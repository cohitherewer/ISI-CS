The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Retail stop in alternative IT hub
                                                                                                            Retail stop in alternative IT hub
  - Bantala to get its shopping-cum-entertainment address in three years          SUBHRO SAHA                          An artists impression of Mani Square Bantala                                        
	Bantala, billed as an alternative IT hub to Sector V and Jagdishpur, will welcome its first dedicated retail address in less than three years.        
	Mani Square Bantala, a 500,000-sq ft deep-discount mall, is expected to be ready by 2010-end, according to Subesh Ray of Mani Group, the developers of the out-of-town shopping-cum-entertainment centre coming up on six acres inside the leather complex.        
	We are delighted to be a part of Bantalas development and this retail centre will have a clutch of factory outlets, cash-n-carry stores and sale of used cars. All these will be anchored around a large-format amusement park, including indoor entertainment and a budget multiplex, adds Ray.        
	Toronto-based Design International, led by Mark Marshall, has designed the Rs 200-crore mall, while the developers are talking to a couple of firms in Dubai and Germany for the theme park at Mani Square Bantala.        
	This will be a welcome development by way of putting in place support services for the new growth area and answering its retail need, said Abhijit Das, the regional director of international property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj.        
	While the primary catchment of the mall will be the IT and residential consumers in the leather complex, the secondary catchment will keep growing. Bantala will eventually come to border New Town, as land acquisition in Rajarhat picks up, thus swelling the consumer base, says Das.        
	Mani Group is opening its flagship retail venture Mani Square on the EM Bypass, next to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, on March 15. We will do a soft-launch on February 25, by when we hope to reach a critical mass of around 60 per cent stores being functional, points out Lou Armstrong, the CEO of Mani Square.        
	A mega launch is scheduled for April 15, with an international singer set to jazz up proceedings. Mani Square is bringing to Calcutta its first IMAX theatre through IMAX Corporation of Canada. The company is all set to bring its largest, clearest and steadiest pictures to the city after Hyderabad and Mumbai, along with its revolutionary, proprietary IMAX DMR (digital re-mastering) technology, which can transform virtually any 35-mm live-action film into the 15/70 IMAX frames.

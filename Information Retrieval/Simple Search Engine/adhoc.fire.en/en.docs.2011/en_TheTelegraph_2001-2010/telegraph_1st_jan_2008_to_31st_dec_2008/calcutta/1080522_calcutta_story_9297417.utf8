                      A journey to wonderland                    Theatre is an ancient art form that has been used as a medium of expression, communication and reflection on social problems. Nandikars theatre festival has already carved out a niche for itself ever since its inception in the city. Now the group unveils another of its pet projects: a four-day childrens theatre festival, beginning today, where two short plays, Tomaar Naam (performance: Sohini Sengupta; music amp; direction: Swatilekha Sengupta) and Upendrakishore Roychowdhurys Ghnyaghasur (direction: Biswajit Ghosh Majumdar) will be premiered. Tomaar Naam centres around a little shy girl and her vast world of imagination. It is, in fact, the world of any child, who transcends the barriers of time and space to build her own world. Ghnyaghasur revolves around the honest rustic boy Manik and his journey to subvert the apparently powerful triumvirate (the King, his doctor and the minister) in a royal court. Manik defeats the evil ogre during his final combat and strips the giant of his plumes. With the destruction of evil, peace and justice are once again restored. The other plays included in the fest are Satyi Rajputra and Pil-Pil-Pil (Nandikars Children Ensemble Production), Three Little Piglets and The Frog Prince (Tyst Theatre, Sweden) and SMS-e-Eshu (A Guidance Academy Production).             Event: Nandikars Children-Friendly Theatre Festival When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts (today), Girish Mancha

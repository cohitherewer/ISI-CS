The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brushstrokes of hope on a day of growing despair 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brushstrokes of hope on a day of growing despair 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Teachers and students, doctors and engineers, lawyers and scientists came together on Thursday to voice support for the Singur project, even as chances of resolution of the imbroglio started receding.         
	The way a business issue, like the location of an automobile plant has been politicised, there is little doubt that the company would not be interested in staying back in Bengal, said Abhishek Chakraborty, an employee of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).         
	Abhishek, along with his friends, had taken part in a silent march that techies had organised in Salt Lake Sector V on Wednesday in support of the Tata project in Singur.         
	Till Wednesday night, the tech professionals were optimistic about a resolution of the Singur impasse. But now it seems the Tatas will go away. How long can they wait? asked a young engineer.         
	We will again miss the bus and all of us will suffer, said Bhavna, another tech professional in Sector V.         
	The tech town wore a grim look on Thursday  because of the fear of the Tatas withdrawal from Singur and a show-of-strength rally by 100-odd Trinamul supporters.         
	I wanted to know who were there at the rally and went to check out. But none was from the IT sector, said Moloy Pal Chowdhury, an employee of Webel, the state governments nodal IT agency.         
	While IT employees did not bring out a march on Thursday to avoid confrontation with Trinamul supporters, other parts of the city witnessed several rallies in support of the small-car project.         
	In the Metro channel, people from various fields  including scientists, teachers, engineers and IT professionals  gathered to voice their support for the factory in Singur.        
	The state council of college principals also pitched for a resolution of the impasse. We have written to Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to lift the siege. If the Tatas leave, our students will suffer as job opportunities will shrink, said Gyanankur Goswami, the president of the council.

          ONTHESPOT - SOVABAZAR MARKET                          Daily business goes on in Sovabazar Market despite its rundown condition and the risk of a collapse. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	The plaster has peeled off the walls, baring the bricks, and water seeps in through the crumbling roof, propped up on bamboo sticks and covered with tin sheets.... The 150-year-old Sovabazar Market lives under the constant fear of a cave-in.         
	Previously owned by Raja Nabakrishna Debs family, the market was given to Prohlad Chandra Paul on a 90-year lease in 1918. Khamig Engineers Pvt Ltd took over from Paul in 1989. But neither Paul nor Khamig Engineers has ever carried out any repair work in the past nine decades. With little maintenance over the years, the market comprising around 462 shops is currently in a shambles.                 
	The bazaar is also beset with problems of clogged drains and broken alleys riddled with craters. The lease-holders have long stopped cleaning the market premises, complained the shopkeepers.         
	Earlier, the lease-holders would tell us that repairs couldnt be done as the rent was very low. In 1993, the rent was raised by Re 1 per day for every shop but even then no maintenance work was undertaken, said Tapan Maity, the joint secretary of Sovabazar Byabasayi Samity.         
	The police and the civic authorities too have turned a deaf ear to their complaints, alleged the Samity.         
	We have written several times to the local councillor, police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, drawing their attention to the dilapidated state of the building and the unhygienic conditions of the market, but no action has ever been taken, said Gopal Kundu, the Samity president.         
	Mahua Mallick, the CPM councillor of ward No. 9, brushed off the Samitys accusation. It is an old market but the condition isnt so bad that it will collapse. Besides, I havent got any complaints, Mallick said.         
	The lease period for Khamig expired on September 30, 2008, but the Deb family trust, Estate Raja Sir Radha Kanta Deb Bahadur, is yet to recover the property.         
	The market has crumbled at several places and they (Khamig Engineers) have never done any renovation work.... Though the lease has expired, Khamig is still collecting rent from the shopkeepers. We have served them a notice and if they dont discontinue soon we will take legal action, said Rathindra Narayan Deb, a trustee.         
	A short circuit is a real threat, with a thick mesh of electric wires criss-crossing the whole market. If wires run haphazardly across the bazaar, a short circuit can happen anytime, warned Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.         
	Currently, there are close to 200 meter boxes inside the market but CESC says that is not their lookout. CESC provides electric connection from the cables to the meter boxes. But we are not responsible for the overhead wires that the shopkeepers have drawn from the meter boxes themselves, said Aniruddha Basu, the general manager of CESC.

                      A bizarre justice                    A shocking tale of revenge and retribution, Meyeti is a psychological thriller based on Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfmans Death and the Maiden. Set against the background of a country that has recently returned to democracy, it unfolds its protagonist Paulinas diligent search for justice. The play begins on a dark, stormy night, with Paulina waiting for her husband Gerardo Escobar, a lawyer, to return home. It has been an important day for Gerardo, for he has been selected to head a commission set up to investigate the crimes committed by the countrys earlier regime. But, as his car breaks down on the way home, he is offered a lift by a doctor called Roberto Miranda. As the men speak, Paulina recognises in the doctors voice the man who had abused and tortured her physically as she lay blindfolded in an army detention camp many years ago. Unable to break free of the horrors of her past, she decides bring her tormentor to justice on her own. Fast-paced and filled with shocking surprises, the play is an inquest into the darker side of humanity  one in which everyone is implicated and justice itself appears to be a fragile, or even ambiguous invention. Direction: Kishore Sengupta.                    Event: Play in Bengali, Meyeti, produced by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

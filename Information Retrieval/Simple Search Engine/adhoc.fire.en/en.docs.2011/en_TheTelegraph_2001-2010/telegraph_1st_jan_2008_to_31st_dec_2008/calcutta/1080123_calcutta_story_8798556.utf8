     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Construction of seven roads in Baruipur and Sonarpur and renovation of Rishi Bankim Setu, in Howrah, are on the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA)s agenda this year.
    
	About Rs 4.5 crore has been sanctioned for the construction of the roads, measuring about 23 km. Work on the roads will begin this month and will be completed within the current financial year, said Debdas Bhattacharjee, the chief engineer of the traffic and transportation wing of the CMDA.
    
	South 24-Parganas zilla sabhadhipati Bimal Mistri said the roads are badly needed, as the volume of traffic is increasing daily.
    
	About Rs 5 crore has been allocated for the repair of Rishi Bankim Setu, earlier known as Old Buckland Bridge. The damaged expansion joints of the bridge will be replaced and a mastic asphalt coat will be provided to the surface. We hope to start the work in February. If everything goes according to plan, we will finish by monsoon, said Bhattacharjee.
    
	The CMDA has also planned to purchase equipment for the central laboratory of its quality control division in Unnayan Bhavan, in Salt Lake. The laboratory, built in the 1970s, has not been used for more than two decades for want of apparatus. The department has 70 employees.
    
	Several tests have to be conducted before each project. We are now forced to depend on outside agencies for the tests, which often delays projects. By making our laboratory functional, we will also save money, said P.B. Nag, the general secretary of the Development Joint Action Committee of the CMDA.

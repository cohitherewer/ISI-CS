The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theatre returns to Star
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Theatre returns to Star

	Will the Chamku or Phoonk crowds take to Champabatir Upakhyan, Juto Abishkar, Jibon Jerokom or Mahabharater Katha?         
	Come September 28, Star theatre will hold one-hour theatre shows, 10am to 11am, at the main hall before the Sunday morning film screening.         
	The effort to bring theatre back to Star began in January 2008, when young writer and RBU graduate Jyoti Mukherjee started staging Mahabharater Katha in the tiny open-air arena on the first floor terrace of the Star, known as Mandirtala.         
	The performance was repeated every Sunday with tickets priced at Rs 20, though seriously disadvantaged by non-existent sound and light provisions, passing trams and DJ music from the terrace above.         
	In August, when Jyoti approached the Star authorities to present short skits inside the main Star auditorium, they agreed readily. By now Jyoti was more organised, with friends  mostly actors and stage hands  pooling in to meet expenses. Five plays, two by children, written and directed by Jyoti and Kriti Majumdar, are to be the first performances of his group Binodini Natyacharcha.         
	We registered under the name of Nati Binodini to show our respect for her dedication to theatre. Talented people from various groups and a Kathak troupe are part of this project. Unless we take advantage of every bit of performance space, theatre might be sidelined forever, Jyoti says.         
	The dance hall        
	Satti Prasanna Sen, the grandson of Kabiraj Dhannantwari Gangaprasad Sen, is helping give Bengali theatre a fresh lease of life by hosting plays in his naach ghar at 17 Kumartuli Street.         
	Before Independence, the naach ghar had become the meeting place for Swadeshis who had thrown stones when British officials had danced here under chandeliers. But all traces of romanticism and idealism disappeared as the naach ghar became the centre of a fierce legal battle between the sons of Gangaprasad Sen.         
	The room, stripped of its rose-patterned carpets and chandeliers, has emerged as an alternative theatre venue.         
	Plays are staged here using the large doors on either side for entry and exit. The little verandah overlooking the Hooghly is the make-up room, where a lone antique mirror stands as a reminder to times gone by.         
	We want this place to be known for something auspicious. At a time when no good entertainment survives, we feel we can contribute to society by supporting the theatre movement, explains Sen.         
	The venue was discovered by theatre group Rangalok and local clubs Shobuj Sangshad and Pallibashi Brindo, who approached Sen for permission.         
	The audience at Girish Mancha and other neighbouring halls are dwindling, said Shyamal Chakraborty of Rangalok. We get this place once a month free of cost and the boys who do the lights charge only a minimum fee. The lighting and sitting arrangement could of course be improved, but we have had full houses at most shows, said Chakraborty.         
	The facility has been used by groups like Uttarpara Samathat, Monirath, Nirbak Abhinay Akademi, Annaya Desh and Belghoria Ethic.       SEBANTI SARKAR

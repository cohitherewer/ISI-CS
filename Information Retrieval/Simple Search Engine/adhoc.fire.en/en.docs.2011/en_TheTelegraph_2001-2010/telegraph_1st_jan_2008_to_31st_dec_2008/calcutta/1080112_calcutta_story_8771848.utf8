     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The city police chief was taken for a ride on Friday and it was his own driver who was at the wheel.
    
	The driver lost his way while taking Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti to Rabindra Sarobar on Friday and drove around south Calcutta before returning to Lalbazar half an hour later.
    
	Chakrabarti had left his office around 3.10pm to attend the closing ceremony of the 53rd National School Games (athletics). He was on track till he reached the intersection of Sarat Bose Road and Southern Avenue. We had alerted the traffic sergeants along the route that the police chief was scheduled to take, said a traffic department officer.
    
	Instead of taking the road towards the Lake Gardens flyover to reach the stadium, the driver, who has been with Chakrabarti since he became commissioner, took Southern Avenue and drove to Gol Park. He then took another wrong turn, towards the Gariahat flyover, added the officer.
    
	According to him, Chakrabarti was not keeping an eye on the road. Since he had worked as the deputy commissioner (traffic), he knows the streets like the back of his hand. When he realised that his driver was lost, he did not want to violate the traffic rules by taking a U-turn. He asked the driver to return to Lalbazar.
    
	The police commissioner was expected to reach the venue around 3.30pm. We were waiting to welcome him, but around 4pm, an officer informed us that the commissioner would not attend the programme. The officer did not give us a reason, said Pushpita Roy, the convener of the programme.

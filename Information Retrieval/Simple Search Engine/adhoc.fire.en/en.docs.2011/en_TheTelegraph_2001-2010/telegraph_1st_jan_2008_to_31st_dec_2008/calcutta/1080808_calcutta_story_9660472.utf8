	To attract more tourists from Calcutta and other parts of eastern India, the tourism board of Malaysia is planning a tie-up with Singapore Airlines to offer special packages.        
	We have a deal with the airlines from Delhi and now we are planning a similar one for Calcutta, under which attractive packages can be offered to tourists, Amirul Ariffin, the director of Tourism Malaysia, said on Thursday.         
	After Malaysia Airlines withdrew its flights between Calcutta and Kuala Lumpur in 2006, connectivity became a problem for tourists. In the peak season  October to March  nearly 20 percent of foreign tourists from eastern India head for Malaysia.         
	Eyeing the increasing footfall, Air Asia  Malaysias low cost carrier  is planning flights to and from Calcutta soon. The Malaysian tourism board is also promoting special packages for honeymoon travellers and wedding parties from India, Ariffin said.         
	Tour operators, however, fear that the Malaysian governments decision to withdraw visa-on-arrival facilities from this month will take a toll on tourist flow to that country.

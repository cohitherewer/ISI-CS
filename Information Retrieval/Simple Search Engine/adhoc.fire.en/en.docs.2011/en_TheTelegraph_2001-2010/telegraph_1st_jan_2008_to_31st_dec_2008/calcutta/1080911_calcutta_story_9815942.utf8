                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU results after Puja
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The results of Calcutta Universitys BA-B.Sc Part I and II (honours and general) exams under the 1+1+1 pattern and BA-B.Sc Part I exams under the old 2+1 system are not likely to be announced before Puja.        
	But the results of the B.Com Part I and II (honours and general) exams under the 1+1+1 system may be declared before the vacation from October 3 to 14, university sources said.        
	More than 1.5 lakh students had written the BA-B.Sc tests and around 50,000 took the B.Com exam.        
	A section of the BA-B.Sc examinees was hopeful about knowing how they fared before the Puja vacation because the university had announced that results would be published early this year.        
	The results of last years BA-B.Sc Part I and II (under 1+1+1 system) exams had been declared in the third week of November. The examinations were held in June and July.        
	In a bid to regularise the academic calendar, the university had started a drive to ensure that the results of all major undergraduate exams are declared before the Puja vacation every year.        
	But sources in the universitys examination department said on Wednesday that there was hardly any scope to complete the process of preparing the BA-B.Sc results before the Puja.        
	The examination department is trying its best to complete the process of preparing the results of BA-B.Sc Part I and II exams before Puja, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university.        
	But if we fail to complete the process before Puja, we will surely ensure that the results are published immediately after the vacation ends, he added.        
	Sources said the process of evaluating the answer scripts of the 1.5 lakh-odd examinees is almost over. But the marks obtained by the B.Sc students in the practical tests, held on August 30, are yet to reach the examination department.

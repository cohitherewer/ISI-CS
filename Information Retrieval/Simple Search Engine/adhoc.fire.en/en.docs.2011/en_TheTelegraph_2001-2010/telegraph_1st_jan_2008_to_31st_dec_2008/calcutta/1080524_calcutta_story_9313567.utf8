                Munna Varma, the principal of Howrahs Irish Educational Academy, was granted bail on Friday. Varma was picked up from his house at Rakeswar Malia Lane late on Thursday after the father of Sudipta Senapati, 12, lodged a complaint with Howrah police. Varma allegedly beat up and injured Sudipta and two other boys for throwing stones at the school.    A 32-year-old man was found dead in the well of his rented flat at Jinjira Bazaar by neighbours on Friday morning. Ananda Rai was a security guard with a private agency and a habitual drunkard. He had been missing since Tuesday.    Two flights had to hover for 10 minutes over Calcutta airport on Friday afternoon after two dogs were spotted on the runway. The runway was cleared and an Air India flight from Imphal and a Deccan flight landed at 2.40 pm.    Shooting resumed at the Tollygunge studios on Friday after the producers of three mega serials resolved the dues row with artistes and technicians.

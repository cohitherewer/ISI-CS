                                                                                                                                    Four floors of debris, embers and fumes, and methane at journey rsquo;s end

   
	FLOOR 10 
      
	The 10th floor is a mound of debris, burning embers and fumes. Some fire-fighters struggle to cut through a twisted iron grille with a giant tool while others are busy snipping off loose ends of burnt-out wires. The heat is unbearable. ldquo;Deowaley maarbi naa, porey jabey (Don rsquo;t strike the wall, it will crumble), rdquo; shouts one fireman to another carrying an iron rod. Piles of plastic sheets and buttons litter the floor. The cracks on the walls are as wide as doors. ldquo;It will be impossible to save this floor and the ones above it. The heat from the walls will take at least three days to cool, rdquo; said a fireman.
 
	FLOOR 9 
         
	The heat is on. It becomes difficult to see through the fumes, despite the afternoon sun shining through a hole in the wall. This floor presents an almost surreal mix of what Nandaram must have been till the night of January 11 and what it is today. A door to the left is wide open, as if welcoming a customer to a gaddi. Only, on Tuesday afternoon, everything mdash; from the thick mattress and pillows to the telephone set and calculator mdash; is afloat. A shelf to the left is untouched by fire or water, with deposit slips, account books, samples of fabrics stapled on a cardboard and visiting cards. In adjoining rooms, there are piles of fabrics and clothes. Elsewhere, there are rows of burnt shops. A cubicle with a lived-in look mdash; a gas stove on a wooden table, the LPG cylinder missing; an iron cot with heaps of clothes dumped on it; utensils piled up. The droplets of scalding hot water from the roof force a hasty retreat.
 
	FLOOR 8 
      
	Eighth is the floor where the discomfort really begins. The temperature rises palpably and the air thickens with fumes. A mesh of wires hanging precariously from outside the main electrical board, a criss-cross of hose-pipes and twisted shop shutters.... Huge mounds of what used to be garments in white plastic packs. ldquo;If you think this is bad, just go to the floors above, rdquo; warns a fireman.
 
	FLOOR 11 
      
	As we reach Floor 11, we hear a fire-fighter cry: ldquo;Please don rsquo;t come in here. Beware of the chemicals. rdquo; His face is covered with a handkerchief. The look and feel of the water has changed; it is murky and frothy. The air is so pungent that proceeding without a gas mask seems impossible (the fire-fighters are armed with only handkerchieves). ldquo;It rsquo;s methane, rdquo; explains one of the firemen. The journey ends here.
      
	The sound of water gushing down the stairs, the pungent smell of a building ablaze for 84 hours, and the rising heat and discomfort mdash; Kinsuk Basu of Metro encountered all this and more as he climbed up to the 11th floor of Nandaram Market. 
 
	If the lower floors presented a now-unnerving picture of what was business as usual mdash; nameplates atop shops and some samosas in a small cardboard packet with a half-empty bottle of water mdash; the top floors mirrored the devastation that has brought life to a halt in the trade hub of the city from the early hours of Saturday.

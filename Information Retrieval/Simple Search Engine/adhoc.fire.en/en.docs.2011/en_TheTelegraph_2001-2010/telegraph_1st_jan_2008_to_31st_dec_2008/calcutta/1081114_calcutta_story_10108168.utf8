                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sting in the tail of unseen film
  - Buddha cloud on screening as Rays Sikkim reaches American Center          KUSHALI NAG                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee chats with Roopa Ganguly at Nandan on Thursday evening. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The jinx of Sikkim, the last unreleased film of Satyajit Ray, continues.        
	Retrieved and restored by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts amp; Sciences and procured by the American Center, it was scheduled to be screened on the final day of the 14th Calcutta Film Festival. But there seems to be a twist to the tale at Nandan.        
	We cant go by what they (the American Center) say, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Thursday, hours after a DVD of Sikkim reached the American Center in Calcutta from Los Angeles.        
	Commissioned by the then Chogyal of Sikkim, the documentary made in 1971 was banned by the Indian government on the ground that it highlighted monarchy.        
	We have got the copyright certificate from the managing trustee of the Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim to show the film at the festival. Everything depends on Nandan now, said Nilanjan Hazra, the audiovisual section chief at the American Center.        
	Nandan is yet to confirm the screening of Sikkim on Monday, apparently because it is reluctant to rejig the festival schedule for Rays 60-minute documentary. We have not decided anything yet regarding Sikkim, said Nilanjan Chatterjee, the Nandan CEO and director of the festival.        
	The Nandan cloud over Sikkim has upset Sandip Ray. People are really looking forward to the film. The festival authorities should do something. Lets hope for the best and keep our fingers crossed, said the filmmaker son of the maestro.        
	Sikkim has had only one screening  a private one at Priya 38 years ago.

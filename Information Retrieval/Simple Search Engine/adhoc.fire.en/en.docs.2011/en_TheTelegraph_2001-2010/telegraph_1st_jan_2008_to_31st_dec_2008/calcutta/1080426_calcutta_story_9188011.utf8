          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Apollo Hospitals will set up a medical college in the state, investing nearly Rs 70 crore in the project.         
	The board of Apollo Hospitals approved the proposal last week.        
	The healthcare group, which runs a 325-bed hospital in the city, requires 25 acres of land for the medical college and a 350-bed hospital on the same campus. It is looking for an existing facility on the outskirts of the city, health department sources said.         
	If the required land and infrastructure are not available, Apollo Hospitals intends to approach the state government for a 25-acre plot.        
	Preetha Reddy, the managing director of Apollo Hospitals, had a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers on Friday to discuss the plan.         
	The CM promised to extend all possible help required to set up the college. It should be operational in two years time, she said.        
	The group plans to also set up 100-bed hospitals in towns like Siliguri, Burdwan and Kharagpur.        
	The KPS Group, too, has planned a medical college in the city but the Medical Council of India has yet to give the green signal.        
	If cleared, the college will be in Jadavpur.

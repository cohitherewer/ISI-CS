The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car in pond after crash
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Car in pond after crash

	A Santro Xing was flung into a shallow pond on EM Bypass on Sunday evening after a Honda City allegedly crashed into it. One person was injured in the accident, which brought back memories of Fridays bus mishap on VIP Road, which claimed 20 lives.        
	Rajesh Arora, 54, who was driving the Santro (WB02 V6866), was unhurt but his son, Ankit, 24, sitting beside him, has been admitted to Woodlands Hospital with injuries on his left side.        
	The Honda City (WB02 X9325) that crashed into the Santro screeched to a halt after hitting a tree. Jitesh Badlani was driving the car and was accompanied by another young man. Both are barely out of their teens, the police said. The car hit the Santro in its bid to squeeze through two cars at high speed, said witnesses.        
	I was driving at 50 or 55 kmph on the left side of the road. The Honda City hit my car from the right. Our car rolled over twice before falling into the pond, said Arora, a resident of Metropolitan Housing Cooperative on the Bypass.        
	When the car landed in the pond, I clambered out. But my son was not moving. I ran to the nearby police outpost for help, added Arora.        
	Ankit had by then got out by the rear right door of the car. Arora lodged a general diary with Parama investigation centre. The driver of the Honda City has been arrested, said the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar.

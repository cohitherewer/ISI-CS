                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Teacher beats up class
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mathematics teacher allegedly kicked, punched, slapped and hit with rulers and dusters his entire class for laughing when he fell off a chair in a government-aided primary school in Behala on Thursday.         
	Around 20 boys and girls in Class IV of Paschim Jayrampur Prathamik Vidyalaya at Rabindranagar were injured. Three of them were treated at Vidyasagar State General Hospital. One of them was advised a CT scan.        
	An eight-year-old girl, Iftesham Chowdhury, went into a coma and died last week after her yoga teacher slapped her so hard that she hit her head against a wall.        
	On Thursday morning, guardians and residents beat up math teacher Jayanta Sarkar, 35, and handed him over to police. He was later arrested on the basis of complaints lodged with Behala police station.        
	The whole class had started laughing as sir fell off a chair. He became furious and started beating us with a wooden scale and a duster. He even punched me on the chest, said Sougata Das, one of the students taken to hospital.        
	On entering the class, we found children lying on benches and the floor and crying. Sarkar was hitting one of the boys with a duster. Other teachers dragged him away, said Shyamali Halder, the mother of Tanmay Das, who allegedly fainted after Sarkar slapped him.        
	Sir occasionally beats us and asks us not to complain to parents and other teachers, said Sougata.        
	Parents alleged that the teacher molested girl students. My daughter had said that Sarkar used to make her sit on his lap and hug her without any reason. He behaved similarly with other students, said a parent.        
	Sarkar, a resident of Parnasree in Behala, is one of the six permanent teachers of the school. The school authorities said they had received complaints about his behaviour and warned him several times.        
	I will talk to the higher authorities and make sure that this insane and perverted person does not teach in the school again, said Anjan Das, the school committee chairman and local councillor.

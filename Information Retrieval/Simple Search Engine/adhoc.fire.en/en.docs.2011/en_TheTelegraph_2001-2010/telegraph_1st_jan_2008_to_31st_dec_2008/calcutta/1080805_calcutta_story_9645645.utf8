	Eight school students and a couple were injured in two road accidents, one involving a pool car, in Howrah on Monday.        
	Six students of St Aloysius Orphan Day School were injured when the Maruti Omni in which they were returning home was hit by a lorry on Andul Road.        
	The children, all students of classes II and III, were injured in the hands and legs,         
	The drivers of both vehicles were arrested. We will start proceedings against them, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	Truck driver Babu Guchait told police that he got distracted for a moment while trying to fasten the seat belt.        
	Gopinath Akak, who was driving the pool car said he spotted the truck late and slammed the brakes, but the damage was already done.        
	The parents of the children, contacted over the phone, rushed to the spot. Akash Singh, 9, said: We were flung from our seats and our heads banged against the window panes. The doctor who examined Akash advised a CT scan.        
	Manoj Goel, the father of Arpit, another injured child, said his son was in shock.        
	In the other mishap, two Class XI students of Muktaram Girls High School were cycling home when a minibus lost control and knocked them down. Kuheli Koley, 17, and Silpa Jathi, 17, sustained multiple injuries. The bus also hit a couple who were riding a motorcycle. A mob beat up the driver of the Patihal-Howrah minibus, Tapas Ghosh, and later handed him over to police. The conductor managed to flee.        
	Police said the driver lost control after the brakes failed. The driver has been arrested, said an officer of Dasnagar police station.

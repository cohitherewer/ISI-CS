                      Delightful hybrid of art                    The indelible stamp of time with its ever-changing moods makes a strong impression on the vocabulary of the artist. Creation, the ongoing art exhibition, presents a coming together of painters and sculptors to showcase an amazing body of work that reflects each artists unique response to his surroundings.

A variety of symbolic and everyday imagery, effected through representative works by 50 artists, makes the show a truly fascinating, memorable experience. Participants include B.R. Panesar, Dhiraj Chowdhury, Jamini Roy, Prokash Karmakar, Rabin Mondal, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Samir Aich, Shyamal Mukherjee and Subrata Gangopadhyay. Curated by Debabrata Chakrabarti.

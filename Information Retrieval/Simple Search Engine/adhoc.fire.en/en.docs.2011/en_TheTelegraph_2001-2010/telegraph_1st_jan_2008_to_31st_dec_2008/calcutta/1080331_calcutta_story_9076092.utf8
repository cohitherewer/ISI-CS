                                                                                                               The City Diary
                Air Indias Calcutta-Kathmandu flight was cancelled on Sunday for want of a chief pilot, airline officials said. The flight was scheduled to take off with 66 passengers but had to be cancelled since the pilots flying hours were exhausted. Although most of the passengers were sent to Kathmandu via Delhi, five foreigners, on direct transit, were stranded. They were put up in a city hotel and will leave for Kathmandu on Monday, airline sources said.     Police detained Shibsankar Mahato, 32, a tenant of the Shaw family, in connection with the murder of Rajesh Shaw, 35, whose body was found in an underground water tank in a godown at 105/3 Jaibibi Road, in Bally, on Saturday. Ashok and Dilip, the elder brothers of Rajesh, were also interrogated.    Ram Bahadur, 42, a guard of an apartment block at Kasbas Purbachal, hanged himself on Sunday morning. Police said Ram was suffering from tuberculosis and depression.    Bitan Roy, 42, and his wife, Kakali, 38, residents of Salt Lakes AE block, were admitted to a private nursing home with burns on Sunday. Though no police complaint has been lodged, neighbours and block committee members said Kakali had tried to set herself ablaze and Bitan suffered burns in the attempt to douse the flames. The security guard of the house, on whose ground floor the couple lived as tenants, informed their relatives about the mishap.

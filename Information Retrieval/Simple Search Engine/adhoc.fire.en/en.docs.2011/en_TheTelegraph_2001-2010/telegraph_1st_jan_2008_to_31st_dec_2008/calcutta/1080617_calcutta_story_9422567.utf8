	The 25 youngsters sitting under the shade of a tree on a hot summer afternoon were oblivious of the heat. This wasnt quite the ordinary day for them. Divided into four groups, they were playing a game that required their complete attention.         
	Overseeing the session was psychosocial consultant Dr Rajaram Subbian. He was conducting a four-day workshop  Building Resilience and Strengthening Communication  for youngsters between 12 and 17 years at Tolly Club from June 4.         
	Children of this age group are at a crucial transitional phase. They are acutely aware of their own sex and awkward before the opposite sex, Subbian said. This workshop aims to create self awareness. It is about understanding who or what we are, in relation to ourselves, to our friends and family. The next stage deals with how our families perceive us and how family ties can be strengthened, he added.         
	The first days interactions were organised to break the ice. The participants were asked to choose from a pile of plastic toys and speak about it as well as about themselves. This is a much easier method than intimidating a child by asking her to speak about herself straightaway, said Subbian. The girls however seemed keener to talk while the boys wanted to run around and explore their settings.         
	Khyati Nathwani, a Class X student of Hope Town Girls School, Dehradun explained: We played a trust game where we were blindfolded. Thus our other senses had to be fully alert. Subbian asked each child to bring an object that resembled his/her personality, from the garden outside. Students came up with an assorted variety of flowers, twigs, blades of grass and leaves.         
	Abhimanyu Joggani, a Class XI student of La Martiniere for Boys had carried in a brick. This brick has great strength. It is the basis for building a house. I would like to work similarly in a team and shine in my career. Khyati, on the other hand, had discovered a beautiful flower growing inside another flower. This flower shows us the perfect balance brought on by dependence. We must be thankful to people for the support they give us.         
	The second day was devoted to theatre. The participants were given three topics: peer pressure, conflict at home, and trouble in school, on which they had to enact skits.         
	The following day, using the psychoanalytical concept of Johari window, participants graded themselves on their level of self esteem. The concluding day had parents joining their wards for a parenting skills test. Participants were also taught the 10 life skills, including empathy, problem solving and decision making.         
	This was Subbians first workshop in Calcutta. I have interacted with children from war-ravaged countries, he said. But children are essentially the same and the eagerness to participate and the perceptiveness is common to them all.

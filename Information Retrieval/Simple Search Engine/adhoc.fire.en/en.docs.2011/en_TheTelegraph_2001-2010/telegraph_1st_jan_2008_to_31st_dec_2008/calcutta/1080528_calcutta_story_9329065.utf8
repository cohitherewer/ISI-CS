The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fears over online forms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fears over online forms
  - Mixed response to college entry applications on websites          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	A host of city colleges has discarded paper admission forms and opted for the online variety, making candidates both happy and apprehensive.        
	The admission forms  several colleges have already posted them on their websites  will have to be filled up online from June 2.        
	We are happy that most of the reputable colleges are posting the admission forms online, saving us the pain of standing in long queues, said Anupam Mukherjee, who is seeking admission in an undergraduate course.        
	But with so many students trying to log onto the websites of the colleges, I fear I will not be able to access any form at all, he added.        
	For the record, more than 2.15 lakh students from the Higher Secondary, ISC and CBSE curricula will compete for around a lakh seats in the 110-odd colleges in and around Calcutta. The last date for submission of the forms is June 10.        
	The colleges that have done away with paper forms include Presidency, Scottish Church, Lady Brabourne and St Xaviers. Some institutions, including Asutosh College, will keep open both options  online and paper forms.        
	Apart from the admission forms, the colleges will post all admission details  including the eligibility criteria and fee structures  on the websites.        
	Preparations are on for posting the admission details as early as possible, said Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of Presidency College. The college finalised the eligibility criteria and the other details on Tuesday.        
	Some students who have scored high marks in the Plus-II exams but are not comfortable with computers fear that they will lose the opportunity to study in top-notch colleges.        
	The institutions, however, have allayed their fears, saying those who could not access the websites on their own would be helped by their staff.        
	Such students can always seek help from our computer centre, said an official of Scottish Church College.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu shelter for licence touts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citu shelter for licence touts

	Touts who sell driving licences to those who cannot drive will soon start functioning under the protective umbrella of the CPMs labour arm, Citu.         
	More than 400 of the 500-odd touts active in the Beltala office of the public vehicles department (PVD) have formed the All Bengal Motor Vehicles Representatives Union, which will function under the aegis of Citu.         
	From August 1, each tout of the union will flaunt a Citu identity card bearing his membership number. The cards will be handed over a day earlier at a programme in Shramik Bhavan, the Citu state headquarters         
	The union has been formed to protect the rights of the people who work outside the PVD office and to save them from harassment at the hands of officials, vehicle owners and police. The union will protect the interests of the people who help vehicle owners, said Aloke Mukherjee, the working president of the fledgling union.        
	More than 15,000 people visit the Beltala office every day for a variety of reasons, including getting a driving licence or a fitness certificate for a vehicle issued.         
	Mukherjee stressed that the union would act as an interface between these people and PVD officials. Vehicle owners will no longer have to queue up to get their work done. Our boys will do everything on their behalf and there will be a fixed price for every service.         
	The leader could not have been more explicit  the touts will have the final say in Beltala where legal procedures are seldom followed. Metro had on December 5, 2007, (right) exposed how touts could arrange for a driving licence for someone who could not drive against a hefty payment.        
	Armed with Citu badges, the touts will not allow any vehicle owner to communicate directly with a PVD official. Everything will have to be routed through the union and people will be forced to pay extra for the services, said an official who did not want to be named.         
	Asked about the decision to extend patronage to the illegal operatives, Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh said: These people (the touts) are making a living in an unorganised way. So, we have decided to grant them affiliation.         
	But dont the touts extort money from vehicle owners? The administration will keep a close watch on the union members and will ensure that they do not indulge in corruption.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chaudhury did not want to comment on the formation of the union. We are trying to move towards a system in which people will not need to visit the PVD office except on rare occasions.        
	After talking to the touts, Metro learnt that the current rate for getting a driving licence issued is Rs 1,500 and for registering a vehicle, Rs 5,000-7,500. In normal circumstances, one has to pay Rs 500 for a driving licence and not more than Rs 3,000 for registering a vehicle.        
	Disputes over payment are a regular feature in the Beltala office, said an officer of Ballygunge police station.         
	We dont intervene any more. Earlier, whenever we tried to curb the illegal activities, the touts would sit in a dharna in front of the police station. People still come to us with complaints but we ask them to meet PVD officials, said the officer.

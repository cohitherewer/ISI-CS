The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parking pinch for Salt Lake 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Parking pinch for Salt Lake

	Bidhannagar Municipality plans to convert a number of free parking areas in Salt Lake into fee parking zones and introduce night parking charges.         
	Fee parking has already been started at 12 spots and the municipality plans to include more areas after Puja.        
	The municipality earns Rs 40 lakh annually from the 12 parking zones, said Somenath Mukherjee, the finance officer of Bidhannagar Municipality. The parking rates for cars and bikes are Rs 5 and Rs 2 per hour, respectively.         
	Fee collection was started in a few spots in Salt Lake on an experimental basis in mid-2006.        
	This year, six more areas were added, including EC block, the swimming pool area in BF block and the stretch between Prasasan Bhavan and Mayukh Bhavan. Areas around City Centre, HSBC, Central Park, Unnayan Bhavan and AMRI Hospital also have fee parking.        
	The municipality is also planning to introduce night parking in residential areas. We conducted a survey and found that around 550 households across Salt Lake park their vehicles on the road at night. We have decided to charge a monthly fee that can go up to Rs 1,000 for each car parked by the road. We plan to roll out the order after Puja, said Krishnamoy Ghosh, the executive engineer in charge of public health and engineers.        
	The authorities feel the move will help regularise the haphazard car management system in Salt Lake. We will also deploy guards to keep an eye on parked cars, said Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.         
	The move has generated mixed reactions among residents. It is unfair to charge parking fees when one drives to the local market. I have three cars and have to park two of them outside my building. Night parking fees will surely pinch my pocket, said Samaresh Chakraborty, a resident of EC block.        
	Others welcomed the move. Twice my windshield was broken when my car was parked on the road at night. I dont mind spending a little extra for the security of my car, said Arjun Goswami of FE Block.

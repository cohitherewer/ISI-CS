The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free vaccines in short supply 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Free vaccines in short supply 
          PRASUN BHATTACHARYA                                                A child being given a polio drop in the city. A Telegraph picture		    
	Parents taking their children to the immunisation clinic at Medical College and Hospital are being turned away because of a vaccine shortage.        
	I have been coming here for the last four weeks to vaccinate my child, only to be told to come the next day or the next week, said a 35-year-old central Calcutta resident whose three-month-old son is due for a dose of DPT.        
	She is not alone. Over the past few days, many parents have had to return without vaccinating their children against measles, hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.         
	The hospital, on an average, vaccinates at least 20,000 children a year. Most of these vaccines are administered to children in phases from the time they are a month old.        
	On being told that supply of free vaccines has dried up, some parents buy them from nearby pharmacies. A single dose of the hepatitis B vaccine costs around Rs 195.         
	What can we do? Supply of various vaccines like those for DPT, hepatitis B and measles has been unstable, said a doctor in the department of community medicine.        
	He said the availability of vaccines had been inadequate for a long time, but the shortage was felt even more in the last couple of months.        
	The state health department admitted the supply chain had been broken. There has been a shortage of some vaccines. We are looking into it with utmost urgency, said Sanchita Bakshi, the director of health services.        
	A senior official of the hospital administration said he was unaware of the shortage until recently. Those vaccines (that are not available now) come from a different source than other medicines. I will look into the matter. Nobody had told me anything about this shortage.         
	The doctor in the department of community medicine said he was puzzled by the officials statement. This is utterly puzzling. How can the hospital authorities talk like that? We keep them informed about any shortage of vaccines.

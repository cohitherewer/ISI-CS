                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Alimony plea rejected
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	An Alipore court has turned down a womans plea for alimony after learning that she earns around Rs 20,000 a month as an IT professional.         
	The court came to know about Nailini Motwanis income after her Mumbai-based estranged husband, Rajesh, gave her PAN card number to the judge.         
	Nalini, who married the software engineer on January 7 last year, had alleged in her petition that her husband and in-laws tortured her regularly for dowry.        
	Unable to bear the torture, she said she left her husband early this year and started living in her parents house in Calcutta.        
	My husband earns Rs 50,000 a month and is quite capable of providing me with a maintenance. The court should ask him to pay me Rs 20,000 a month, Nalini said in the petition.         
	She claimed that she had no source of income and that her family was poor.         
	Opposing the prayer, Rajeshs lawyer Somnath Mukherjee submitted that Nalinis statements about her financial status were false and fabricated.        
	Its not true that the petitioner is poor. She has a bank account, lives a luxurious life and owns a car. She earns a lot and pays income tax. Her income can be assessed through her PAN card number, which my client knows, said Mukherjee.        
	As directed by the judge, the lawyer gave him the PAN card number. Following an assessment of Nalinis income tax return, the court came to know that her monthly income is at least Rs 20,000, the amount she has been seeking as her monthly maintenance.        
	The petitioner has also invested in mutual funds and trades in shares, the lawyer submitted. After hearing both sides, the judge dismissed the petition, saying: The petitioner had failed to satisfy the court. She can maintain herself.        
	Lawyers pointed out that these days even homemakers could have PAN cards. Some husbands show part of their income as their wives, said a lawyer

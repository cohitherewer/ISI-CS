  - FIVE-DAY CAPER IN V-DAY RUN-UP          A STAFF REPORTER                          TIME-OUT TOGETHERNESS: A section of the crowd at last years City Centre-t2 Valentines Day celebrations. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Desperate to know about your boyfriends first date? Dying to check your compatibility quotient? Drop in at Red FM 2 Much Hungama, presented by t2 (the lifestyle tabloid of The Telegraph) in association with City Centre, for an action-packed Valentines Day.        
	The five-day line-up of interactive activities started on February 9 at the Salt Lake hotspot and is scheduled to wrap up on February 13, with some special moments reserved for winning couples on the big day  February 14.        
	This is the third year we are hosting such an event. It is a branding that we have to do to make the mall more popular with the youth. Our target group has always been the 15-30 age group. An event of this scale projects City Centre as a hangout and not merely a shopping destination. Other malls do not have the kind of space that we have, says Vivek Banerjee, the head of events, (marketing), City Centre.        
	A kiosk next to INOX (City Centre) is the hub of all activity, with fun contests of various kinds in store throughout the day to draw in the lovestruck. We have got at least four to five games that couples will have to play, explains Banerjee.        
	There is Truth or Dare, Passing the Pillow, Paper Dancing and games to test how compatible couples are. In the Truth and Dare game, we might ask the couples to drink a litre of water or do 50 push-ups, says Rathijit Chatterjee, the marketing head of Red FM.        
	The fun starts at noon and goes on till 8pm, from February 9 to 13. A total of 25 couples will be selected from all those signing up, out of which three will be crowned mega winners through a lucky dip.        
	Well be selecting five couples every day, one every hour. They will get goodie bags from Red FM and a gift hamper of cosmetics from Chambor, explains Vivek.        
	Royal treatment awaits the three winning couples. Not only will they get to shop at the the popular hangout on February 14 with a cash prize of Rs 5,000 in the bag, they will also catch Rajat Kapoors Mithya at INOX, dig into a Kaafila spread and finally party at The Apartment.        
	They have to shop for garments and accessories within two hours, all of which has to be worn that very night, reveals Vivek.        
	Last year, the City Centre-t2 Valentines Day event had seen an overwhelming turnout of around 40,000 people. The footfall has been great this year, too. We have 500-600 couples registering every day, most of them between 15 and 25 years, says Vivek.        
	In the true spirit of V-Day, love is in the air this week at City Centre. Through such an event, we are encouraging more people from different backgrounds to come forward and participate, says Jimmy Tangree, the station head of Red FM.

	Jibon Saha, one of the owners of the Sodepur garments shop in which 13 people suffocated to death in a fire on May 16, was remanded in CID custody for four days after his arrest on Monday.         
	The 57-year-old businessman had been undergoing treatment in a South Calcutta nursing home all along, preventing the CID from arresting him. He was produced in Barrackpore court after being taken into custody.         
	Jibon and his brother Narayan, who co-owns Readymade Centre, have been booked for causing death through negligence (Section 304A of the IPC), culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304) and negligent handling of combustible matter (Section 285).        
	Narayan was arrested after being discharged from a nursing home on June 26 and remanded in judicial custody till July 13.         
	Jibons lawyer, P. Ghosh, had moved a bail application on the ground that his client was ailing and needed further medical attention. The court rejected the plea. Jibons health was not so delicate; so he was remanded in police custody for further interrogation, the public prosecutor, Himanshu Bhattacharya, said.        
	According to CID sleuths, Jibon was the one responsible for the first floor of Readymade Centre turning into a gas chamber. It seems that he ordered someone to pull down the shutters while customers choked inside. The closed-circuit television cameras that we recovered from the damaged shop did not have recording facility. Since Jibon used to maintain these, we will enquire why he did not opt for the recording facility, one of the investigators said.        
	The fire services department will file a case, too, for not obtaining a no-objection certificate for the shop.

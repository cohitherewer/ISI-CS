The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High alert on Metro tracks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       High alert on Metro tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city panicked briefly on Christmas Eve as Calcutta police announced a high alert at all Metro stations on Wednesday evening, resulting in a sudden security beef-up that left passengers and Christmas shoppers baffled and worried.        
	We received delayed information from specific sources that an attack was planned at one of the Metro stations between 6pm and 7pm on Wednesday. We got the information only around 4.30pm and immediately beefed up security at all the stations, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner (headquarters) of Calcutta police.        
	Sniffer dogs, hand-held metal detectors and combat forces were pressed into service at the 17 Metro stations. At Esplanade, the usually wide gates were narrowed for better frisking. Three to four policemen were deployed at each gate to open and check passenger luggage.        
	At Park Street station, the number of door-frame metal detectors was increased from two to four and policemen were seen urging passengers to pass through them. Sniffer dogs combed the station. It later turned out to be a false alert, but the extra checks left passengers panicky.        
	As soon as I heard about the terror alert from a policeman posted at Park Street station, I decided to skip the Metro, said Prabir Bandopadhyay, who took a bus instead to his Lake Market home.        
	Lalbazar spent Wednesday night on high alert with security beefed up from the Cathedral to clubs as the city prayed and partied.        
	Two unattended bags also created a flutter at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Wednesday at 6pm. The two bags  found at the taxi stand near the domestic terminal  were found to contain clothes.

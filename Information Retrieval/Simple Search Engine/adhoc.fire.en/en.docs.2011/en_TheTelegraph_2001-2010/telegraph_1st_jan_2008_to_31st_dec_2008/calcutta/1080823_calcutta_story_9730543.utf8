          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The leader of a seven-member gang that stole many cellphones in the city was arrested on Friday morning. A stolen phone was found on Mohammed Sarfraz, the kingpin.        
	Police said Sarfrazs gang targeted cinemas and crowded marketplaces.        
	The members befriended people inside the halls and offered them biscuits laced with bhang. They took away the cellphones when the victims dozed off. In crowded markets and malls, they would lift phones from shoppers pockets, said an officer of Girish Park police station.         
	The gang members, all between 17 and 25, are from Bihar and Jharkhand.         
	Raids were conducted in the port area but no one was arrested.         
	Sarfraz, a Tangra resident, told the police that he had come to Calcutta from Bihar 10 years ago.        
	Plans are on to deploy policewomen in malls and markets on weekends, said an officer.

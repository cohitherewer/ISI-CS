The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal tannery gutted
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Illegal tannery gutted
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire reduced an illegal tannery in Tangra to ashes on Thursday morning. There were no casualties.        
	Fire officers said 41 tenders took more than six hours to put out the blaze, the cause of which was not yet known. A two-storeyed building housed the tannery on the ground floor and living quarters above.        
	The fire engulfed the whole building within a few minutes as the tannery was stocked with inflammable chemicals. The owner flouted all safety norms. We have lodged a complaint against him, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director-general of fire services.         
	Police said the tannery was owned by Lee, a 70-year-old man of Chinese origin. He lived with his family on the first floor. They must have vacated the building after noticing the flames, said an officer.        
	Lee was not arrested till late on Thursday.        
	All tanneries were supposed to shift to Bantala three years ago but a lack of facilities there prompted some to stay back illegally.

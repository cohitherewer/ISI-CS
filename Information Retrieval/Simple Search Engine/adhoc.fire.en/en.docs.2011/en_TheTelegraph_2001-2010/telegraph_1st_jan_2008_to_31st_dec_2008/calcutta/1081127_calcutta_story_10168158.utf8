          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple were arrested in Thakurpukur on Wednesday for allegedly murdering an acquaintance, 45-year-old Deepali Sarkar. Police said Rabi Mondal and Shipra  in their 30s  had been arrested in 2007, too, for murdering a Behala trader.        
	On November 17, Shipra spiked Deepalis drink in the couples house on Taramonighat Road, police said.         
	They took an unconscious Deepali near her house in Paris Para and threw her into a pond after tying her hands and legs with a dupatta, an officer said.         
	Deepalis daughter told the police that her mothers gold ring, gold chain and cellphone were missing. The police recovered the gold items from a jewellery shop in Jadavpur and came to know about the couple who had sold them.         
	Rabi and Shipra confessed to the murder during interrogation, the officer added.

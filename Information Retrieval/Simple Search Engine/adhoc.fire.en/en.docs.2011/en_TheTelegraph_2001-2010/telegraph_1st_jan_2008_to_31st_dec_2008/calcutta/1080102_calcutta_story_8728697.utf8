	The civic body and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) have taken up a project to build a walkway along the eastern bank of the Hooghly as part of a Rs 12.8-crore riverfront beautification scheme. 
    
	The construction of the concrete walkway will start this month. Twelve segments of it will initially come up in front of a dozen ghats, from Babughat to Rathtala ghat. The segments between Babughat and Chitpur will later be joined to form a four-km-long and eight-ft-wide walkway. The path will later be extended on the north.
    
	The decision to construct the walkway was taken at a meeting between the commissioner of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Alapan Bandyopadhyay, and CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.
    
	We have appointed architect Ranjit Gupta as the CMC consultant, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. The CMDAs architect cell will oversee the project. 
    
	The CMC and the CMDA have got central and state funds to the tune of Rs 6.8 crore for the makeover of the riverfront. In addition, a private donor has offered Rs 6 crore to the CMC for refurbishing Nimtala burning ghat. The CMDA will renovate the Nimtala immersion ghat.
    
	The civic authorities will also take up renovation schemes for Babughat, Ahiritola ghat, Prasanna Kumar Tagore ghat and Bhonsri mosque at Tallah, said CMCs director-general (project management unit) Anindya Karforma.
    
	The CMDA will take up beautification of eight other ghats, from Nimtala to Rathtala.

                      Secret to success                    The coach of perhaps the most successful team ever in the history of international cricket, John Buchanan spent eight years with the Australian cricket team, consistently guiding it to win a record 16 consecutive Test matches and maintain an unprecedented win ratio of 75 per cent or better in both Tests and One-Day Internationals. He was the first cricket coach to use computer analysis of every ball bowled and has adapted his ideas on movement and motivation from a wide range of other disciplines. This morning, Starmark hosts the Calcutta release of If Better Is Possible by Buchanan, who is presently coaching the Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing Indian Premier League. The book reveals how business managers and coaches at all levels can lead their teams to victory, exploring in detail what it takes to build and sustain championship teams. Written as a series of crisp and accessible essays, it offers guidance on making important and life-changing choices, creating a culture of success, gaining mental toughness, using systems and processes to achieve a winning advantage, providing leadership opportunities and matching competitors ideas. It also presents valuable insights into the strategic thinking behind shaping and leading an elite team.                    Event: City release of John Buchanans If Better Is Possible When: Today at 11 am Where: Starmark, South City Mall, 375 Prince Anwar Shah Road

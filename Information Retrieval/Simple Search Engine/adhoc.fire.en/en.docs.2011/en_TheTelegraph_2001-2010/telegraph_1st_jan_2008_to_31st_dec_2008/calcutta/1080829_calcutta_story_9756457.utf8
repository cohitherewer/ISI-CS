                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bypass campus for B-school 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), which started in a rented building in Sector V in 2006, plans to move to a new campus near Ruby General Hospital in two years.        
	The state government has given us land. We hope to start construction after monsoon, said Ravi Shanker, the chairperson (international cooperation and off-campus programmes) of the institute. We hope the campus will be ready by the 2010 academic year.        
	Shanker was speaking on the sidelines of a national information technology symposium organised by IIFT and Nasscom.        
	The Bypass campus, which will be the institutes second hub in the country after Delhi, will spread across 10 acres, opposite The Heritage School.        
	IIFT runs a two-year postgraduate MBA programme with specialisation in international business and a part-time MBA course for working professionals. The student intake is 60 for each course. Once the new campus is ready, it will rise to 120.        
	The institute, set up by the Union commerce ministry in 1963, has a number of research centres that deal with international trade. Its World Trade Organisation cell in Calcutta provides inputs to policy-makers, government officials and trade and industry bodies on issues affecting industry, agriculture and the service sector.

Gunjans father Pradip Ghosh died in his Salt Lake home on Monday evening. The jail authorities said Gunjan would be released for a day on Tuesday after they get a formal order.     A portion of a road caved in at Mukundapur in east Jadavpur on Sunday night, injuring two labourers constructing a drain under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP).

He also tortured her for dowry, Tagari said. Pandit was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro for temple town
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Metro for temple town
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government is keen on extending Metro Railway to Dakshineswar, which will require an investment of Rs 537 crore.        
	The proposal is ready. We are waiting for the Centres nod, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. The project will ensure an integration between the north-south Metro and the proposed East-West Metro.        
	The Centre had a month ago signed an agreement with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for the Rs 4,675-crore East-West corridor which will link Salt Lake and Howrah.        
	For the proposed extension of the north-south line to Dakshineswar, the Metro authorities had conducted a survey a year back. The report, submitted recently, is satisfactory, said Chowdhury. The state will pay a third of the cost.        
	The 8-km stretch from Dum Dum to Dakshineswar is likely to have at least three stations  Naopara, Baranagar and Dunlop.        
	Initially, the service was sought to be extended till Baranagar, and then till Dunlop. But following local CPM MP Amitava Nandis intervention, the Centre has on principle agreed to take the tracks till Dakshineswar.        
	The link will benefit people who ply down BT Road. Reaching central or south Calcutta from the northern fringes, quite difficult now, will be easy once the Metro trains run till Dakshineswar, explained said Nandi.        
	Sources said the government may have to acquire a few hectares for the construction of the stations on the extended route. The state and Metro Railways have also started a survey on the viability of extending the service from Dum Dum to the airport.

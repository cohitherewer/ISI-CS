          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A policeman on vigilante patrol in the Shibtala area of Bally was shot in the arm at 1am on Friday by a youth standing in front of his house. Police said the youth was chatting with two others on motorcycles in front of Shaktipada Hazras house when he confronted them.         
	The trio claimed they were from the same locality and were discussing something important, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). Not satisfied with their explanation, he asked them for their addresses and the names of their parents.         
	An officer of Bally police station said Hazra also asked his son to call the police. The trio tried to escape on their motorcycles but Hazra and other members of the patrol group blocked their way, he added. One of the three took out a gun tucked in his waist and shot Hazra, said another officer.         
	Hazra was admitted to Medical College and Hospital. His condition is said to be stable. The three youths fled but the motorcycles have been impounded. We will trace out the owners with the help of the registration numbers, said an officer.

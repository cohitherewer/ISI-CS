                A city-based NGO moved the high court on Thursday against the Calcutta Municipal Corporations (CMC) decision to allow a private company to trim and cut down trees inside the Swabhumi Heritage Conservation Park to construct a hotel. The petitioner claimed a complaint was lodged with Phoolbagan police station on June 18, but no action was taken. The NGO prayed for an order restraining the CMC from permitting the firm to go ahead with the construction.     The high court and the city civil court buildings were searched on Thursday afternoon after Lalbazar received a call saying there was a bomb on the premises. Police deployed sniffer dogs but no bomb was found.     Calcutta police launched a Puja Guide and introduced an SMS service (9874400500) on Thursday for getting information on the exact location of a pandal, parking areas, diversions and live traffic updates. A toll free emergency line (1066) with Apollo Gleneagles was also launched.     Train services between Howrah and Kharagpur were stalled on Thursday evening after the overhead wires at Andul were damaged.

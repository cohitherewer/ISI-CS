	The last time Anoushka Shankar was here, less than a month ago, it was all about her father and a lot about her sister. But on Monday, it was about me, myself and music. 
    
	In town to promote her new album Breathing Under Water  a collaborative effort with producer and composer Karsh Kale and featuring everyone from family members Pandit Ravi Shankar and Norah Jones to friends Sting and Shankar Mahadevan  Anoushka hasnt yet got over the December concert at Calcutta Club.
    
	It was terrifying, she laughed. You just look up from the stage and see all those great musicians seated in the front rows. It was frightening because I hadnt played here in a few years (she had last played in Calcutta five years ago) and performing in front of all those people was like you had to show yourself. And thats an intimidating way of playing music. But it was also inspiring, because you had to give your best.
    
	Anoushka admitted that playing with her father in Calcutta was one of the more special musical moments of her busy concert schedule. It was an honour to play here and I know how much it meant to everyone to see my father perform here again, she recalled. The energy was incredible and I could see in my father how much it meant to him.
    
	Another vital aspect of that trip was the presence of sister Norah Jones, who was holidaying in India at the time and travelling with the Shankars. She was in the country for about four weeks and she really had a nice time, said Anoushka. But Norah couldnt see a lot of Calcutta, thanks to the constant media glare. She liked Calcutta whenever she was allowed to see it, Anoushka smiled cheekily.
    
	On her part, Anoushka rued missing out on the Dover Lane Music Conference, starting Tuesday night. I really wanted to attend it, she said. Perhaps she can ensure her presence by playing there next time.

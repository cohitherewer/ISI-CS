	A Guide presents a Bharat Scouts and Guides scarf to Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at the Rajya Puraskar ceremony        
	The joy of receiving the state award was marred for the Bharat Scouts and Guides who had gathered from across West Bengal at Raj Bhavan. They were to receive certificates from the governor, at the 11th Rajya Puraskar ceremony on Friday.         
	The eager students had queued up for the ceremony, but had to head home disappointed. We had even practised receiving the award from the governor, said dejected Class X student Sayani Roy.         
	Reeppandi Lepcha of Kalimpong echoed her sentiment. It would have been nice if the governor gave us the award. Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi could spare only about eight minutes, before he left to attend a funeral.         
	The annual ceremony saw 133 students receiving the Rajya Puraskar, with 12 adult leaders with more than 10 years with the movement being awarded the Medal of Merit. The Bar to the Medal of Merit was given to four adult leaders who have dedicated more than 15 years of service.         
	In West Bengal, there are more than 30,000 scouts and guides, one-third of whom are guides. Many dropped out between 1998 and 2003 as school initiative was lacking. Now we are focussing on schools to induct more scouts and guides, said K L Tamta, assistant state commissioner of scout and inspector-general of police, north Bengal.         
	After being inducted into Bharat Scouts and Guides, a boy or girl advances through four levels namely Pratham, Dwitiya, Tritiya Sopan and Rajya Puraskar to become a Rashtrapati Scout or Guide.         
	A Tritiya Sopan holder, with proficiency badges in any five fields like literacy, soil conservation, community work, ecology, rural work, cancer awareness, sanitation promotion is eligible for a Rajya Puraskar.        
	The children were happy to receive recognition for their efforts. We brave hazards like insect bites and sudden accidents when we go for overnight camps, treks and hikes, said Bijaya Chattri and Lhaden Bhutia who had come from Kalimpong. Along with activities like paragliding and river rafting, we are also trained to save people from drowning, said Utkarsh Kothari, who has been a scout for the last seven years.         
	I had joined because of my schools insistence, but now I aim for the Rashtrapati Award, added Sayani, the first person in her family to be a guide. Rahul Senguptas attitude bespoke his maturity: We learn to adjust to all kinds of conditions. After all, in camps we do not get cosy beds.         
	Despite the students enthusiasm, state encouragement in terms of funds and amenities is not as good as in the rest of the country, said a scout who has been with the movement for more than 20 years.

	The principal of a central Calcutta school has been accused of beating a student so hard with a wooden ruler that the 12-year-old boy has suffered a deep cut under his right eye.        
	Principal Mohan Raj was arrested on Wednesday after Fasahat Hussain, the student, lodged a police complaint.        
	Raj will be produced in court on Thursday, said an officer of Taltala police station, under which the school at Haji Mohammed Mohsin Square falls.        
	Fasahat, a student of Class VI of St Saviours Tamil Church School, not far from the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street, had to be administered three stitches.        
	Corporal punishment is banned in schools and a teacher can be dismissed from service if he is found to have beaten up any student.        
	Fasahat alleged in the complaint that he had been assaulted for no fault of his. He said some of his friends were busy chatting on Tuesday morning when the teacher who was supposed to take the class did not turn up.        
	The principal had come to our room twice and asked us to keep quiet. When he came in for the third time, I had gone up to my classmate Shahdab to borrow a pen, said Fasahat, sitting with mother Parveen Begum at their Pemantle Street home, close to the school.        
	Without waiting for any explanation, he started hitting me with a wooden ruler on my right hand and shoulder. I raised my hands when he was about to hit me on the head and the blow landed just below my right eye. The ruler also hit my nose, said Fasahat.        
	The boy alleged that the principal did nothing while he kept bleeding for half an hour.         
	After half an hour, he asked me to go to the toilet and wash my face, Fasahat recounted. Raj finally took the bleeding boy to a doctor on Alimuddin Street.         
	The doctor administered three stitches on his cheek below the right eye and Fasahat was then taken home. When I asked the principal, he told me that Fasahat had been punished for playing cricket during school hours. But I learnt from the doctor that the principal was trying to hush up his brutal act, said mother Parveen.        
	Family members said they decided to lodge a police complaint after realising that Fasahat was in physical and mental distress.

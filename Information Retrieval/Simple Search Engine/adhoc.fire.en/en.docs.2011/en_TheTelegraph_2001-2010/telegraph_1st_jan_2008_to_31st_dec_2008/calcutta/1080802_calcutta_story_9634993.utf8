                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hoax-weary citizens amp; sniffers     -   Grrrrr! A girl gang on prowl
          KINSUK BASU                          Raring to go: (From left) Asha, Hasi, Ria and Tuli of the dog squad at Police Training School. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Whoever sent the hoax mail on Tuesday evening threatening bomb blasts at seven places in the city had better not show their faces to Asha and Snoopy. Or Hashi and Ria. Or Tuli and Lipi.        
	This all-girl band  yes, Snoopy is a female, too  of six hasnt had a moment of rest since their after-dinner doze was rudely interrupted around 7.30 that evening.        
	Asha and Snoopy rushed to Park Street, one of the places the email from khalid50rocketmail.com mentioned as a target.        
	From one end of Park Street to another, they sniffed and sniffed, trotting around each parked car, going under, going up with the front legs resting against the vehicles side to check the roof.        
	If youve seen Park Street in the evening  cars parked bumper to bumper  youll know how much work that was for Asha, a veteran at nine, and Snoopy, who at six isnt getting any younger.        
	Asha and Snoopy, both black Labradors, were taken to Calcuttas hotspot because theyre the best in Calcutta polices dog squad. And dont call them sniffer dogs since your life depends on them. And because they are no ordinary sniffer dog.        
	Pradeep Pandey, the officer-in-charge of Calcutta polices dog squad, explained: Theyre specially trained (at the National Training Centre for Dogs in Gwalior) to detect explosives and called explosive detector dogs.        
	Since Tuesday, the six of them  four Labradors and two Golden Retrievers  have rushed from one sniffing assignment to another.         
	According to a rough estimate, there have been 18-20 such occasions, on top of the routine tasks they have to perform.        
	On Friday, for instance, there were bomb hoaxes at a bank on Lenin Sarani, on the Maidan where a briefcase was abandoned and at a private hospital at Ekbalpore.        
	Tuli, who doesnt like working among crowds too much  neither does Lipi  was taken to the Maidan. Of course, nothing was found, as in all the other scares raised in the past few days.        
	But the work schedule has been scary enough for the six who have frequently missed their 6pm mealtime. All the rushing about tells on their nerves too, not to speak of digestion.        
	The diet has been changed to cope with the nature of work: a high-protein combine of beef and chicken while the carb, mainly rice, has been curbed. Less vegetables too.        
	Their minders are feeding them ghol, the Bengali equivalent of lassi, several times a day, which, as anyone whose mother has taken good care of them at exam time knows, keeps your stomach and head cool.        
	After a dog days work, they are cleaned up and given a hot compress to relax their tired limbs.        
	As they lie down at night, they must be chewing on the thought of getting their teeth into the hoax email sender. Grrrrr.        
	That goes for all of us.

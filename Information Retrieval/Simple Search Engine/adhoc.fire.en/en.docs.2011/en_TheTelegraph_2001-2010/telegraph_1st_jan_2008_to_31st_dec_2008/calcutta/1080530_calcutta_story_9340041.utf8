                      Feelin groovy....                    A journey is best measured in friends rather than miles  goes the saying and when friends unite to recapitulate the experience, its celebration time all the way and guys would yell in unison, Chalo Lets Go.... After a short hiatus following The Bong Connections success, Chalo Lets Go... (a still from the film appears here) is music director Neel Dutts second Bengali feature film soundtrack. And to raise a toast on the occasion, the films director/singer Anjan Dutt will be joined by Rupankar, Rupam Islam, Nachiketa and Neel Dutt who will belt out numbers from this film. The film is a tribute to the quintessential footloose Bengalees unsatiating thirst for travelling, which was given an official sanction by two Bengali icons of the silver screen, Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, when they lipped the immortal song, Aei path jodi na shesh hoye.... The song celebrates the spirit of adventure that typifies the Bengali psyche. Music director Neel re-interprets the spirit of the song as he looks at it from a from a new and youthful perspective, rekindling the nostalgic elements while paying a befitting tribute to the track.

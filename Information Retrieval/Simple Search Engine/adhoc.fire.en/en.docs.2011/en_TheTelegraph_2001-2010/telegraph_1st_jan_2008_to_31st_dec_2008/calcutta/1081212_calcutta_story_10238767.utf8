          Todays question: Would Diego Maradonas visit do any good to Bengal football? More responses will be published next week                                                      
	Arnab Bhadra, 
  Baranagar         
	Maradonas visit to Bengal is a glorious event for us. It should be an inspiration for players. But I think there will be no change in Bengal football due to several barriers like poor infrastructure.               
	
Santosh Chakravarty, 
  Behala        
	Not at all. A hurricane visit of the soccer idol can hardly do any good to Bengal football. Any betterment in football needs practice, infrastructure and positive attitude. Maradonas magic cannot be injected into Bengal in the twinkle of an eye.         
	

PRAMIT MAITY, 
  Girish Park        
	Motivation is a key factor behind any achievement. Diego Maradona is an inspiration not only to Bengal football but to everybody in the game. I am very proud that he came to our city. It will help our football. But key factors like government support and sponsorship are also vital.               
	

DEBOJYOTI DHAR, 
  Dhakuria Station Road        
	Maradonas arrival is politically motivated. In the present state, Maradona is of no use to Bengal football, even though he is the coach of the Argentina football team. How can a mere felicitation help progress a game? The occasion milked the Bengalis craze for football.              
	

P.K. Ghosh, 
  Barasat        
	Maradonas whirlwind visit will do no good to Calcutta football as it is going downhill because of in-fighting. The hand of god does not wield a magic wand.         
	

Jhumpa Paul, 
  Dankuni        
	Indians are better known as cricket-lovers to the world than as football-lovers. Maradonas visit will draw attention to our football. We can encourage ourselves into developing our football infrastructure.               
	

SHANKHA SHUVRO, 
  Dhakuria         
	In the past 40 years, Bengal has seen many football greats from Pele to to Kahn to Rummenigge. But, surely after Peles visit, this is going to be the greatest occasion. The man with the hand of God saw Bengal for the first time. Bengal ought to be proud. I dont know whether there will be any improvement in Bengal football at the grassroots level but young footballers will be inspired by his magnetic personality.               
	

KAJAL CHATTERJEE, 
  Sodepur         
	The idea that Diego Maradonas visit will do good to Bengal football is perhaps the biggest joke of 2008. Bengal is certainly the only region in the world where instead of investing resources in nurturing budding talent, millions are squandered over cheap gimmicks like inviting Maradona, only to make him cut ribbons at a football academy.              
	

Himadri De,

	This is a gimmick, an effort to divert the mind of the people of Bengal towards such an event which has no relevance to the ongoing burning issues like Lalgarh and Mumbai attacks.The expenditure incurred could be utilised as subsidy towards autos converting to LPG.

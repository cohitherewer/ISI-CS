The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caterer flat blast rocks building
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Caterer flat blast rocks building
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A blast suspected to have been triggered by leaking cooking gas in a caterers store room-cum-kitchen ripped through a four-storeyed building in New Alipore early on Friday, injuring three persons.        
	The shockwave from the blast shook the Sahapur Colony building for a few seconds, blowing off doors and smashing windowpanes of the flats on all floors.         
	The explosion bears resemblance to the one in McDonalds on Park Street, which, too, is believed to have been caused by a gas leak.         
	Gas leaking from three LPG cylinders kept in a two-room flat in Sova Apartments might have come in touch with an electrical mosquito repellent and caused the blast. The flat was used as a warehouse and kitchen by a caterer, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Bhola Kayal, 27, who was sleeping in the room, suffered severe burns and was admitted to a nursing home.         
	Gautam Dey, the caterer, is absconding. A case of criminal negligence and mischief with fire has been registered against the New Alipore resident. If Kayal dies, he will also be charged with causing death by negligence, said an officer.        
	The 30-odd residents of the building were jolted out of their sleep around 3.40am. Gauri Banik, 65, and Snehal Mitra, 17, who live on the first floor, were injured by shards from shattered window panes.        
	I rushed to the flat where the blast had occurred and saw a wall blown apart. There were small fires everywhere, said Bikash Chatterjee, 57, who lives in an adjacent flat.         
	Sunil Mitra, Snehals father, joined Chatterjee minutes later. I saw a naked man (Kayal) in flames running out, he recalled. An officer said Kayal rushed to Durgapur Colony, where his parents live. His acquaintances there doused the blaze. The flames in the caterers flat were put out by a tender.

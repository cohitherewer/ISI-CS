                      Visual legacy of the 20th century                    T he act of responding to earlier ideas and visions was very much an accepted trend in the 20th century. A great many European artists, including Picasso, have responded to earlier masters like Manet, Rembrandt, Delacroix, Velasquez, El Greco, Goya and others. On the occasion of its 15th birthday, CIMA invited 15 Indian artists to respond to five artworks that made a profound impact on Indian visual thought and history. The artworks chosen were Bharatmata (Abanindranath Tagore; 1905), The Santhal Family (Ramkinkar Baij; 1938), Zameen (Maqbool Fida Husain; 1955), Man with a Bouquet of Plastic Flowers (Bhupen Khakhar; 1976) and the very famous Guernica (Pablo Picasso; 1937). What finally emerged is indeed a fascinating repertoire of new ways of looking at art. ReView, the ongoing exhibition, hopes to offer insight into understanding how creative minds silently imbibe, interpret and finally redefine ideas. It also helps study the influence of changing times, space and history on Indian creative thought and practice besides affording an opportunity to revalidate, refute or create new terms and parameters of discussion and engagement. Participants include Farhad Hussain, Jogen Chowdhury, Paresh Maity, Partha Pratim Deb (a painting by him appears here) and Sumitro Basak.

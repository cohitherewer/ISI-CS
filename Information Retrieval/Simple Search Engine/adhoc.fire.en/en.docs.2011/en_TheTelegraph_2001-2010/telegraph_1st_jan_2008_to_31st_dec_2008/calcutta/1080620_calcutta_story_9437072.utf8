          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Pranab Kumar Sengupta                                   
	The primary schoolteacher getting a salary of Rs 21.75 for 35 years won another battle on Thursday when the high court upheld contempt against the state and asked it to pay his dues.        
	So far, however, legal victories have proved fruitless for Pranab Kumar Sengupta, who joined Patipukur Basak Bagan Primary School in 1973, as a number of orders by Calcutta High Court could not secure for him confirmation of appointment with retrospective effect and payment of dues.        
	A division bench, comprising justices Asim Banerjee and Tapas Kumar Giri, rejected the appeal by the North 24-Parganas district primary school council chairman challenging the validity of the contempt rule issued against him in January 2006 for not confirming Senguptas appointment.        
	I am 57 years old. If I am granted the appointment now, I will have to retire in three years. But I do not believe the division bench order will be obeyed, Sengupta said after Thursdays judgment.        
	The chairman and the state primary education council not only did not abide by the instruction to confirm him but also appointed an assistant teacher in the school by flouting a court order. The court had asked the government not to employ any teacher in the school before confirming Senguptas appointment.        
	Saibalendu Bhowmik, the lawyer who has been fighting the case since 1993, alleged that the education department had violated court orders in other respects, too.         
	Justice (K.J.) Sengupta (who had issued the January 2006 order) had asked the state education department not to disburse the salary of the chairman of the North 24-Parganas primary school council before the teachers dues were cleared. But the chairman is getting his salary, he said.        
	Sengupta was employed on a temporary basis by the institution in 1973 on a monthly salary of Rs 21.75. In 1978, the state declared the school as government-aided and took over the responsibility of paying teachers salaries.         
	The school education department, however, declined to pay Sengupta as the district primary school council had not confirmed his appointment.        
	When attempts to get his appointment confirmed did not yield result, Sengupta moved the high court in 1993. The following year, Justice P.K. Mukherjee directed the primary school council to appoint Sengupta with effect from 1973.        
	Instead of implementing the order, the government has been acting litigation-happy and losing case after case.

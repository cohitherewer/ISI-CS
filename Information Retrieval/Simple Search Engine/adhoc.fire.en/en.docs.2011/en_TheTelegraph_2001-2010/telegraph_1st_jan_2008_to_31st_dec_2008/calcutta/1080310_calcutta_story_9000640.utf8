                      Variegated vision                    Featuring works by eminent contemporary artists, Gaze Within, Gaze Without, the ongoing exhibition, derives its title from nine diverse practices that have a single common feature  the act of gazing. While some gaze inwards at the self, confronting personal conflicts and crossroads, others gaze outwards, often via the self. For some, the third entity that is the other also emerges as a key player in the politics between the self and the arena of public concern. Invariably, the private space transgresses the public, and vice versa, blurring the boundaries of gazing within and gazing without.

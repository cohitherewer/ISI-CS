          A STAFF REPORTER                          Swarup Biswas                                  
	Swarup Biswas, the alleged mastermind of the attack on Charu Market police station, was granted interim bail on Wednesday. He was directed to appear before the court on November 3.        
	Public prosecutor Satya Chakrabarty told the court, For the sake of smooth investigation, the accused should be sent to judicial custody.        
	But acting chief judicial magistrate Arijit Mukherjee granted Swarup interim bail and ordered him to submit a bail bond of Rs 3,000 and three security deposits of Rs 1,000 each. The Trinamul Congress activist was also asked to meet the investigating officer every alternate day at Lalbazar.        
	The detective department had arrested Swarup, brother of Trinamul MLA Arup Biswas, on October 8 from the Kona Expressway on the charge of leading the attack on October 5. Four police vehicles were set ablaze and some officers were injured in the violence.        
	After spending four days in the Lalbazar central lock-up, when Swarup was produced in court, he fell ill and was admitted to Medical College and Hospital. The 28 others who were arrested on the day of the violence had got bail earlier.        
	On Wednesday, Swarup was brought to Lalbazar at 11am after the hospital declared him fit. A panel of lawyers was present in court to defend Swarup.

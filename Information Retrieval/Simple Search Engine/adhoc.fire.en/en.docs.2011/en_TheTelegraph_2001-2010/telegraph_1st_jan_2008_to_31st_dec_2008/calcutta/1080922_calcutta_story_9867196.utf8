The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night drive bares fume check flaws
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Night drive bares fume check flaws
          JAYANTA BASU                          A reading on the pollution meter on Saturday night. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Time: 12.50am        
	Place: Taratala crossing        
	A lorry (WB259911) loaded with debris is stopped by policemen carrying out the first round of night pollution checks in the city. The vehicles pollution under control (PUC) certificate shows its emission level to be 46 HSU (Hartridge Smoke Unit), well within the permissible limit of 65 HSU; a spot check reveals a reading of 96.6.        
	The policemen, however, have to let the lorry go as a high court order exempts vehicles with PUC from prosecution even if their emission levels in a spot check are revealed to be higher than permissible. So the driver is asked to take remedial steps and bring the lorry back for a test within a week.        
	Two other vehicles, of the eight tested by the cops and pollution control board experts on Saturday night, had emission counts over the permissible limit. One of the drivers had to pay a fine as his lorry did not have a PUC certificate.         
	The two-hour drive, following a prod by the high court on the basis of a public interest litigation by Subhas Dutta, underlined how flawed the tests being conducted in several emission centres around town were.        
	The situation is the same during the day. We could only prosecute four vehicles during a surprise check at Esplanade though we found 19 whose emission levels were above the permissible limit, said sergeant Subhas Chatterjee, who was in charge of the drive.        
	A senior officer added that such checks were not a deterrent for outstation commercial vehicles that pass through the city. The point was illustrated by the driver of a jute-laden lorry that failed the test. We are from Punjab and will return there shortly. How can we bring the vehicle for a retest in seven days? he asked.        
	The first night of pollution check exposed the inadequacies of the testing team. We had decent infrastructure till 2000, when we collected about Rs 1.3 crore as pollution fine. But now weve only three smoke meters. Weve asked the environment department for funds, said additional commissioner (traffic) K. Hari Rajan.        
	The motor vehicles department also argued that it doesnt have the infrastructure to test the thousands of goods vehicles that enter the city at night.        
	Our mandate is to give technical support, claimed a pollution control board official. The test seems to be an eyewash when one looks at the 60,000 goods vehicles that ply the city streets at night. A dedicated team with adequate infrastructure is needed, said green activist Dutta.

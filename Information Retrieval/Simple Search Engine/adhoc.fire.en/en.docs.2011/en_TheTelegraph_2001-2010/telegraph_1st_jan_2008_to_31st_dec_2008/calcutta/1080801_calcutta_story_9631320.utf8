                Dipak Sonkar, 38, a resident of Fakir Bagan Lane in Howrah, was arrested for sending a text message to Pritam Sinha, 30, a resident of Hooghlys Chatterjeepara, threatening to blow up his apartment. Sonkar will be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Chinsura, Hooghly, on Friday.    Calcutta High Court on Thursday issued an injunction on the sale of the excess land acquired by the state in 1962 for construction of the six-lane Kona Expressway in Howrah. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority had recently invited tenders from private parties and developing companies for selling the plots.     The Howrah-Hyderabad East Coast Express service will be restored from August 2, a South-Eastern Railway spokesperson said on Thursday. The decision was taken after reviewing the condition of the tracks on the Kharagpur-Bhadrak section, which were damaged in the recent floods.    A demonstration by nearly 100 residents of Mullick Bazar disrupted traffic in Moulali, Park Street and Park Circus on Thursday afternoon. They were protesting the poor condition of the carriageways and tram tracks.    A man was killed following a collision between a taxi and an army truck on Strand Road on Thursday. Police said the truck hit a taxi coming from the opposite direction. A second taxi, which was behind the first one, bumped into it. Manik Das, 30, the driver of the second taxi, was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The passenger of the second taxi suffered minor injuries. The truck driver fled.    Air India has announced the withdrawal of its Calcutta-Yangon flight till September 30. The flight, which operated every Monday, was withdrawn due to lack of passengers, officials said.

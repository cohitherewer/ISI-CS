                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Court wants life term for killer driver
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court wants a driver allegedly responsible for a fatal accident to be charged with an offence punishable with life imprisonment. Police have booked the driver under a less stringent section.        
	The present practice, which transport minister Subhas Chakraborty is trying to preserve against his governments wishes, is to charge drivers spilling blood on the streets with a bailable offence under IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence), which carries a maximum punishment of two years in jail.        
	The government is planning to change the system and charge killer drivers under a non-bailable section  304, culpable homicide not amounting to murder. If convicted under this section, a driver will have to spend the rest of his life behind bars.        
	The court ruling  a shot in the arm for the government  followed a bail plea moved by Sanjay Singh, who had been arrested in Birbhum for allegedly ramming his 10-wheeler into a car, killing four persons.        
	The mishap occurred on August 21. The four were travelling to Tarapith. Some criminals had stopped the car by placing a tree trunk on the road and the truck hit it from behind, said Pradip Roy, who appeared for the state.        
	Sanjay, who was driving the truck, was arrested and charged under Section 304A. He plea for bail was turned down, said Roy. Sanjay then moved the high court, seeking bail on the grounds that he had been booked under a bailable section.        
	But the division bench headed by Justice A.K. Talukdar held that the accused should be prosecuted under Section 304. When a moving vehicle hits another moving vehicle and cause deaths, the accused can be booked under 304A. But in this case, the car was not moving. The truck driver had the opportunity to avoid the accident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Glare on road after Priya horror ride 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Glare on road after Priya horror ride 
          AMRITA GHOSH                           The car in the ministers convoy that fell into the ditch                                  
	Residents of Howrahs Belillious Lane have been suffering for the past quarter of a century what Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi faced and fretted over for a day.        
	The stretch of road where Das Munshis Scorpio got stuck in slush on Thursday and another car in his convoy fell into a clogged roadside ditch becomes waterlogged after every sharp shower. But nobody in the administration seemed to bother  or even know about it  until the Union ministers horror ride.        
	The one-km link between Panchanantala and Belillious Road is among the busiest in Howrah, and also the worst. Its been like this for 25 years. Waterlogging is a regular affair because the Howrah Municipal Corporation hasnt repaired the faulty drainage system even once, a trader said.        
	Residents of Panchanantala have to take the road to reach Narasingha Dutta College, Belillious Park and several other landmarks. Those who live along Belillious Road use the lane to reach Kadamtala, Drainage Canal Road, Kamardanga, Kona Expressway and the industrial hub of Dasnagar.         
	Basudev Jaiswal, the owner of an iron-plate shop at 124 Belillious Lane, said the monsoon months were bad for business. The road is under knee-deep water every other day.         
	Sarmistha Debnath, a second-year chemistry student, lives near Annapurna Bayam Samity and walks to college. My college is just a 15-minute walk away. But when it rains, walking through this road is a horrible experience.         
	The Howrah Improvement Trust raised the level of the road last year in an attempt to stop waterlogging, but ended up creating a new problem instead of solving one. Water started entering houses, shops and even government offices after the road level was raised, said Bilas Kanti Karmakar, an employee of the agriculture marketing office at 79 Belillious Lane.        
	On Thursday, Das Munshi was visiting the area to inaugurate a puja organised by the Jatiya Seva Dal, of which he is the president. The parliamentary affairs minister travelled around 7 km without an escort as the pilot car supposed to lead the convoy to the puja from Vidyasagar Setu did not turn up at the appointed time. The sub-inspector assigned to escort the vehicle and the driver of the pilot car were suspended.         
	Gopal Mukherjee, the mayor of Howrah, said: The waterlogging problem will be solved after the drainage system is revamped by the Howrah Improvement Trust. Footnote: Belillious Lane is named after the philanthropist Parsi businessman Isaac Raphael Belilios, who established Belillious School and donated some of his property to public organisations.

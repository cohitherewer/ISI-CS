                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trees cut at green hub

	The Indian Botanic Garden authorities have allegedly cut down at least 30 trees without permission from the forest department.        
	The authorities claimed the trees were felled to set up a flower garden and such operations are undertaken regularly. The chopped trees have been sold through auction.         
	After receiving complaints from morning-walkers, I visited the garden and found more than 30 trees had been chopped off. Labourers said more trees had been cut in the garden in the past month, said environment activist Subhas Dutta. He lodged a complaint with Shibpur police station.         
	Garden in-charge Girija Shankar Giri said: Twenty trees with an average age between 30 and 40 years had been chopped off to create a flower garden. It was there in the original plan but had not been maintained properly. We are now trying to restore the flower garden with the help of CESC, whose cable passes through the garden.         
	He added that since the garden was under the Union ministry of environment and forest, the authorities did not need any permission from the state forest department.         
	The official claimed trees had been cut in the garden in the past to maintain its planned character. He, however, admitted that so many trees had never been cut earlier.        
	The garden definitely needs permission from the forest department, stated Dutta.        
	Atanu Raha, the principal chief conservator of forests, also said permission from the forest department was mandatory. The garden authorities must have planned the tree cutting for a proper reason, added Raha.

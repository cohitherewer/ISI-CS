          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A super speciality cardiology hospital, a nursing college and a network of blood transfusion clinics are set to come up in the city as part of the Mission of Mercy Hospital and Research Centres expansion plans in West Bengal and Orissa.         
	We will set up at least 10 hospitals in the next few years in West Bengal and Orissa. The cardiology hospital is being planned in the city. The cost of the projects is being worked out, said Sanjay Prasad, the CEO of the hospital, which was earlier known as Assembly of God Church Hospital.        
	The chains existing facility on Park Street is being renovated. On Saturday, an insulin pump installation centre, a 24-hour diabetes clinic and a number of multi-speciality clinics were launched there.         
	The hospital is in the process of acquiring a 100,000-sq-ft plot in Thakurpukur to establish the nursing college for around Rs 10 crore. We are on the lookout for a suitable plot to build the cardiac hospital, said Prasad.         
	The network of clinics to be set up in and around the city, essentially for leukaemia and thalassaemia patients, will be converted into 20-bed hospitals, according to Prasad.        
	The Rs 12-crore renovation project will see more space between beds in the Park Street hospital. Most of the renovated wards will have air-conditioning, said an official. There will be a billing counter for every two floors of the eight-storeyed hospital.        
	A private medical college in the city is also on the Mission of Mercys radar. KPC Charitable Foundation recently received clearance from the Medical Council of India to build the first private medical college in the state in Jadavpur.

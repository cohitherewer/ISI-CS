	Rain threatened to play spoilsport but Spring Fest could still live up to its theme  The True Spirit of Youth.
    
	Braving the steady drizzle and the chilly wind on Day II of the annual IIT Kharagpur carnival, organised in association with The Telegraph, youngsters thronged Tagore Open Air Theatre on Friday for the inaugural round of Wildfire, the rock music contest.
    
	Bands from Calcutta, Darjeeling and Durgapur set the crowd under umbrellas on fire. They played original compositions as well as covers of Pink Floyd, Rage Against The Machine and Metallica  the crowds cheering them on.
    
	Being the top draw of the fest, Wildfire received more than 40 registrations online. Only three of the bands are from the institute. We hope all the outstations ones will come down and perform, said Tanuj Dora, a fest organiser.
    
	The competition, being judged by the Indian rock band Pentagram, will be held over three days. The winners will perform on Sunday, opening for Pentagram.
    
	The rain, however, took its toll on Arena, an open-air stage modelled on a ship. All but one event lined up aboard Arena during the day had to be postponed indefinitely. Only Collaging could be held, as it was shifted to an auditorium. Our plans went haywire because of the rain, admitted an organiser.
    
	Cyber Quiz (held at the Netaji Auditorium), Sur (an instrumental contest at Bhatnagar Auditorium) and Rhythm (vocal contest at Bhatnagar Auditorium) saw good footfall. Hamlet  The Spoof, a play by theatre group Evam, was also well attended.
    
	Singer Sukhwinder Singhs performance at the open-air theatre on Friday evening was a hit.
    
	The fest got off to a rocking start on January 24 with Taal. UK-based band Breathe  The Delicate Sound of Floyd took the stage at 7pm and had the packed Open Air Theatre sway to their rendition of Pink Floyd.
    
	The star events over the next two days include Rangmanch, (a theatre contest) and the Rocknite, featuring Pentagram.

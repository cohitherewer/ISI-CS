          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	About 4,500 pirated textbooks of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and Visva-Bharati were seized from a godown on Amherst Street on Tuesday. A man was arrested in this connection.        
	A racket was behind the unauthorised printing of English and environment science textbooks for classes V to X, said police.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that the books kept in the Raja Dinendra Street godown were printed for the current academic session.        
	 Officers will be on the lookout on College Street. They will raid shops if they see anything suspicious, said an officer.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic body takes steps for safer VIP Road
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Alarmed at the spate of accidents on VIP Road, the Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality has joined hands with the North 24-Parganas police for proper enforcement of traffic rules.        
	The civic body has fielded traffic volunteers and introduced a state-of-the-art breakdown van for better traffic policing on VIP Road. It will also install three closed-circuit cameras.        
	Till June this year, 36 people lost their lives on the artery connecting the city with the airport. On April 4, 21 people died when a bus plunged into Lower Bagjola canal (see grab).        
	We have been told that one of the reasons for the rising death toll on VIP Road is lack of manpower to enforce traffic rules. So, we have selected 153 volunteers who will man the three-km stretch of VIP Road between Kestopur and Kaikhali, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality.        
	The decision was taken after the police urged civic bodies to shoulder some burden of manning traffic in districts, said Chatterjee.        
	The municipality, he said, will foot the monthly salary bill of the traffic volunteers  Rs 2,000 each  who will work under the guidance of traffic department officers.        
	The civic body will also pay for the three closed-circuit cameras that will be installed at the Joramandir, Baguiati and Kestopur crossings. Officers from the Baguiati traffic guard will monitor the footage and crack down on errant vehicles.        
	The municipality has also provided a breakdown van, which can tow a load up to 15 tonnes. This will ensure that the April 4 tragedy does not recur, said an official.        
	As part of the new arrangements, traffic regulation on VIP Road has been extended by four hours. Instead of the 9am to 10pm schedule, the monitoring will continue from 6am to 11pm.        
	We are happy with the municipalitys move, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.

            Up against the fathers law				 
             
	Time present and time past seemed to be the themes at the launch of Manil Suris latest novel, The Age of Shiva, at the Oxford Bookstore on January 17.
    
	The author was gently rebuked for having produced his book seven long years after his internationally acclaimed first novel, The Death of Vishnu. Seated between author Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Sujata Sen, the director of British Council, Suri looked faintly embarrassed as he tried to justify the reasons behind the delay. An author finds it difficult to write a second book because he usually exhausts the storehouse of his experience with the first.
    
	So for The Age of Shiva, Suri delved into his parents past, which was inextricable from that of independent India. Suri needed time to recreate the past authentically, hence the long pause. 
    
	The story of Suris protagonist, Meera, is also the history of the young nation as it limps towards modernity while bearing the scars of the Partition. As a woman in a patriarchal society, Meera finds that the only way she can shape her destiny is through rebellion. So she repeatedly tries to foil the designs of her father and husband as they try to manipulate her life.
    
	Dev Sen, who launched the book, found it interesting that Suri chooses to speak in the voice of Meera throughout the novel. Suri explained that this was as much a result of his effort to make his second novel different from the first as that of his attempt to uncover the mystery of womans desire. 
    
	The first excerpt from the beginning of The Age of Shiva described Meeras pleasure in suckling her child, a pleasure so intense that it sounded almost erotic. For Suri, his novel is also an examination of Oedipus complex from the mothers point of view. Putting himself into the mind of Meera, Suri professes to explore the limits of eroticism between mother and son. 
    
	Commenting on the title, Suri said that the age of Shiva signifies an era of religious upheaval.
    
	Lights out
    
	It was not even a year and a half ago that shepherds crook street lamps with a supposedly retro look were planted on both sides of the Chowringhee flyover. These had outsized globes hanging from them to accommodate the electric bulbs. Very soon, vandals used them to hone their skills of chucking stones at immovable objects. Anyway, they were ugly enough to be destroyed, and with rainwater setting at their bottom, they had turned into breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Now these globes have been replaced by smaller teardrop shaped shades. Not that these are any better looking  but at least they have the virtue of not being so noticeable. 
    
	No ladies, please
    
	Things have come to such a pass. Chung Wah, once a popular watering hole cutting across classes and gender, lost its character since it started to entertain heavily made up women in sequinned saris and salwar kurtas singing popular Hindi numbers with an orchestra loud enough to drown the vocals. Which is all right, because the singers are not noticeable for their talent. But over a few months, the restaurant has also pasted a notice on its entrance saying Ladies guests not allowed after 6.30pm. This is unpardonable. Not only for the English.

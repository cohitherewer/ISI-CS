                      Unfettered art                    The artist, viewing his fellows through his personal vision, has through the ages attempted to portray what he sees and to present his understanding of it. Censorship in his case has perpetrated heavy and sometimes reprehensible blunders  Hollis Alpert        Mukta Shilpa was formed five years ago by a group of established artists/sculptors who had a dream: to reach out to the masses, provide a platform for budding artists and art enthusiasts, to learn from seniors and an opportunity to exhibit their works along with renowned artists. The group was also keen to increase social awareness among the artists and involve them in creative projects that would help them serve society more positively. In fact, this organisation became a handmaid of Charuchetana, set up a decade ago to stoke the ember of talented children living in the fringes of mainstream society. Since its inception, Mukta Shilpa has been organising art/sculpture workshops on particular themes. This year, however, the creators were given the freedom to select their own themes. The result of this freedom of expression has been truly amazing. The ongoing show displays the works of both well-known artists and sculptors and upcoming ones, and the vast range of subjects, the originality of expressions and, above all, the number of participants, are mind-blowing. One of the exhibits, The Virgin by Ratan Banerjee, appears here.

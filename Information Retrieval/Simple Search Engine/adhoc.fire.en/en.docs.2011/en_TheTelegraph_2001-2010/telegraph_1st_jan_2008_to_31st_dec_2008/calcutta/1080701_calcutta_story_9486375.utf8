                      Different strokes                    Creating a beautiful world of colours and forms is a common passion shared by a group of upcoming, young artists. Buds, the ongoing exhibition of their works, brings them together to showcase their distinctive talents and, at the same time, reflect their individual experiences and interests. Still struggling to invent their unique style and form, their works portray themes from everyday life, while their forms are founded in fantasy. Making use of popular motifs from both classical and modern cultures, these paintings are usually unpretentious expressions of their respective creators. Certainly not simplistic, each painting contains interesting narrative qualities, offering an imaginative insight into its creators world view. Participating artists: Ranit Dutta, Subir Dey, Goutam Sarkar, Sudipta Karmakar, Srinjoy Gangopadhyay (a painting by him appears here) and Pradip Sarkar.

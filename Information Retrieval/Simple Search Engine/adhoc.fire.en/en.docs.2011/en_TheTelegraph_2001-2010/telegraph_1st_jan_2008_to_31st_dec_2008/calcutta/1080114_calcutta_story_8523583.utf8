	Sunday, 1.45pm. Thunderous applause greeted the first successful attempt to spray water from the ground on the 11th floor of Nandaram Market complex, 36 hours after the fire broke out.
    
	The army did it, shouted Aman Pachisia, who has a shop in the burning building.
    
	The excitement was shared by thousands gathered on the spot, as a fire tender from the armys ordnance depot in Panagarh sprayed water on the 11th floor of the 13-storeyed building.
    
	See, I told you the army will be able to put out the fire within hours. For the past 36 hours, the men from the West Bengal Fire Services failed to spray water on the top floors where the blaze is raging uncontrolled, said another shopkeeper.
                
	Burrabazar traders and residents seemed to have lost faith in the state fire services the moment its first tenders arrived on the spot. One of the tenders was empty. The firemen could do nothing as the flames leapt out of control, said a resident.
    
	The authorities finally sent an SOS to the army at 10.30am on Saturday. We immediately sent fire tenders from Panagarh ordnance depot, said Colonel Vikram Taneja, the commandant of the depot. We wanted to spray foam on Saturday evening, but fire officials did not allow us.
    
	On Sunday morning, 30 armymen, led by Colonel Taneja, took charge of the interior of Nandaram.
    
	The mood of the local people was best summed up by Ratan Agarwal, an affected shopkeeper: The firemen have been trying for so long. Let the agile armymen take over.
    
	The fire department, however, had a different version. The army is only playing to the gallery, while the real work is being done by our men, who are risking their lives to bring the blaze under control, said divisional forest officer Bibhas Guha.
    
	Around 8.30pm on Sunday, a Metro team went up to Nandarams ninth floor and could not spot a single armyman.

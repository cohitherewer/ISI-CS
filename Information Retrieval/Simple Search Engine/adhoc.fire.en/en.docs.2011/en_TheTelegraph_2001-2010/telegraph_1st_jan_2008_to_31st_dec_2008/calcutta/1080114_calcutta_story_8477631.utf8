	The Burrabazar blaze has claimed one life, but destroyed hundreds of families. Metro spoke to a few...
     
	Name: Subhash Pal.
 
	Family: Wife Manju, two sons.
    
	Shop: A 50-sq-ft cosmetic shop on the fourth floor of Nandaram. The family has been working out of this address for 75 years. They bought the shop recently to spare their sons the travails of being tenants.
    
	What is left: Nothing. Goods worth at least Rs 2-3 lakh are always stocked in the shop. Everything is gone, said Pal. 
    
	Insured: No.
    
	What will they do now: We had built this over years. One fire has reduced everything to ashes, cried Manju.
        
	Name: Mohammad Bhati, 48.
    
	Family: Wife, a son and three daughters.
    
	Shop: Five shops and two godowns of Kohinoor Tarpaulin in Tirpalpatti. Stocks worth Rs 70-75 lakh and all documents were inside.
    
	What is left: Nothing.
    
	Insured: No.
    
	What will he do now: We will have to start from scratch again. All the stocks and bills have been burnt. As our business operates on credit, we will have a hard time recovering our money, said Bhatti.
        
	Name: Somesh Dholakia, 52.
    
	Family: Wife, two sons and two daughters.
    
	Shop: Two shops and three godowns of Shree Ram Canvas and Tarpaulin in Nandaram.
    
	What is left: There is hardly any hope of recovery.
    
	Insured: Partially.
    
	What will he do now: This is our sole source of income. My elder daughter is getting married in April. I dont know how I will manage. Will I be able to revive my business? God only knows, said Dholakia.
        
	Name: Ratan Agarwal, 45.
    
	Family: Wife and two daughters, aged 11 and 13.
    
	Shop: A sari shop and godown in Nandaram.
    
	What is left: On Saturday afternoon, the wholesaler tried to enter the smoke-filled building. He failed.
    
	Insured: Partially.
    
	What will he do now: I had inherited the business from my father. I do not have any other source of income, cried Agarwal.

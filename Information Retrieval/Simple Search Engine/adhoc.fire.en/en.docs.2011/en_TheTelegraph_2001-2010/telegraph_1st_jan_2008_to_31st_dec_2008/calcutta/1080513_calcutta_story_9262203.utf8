          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bharati Sur, a 24-year-old homemaker, died of burns allegedly inflicted by husband Arun. He has been arrested following a complaint from Bharatis father Kripasindhu Biswal.        
	Bharati, who was married off to the Tiljala resident 10 months ago, was taken to National Medical College and Hospital on Saturday night. She died on Monday morning.        
	Arun, too, was admitted to the hospital with 35 per cent burns. Police said they would interrogate him after he recovered. Arun, who works in a private company, told the police that Bharatis sari caught fire while cooking at their Chowbhaga Road home. He got injured while trying to save her.        
	But there were several contradictions in his statement, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.        
	But Bharatis parents said Arun often tortured her for dowry. He demanded money from her parents to start a business. I gave him some money but soon his demands crossed all limits, Kripasindhu told the police.        
	Neighbours, too, have alleged that Arun often assaulted Bharati. We saw smoke billowing from the house on Saturday night and rushed over. After several knocks, Arun opened the door. Both of them were in a serious condition, said a resident.

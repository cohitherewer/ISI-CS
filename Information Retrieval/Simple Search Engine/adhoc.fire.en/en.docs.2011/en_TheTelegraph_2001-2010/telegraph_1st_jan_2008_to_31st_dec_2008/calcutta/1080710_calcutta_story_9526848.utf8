          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 51 Whiteliner buses operating under the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation were taken off the road on Wednesday by franchisee Pirojiwal Infrastructure Ltd following differences with the workers union.         
	The Whiteliner service was inaugurated by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on October 4, 2005. The buses operated on three routes in the city  Airport-Tollygunge, Airport-Santragachhi and New Town-Joka  and to Siliguri, Puri, Ranchi and Digha.        
	The workers alleged that most of the buses did not have papers in order and traffic sergeants would often punch the licences of the drivers.         
	The licences of 20 of our drivers were seized recently after police increased vigilance on VIP Road. Our drivers refused to drive buses that did not have papers in order out of fear. The company, instead of trying to ready the papers, decided to discontinue services from today, said Soumendra Burman, the secretary of the Pirojiwal Infrastructure Limited Whiteliners Employees Union.         
	Only 30 of the 51 buses had route permits and of these, only four had all the necessary papers like insurance and tax documents and pollution certificates, he alleged.         
	The drivers and conductors who reported for work at the fleets Salt Lake depot, near the Wipro intersection, on Wednesday morning were greeted by a suspension of work notice. They found that more than 25 buses that were in running condition had been removed overnight by the company.         
	The workers union president, Ashim Gupta, also alleged that the 300 employees of the whiteliner service did not receive their salary for June.         
	Ritesh Pirojiwal, the managing director of the franchisee, and CEO Barin Basu did not answer Metros calls and text messages throughout Wednesday.

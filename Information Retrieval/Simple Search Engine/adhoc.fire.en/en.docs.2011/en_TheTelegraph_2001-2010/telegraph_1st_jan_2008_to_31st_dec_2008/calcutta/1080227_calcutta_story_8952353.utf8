     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Government Railway Police (GRP) has not yet recovered the handbag snatched from minister Bilashibala Sahish at Howrah station on Monday morning. 
    
	The GRP had held 25-year-old Sonu Kumar Shaw from a slum in Bantra, Howrah, for the crime and claimed to have recovered Rs 2,900 from him.
    
	Additional public prosecutor Samir Kumar Dey, however, said on Tuesday: No recovery has been made by the GRP. If they had recovered anything from the accused, they would have mentioned it in the case diary. The chief judicial magistrate of Howrah remanded Shaw in police custody for three days.
    
	He allegedly snatched the bag  containing two cellphones, Rs 4,000 and four diaries  through a window of the Chakradharpur Express as the train pulled into the station.

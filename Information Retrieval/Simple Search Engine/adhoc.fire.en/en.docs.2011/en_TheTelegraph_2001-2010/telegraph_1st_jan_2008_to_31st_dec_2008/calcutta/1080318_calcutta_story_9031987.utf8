                The body of a contractors labourer working in Rajasthan was brought to Calcutta on Monday under mysterious circumstances. Kamalesh Tiwary, 32, of Prince Anwar Shah Road, had gone to Rajasthan in February. On March 15, his brother Nikhilesh received a call from Rajasthan that Kamalesh was seriously ill. He left with his brother the next day. Kamaleshs father Raghunath on Monday received an anonymous call asking him to receive Kamaleshs body in front of MR Bangur Hospital. Raghunath contacted Jadavpur police station. Four persons were found in front of the hospital with the body. The body has been sent for post-mortem and the four persons are being interrogated, said Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). Police have informed Kamaleshs wife, who stays in Bihar with her two sons.    A Calcutta-Lucknow Jetlite flight via Patna returned to the city after developing a snag in mid-air on Monday morning.

The pickpocket slashed Reyaz Khans face with a razor when Khan tried to pull him off the bus. The cop was given first-aid.     An international project on power reforms and consumer rights was launched in Calcutta recently by consumer interest organisation CUTS. According to a CUTS study, only 208 consumers of the total strength of nearly 21 lakh in Calcutta have complained to the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission between 2004 to 2006 for various grievances, highlighting lack of awareness of the consumers about their rights. The three-year project will be simultaneously executed in India (West Bengal and Rajasthan), Bangladesh and Nepal. It will be funded by Norwegian funding agency NORAD.    Mohan, 58, was knocked down by an unidentified vehicle on Strand Road early on Monday. Police said the man, a resident of Paharpur, in the port area, was rushed to Medical College and Hospital. The vehicle is yet to be traced.    Three persons were injured when a speeding Tata 407, loaded with fish, overturned near JK Island Bridge after the driver lost control of the vehicle.

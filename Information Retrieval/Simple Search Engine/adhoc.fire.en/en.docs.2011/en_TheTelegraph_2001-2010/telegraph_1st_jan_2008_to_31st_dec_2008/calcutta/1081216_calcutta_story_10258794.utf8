          ONTHESPOT - RAJAPUR CANAL                            The canal running through Purba Rajapur that was cleaned in June has returned to its filthy state in six months and (above) a makeshift structure on the canal used as a toilet.

	The civic body often cites lack of funds for not undertaking development projects. But what if the authorities spend lakhs to clean a canal only to see it return to its earlier state in six months?        
	The canal that bifurcates wards 109 and 103 of Purba Rajapur, behind the highrise buildings of Udita, Udayan and Hiland Park, was cleaned in June but by December, it had returned to its old state. And this because of the flawed plan of the civic authorities and callousness on part of residents of the area.         
	The stretch of the canal, from Jadavpur railway station in the west and from Bagha Jatin railway station in the south to Jora Bridge in the north, was cleaned in June under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP). The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was its implementing agency.        
	Six months later, the canal has reverted to its original state. Plastic items, waste, dried flowers and bamboo frames float on the water. Weeds dot both sides of the canal.        
	What kind of cleaning had the CMC done that weeds grew back in just six months? asked a resident of Purba Rajapur.        
	The muck dredged from the canal was dumped on its two sides. The authorities didnt remove the mud. When the rains came, all the dug-out filth was drained back into the canal, said Banani Sengupta, a resident of the area.         
	Several tiny wooden structures have come up along the banks of the canal. These structures have been built by slum dwellers for urinating and defecating in the canal. The water thus gets polluted and stinks, said Buddhadeb Guha, another resident.        
	The level of silt in the canal is rising as the soil dug up for an underground sewage project by CEIP is being dumped in the water.         
	Local residents are also to blame. Household garbage is thrown into the canal with impunity, said Timir Sankar Basu, who stays near Bagha Jatin railway station.        
	Residents complained that workers at two ceremony houses on the eastern side of the canal often dump garbage in the water.        
	An unclean canal with floating waste is a health hazard.                  
	Those who live in buildings facing the canal have to withstand the stench 24x7. We have become habituated but visitors often complain, added Basu.        
	The filthy water is also a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Mosquito larvae can be spotted on the stagnant water.        
	You cant stand for a minute near the canal without being engulfed by droves of mosquitoes, said Guha.              
	Councillorspeak We sprayed mosquito repellents in the canal as well as near the weeds, said Samarendra Roy, the chairman of borough XII and the CPM councillor of ward 109.         
	The CEIP has dug up roads to install 14ft wide underground sewage pipes on both sides of the canal. These lines will carry polluted water from other areas. The canal will remain clean and carry only rainwater. They are keeping the dug-up earth on the sides of the canal. But the piled-up earth often falls into the canal and chokes it. Ideally, this work should have been done before the canal was cleaned, said the CPM councillor of ward 103, Subrata Dasgupta.        
	We met CEIP officials at the local borough office on December 10. We have requested them to clean the canal once more. They should level the two sides of the canal and plant saplings so that the slush doesnt fall into the water. The trees will also act as a barricade, stopping residents from throwing waste into the water, added Dasgupta.              
	CEIPspeak We have plans to create gardens on both sides of the canal. This will stop encroachment of the banks. We have floated a tender for the work. We also promise to remove the soil that has fallen into the canal, said Soumya Ganguly, the director-general (project) of the CEIP.                    SUBHAJOY ROY

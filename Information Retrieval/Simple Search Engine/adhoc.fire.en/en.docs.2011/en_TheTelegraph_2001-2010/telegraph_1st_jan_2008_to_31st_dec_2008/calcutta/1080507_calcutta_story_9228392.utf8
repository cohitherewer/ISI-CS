                      Epic in folk style                    A research-based performance applying different forms of folk theatre of our country, Bharat Katha narrates an episode from the epic, The Mahabharata. Exploring the native, rich and dynamic energy of folk forms, it includes elements of Indian classical music, embedding it with folk music and dance forms like pandavani, jhumur and chhau. Apart from the core cast, a group of chhau dancers from a remote village of Purulia also features in this evenings production. The action of the play revolves around the incidents of the battle of Kurukshetra, when Abhimanyu boldly ventures to penetrate the dangerous, enigmatic chakravyuh. Once within it, he bravely fights great Kaurava warriors, but Arjunas young son is tragically killed by the Kauravas. Participants of the production have been trained in folk forms by Teejan Bai and by Amulya Kumar, a jhumur singer of Purulia. Concept and design: Manish Mitra.

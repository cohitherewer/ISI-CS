The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nata Mano to Miracurall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nata Mano to Miracurall
  - A pandal that Mamata should avoid and one that Buddha might want to visit                            BENGALS NANO: At Santosh Mitra Square, the pitch for industrialisation and lament for the loss of the Tatas are the loudest. The pandal resembles two factories, one small and one big, with a giant lock depicting a state of lockout. But the Nata Mano in the foreground is the top draw for pandal-hoppers local and global. The Nano prototype in yellow, 10ft long, 5ft wide and 5ft high, sums up the theme of we want industry to flourish in Bengal at this 73-year-old puja in Sealdah. Something tells us Mamata Banerjee will not be visiting this puja.

Hand in hand we stand is the spirit of Rajpur 11 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab, next to Narendrapur. Spread over three bighas, with a budget of 
  Rs 2 lakh, this puja revolves around the theme of ldquo;agriculture and industry flourishing side-by-side rdquo;. The organisers of this nine-year-old puja are ldquo;not trying to send any political message rdquo; but they do want people to ldquo;pause and ponder rdquo; about the co-existence of the   twin engines of growth. If only hellip; Picture by Pabitra Das              BENGAL SHINING: Trust finance minister Ashim Dasgupta rsquo;s para puja to dig out something economic to crow about, albeit from 11 centuries ago. The FE Block puja in Salt Lake showcases a glorious phase of Bengal ldquo;when trading with Malay, Ceylon and Rome was at its peak under the Pala dynasty rdquo;. A light-and-sound show on the importance of industry in today rsquo;s Bengal has also been put together. The initial plan of the Tata plant in Singur as pandal was shelved but the motto remains industrialisation for progress at this 24-year-old puja with a budget of Rs 11 lakh. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha  MIRACLE MAN: What does Bengal need now? Miracurall (the magic potion for all ills) and Annihilin (a gun that can destroy all evil). And where can they be found? At the Tarun Sathi Club puja in Sulekha, Jadavpur, where Professor Shanku is busy at work.   The pandal here is the laboratory of Satyajit Ray rsquo;s favourite scientist, complete with a microscope, a robot and more. In its 28th year this puja aims ldquo;to give pleasure to children rdquo;, but something tells us chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would love to get his hands on some Miracurall and maybe even Annihilin.

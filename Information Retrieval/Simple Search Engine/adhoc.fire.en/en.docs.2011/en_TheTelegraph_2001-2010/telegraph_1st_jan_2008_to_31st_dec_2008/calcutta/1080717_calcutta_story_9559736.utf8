          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	The state government will spend Rs 20 crore more for the upgrade of Medical College and Hospital (picture left) to the standard of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said in the Assembly on Wednesday.        
	The rise in the cost of building material has compelled the government to sanction an additional Rs 20 crore for the upgrade.        
	It is not possible to upgrade the hospital with the budget of Rs 120 crore. We have sanctioned an additional Rs 20 crore following the escalation in the cost of building material. The extra money will be borne by the state, Mishra said.        
	Of the earlier budget of Rs 120 crore, the state was to cough up Rs 20 crore and the rest was the Centres share. Now, the states share has gone up to Rs 40 crore.        
	Mishra said it was not possible for the state to set up medical college and hospital of the status of AIIMS, as that would have required an investment of Rs 1,500 crore. So, the state, for now, has settled for an upgrade of Medical College and Hospital.        
	Post-revamp, the minister said, there will be a new outdoor and an administrative building on the campus. The present outdoor building will be converted into a nine-storeyed structure which will offer multi-storeyed services. We hope to finish the work within two years, the minister informed.        
	The minister said the high court would appoint two judges to decide on the admission formalities and the fee structure of private medical colleges, one of which is coming up in Jadavpur.         
	Of the 150 postgraduate seats at the Jadavpur hospital, we have asked them to give 56 seats to the state, he said. Students who will qualify the JEE will be admitted to the seats.

  - Travel agent disappears with Rs 2 lakh and promise of Bhutan holiday          A STAFF REPORTER                          The travel agents office in Ballygunge Place. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	The Duttas were set to usher in the New Year in the hills and valleys of Bhutan. The travel agent was arranging everything  from air tickets to hotel bookings and local tours. Only the date when the family would fly out needed to be finalised.        
	It never was. The travel agent kept pushing back the departure from December 20, until he himself disappeared on December 31. Rattled, Sujit Dutta, a resident of Ballygunge Circular Road, called up the hotel in Bhutan where he was supposed to have put up with his family and found that no booking had been made.        
	Based on Duttas complaint, Shibaprasad Roy Chowdhury was picked up from his home-cum-office in Ballygunge Place around 10pm on Tuesday. The man, in his mid-40s, had allegedly cheated two other families by making false promises of organising a luxury vacation in Bhutan.        
	The three families had paid over Rs 2 lakh to Roy Chowdhury for the tours, according to police. A poster put up outside the Ballygunge Place house, where Roy Chowdhury lived and ran a consultancy firm, had lured the people. He had promised to deliver all the travel documents to the homes of his customers, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.         
	While Dutta lodged a complaint with Gariahat police station, the other two families are yet to approach the cops.         
	I did not have the slightest suspicion that I was being duped. I made all the arrangements for the vacation and was waiting for the tickets to arrive, Dutta told the police.        
	According to his statement, he started harbouring doubts when the holiday dates were first postponed from December 20. Roy Chowdhury told me that he would inform me about the dates in a couple of days. But he did not contact me for the next four days, Dutta stated.        
	The businessman visited the Ballygunge Place office, only to be told that the tickets and other documents would be handed over in another two days. However, Roy Chowdhury again went incommunicado.        
	He was produced in Alipore court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody.

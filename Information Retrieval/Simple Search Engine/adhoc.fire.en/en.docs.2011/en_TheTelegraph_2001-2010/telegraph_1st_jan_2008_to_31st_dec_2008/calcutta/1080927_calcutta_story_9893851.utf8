          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested on Thursday night for allegedly abducting a youth and beating him up at the behest of his girlfriend.         
	Police said the incident was the fallout of a dispute between Asif Ahmed, in his mid-20s, and Rima Agarwal, 20. A complaint has also been lodged against Rima.        
	A senior police officer said Asif and Rima spent two hours together on Thursday afternoon. Asif, a relationship manager of an insurance firm where Rima also works, left after she boarded a bus from Park Circus, he said.        
	A little later, Rima called up Asif and asked him to come to CIT Road near Philips More, feigning sickness.        
	When Asif reached the spot, the three men dragged him into a taxi. Residents called the police and gave them the taxi number. Cops located the vehicle near Narkeldanga railway bridge and arrested them.        
	Rima wanted to break up with Asif, but he wasnt willing to leave her. So she decided to teach him a lesson and contacted her neighbour and his two friends, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nandigram nets gunrunner
                                                                                                               Nandigram nets gunrunner
  - Arms smuggler supplied more than 7000 guns in city          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Tapan Sahas desperation to spread his arms network to Nandigram lured him into the CID trap on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The 37-year-old gunrunner was arrested as soon as he turned up at a designated spot on EM Bypass, in Tiljala, with a consignment of arms. The sleuths, posing as Nandigram residents eager to buy arms, had asked Saha to come over with the consignment.        
	Saha, involved in arms smuggling for the past 15 years, has been desperately looking for a contact in Nandigram. When we approached him as customers from the trouble-torn area, he agreed instantly, said an officer of the CIDs Special Operations Group (SOG), the wing that netted the arms dealer.        
	It was around 12.30pm when Saha arrived with four pistols tucked in his waist and a hand-bag containing the other arms and ammunition.        
	We appeared in front of him and asked whether the consignment was ready. The moment he said yes, we pinned him down, said a sleuth.        
	Seven pistols, a revolver and 150 rounds of cartridges of various bores were seized from him.        
	Saha, a resident of Habra, in North 24-Parganas, reportedly told the sleuths that he had supplied more than 7,000 firearms to gangsters in the city and its adjacent areas.        
	He also revealed the names of the gangsters who had bought arms from him. Searching our records, we have come to know that around 150 people were killed in and around the city with weapons supplied by Saha in the past five years, said an officer.        
	Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector-general (operations) of the CID, said: Saha would often visit Munger to buy the arms. According to an SOG official, the gunrunner frequently organised free servicing camps in various hideouts. The gun manufacturers from Munger attended the camps where Sahas clients would come if their firearms malfunctioned.        
	Saha came in touch with arms dealers in Munger while working as a satta bookie 15 years ago. I then decided to switch trades and take to arms smuggling, an officer quoted Saha as having said.        
	From then on, he would keep a tab on gang rivalry in the city and its adjacent areas. He would contact the gang members personally and supply them arms and ammunition.        
	He also told us that whenever there was a murder, he would immediately contact the associates of the victim. He knew that at least in some cases, the associates would plan a revenge killing, the officer added.

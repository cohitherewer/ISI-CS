          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 75-year-old man who had suffered a stroke died at SSKM Hospital on Saturday night allegedly while two doctors of different wards argued over his admission.         
	Sanjib Bose, a retired state government employee and a resident of Alipore Road, was brought to SSKM Hospital around 9.45pm.        
	Rupam Chakraborty, a doctor in the emergency ward informed Boses family members that there was no vacant bed. But after conducting a CT scan, which showed severe brain haemorrhage, he referred Bose to SSKMs Mackenzie ward around 10pm.        
	If you try to take him to another hospital, he would die on the way, the doctor reportedly told the relatives.         
	A junior doctor and the nurse-in-charge at the Mackenzie ward allegedly refused to attend to the patient. Let the patient fall down from the trolley and die. We cannot do anything, the family members quoted the nurse-in-charge as saying.        
	The two allegedly argued with Chakraborty over admitting Bose to the ward. The junior doctor even called up senior officials, to complain about the referral.         
	After Bose died at 10.40pm, his family members were allegedly asked to fill up an admission form if they wanted a death certificate. The ward doctor entered the time of death as 11.40pm but we did not object, said Swati Ghosh, Boses sister-in-law.         
	When the family members went to Bhowanipore police station, an officer asked them to lodge a complaint with the health department, said Boses nephew Dipankar Roy.        
	Ashok Ghosh, the medical superintendent of SSKM, said the patient died while being transferred to the ward. He was brought in a moribund condition but the doctor and nurses on duty had examined him. There was an argument regarding the patients admission but the emergency doctor was right in transferring the patient to the ward.        
	Chakraborty was not available for comment.         
	Ghosh also said that admission to hospital was restricted as the authorities were trying to keep beds free following blasts in various parts of the country. But there is no problem in accommodating a patient, added the superintendent.

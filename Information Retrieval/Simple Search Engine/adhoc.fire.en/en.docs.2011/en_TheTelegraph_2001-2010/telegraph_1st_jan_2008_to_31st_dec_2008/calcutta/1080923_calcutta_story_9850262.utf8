The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Decibel devil in study zone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Decibel devil in study zone
          RITH BASU                          Only the dog seems to be paying attention to the words written on Chittaranjan Avenue. Constant honking by drivers on the stretch disturbs patients in Medical College and Hospital and students in educational institutions in the area                                  
	An orchestra of air horns, loudspeakers blaring at street-corners, the growl of engines and slogans from passing processions often drown the voices of teachers in classrooms on either side of College Street.         
	Microphones have been installed in the English department classrooms of Calcutta University (CU) but students still fail to decipher what the professors say because of soaring decibel levels on and off the campus.        
	Students and teachers of Presidency College, Medical College and Hospital, Sanskrit College, Hare School, Hindu School and some other educational institutions in the area face similar problems.        
	But a 100-metre radius around each campus is supposed to be a silence zone under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and the Noise (Pollution and Control) Rules, 2000, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the member secretary of the state noise pollution monitoring committee. The rules are seldom followed.         
	In civilised societies, people dont honk near educational institutions and hospitals. But on Colootola Street, which separates the medical college from Calcutta University, drivers flout the norm even though it is a one-way stretch, said Chinmoy Guha, who teaches English at the university.         
	It was the same in the 1970s when I was student. There have been numerous protests but police have not been able to make this a no-horn zone, added Guha, who asks students to shut the windows immediately after entering a class.        
	College Street being a hotbed of political protests does not help. Loudspeakers are regularly used at meetings and demonstrations without a thought being spared for students writing exams and patients fighting for life barely yards away.         
	There was an AIDSO meeting, a demonstration to protest infiltration through the Bangladesh border and a programme by Forward Bloc on the past three days, Vivek Mukherjee, a CU student, told Metro last week.        
	Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of Presidency College, said: There is some meeting or the other every day and loudspeakers are inevitably used. We have sent proposals to the public works department to make some of our classrooms soundproof.        
	Processions by students unions on the CU corridors add to the din.         
	At Xaviers, we werent even allowed to walk down the corridor if classes were on. At the university, SFI and AIDSO supporters march down the corridor shouting slogans when professors are trying to teach, said an MA first-year student who did her graduation from the Park Street college.        
	The situation is worst during power cuts, which render the classroom microphones useless and make it difficult to keep the windows shut.         
	Arghya Basu, a junior doctor at Medical College, said the noise disturbs patients wheeled into the emergency department. The decibel level also inconveniences patients in the cardiology department, which overlooks College Street.        
	According to doctors, constant exposure to loud noise causes irritability and palpitation and diminishes hearing ability.

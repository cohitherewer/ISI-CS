                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nano poems on a nano phone

	Kapil Sibal, the poet, was in town for the Calcutta promotions of his book I Witness: Partial Observations. The Union minister of science and technology loves reciting his poetry, which he punches out on his switched-off cellphone whenever he flies. And hes a frequent flier.         
	Is his poetry a refuge, then, from both science and technology? There are these long hours on air when I put my cellphone on off-mode and write poetry. These are random thoughts, musings that I like to put in rhythm and rhyme.         
	While Sibal is by no means a first-time author, having written on law and the Constitution before, he is definitely a first-time poet. I would compose these poems and show them to my family  they would encourage me to publish them. But I knew they were not being just kind because they warned me that some of them might upset a few people. Then I read them out to a group of friends, who advised me to get them in print, said Sibal.         
	His publisher Pramod Kapoor of Roli Books probably had more faith in his potential when he decided to publish his poems. Kapil comes from the constituency of Mirza Ghalib, he said and warned the audience that he composes verse even while he reads them out.         
	Launched at Raj Bhavan by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, on Friday, parts of I Witness were read out at the launch and also at Oxford Bookstore in the afternoon. Sibals favourite among them was one on Nano that he read on both occasions:         
	Nano tubes
  in nano pores
  Nano thoughts
  of nano brains
  A plethora of
  nano claims
  Nano meters,
  nano miles,
  Nano cars
  in nano style
  Nano solutions
  here to stay,
  living our lives,
  the nano way.           
	Moms the word  
	Friday evening at Starmark was for mothers, by mothers and of mothers. It was the launch of Janani: Mothers, Daughters, Motherhood, a compilation of essays edited by Rinki Bhattacharya .         
	As panelist Mandira Sen said: What is a woman outside motherhood in a conservative society like ours? She reminded the audience of an old joke, according to which all sons think their mothers are virgins and all mothers think their sons are Jesus Christ.         
	Janani defines motherhood unconventionally  its is not just about women who have given birth, but also about those who have adopted their children, who chose not to conceive and those who have gone through abortion. The stories are autobiographical accounts by women who are authors, artists and academicians. Maitreyee Chatterjees My Mother, My Daughter is rather poignant.         
	Nabaneeta Dev Sens piece, along with Kamala Dass short tale (she became a mother at 16), on being mothers and daughters are inspiring.         
	Long live mothers and daughters. Let the words flow!

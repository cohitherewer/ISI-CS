          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The sting toll this season rose to 20 on Wednesday as vector panic gripped two medical colleges in the city.         
	Seven students at SSKM Hospital are suffering from mosquito-borne diseases, including three from malaria. There were also reports of a number of students and nurses of Medical College and Hospital suffering from similar ailments.         
	Rafik Mullick, an employee of a garment shop on Collin Street, died of malignant malaria at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital early on Wednesday.         
	The 27-year-old resident of Arambagh had been working in the shop for the past three years.        
	He had been running a temperature since he left for home on October 29. At Arambagh, he was diagnosed with malignant malaria and admitted to a nursing home. But as his condition deteriorated on Tuesday, family members shifted him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said Rafiks employer Fakir Mondal.         
	At SSKM, the authorities confirmed that some students were suffering from vector-borne diseases but refused to give any figures.         
	Sources, however, said three MBBS students were diagnosed with malaria on Wednesday while four others were suffering from an unknown fever.         
	Those who tested positive for malaria at SSKM are Abdur Rauf, Minajuddin Siraj and Subhasis Bhakta.         
	Subhasis and Sabyasachi Sen, who is suffering from an unknown fever, have been admitted to hospital. Abdur and Minajuddin are staying at hostels on the hospital premises as their exams are on, said Gauranga Pramanik, a fourth-year student.         
	The hostels, not cleaned for the past six months, are ideal for mosquito breeding, alleged Amit Bhabal, a fourth-year student.         
	Officials, however, denied the charge. We are regularly cleaning the hostels and spraying insecticides. All steps are being taken to prevent any outbreak, said a hospital official.        
	SSKM houses a 24-hour malaria clinic named after Sir Ronald Ross, who had discovered the malaria parasite in 1897.         
	At Medical College and Hospital, several junior doctors and nurses are suffering from mosquito-borne diseases.         
	Blood samples of the affected persons have been sent to the health department for tests. We have started clean-up operations and the situation is under control, said an official.

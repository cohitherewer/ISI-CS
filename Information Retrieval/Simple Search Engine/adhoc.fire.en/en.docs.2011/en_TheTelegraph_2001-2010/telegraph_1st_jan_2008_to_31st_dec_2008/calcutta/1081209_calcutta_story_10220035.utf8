The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Battle-ready, but bitter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Battle-ready, but bitter
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Pijush Kanti Bhattacharya recounts the encounter with militants in 1997. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Pijush Kanti Bhattacharya still wears his hair short. It is perhaps one way of reminding himself that he remains a soldier.        
	If they ask me to go and fight militants in an insurgency-prone area today, then let them hand me a weapon. I am ready, he told Metro, sitting on the steps of his house in Adi Kasempur village of Barasat, 45 km from Calcutta.         
	The bitterness in the 41-year-old former BSF jawans voice was hard to miss. I have a deep dislike for politicians, bureaucrats and the BSF top brass for neglecting the sacrifices of brave soldiers, he said.        
	Bhattacharya took five bullets in his body during an encounter with militants in Manipur in 1997 and was discharged from the paramilitary force in 2005 after being declared disabled.         
	The former soldier, who lives with a bullet embedded in his spinal cord, last drew a salary of Rs 8,200 but now has to make do with a meagre pension of Rs 1,913, the amount a regular BSF pensioner of his rank gets. A soldier injured in the line of duty is supposed to be paid half of his last salary plus Rs 400 every month.        
	Calcutta High Court last week asked the BSF to review Bhattacharyas pension according to the law.        
	A narrow, unpaved path off Krishnagar Road leads to Bhattacharyas small, single-storey home. The house is in need of a coat of paint, but money is hard to come by. I have a mother in her seventies, a wife and a school-going son to feed. But rather than providing for them, I am dependent on others, he said.        
	He smiles only when he talks about his days as a soldier. Bhattacharya always wanted to do something for the country and dreamt of being a man in uniform. He served in strife-torn Kashmir and Punjab before being transferred to Manipur.        
	On May 21, 1997, Bhattacharya, then attached to the BSFs 55th Battalion, was critically wounded in an ambush by militants at Wangjing, in Thoubal district of Manipur. He was in a jeep leading three other vehicles transporting government dispatches, rations and supplies from Imphal to their camp in Pallel.         
	We saw the militants  about a dozen of them  in BSF uniform and thought they were our men. So we proceeded down the serpentine road, Bhattacharya recalled.        
	A truck had been parked on the side of the road, narrowing the passage. A little ahead, the road was blocked with vehicles, rocks and tree trunks.        
	Suddenly, five bullets hit my body in rapid succession  one on the left side of my chest, one near my hip and another on my left leg, while two penetrated to the back of my waist, he said.        
	He felt no pain but could feel blood oozing out of his body as he collapsed. He regained consciousness four hours later after surgery in a military hospital, with two bullets still lodged in his body.         
	I enquired about my colleagues, and was told that I was the sole survivor, Bhattacharya recalled. There were 12 jawans in the convoy.        
	Bhattacharya worked as a clerk in various BSF camps after coming out of hospital but the bullet that remained in his body kept troubling him. In 2005, he was discharged from service after being declared disabled. It was a bolt from the blue.         
	Bhattacharya admits he is a shadow of his former self, although his upright five feet, 10-inch frame belies it. My body would hurt terribly but I have grown used to the pain, he said.        
	Since 2005, he has been regularly meeting the BSF authorities in Madhyamgram, his final place of posting, to get his dues, only to be told that everything is in the hands of the central government.        
	The wait for justice continues.

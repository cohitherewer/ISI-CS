The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Complaints draw cop censure
                                                                                                               Complaints draw cop censure
  - Lalbazar grievance cell cracks whip against seven policemen          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                    
	Complaints lodged with the police grievance cell at Lalbazar have resulted in censure for four sub-inspectors and departmental proceedings against three other officers.        
	We started an investigation after getting complaints against the policemen. Four of them have been censured, while departmental proceedings are on against three on the charge of misconduct, S.N Sarkar, the additional commissioner (I), told Metro.        
	This is the first time action has been taken against policemen following complaints lodged with the grievance cell, he added, refusing to identify the cops in the dock.         
	Sarkar, the chief vigilance officer of Calcutta police, supervises the functioning of the cell. He said several other complaints are being looked into.         
	The message to policemen is loud and clear: Be respectful to those who visit police stations to lodge complaints, or else strict action will be taken.        
	The grievance cell was inaugurated by city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti in November last year. Complaints have poured in not only against policemen but also regarding matters like landlord-tenant disputes. We only act on complaints involving policemen. Landlord-tenant disputes are beyond our jurisdiction, said Sarkar.        
	The grievance cell is located on the third floor of the main building at Lalbazar, which houses the offices of Chakrabarti and other senior officers.         
	An officer said every complaint is looked into and the complainant is informed about the progress in the case.        
	The cell is a blessing in disguise for policemen. Now that they know they are under the scanner, they will be forced to perform their duty, he said.        
	He cited the example of a primary school teacher who had approached the grievance cell after being allegedly harassed at Taltala police station when he went there to lodge a complaint. An inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

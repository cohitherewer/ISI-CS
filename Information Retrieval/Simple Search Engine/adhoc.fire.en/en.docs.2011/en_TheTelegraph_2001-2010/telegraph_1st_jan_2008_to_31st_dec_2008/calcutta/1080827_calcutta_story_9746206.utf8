	Our mayor is more interested in attending social dos than solving civic problems like waterlogging. He seems unable to comprehend that Calcuttans are facing severe problems because of the inefficiency of the civic body.                                                   
	lApropos the report Morning jolt to traffic guard, July 12, an unauthorised taxi stand is thriving at South Sinthee bus stop on BT Road under the banner of Citu as a result of what I suspect is an unholy alliance between the union and Shyambazar Traffic Guard.           
	Musclemen of the union often humiliate and harass passengers at the bus stop, forcing them to stand on the carriageway, amid heavy traffic. Crossing the road at this point has become nearly impossible. With street lights missing, the situation becomes more dangerous after sunset.           
	The taxi stand has been there for several years now. Officers of the traffic guard have been, if not an underhand partner in the venture, mute spectators to the reckless violation of rights of citizens.           
	Calcutta police has simply ignored the high court rulings stating that footpaths and thoroughfares on important roads, especially near important crossings, must be kept free of encroachment. When will the force dare to stand up for the common man?

	Tinted vision: The photograph of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya wearing 3D glasses was amusing (Aliens and 3D effect, July 15). One hopes he can see the plight of Calcuttans due to potholed, waterlogged roads and overflowing garbage vats in 3D.

	Our mayor is more interested in attending social dos than solving civic problems like waterlogging. He seems unable to comprehend that Calcuttans are 
  facing severe problems because of the inefficiency 
  of the civic body.

	Our chief minister said in the Assembly that the launch of Nano would not add to traffic woes because the East West Metro will reduce the additional vehicular load (CM allays Nano traffic fear, July 11). Empirically, it is the other way round. Nano is slated to hit the road in October but the East-West Metro will not materialise, by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees own admission, before 2014. Will the Nanos fly for these six years?           
	Following the recent increase in fuel prices, the state government reduced the sales tax on petrol to subsidise the unaffordable luxury of a handful of car-owners but did nothing to reduce the burden on LPG consumers, who are far greater in number.           
	Subsidy on petrol is subsidy on traffic congestion and pollution. Artificially lowered petrol price encourages people to avoid public transport. The state government should pass on the tax rebate on petrol to LPG users.

	The East-West Metro and an elevated train service from Joka to Sodepur are the need of the hour. Traffic snarls, potholes and waterlogging have currently made commuting in the city an agony. If comfortable train services are available from Howrah to Salt Lake and Joka to Sodepur, people will be willing to forego even the Nano.

	Apropos the report Teen wins modelling contract, but loses seat in school, July 14, the refusal by the principal of Alipore Multipurpose Government Girls School to admit Sampurna Lahiri to Class XI on the ground that she is a model shows some teachers are clinging to outdated values in the name of morality. Sananda Tillottama is a prestigious contest and if a student has done well in it, the school should be proud of her. It is difficult to fathom how the concentration of Sampurnas classmates will be affected if she models after school hours. Moreover, in this case, the girls father is a film-maker and she has already acted in films. Its sad that such a stand was taken when we teachers constantly talk of boosting a childs creativity, talent and originality.             
	Basudeb Bhattacharya,
  director, Angel Education Society           
	The principals stand regarding Sampurna Lahiris admission is bewildering to say the least. The fear that her admission in school will spoil the homely environment and disturb the concentration of the other pupils is baseless. Such a statement betrays the principals poor administrative acumen. She should be proud to have Sampurna in school.           
	Santosh Chakravarty, 
  Unique Park, Behala           
	Congratulations to the authorities of Alipore Multipurpose Government Girls School for taking the bold step of denying admission to a student who wishes to pursue a career in modelling and related activities. All educational institutions should discourage youngsters from pursuing professions that promote the worst of western culture.

	Wealth wait: Apropos the report ldquo;Coin count continues rdquo;, July 9, it is wonderful that Lakshmi Das despite being a beggar had the sense to save for old age. In this age of credit cards and conspicuous consumption, the youth should learn the importance of saving from her.   
	 G. Rathi,
  Salt Lake          
	Apropos the report Cancer patient dies after wrong injection, July 10, I am shocked by the death of Kuntal Chowdhury. The anaesthetist who administered a chemotherapy injection into his spinal cord instead of vein should be banned from practising medicine so that other doctors do not dare to be negligent like him. Unfortunately, the medical council only wastes time without taking any action.             
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee, 
  Konnagar, Hooghly                   
	Apropos the report Bus with student slips, July 4, bus accidents have become the most common form of road mishap. It is surprising that school buses are plying without regular maintenance. Helpless children are suffering because of negligence on the part of bus-owners and schools.

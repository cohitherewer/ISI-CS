                      Boy who would not be a hero                    Children are the future of our society and need to be nurtured with care so that they grow up to be its responsible, worthy citizens. Unfortunately, they have become victims of a terrible, mindless competition which is supposed to ensure their success once they grow up. Thus they are deprived of their childhood realm of imagination, music, magic and delight, a world which is rightfully theirs. To mark Childrens Day, Blank Verses latest play Kanaichand Palowan attempts to address this crisis of society in a humorous manner; delivering an important message and, at the same time, bringing smiles on the audiences faces. Staged by children who play the role of adults and adults playing the role of children, the performance takes the form of traditional folk theatre, with a choric character narrating the sequence of events as they are enacted. The story follows the life of Kanai, a teenager who loves to play football and does not pay attention to his studies. He is compelled to fulfil his parents ambition of being a social success, with fatal consequences. As his shocked parents realise their serious mistake, it becomes clear that they both had a nightmare. Kanai re-enters the stage and the drama ends on a happy note, but the disturbing questions raised by it are left very much alive. Drama and direction: Raja Bhattacharya.                    Event: Play in Bengali, Kanaichand Palowan, produced by Blank Verse When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police picked up three teenaged boys from Thakurpukur on Thursday following a complaint by the father of 16-year-old Riki Dasgupta, who has been missing since Wednesday night.        
	Rikis father Sitangshu Bimal Dasgupta said his son left their Banerjeepara Road home along with three of his friends in the evening. The friends returned at night but Riki could not be traced.        
	The three boys have been picked up as their statements on the whereabouts of Riki were incoherent, said D.P. Singh, the additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

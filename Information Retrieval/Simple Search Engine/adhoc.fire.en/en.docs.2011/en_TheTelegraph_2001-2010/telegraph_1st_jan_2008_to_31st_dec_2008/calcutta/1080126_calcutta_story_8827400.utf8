 - Why the chief minister is safe but Writers Buildings is not
     A STAFF REPORTER
             Writers Buildings: Who goes there? A Telegraph picture
                    
	Over 250 policemen guard the seat of power in West Bengal, but still, Haripada Jana  hiding a dagger  sneaked past the security ring on Thursday. The 30-year-old, from Nandakumar, in East Midnapore, could be stopped from entering Writers Buildings only because the machine did not let down the security system the way the men in uniform did. Jana was caught as the metal detector beeped. A day after Janas arrest, Metro visited Writers to run a reality check on the security system.
    
	Entry points: Apart from the central gate, meant for VIPs only, there are three entry points to the building, which has nine blocks. The chief minister and his senior cabinet colleagues have offices in the main block. While Writers staff can enter by flashing their ID cards, outsiders need a visitors slip. On an average, 15 to 20 cops guard each of the three gates. Security is tightest at the central gate, where at any time, the number of guards is not less than 50. One can make it to the metal detector only after crossing two security layers  plainclothes policemen on the pavement and armed constables at the gate.
    
	Jana had crossed the first two layers. He should have been checked before he could reach the doorframe metal detector. That the system let him reach so far was clearly a major security lapse, said a senior police officer.
    
	On Friday, Metro found that deployment at the gates had been beefed up, but the standard security processes, meant for scanning people entering the building, were not properly followed. I do not even show my card. I just say, staff and they let me in, smiled a law department clerk, adding that the cops do not even bother when vendors go in.
    
	Outside the CMs room: A sharp contrast is visible outside the chief ministers first-floor room. Gun-toting commandos and cops with walkie-talkies in the corridor paint a picture of alertness. Even standing outside the CMs room is not allowed.
    
	Conclusion: The chief minister is safe, but Writers Buildings is not. The approach is flawed It is true that security around the chief ministers room is tight, but that does not justify lax arrangements at other spots. The other blocks are not that far from the main section, pointed out a retired special branch officer.
    
	Officialspeak: We regularly assess the security measures and change as and when required, said an officer in charge of security at Writers.

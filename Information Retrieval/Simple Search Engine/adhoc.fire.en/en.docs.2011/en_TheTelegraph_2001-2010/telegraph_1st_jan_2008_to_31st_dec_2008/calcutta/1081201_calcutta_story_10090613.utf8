	The state government is planning to seek tips on preventing damage to roads due to rainwater accumulation from participants at the Indian Road Congress.        
	This years edition of the Indian Road Congress will be held in the city from December 13 to 16. More than 2,000 people, including representatives of different states and private companies, will attend the summit.        
	The latest developments on roads and traffic are discussed at the road congress. We want to know how technological advances can help us maintain roads better, said Kshiti Goswami, the state public works department (PWD) minister.        
	 The congress will help us keep abreast of the sweeping changes in the sector across the country and in the other Saarc countries. We would like to know how different agencies have been handling encroachments while building roads through densely populated areas, said PWD chief engineer (roads) Shantanu Basu Rai Chaudhury.        
	PWD officials claimed Rs 90 crore was spent every year on road repairs and the amount is not enough.        
	We have sought cabinet clearance for more road repair funds. We have to find out about the latest road repair technology because we are short of funds, said an official.        
	The summit will see discussions on repair of potholes without disrupting traffic, bituminous layering of roads and noise pollution.         
	There will be presentations on road mishaps in Rajkot and optimisation and privatisation of bus network in Vadodara.

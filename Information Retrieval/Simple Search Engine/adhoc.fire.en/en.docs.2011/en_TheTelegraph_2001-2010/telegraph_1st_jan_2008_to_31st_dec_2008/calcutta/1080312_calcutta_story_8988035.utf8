The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car companies roll out freebies
                                                                                                               Car companies roll out freebies

	Movies, rallies, games, fashion shows and free service camps are just some of the options being tried out by car companies to keep customers and their families happy.         
	According to an industry veteran, with sales volumes rising and market shares falling, companies are desperate to retain customers while attracting new ones.         
	People usually upgrade their car every four or five years. Companies are providing better service facilities and free entertainment to hold on to customers, he says.         
	We organise small dos for customers. Its our way of thanking them, says Gagandeep Singh, the zonal sales manager (east) of General Motors.        
	The company conducts customer contact programmes throughout the year. Our representatives called on the first batch of 350 Spark customers at their homes or offices to record their feedback, Singh adds.        
	The company even sets up movie and dinner dates for buyers. We invited 150 families to a show of Chak De! India at Menoka. We do such shows at least once every three months, says Singh.         
	Hyundai, too, sponsors film shows. Since we have a large number of customers, it is not possible to call on all of them. We have lucky draws or hold shows for specific groups, like separate shows for Santro owners and Verna customers, says Partha Datta of Hyundai.        
	The films for the free shows are chosen carefully. It must be a family outing, stresses Singh, because it is no longer just the breadwinner who decides which car to buy. The wife, children and the parents, too, are invited.         
	Through the winter, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Toyota organised rallies that drew participants across segments.         
	Hyundais Mile and Smile Rally for Getz, Verna and Santro buyers was flagged off from the Kasba Bypass connector in November. The cars, topped up free fuel, drove to Nicco Park. The driver with the best mileage won the first prize.        
	This way, we educate our customers on how to extract better mileage from their cars, says Datta. The rally ended with drinks, dinner and a DJ night.        
	The companies typically spend between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh for such events.        
	Getting a car serviced has also become easier, with companies organising camps and carnivals for owners. Hyundais Always Around campaign started last July. We hold service camps in housing estates where we serve breakfast and organise games for kids, says Datta. Hyundai relaunched the campaign this month.        
	Maruti organised 300-plus camps last year, says a company spokesperson from Delhi. Our technicians also visit customers and carry out repairs, he adds.        
	Besides, the company has arrangements to pick up cars of women customers and return them after servicing.        
	Ford and Toyota, on the other hand, focus on addressing customer complaints.

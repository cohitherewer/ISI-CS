The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport upgrade takes off
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airport upgrade takes off

	The much-awaited modernisation of Calcutta airport formally took off on Monday with the chief minister laying the foundation stone for an integrated terminal in the presence of civil aviation minister Praful Patel and external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The Rs 2,100-crore project of the Airports the Authority of India (AAI) is scheduled to be completed in 30 months. Preliminary work started in November.        
	We need to modernise Calcutta airport to increase its capacity, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the programme.        
	During the meeting for the 11th Five Year Plan, I had stressed improvement of the airport infrastructure. We are far behind China in terms of infrastructure, which is important to attract foreign direct investment, he added.        
	The new terminal will handle 20 million passengers, four times the combined capacity of the existing international and domestic terminals. During peak hours, the new terminal will handle over 7,500 passengers.        
	The project includes multi-level underground car parking and other passenger facilities. The secondary runway is being extended by 400 metres for the installation of the Instrument Landing System. Also on the cards is a power taxi bay which will allow Airbus 380, the worlds biggest aircraft, to land.        
	There are plans to set up a new air traffic control tower. New communication, navigation and surveillance gadgets will be installed for safer flight operations. Metro Rail is likely to be extended to the airport.        
	Asked about the proposal to build a second airport in the city, the chief minister said: I will talk (to Patel) about this later.        
	Patel, however, said a second airport in Calcutta would not be viable. The Behala airport has been upgraded and airlines can use it. But there are no takers for a second airport in the city.        
	Pranab Mukherjee said the modernisation of Calcutta airport is a big step in tune with the Centres Look East policy.

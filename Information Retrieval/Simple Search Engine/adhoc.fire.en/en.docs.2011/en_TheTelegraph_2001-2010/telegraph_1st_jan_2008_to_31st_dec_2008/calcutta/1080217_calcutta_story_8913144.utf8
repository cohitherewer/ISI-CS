	What is Calcuttas contribution to global warming? The scientists are not sure. According to them, the effect of particulates  the major pollutant in the city  on climate change is mixed.                
	Particulates do not allow sunrays to reach the surface through a phenomenon called negative radiative forcing, thus preventing a rise in temperature, says Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist of the state pollution control board.          
	But there is another school of experts which believes that the finer particulates aid global warming as they retain heat and later release it.          
	Finer particulates absorb infrared rays and subsequently release them, contributing to climate change, says environment scientist Siddhartha Dutta.          
	Calcuttas annual average of finer particulates  respirable particulate matter (RPM)  is more than 1.5 times the permissible limit and the city produces about 75,000 tonnes of such particulates every year, according to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) study in end-2005.          
	The transport sector and other dust sources are behind more than 80 per cent of the RPM burden.          
	While there is difference of opinion about the role of particulates in global warming, the harmful effects of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide on the environment are not in doubt. A huge amount of carbon gases is produced in the city every day by vehicles and factories.           
	The ADB report points out that two-stroke three-wheelers (autorickshaws) generate 43 per cent of the total carbon monoxide produced by the transport sector. The corresponding figures for buses and cars are 33 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively.          
	This, despite the number of petrol-driven cars in the city far outnumbering autorickshaws or buses.

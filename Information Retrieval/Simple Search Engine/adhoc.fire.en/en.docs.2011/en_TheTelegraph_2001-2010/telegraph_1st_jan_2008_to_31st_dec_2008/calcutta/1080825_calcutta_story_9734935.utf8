The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU cut-off on the way up
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             CU cut-off on the way up

	Only a first class or thereabouts in graduation will secure a seat in the Calcutta University MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses this year.         
	After the first phase of admission that began in early August, students scoring less than 55 per cent have not been admitted to most of the postgraduate courses, said a university official.         
	This has been the trend for the past couple of years. Last year, the cut-off dropped during the second phase of admission. That is unlikely this year with more students clearing and securing first class in BA, B.Sc and B.Com under the 1+1+1 pattern.         
	Physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, applied mathematics, radio physics, electronics and computer science and engineering are the science stream subjects most in demand. All those admitted in these subjects scored over 60 per cent in graduation.         
	Students scoring between 55 and 60 per cent have been admitted to courses in chemical technology, polymer science, biotechnology and IT. The cut-off marks in applied physics, psychology, applied chemistry, molecular biology, anthropology and physiology are also in that range.         
	Amit Roy, the secretary of the science and technology faculty, said there would have been greater demand for seats if colleges werent given permission to offer postgraduate courses.         
	Students with first class are dominating postgraduate admissions in Presidency, Lady Brabourne, Bethune and Scottish Church colleges, too.         
	The cut-off for our 30 seats in chemistry and 20 seats in botany is 59 per cent, said D. Kundu, the bursar of Scottish Church College.         
	English, Bengali, Sanskrit, political science, history and education are among the arts subjects in demand, added the official. In Sanskrit, the last seat went to a student with 58 per cent marks.         
	Not a single student scoring below 55 per cent has been admitted to masters courses in English, Bengali, Sanskrit and history, said D.P. Dey, the secretary of the arts, commerce and law faculty of the university. The cut-off so far in M.Com is 57 per cent.         
	Mathematics, economics and philosophy are the only subjects where students with about 50 per cent have been admitted.

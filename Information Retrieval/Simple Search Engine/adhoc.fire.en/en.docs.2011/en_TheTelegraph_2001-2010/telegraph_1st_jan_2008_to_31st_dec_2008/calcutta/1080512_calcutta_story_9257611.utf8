The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theres a trolley on the tarmac
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Theres a trolley on the tarmac
  - Ground vehicles break rules to block runway, put planes at risk          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	A luggage trolley crossed the path of an aircraft with over 100 people on board as it was taxiing for take-off at Calcutta airport last week.        
	Ask the vehicle to get out of my way, the shocked pilot of the Jet Airways flight told air traffic control as the plane ground to a halt.        
	He later said the brakes could be applied because the aircraft was moving at 20 kmph. If it had picked up speed, sudden braking or a change in course could have caused it to overturn.        
	Even a brush with a luggage trolley can damage a moving aircraft severely and endanger the lives of passengers, said an airport official.         
	The danger is becoming more real every day at the airport, where an increase in flights has led to congestion not only in the terminals but also on the tarmac.         
	On an average, 30 to 35 ground vehicles break rules to enter the tarmac or park in the vehicle movement area, said an airport source. The most common violation is crossing the taxiway. A disaster is waiting to happen, he added.         
	Kanu Gohen, the director-general of civil aviation, said he had received complaints about ground vehicles breaking rules at Calcutta airport. Such incidents have increased in Delhi and Mumbai airports, too. We are trying to find ways to stop such incidents.         
	The number of flights from Calcutta is increasing by 30 per cent annually. The growth is matched by a rise in the number of ground and equipment vehicles. These include the buses that carry passengers from the terminal buildings to aircraft, luggage trolleys carrying passengers luggage and unaccompanied cargo and aircraft refuelling vans.        
	The airports infrastructure has not been stepped up to support more flights. Hence, there is congestion on the tarmac, said a Kingfisher airline official.        
	The matter was recently discussed by the airports technical committee, made up of representatives of the Airports Authority of India and the Airlines Operators Committee. White lines were drawn on the tarmac to demarcate the path of ground vehicles.        
	For the past few months, drivers of ground vehicles are often crossing the line and entering the taxiway. Such incidents were rare. If the drivers are caught and fined, they say that they were trying to take short-cuts, said an official.        
	The fine is between Rs 100 and Rs 500, but there are provisions to cancel the permits of drivers  an option that has not been exercised yet in Calcutta.         
	Airlines blame the airport authorities for the incidents. Several construction projects related to the extension of the secondary runway and the strengthening of the primary runway are on. This has led to chaos, said a member of the Airlines Operators Committee.        
	The situation will improve soon  12 parking bays are being added, said a senior airport official.

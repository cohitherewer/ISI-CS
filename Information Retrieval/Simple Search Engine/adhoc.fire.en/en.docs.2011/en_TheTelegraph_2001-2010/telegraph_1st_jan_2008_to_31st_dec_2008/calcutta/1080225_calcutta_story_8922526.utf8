The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Credit card con at home
                                                                                                               Credit card con at home
  - Secret information being accessed by gang          KINSUK BASU                                                  
	A gang of con men is duping credit card-holders in their homes with sleight of hand after winning their confidence by providing confidential details.        
	The swindlers have been calling up card-holders posing as officials of the banks that issued the cards and rattling off information  such as the secret three-digit codes on the back of the cards  before offering to upgrade them.        
	If allowed to, the gang-members turn up at the home of the card-holder. After introducing themselves as the bank officials who had called up, they request permission to take a look at the card. On the pretext of checking it, they replace it with a duplicate credit card and hand it over along with a sealed envelope, which is supposed to contain the new upgraded card, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	To make the exercise look real, the men even cut up the fake card with scissors, added the officer.         
	Between last October and January, the detective department has received at least six such complaints, mostly from upmarket areas. The complainants have been cheated of Rs 75,000 to Rs 2 lakh. An organised racket is accessing confidential credit card information and using it to win the confidence of the card-owners, said an officer.        
	Krishna Kumar Das was the first to lodge a complaint about being swindled in this manner. He was defrauded of Rs 2.4 lakh, he told officers of Gariahat police station. Similar complaints followed from card-holders in New Alipore, Karaya and Ballygunge in the next few months.         
	We have held meetings with representatives of the banks and asked them to review security arrangements and inform customers about the threat, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Some private banks are sending text messages to customers to increase awareness about credit card security. Some other banks have started advertising campaigns.        
	We have stopped issuing credit cards against other cards and have stopped offering personal loans to credit card-holders to cut down the possibility of information leak. From next month, bank statements will carry instructions on credit card handling, said a senior risk management officer of a private bank.

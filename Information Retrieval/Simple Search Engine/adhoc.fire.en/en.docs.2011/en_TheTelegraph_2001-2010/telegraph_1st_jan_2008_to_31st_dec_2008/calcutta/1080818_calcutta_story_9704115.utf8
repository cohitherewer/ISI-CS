The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pavement pitch for blogger novel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pavement pitch for blogger novel
          ANASUYA BASU                           Pedestrians browse through copies of You are here at Exide crossing. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Books are out of stores and at crossroads and on pavements. No, not the second-hand ones spread out on plastic sheets in Chowringhee or Gariahat. This is the latest title from Penguin, fresh out of press and doing the rounds of streets in the hands of a group of girls and boys.         
	The young sales executives have been informing passers-by about Compulsive Confesser blogger Meenakshi Reddy Madhavans novel You are here and giving them copies to browse through and buy at the busy Exide, Gol Park and Gariahat crossings. The six to seven hours of daily road promotion will continue till early September.        
	This is the first time books are being sold directly by the publisher at street corners and pavements, said Nirmalya Roy Choudhury, the regional sales manager (east) of the Penguin Group, India. This will not disturb store sales as we are not selling in front of bookshops. We have picked spots in south Calcutta to market the book directly to readers.         
	Launched across the country, You are here is also being street sold in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Cochin, Thiruvananthapuram, Gurgaon, Pune and Ahmedabad.        
	Such direct selling is here to stay and Penguin plans to adopt the method for more of its chick-lit and mass market titles, added Roy Choudhury.        
	And what does the author feel about the strategy? This way of selling books is a little sensational but is definitely new. And why not, books are consumer goods that need to be sold aggressively, said Madhavan.         
	The bibliophile in Calcutta, however, is a little uneasy at this pavement pitch for new books.        
	I dont think this is a good idea. The publishers could make the bookshops more attractive so that readers drop in regularly and browse and buy books instead of thrusting a book under their nose on the road. Developing a healthy reading habit is in the publishers interest and only that will result in more sales for them, said Professor Sukanta Chaudhuri.         
	Those in the book trade are not complaining. It means more visibility, more awareness. It will not impact sales at stores but will bring in more readers, said Siddharth Pansari of Crossword.

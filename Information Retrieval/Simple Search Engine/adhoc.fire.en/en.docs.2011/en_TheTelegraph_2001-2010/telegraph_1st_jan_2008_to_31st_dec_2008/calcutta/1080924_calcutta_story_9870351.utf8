                      Satire strokes        An effective visual device of criticism, a caricature is a drawing that depends on disproportionate exaggeration of selective elements of a person or objects feature and the deliberate suppression of its other aspects to highlight the exaggeration. However, caricature as a means of social criticism often runs the risk of being a vehicle of propaganda. Passion Hazards, the ongoing show of Subhashis Sahas paintings and drawings, features works with a social message that deserve to be looked at as objective works of art using caricature as a critical weapon. The distinctive mark of his drawings is that he manages to make his figures resemble real characters even when he exaggerates selective physical features to a ridiculous extent for the sake of generating humour. Making statements on real-life experience, the subjects that engage his attention are the covetousness promoted by a consumerist culture and the erotic temptations provided by an expanding fashion industry. Done in acrylic and oils on canvas and in mixed media on paper, his works make light-hearted banter rather than take any mock-serious social stance.

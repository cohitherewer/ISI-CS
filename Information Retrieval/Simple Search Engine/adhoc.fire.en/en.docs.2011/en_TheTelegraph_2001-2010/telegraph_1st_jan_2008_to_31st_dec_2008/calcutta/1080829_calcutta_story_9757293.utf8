            A STAFF REPORTER                          Priyanka Prasad at Medical College and Hospital on Thursday. Picture by Pabitra Das                                              
	The question: Where is our countrys capital located?        
	The answer: A nervous stammer from 12-year-old Priyanka Prasad.        
	The consequence: Caning on her palms, followed by a smack on her ear, causing bleeding and loss of consciousness.        
	A Class V student of Metropolitan Institution (Main) for Girls in north Calcutta suffered corporal punishment at the hands of her class teacher for fumbling the answer to a question on Thursday.        
	School authorities summoned a local doctor for first-aid and Priyanka was later treated in the ENT section of the Medical College and Hospital.        
	Priyankas father Subhash Prasad, a day labourer, later lodged a complaint with both the school authorities and Amherst Street police station on the basis of his daughters statement.        
	The Prasads live on Keshab Sen Street and Priyanka has a younger brother.              
	We have started an inquiry after receiving the formal complaint and we will be interrogating the teacher, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	The incident occurred during a geography class on Tuesday morning.        
	Class teacher Diptoshree Chakrabarty was asking questions one by one. I became nervous when she looked at me. I started stammering when she asked me the question.        
	She came close to me, grabbed my ear, ordered me to put my hands on the bench and caned my palms several times. Then, she suddenly slapped me hard on my ear and everything went blank, recounted Priyanka.        
	Jaya Bhattacharya, the headmistress of Metropolitan Institution, said she came to know about the incident around 10am.        
	Priyankas classmates called me and I ran to the room. Blood was oozing from Priyankas ear. I immediately called a local doctor and alerted her parents. The girl was later taken to a hospital, said Bhattacharya.        
	The accused teacher, a resident of Behala, apparently left school around 10.30am.         
	She could not be contacted, but sources in the school said she had never thought that her slap would harm the girl and cause her serious injury.        
	I have received a complaint from Priyankas father and the matter will be placed before the managing committee of the school. It is up to them to decide what action will be initiated against the accused teacher, said the headmistress.

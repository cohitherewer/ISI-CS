	The launch of Nano would not add to traffic congestion as the East-West Metro would help reduce the load on the city streets, the chief minister said in the Assembly on Thursday.        
	Replying to Congress MLA Sudip Bandopadhyays query on whether the roll-out of the Tata small car would lead to traffic chaos, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: I am not happy with the citys traffic system but that does not mean that the launch of Nano would add to traffic problems. The Tatas told me that 75 per cent of the work at the Singur plant is over and that the car is likely to be rolled out in October.         
	Another good news is that we have got the clearance from the Centre for the East-West Metro. We have set a six-year deadline for the completion of the project. So, the burden on the city roads would be much less in days to come. The existing Metro Railway is already bearing a huge traffic load.        
	The Union Cabinet has cleared the East-West Metro that would run from Howrah to Salt Lake. The route will cover BBD Bag, Swabhumi and Salt Lake Sector V.        
	The chief minister informed the House that his government was also trying to go ahead with the project to run an elevated train service from Joka, in South 24-Parganas, to Sodepur, in North 24-Parganas.        
	The elevated train tracks will supplement the existing Metro and the proposed East-West Metro in reducing the citys traffic load. I have talked to the Union finance ministry and if we are assured of funds, there wouldnt be any problem to begin work, said Bhattacharjee.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Todi arrest stayed for a week

	The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the execution of arrest warrants against the Todis and Anil Saraogi, accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, till November 17.        
	The petition by the industrialist brothers and their relative seeking a permanent stay was supposed to be taken up on Monday. But the hearing could not take place as one of the judges on the bench was unavailable.        
	While fixing the next hearing on November 17, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan verbally asked the CBI not to execute the warrants till then.        
	The Calcutta metropolitan magistrates court had on October 27 issued the non-bailable arrest warrants against the trio after they failed to appear in person in response to summons.        
	The Todis and Saraogi, who have challenged the arrest order on the ground that the summons had allowed all seven accused to be represented by their lawyers, have been missing since the warrants were issued.        
	As the Todis petition is pending with the Supreme Court, the Calcutta metropolitan magistrates court on Monday refused to hear the CBIs plea seeking an order declaring the trio proclaimed offenders. The case will be heard again on November 20.        
	In compliance with an earlier order, three of the accused  police officers Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das  appeared in the magistrates court on Monday. The cops, out on bail, were asked to appear again on November 20.        
	The magistrate turned down the bail plea of the seventh accused, Pappu, and extended his judicial remand till November 20.        
	In another development during the day, Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur Rahman moved the high court seeking early hearing of the appeals filed by the accused against the order allowing the CBI to file chargesheets in the case.        
	Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar directed court officials to include the case in the daily cause list.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year-old trader was shot dead in Howrah on Wednesday in what appears to be the fallout of a love triangle. A probe revealed that Bibhu Chatterjee had an affair with the wife of a local goon, Kartik Samanta, who is absconding.        
	Chatterjees body was found in Samantas scrap-iron godown in Kedar Bhattacharya Lane in Howrah.        
	An officer of Shibpur police station said: Eight months back, Samantas wife had eloped with Chatterjee. Samanta had then lodged a police complaint. She returned after a month and the case is still pending.        
	The police said Samanta had been plotting to kill Chatterjee since.        
	The sleuths suspect that Samanta had lured Chatterjee into the godown by telling him that he wanted to bury the hatchet and inviting him for a drink.        
	Samanta then hired Chhotu, the alleged assassins of goons Chaal Swapan and Maach Swapan, to kill Chatterjee.        
	The police said Chatterjee arrived at the godown at 11am and was shot in the head and shoulder at point-blank range. He died instantly.

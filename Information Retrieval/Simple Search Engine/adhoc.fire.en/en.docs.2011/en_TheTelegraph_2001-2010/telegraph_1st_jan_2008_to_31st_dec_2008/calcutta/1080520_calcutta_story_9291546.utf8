The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Accidents waiting to happen on VIP Road
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Accidents waiting to happen on VIP Road
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Barely six weeks after a bus packed with passengers skidded on slush and plunged into Lower Bagjola Canal near Kestopur, the authorities have forgotten the lessons they had learnt from the mishap.        
	Dredged slush is back on VIP Road, mostly along the Golaghata-Lake Town and Baguiati-Joramandir stretches of the thoroughfare. Construction material dumped carelessly on the road has made the two-lane airport link narrower still. Everyone except the authorities thinks a rerun of the April 4 accident, that killed 21 people, is waiting to happen.        
	When Metro contacted officials of South Dum Dum Municipality, they spoke about what the irrigation department did not do, instead of what they could do, to make VIP Road safer.        
	Dredging canals is the irrigation departments duty, but we are doing the job with our money, Anup Mitra, the chairman-in-council member for water and electricity, said.         
	He denied that workers had left slush on the road. Everything has been cleaned. There is no slush on VIP Road.         
	A survey of VIP Road revealed tell-tale signs of vehicle tyres skidding on the slush, still wet from Sunday nights Norwester. Mounds of slush obstructed the flow of traffic at some places.         
	One of Mitras colleagues admitted later that slush had not been removed because of payment-related issues with the contractor.         
	Dredging started almost a month ago in preparation for the monsoon, when the low-lying areas of Lake Town and Bangur experience flooding after every prolonged spell of rain.        
	For now, its the possibility of accidents that residents of the localities along VIP Road are more worried about. I had a close shave when I was driving down the service road during the thunderstorm on Sunday evening. My Getz skidded on the slush. Had I not applied the brakes, my car would have careened off the road and plunged into the dredged canal. The slush makes the road very slippery when it rains, Prateek Banerjee, a resident of Lake Town, said.        
	Another problem plaguing VIP Road is the construction boom and the callousness of the realtors, who have been building large housing estates and standalone properties along the thoroughfare.        
	Most realtors stock sand, bricks and stone chips by the side of the road, and nobody seems to complain. The stretch in front of Big Bazaar and Vishal Garments is the narrowest. Stone chips and sand have been lying on the road for the past week, leaving space for only two vehicles to pass at a time.         
	Police say their hands are tied. Whenever we have tried to take action against someone for dumping construction material on the road, the person has turned out to be politically well-connected, a traffic sergeant posted at the Baguiati crossing said.

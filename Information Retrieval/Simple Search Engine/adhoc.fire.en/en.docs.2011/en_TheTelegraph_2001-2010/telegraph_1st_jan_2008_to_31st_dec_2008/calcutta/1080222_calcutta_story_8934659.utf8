The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Truck amok in BBD Bag
                                                                                                                   Truck amok in BBD Bag

	A truck rushing through crowded roads around Writers Buildings knocked down a pedestrian before ramming into an island in BBD Bag on Thursday afternoon.         
	The injured, Salil Kumar Das, a Jadavpur resident, was taken to SSKM Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical.        
	The mishap has raised questions about security around Writers, as trucks are not supposed to enter the BBD Bag area. There was an attempt by a section of police to cover up the violation by claiming that the truck was carrying material for the construction of a parking plaza opposite Writers.        
	But it failed after the owner said he had no clue whether the truck was being used for the construction of the plaza. An inquiry has been ordered to find out how the truck entered the prohibited zone, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).        
	The police said the accident occurred around 2.25pm. Witnesses said the empty truck was speeding along the stretch in front of the General Post Office.         
	It took a right turn and hit BBD Bag North Road, in front of Writers. After crossing the BBD Bag-Brabourne Road intersection, the driver lost control and ran over the pedestrian, before smashing into the island, said an officer of the traffic department.

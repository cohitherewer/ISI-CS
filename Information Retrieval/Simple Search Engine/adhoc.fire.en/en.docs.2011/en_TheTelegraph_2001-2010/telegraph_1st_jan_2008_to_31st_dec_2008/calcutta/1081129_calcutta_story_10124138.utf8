                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City proper feels sting more than the fringes
                                  
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had conducted a five-day sample survey on malaria from November 2. The disease had claimed 19 lives this year.              
	Five worst-hit pockets (figures in bracket indicate the percentage of blood samples that tested positive)        
	 BBD Bag-Burrabazar (60%)         
	 Chandni Chowk (60%)        
	 Ballygunge-Kasba (56.57%)        
	 Shyampukur-Hedua (53.60%)        
	 Vivekananda Road-Simla (52.54%)                
	Prevalence of malignant malaria        
	 Taltala (69.38%)        
	 Natunbazar-Sonagachi-Rajabazar (62.50%)         
	 Kumartuli-Sovabazar (57.41%)        
	 Grey Street (55.91%)        
	 Gobra-Padmapukur (52%)              
	Malaria-free pockets        
	 South Sinthee        
	 Cossipore        
	 Chiria More        
	 Palbazar (north Calcutta)        
	 Palbazar (Jadavpur)                
	Findings of the survey        
	 The survey in all 141 wards revealed that 26.64 per cent of Calcuttans had suffered from malaria. Given that the citys population is 50 lakh, around 13 lakh had at some point of time been infected with the parasite.        
	 The incidence of malaria cases has been on the rise. The survey found that 21.97 per cent of Calcuttans had been affected with malaria between January and November 8.        
	 Prevalence of the disease is more in the city proper, which is serviced by underground sewers. The infection rate on the stretch  extending from Shyambazar in north to Tollygunge in south and Burrabazar in west to Entally-Beleghata in east  varies between 40 and 60 per cent.        
	On the other hand, not one of the 46 blood samples tested in South Sinthee, on the northern fringes, was positive for malaria.         
	Similarly, prevalence is nil or low compared with the city proper in added areas such as Jadavpore and Behala.        
	Vector-control experts attribute the trend to the presence of open drains in the added areas and fringes. Culex mosquitoes which breed in the flowing water of open drains kill malaria-causing anopheles mosquitoes.        
	The prevalence rate, however, is high in certain east Calcutta pockets such as Tiljala, Topsia, Kasba, Picnic Garden and Bondel Gate. Though the areas are serviced by open drains, those are choked following deposition of solid waste.                
	Actions taken by the CMC        
	 Door-to-door survey in the malignant malaria-prone areas        
	 Spraying larvicide every week        
	 Keeping malaria clinics open every day        
	 Cancelling the leave of doctors and officials in the health department        
	 Slapping notices on households and institutions where larvae are detected        
	 Carrying out awareness campaign        
	 Clearing open drains that have been choked.

	As the nation awaits shuffling of crores on Budget day, a family in a hamlet 35 km from Calcutta struggles to survive on a shoestring  Rs 2,900 a month.        
	A short cut to ease the ordeal came its way on Monday night, but the Sahas are proud that the youngest member of the family did not even think of taking it.        
	Gopal Saha, 21, a housekeeping staff member of INOX (City Centre) stumbled upon a bag stuffed with Rs 1,22,000  42 months of his salary  and a bunch of credit cards after an evening show of Jodhaa Akbar, but didnt think twice before depositing it at the counter.        
	The money could have helped him resume his studies and foot the medicine bills of his ailing parents for the next few months.        
	But the Saha family in Humaipur Patuli village of Madhyamgram  it took over an hour to reach it from Ultadanga on Wednesday morning  is proud of Gopals act of honesty.        
	Mother Arati, who suffered brain haemorrhage in 2002, could not stop beaming. Amar chhele chhotobela theke khub shanto, khub bhalo (Ever since his childhood, my son has been a quiet and good boy).        
	Father Ratan Saha, in his mid-40s, who had suffered a stroke last year, was equally proud but more matter of fact. Amar chhele khub boro kaaj korechhe, kintu sheta to or duty chhilo (My son has done a great job, but then its part of his job), he said.        
	Gopal, who too feels that he had only done his duty by depositing the bag, has become a hero in his village.                  
	When Metro visited the Saha home on Wednesday, the Sourav-Shah Rukh fan was surrounded by a bunch of admirers, including a few giggling teenagers and excited children. Newspaper clippings highlighting Gopals act of honesty lay strewn on the small bed in a modest room. Also present were Gopals three elder sisters, all married, and childhood friend Biswajeet Patra.        
	Madhyamik pass Gopal wanted to study further but was forced to take up a job after his family fell on hard times. His father earned little, selling sunglasses and leather items like wallets and belts at the local haat.        
	Since the stroke, I have not been able to go to the haat regularly. We struggle to make both ends meet with my sons income, said Ratan.        
	Gopal still hopes to return to books but knows that his familys financial condition and long hours at work  it takes him two hours to reach INOX  make that a distant dream. Aami kaaj kore khub tired hoye jai. Aar energy thaake na (I feel extremely tired at the end of the days work), said Gopal.         
	Any reward for his honesty yet? My boss shook my hand and gifted me a T-shirt. It felt good, smiled the shy youth.

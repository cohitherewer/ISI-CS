                      Voyage of the voyeur                    All creations of Kishore Chatterjee emanate from the conviction that a work of art must stand before the viewer and be able to communicate like the soul communicates with the Maker. Chatterjee calls his present offering a confession. The paintings are a voyeuristic voyage down the vast river of the mind, a dark river we visit in our sub-conscious state. All artists, Chatterjee claims, are in a sense, voyeurs of the soul. The paintings are a recollection of his dreams. His kind of work is generally termed surrealistic but he prefers calling it personal and autobiographical. All his creatures stand beyond the cold light of reality. All his colours emante from a singular source: they are varying shades of his own persona. The themes he takes up become testimony of his love for life and experience, like the one, titled Paradise, appearing right. The works are done mostly in acrylic on canvas and paper.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Kishore Chatterjee When: Till January 14; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

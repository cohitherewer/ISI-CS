                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       17-year-old kills himself at home

	A 17-year-old boy committed suicide by hanging himself at his Ballygunge Station Road home on Wednesday evening.         
	No suicide note was found in the room where Raj Abhishek Mitra, who lost his father six years ago, killed himself.         
	The body of Raj, who studied in Class XII of a Tollygunge school, was found hanging from the ceiling with a towel tied around his neck. Family members took him to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.         
	Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said the family members did not notice anything unusual in Rajs behaviour. He had normal conversation with his mother and other family members on Wednesday.         
	An officer of Gariahat police station said an unnatural death case had been registered. We are waiting for the post-mortem report.         
	Ranjan Mitter, the principal of the school Raj went to, said the boy was good in studies.         
	Rajs mother Mita Mitra told the police that her son behaved normally when she gave him a glass of milk before leaving home around 6pm.         
	She returned around 7.15pm and found the door of Rajs room bolted from inside. I thought he was studying. I knocked on the door after a few minutes but there was no response. Scared, I called the other family members.         
	The family members broke open the door and found Raj hanging from the ceiling.         
	In her statement to the cops, Mita said: So far I know, my son had no enemy. I do not hold anyone responsible for my sons death. I only blame my fate         
	Relatives said Raj had a spiritual bent of mind.         
	Mitter, who watched Raj closely, said he had never seen him depressed. Rather, he actively participated in a number of events during the last fest of the school. He was on good terms with classmates and teachers.         
	He always kept himself busy studying or taking part in spiritual events. He was not the type who liked going out with friends. We are at a loss trying to find out what led the otherwise normal boy to end his life, said a member of the Mitra family.

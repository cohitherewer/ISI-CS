	On Friday morning, Chiamparino met the industry and commerce secretary, Sabyasachi Sen, to discuss possible areas of co-operation between Turin and West Bengal. Sen listed leather, gem and jewellery, textile and engineering as possible areas of co-operation.        
	Eleven Italian universities signed MoUs of co-operation with five universities in the state in the presence of the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation premises.        
	The five institutions are Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Burdwan University and Rabindra Bharati University.        
	Apart from exchange of students and visiting professors, joint seminars, scholarships, joint research and training, the MoUs include research projects on industry, promotion of studies in languages of both countries, translation of works in both languages and initiatives on theatre, cinema, dance and fine arts.

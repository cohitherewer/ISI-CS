The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hema-funded feline shelter ready for strays 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hema-funded feline shelter ready for strays 
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                                                Hema Malini		    
	She isnt known to be catty like some actresses we could name, but Hema Malinis heart certainly purrs for cats.         
	The actress-turned-Rajya Sabha member is the driving force behind Calcuttas first cat pound, to be opened next Sunday at Ajaynagar, off the EM Bypass.        
	Hema donated Rs 2 lakh from her MPs Local Area Development Fund to People For Animals to set up the feline shelter, which will be both a home and a sterilisation centre for strays rounded up from across the city.         
	There are several shelters for dogs but none for cats, whereas the number of stray cats is increasing every day, the actress had said a few months ago, explaining why she chose to fund the cat shelter.         
	Debasis Chakrabarti of Compassionate Crusaders, an NGO that is partnering People For Animals, said Hema had been enthusiastic about the project from the moment she was approached by fellow parliamentarian and animal rights crusader Maneka Gandhi.        
	She is well aware of our activities and has met us during her visits to the city for cultural programmes. We have kept her informed about the progress of the project.         
	The 2,000-square-foot pound will have a preparatory room along with an operation theatre. If cats are caged during the post-operative period, they suffer from depression. So, it is best to keep them in an open enclosure and cage them only at night. This helps them heal from surgery faster, said P.K. Samanta, a veterinarian.         
	Until recently, stray cats used to be caught and kept in the common animal shelter, Ashari, next to the Dhapa dog pound. The Ajaynagar facility can house nearly 100 cats.        
	Like dogs, cats spread rabies. They could also carry germs like the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Infected cats can pass on the germs to other animals; so we thought it best to have a separate pound for them, Chakrabarti said.

                Police have started an investigation into a fraud in ING Vysya Banks Bally branch. The fraud came to light after bank officials noticed that transactions in the account of Biswajit Mukherjee had increased abnormally in the third week of May. On May 23, bank officials visited Biswajits house at Anandanagar and learnt that he had died in a fall from a running train between Liluah and Howrah in November 2007. The bank officials asked Biswajits family to give them a letter informing them of his death, along with a copy of his death certificate. The family, however, refused and lodged a complaint with Bally police station. Biswajit had opened the bank account on September 1, 2007. On December 1, 2007, the bank issued a statement showing zero balance in his account. But bank records shows that Rs 20,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 749 were withdrawn from his account on May 18, 20 and 22.    Detective department officials have arrested Santanu Sil in Serampore in connection with the fake admission of constables in Calcutta police. Santanu, the cops said, was a key aide of Prabir Bose, alias Bappa, a former constable and a major suspect in the job scam. Santanu would bring Bappa candidates. The district police in Serampore spotted Santanu riding Bappas motorcycle and intercepted him. His inconsistent answers to their queries led them to alert the sleuths.     An armed group of nearly six miscreants broke open the door of a plywood factory at Dogachia, in Naihati, and robbed cash and machinery worth over Rs 2 lakh. Police said the robbers arrived at the factory, SP Enterprise, around 5am on Monday and overpowered the security guard. One of them stood guard while the others went on a looting spree for about half an hour. Nobody has been arrested.    Six persons travelling in an Ambassador were injured on Monday afternoon after it was dashed by a Matador van on Diamond Harbour Road near Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city. All the injured were taken to Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala. The driver, Bablu Ghosh, was transferred to SSKM Hospital as his condition deteriorated.    Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya announced on Monday that the scheme for regularisation of illegal structures will be extended to all 141 wards of Calcutta. Earlier in March, the mayor had announced the regularisation scheme only for citizens in ward No. 100 and in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Khan to perform even if Knights cant
  - Shah Rukh song and dance for fans before hosts match against Royal Challengers          A STAFF REPORTER                           Shah Rukh talks to a pompom girl at Eden Gardens. A Telegraph picture                                        
	King Khan has promised to be in form at the Eden next Thursday; though its his team that needs it more.        
	Keen to repay loyal fans of the Kolkata Knight Riders with some Bollywood-style entertainment, Shah Rukh Khan has decided to perform on the evening of Ponchisey Boisakh, just before the beleaguered Knight Riders take on the Royal Challengers in their third match on home turf.         
	Shah Rukh has asked officials of his company, Red Chillies Entertainment, to arrange for a makeshift 30ftx20ft stage at an appropriate spot for him and his troupe to perform for 15-20 minutes before the match starts at 8pm.        
	Shah Rukh wants to offer something to the KKR fans, who have stood by the team. He wants to do something for the crowd from the bottom of his heart, said I.S. Bhandari of Red Chillies.        
	Nobody would confirm it but the buzz is that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Size 0 Kapoor will be a part of the show along with the Indian-origin wrestler who has found fame in America as The Great Khali.        
	Sources said the makeshift stage would be just outside the boundary. The choice is between F and J blocks.        
	We have asked them (Red Chillies) to officially send us a detailed plan. We will grant them permission, provided it is not an issue with the cops, CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee said.        
	We have told the organisers that the stage should in no way affect the arrangements on the ground.        
	Sports minister Subhash Chakraborty scoffed at the idea of holding such a show before the match. May 8 is Rabindra Jayanti and such an event (Shah Rukhs show) will not be in tune with it.        
	On whether he would do anything to prevent the event, Chakraborty said: Who am I to stop anything? Why should I interfere? They (the organisers) need to introspect and take a call on such things.        
	The sports ministers grouse against Red Chillies had as much to do with the number of tickets being offered by the organisers as with Shah Rukhs proposed show. The sports department had asked for 198 tickets for the match but was offered only half that number. Chakrabortys department felt insulted and refused them.        
	Why should we take any? We had asked for 198 tickets and were offered only 101. Its not a joke, Chakraborty said.

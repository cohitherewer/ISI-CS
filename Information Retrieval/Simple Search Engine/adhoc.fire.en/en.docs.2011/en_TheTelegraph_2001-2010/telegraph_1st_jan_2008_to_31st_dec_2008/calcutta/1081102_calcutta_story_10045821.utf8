The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | When tea was a miracle cure 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       When tea was a miracle cure

	Has any other leaf influenced history, culture, lifestyle and civilisation so much as tea? It has changed Englishmen, flagged off the American War of Independence (Boston Tea Party), created the subtle performing art of the Japanese tea ceremony and led Alexander Pope to write the immortal couplet Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey/ Dost sometimes counsel take  and sometimes tea, where tea is supposed to rhyme with obey. Above all, tea is the venerable drink that we know it is.         
	The British are responsible for the current popularity of tea in India. They started large-scale cultivation of tea in Assam in the 19th century. (The Agricultural and Horticultural Society in Calcutta first declared in 1834 that the sample of leaves sent by Charles Alexander Bruce from Assam was actually tea.)        
	But tea did not become popular in a day. Till the second decade of the 20th century, before the arrival of two multinational tea giants Brooke Bond and Lipton, a lot of effort had to be put in to popularise tea in Calcutta and other cities in India. Lipton once used to advertise its name on the underside of the wings of aircraft.        
	Those associated with the railway did their bit. On behalf of a British tea merchant, H.C. Dey amp; Company, a railway contractor for catering service, used to distribute tea free of cost at railway stations. Several of those boards publicising the therapeutic value of tea still stand at a tea stall at Dum Dum railway station, on platform No. 3.         
	My shop is about 80 years old and it was started by my father. I have inherited these boards, says Uma Shankar, 66.         
	Price of a big cup of tea was one anna; a small cup cost one paisa and half a cup was available at half-paisa.         
	One poster lays down meticulous instructions on preparing tea and how cheap varieties should be avoided. Another (see picture) claims that tea protects its drinker from malaria, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, plague and depression. Only if it were true!         
	Green pledge        
	Calcutta has found a new green crusader in Beth A. Payne, the recently appointed US consul-general.         
	Inaugurating a green booth, Sabuj Thikana, which the state environment department has set up during Puja with an NGO to spread awareness about the environment, Payne vouched to do her bit for protecting the city. I am prepared even to collect trash from the Hooghly, promised Payne, while participating in a green adda that was organised during the event.         
	She even recorded her pledge to keep the river clean on a green canvas. We are waiting for some green action.         
	Sweet Nano         
	Nano might have left a bitter taste, but a confectioner in Salt Lake has given the name a sweet turn.                   Nano sandesh at a Salt Lake shop. Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee      
	Nano sandesh rolled out of the vien ghar of Kalpataru in CA Market and proved to be the high point of bhai phonta in several homes. Since Nano is the talk of the town, I gave the idea to our haluikar. He came up with Nano sandesh, says Pradeep Sheel, the owner of Kalpataru.         
	Shaped like a car, with the letters n, a, n and o forming its two-tiered windows, the sandesh, unlike its fuel-driven counterpart, was not the cheapest option available, carrying a price tag of Rs 25 a piece.         
	To test the market, I kept a few pieces on the counter and was flooded with queries, says Sheel. Ratan Tata parlo na, ar apni Nano baniye phellen (You built a Nano when Ratan Tata failed)? observed many.         
	Sheel was well-stocked on bhai phonta, but still fell short. I have decided to keep the Nanos rolling till the season lasts, Sheel says. Maybe he should send some to Mamata Banerjee.         
	Land ahoy        
	But there cant be enough of Nano talk. Recently at a Discovery Channel press conference in the city, a preview of a programme called Next World was shown. Among the futuristic inventions showcased, there was a floating city  a piece of land that would rise with the tide, escaping inundation.         
	So an entire city could lay anchor by a coastline, assimilating itself with the land. If there was a forecast of torrid weather, one could shift to sunnier climes.         
	Perhaps this is the only way Buddhababu can get land for his industry dreams, quipped a viewer. If a bit of Gujarat can set sail, from Arabian Sea to Bay of Bengal, the Nano might even return to us!

	This one wont go down well with the men of Calcutta . Last few days, during the pujas when they are all around, I have been noticing guys on the road, in shops and in restaurants and I must say I am disappointed.         
	An aunt teased me that when my husbands away on ship, Im sure to have a rocking time. I pointed out that even if I were to have a roving eye, theres very little eye-candy for a woman in Calcutta. She insisted that if I look out, Im sure to spot a dude or two. Thus began a mission that very soon turned out to be mission impossible. Heres why.         
	a) Most Bengali men sport an abominable growth on their upper lip, which they proudly call a moustache. I cannot fathom why any right-thinking individual would allow anything to grow, let alone flourish, on his face thats such a turn-off. Its unhygienic, useless and downright sick.         
	b) They display ungainly rings of every colour, shape and size on their fingers, making their hands look like disfigured consoles with stubby knobs. These rings are worn for peace, prosperity and all kinds of good fortune, but as far as lady luck is concerned, ahem         
	c) Their dressing sense is so pathetic that if let loose at a designers meet, they could be tried for homicide. They wear trousers in browns and creams and equally dull shirts in flat colours. Whats worse, the formal shirts are not tucked in, albeit to hide the ubiquitous Bengali paunch. Those who do wear denims rarely pair them with a crisp white shirt or a cool grey T.         
	d) Dont even dare look at their feet they wear slippers and floaters, and sometimesbrace yourself sneakers with formals.         
	e) Then theres of course the khadi kurta with dirty jeans. They wear them in every colour possible  aqua- marine to pink to mustard  and in winter, they pair them with jackets!!         
	I could go on, but Im already feeling a bit queasy. I guess Im being superficial, but being well-turned out is hardly about expensive clothes or branded accessories. If someone is shabbily dressed, s/he is likely to be casual about everything, be it profession, love life or other relationships.         
	Our aunt will be disappointed.                     SAMHITA L. CHAKRABORTY

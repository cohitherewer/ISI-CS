          A STAFF REPORTER                      Partha Sarathi Bose                          
	CBI sleuths on Sunday arrested one of their colleagues while he was allegedly accepting a bribe from a Guwahati-based transport operator.         
	Partha Sarathi Bose, a deputy superintendent of police, was caught red-handed while accepting Rs 50,000 from Avtar Singh on CIT Road in Ultadanga, said a CBI official.         
	Singh had lodged a complaint with the investigating agency alleging that Bose was threatening to implicate him in the murder of Tarun Kumar Dutta, a revenue intelligence officer, if he did not cough up Rs 50,000. Dutta was killed in Guwahati in September, 2006.        
	Bose, who investigated the rape and murder of Singur girl Tapasi Malik, was also probing the Guwahati killing and visited Assam several times in the past two years. A preliminary probe had revealed that the vehicle used for killing Dutta was hired from Singh.        
	Following the complaint, we started recording Boses telephonic conversations with Singh, a sleuth told Metro.         
	A special team of the agencys anti-corruption wing arrived in the city from Delhi on Saturday night and laid a trap for the officer. As advised by the sleuths, Singh set up a meeting with Bose in front of a shop in Ultadanga at 12.15pm. We arrested him the moment he accepted a packet containing the money. We did not engage any of our city-based officers as Bose could have identified him/her, said the official.         
	Sleuths said Boses arrest would not affect the murder probe or the Tapasi Malik case. CPM leader Surhid Dutta and Debu Malik, who were convicted for Tapasis murder and given life sentence, have moved the high court against the trial courts order.

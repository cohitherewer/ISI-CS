The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blood blots vermilion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blood blots vermilion

	Maya Mohan cringes every time she applies sindoor. She cannot bear to look at herself in the mirror. For, her 28-year-old daughters maang is bare  the vermilion wiped off her widows peak by a mishap on VIP Road.        
	On February 29, Ratna Ray and her five-month-old son Krish bid goodbye to Saswata Roy, 38, as he left their Kestopur home for Scottish Church Collegiate School. He taught English and Bengali in the primary section.        
	Saswata had barely hit VIP Road when his motorcycle skid on a patch of sand. A speeding bus on route 44 ran over the schoolteacher, killing him on the spot.        
	Ma (Maya Mohan) is reluctant to apply sindoor... No woman should ever be faced with such a dilemma. Ma has removed all the mirrors at home so that she does not have to see her sindoor-streaked forehead, said Ashim Kumar, Ratnas elder brother.        
	Maya has tears in her eyes every time she looks at Ratna, who is now a wreck. She has hardly had a full nights sleep since February 29.        
	For the first few days she survived only on water. We had to dissolve protein supplements in water to keep her going. She was given injections to induce sleep, but she would stay awake all night, said Ashim, his gaze fixed on little Krish, who is oblivious to the tragedy.        
	The bus driver was racing with another bus to pick up a few more passengers. In his mad race for some extra commission, he managed to ensure that this little boy would never know what a fathers love is.... said Krishs maternal uncle.        
	It was on Krishs annaprasan on February 11 that Saswata and Ratna had shared with the family their dream project of opening a dance school. Ratna is a good Bharatanatyam dancer and they together were scouting for land and applying for bank loans. But now, she is just going through the motions of living, said her brother.        
	A month after Saswata was crushed by a speeding bus, another private bus racing down VIP Road plunged into the Lower Bagjola Canal, killing 21 passengers. Yet, the administration remains reluctant to rein in the road rogues.

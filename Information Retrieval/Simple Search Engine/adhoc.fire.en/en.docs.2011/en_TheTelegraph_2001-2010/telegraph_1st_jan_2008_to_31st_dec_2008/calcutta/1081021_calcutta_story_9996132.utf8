          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The condition of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl diagnosed with Japanese Encephalitis worsened after her family took her away from a city hospital to get her treated by a village quack.        
	Sunima Khatun continued to have high fever and bouts of shock after her parents took her back home to Joynagar, South 24-Parganas. Health department officials came to know about it and convinced her family to shift her to the block hospital.        
	The disease had claimed the life of a 36-year-old man in Behala two weeks back and health officials are unwilling to take chances with Sunima.         
	Officials said they were planning to shift her to another Calcutta hospital. Her condition is serious and we will offer the best possible medical help, said Sacchidananda Sarkar, the chief medical officer (health), South 24-Parganas.         
	Reports of dengue and chikungunya continued to pour in from the city and its suburbs. On Monday, an eight-year-old boy, Neelavo Banerjee of Salt Lake, tested positive for dengue. So far, 19 cases of dengue and 27 of chikungunya have been reported from the southern city fringes.

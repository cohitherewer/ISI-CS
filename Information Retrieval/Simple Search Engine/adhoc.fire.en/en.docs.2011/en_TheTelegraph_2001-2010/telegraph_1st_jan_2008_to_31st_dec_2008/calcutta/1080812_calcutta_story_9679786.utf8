          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Several students are part of the motorcycle theft gang three of whose members were arrested on SP Mukherjee Road on Sunday, according to police.  
	The trio mdash; Abhisekh Roy, Ravi Shankar Singh and Sudhir Singh mdash; are in their early twenties and did not have criminal record.   
	 Three motorcycles allegedly stolen by them were seized in Jadavpur. The police suspect that they were behind several other motorcycle thefts.  
	 ldquo;Abhisekh, Ravi and Sudhir got involved in the racket eight months ago. Initially, they used to provide information to motorcycles thieves in return of a meagre amount. Later, they started stealing the motorcycles themselves and used to be paid 20-30 per cent of the amount for which the two-wheelers were sold, rdquo; said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.  
	 Each of them earned between Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000 per month, he added.   
	 According to the police, Abhisekh was a first-year drop-out from the evening section of a reputed central Calcutta college.  
	 ldquo;He started working in a mobile phone shop. Later, he used to repair phones near his house in Bansdroni, rdquo; said the officer.  
	 Abhisekh may have been part of a cellphone theft racket as well. Three mobile phone sets were found on him.   
	 Ravi is undergoing a nine-month merchant navy training at an institute in Hastings and was due to be placed in three months.  
	 Sudhir is a second-year student in a south Calcutta college.  
	 The investigators have learnt that more students are part of the gang. They were lured by the prospect of making fast bucks.  
	 ldquo;This is a recent trend. More and more educated people are getting involved in crime. We are trying to track others associated with the gang, rdquo; said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).  
	 ldquo;We have some leads on the mastermind of the gang and will conduct raids shortly, rdquo; said another officer probing the case.

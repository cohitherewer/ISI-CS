The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guild fix-it mars maidan   Grass gone, dust flies
                                                                                                            Guild fix-it mars maidan
  - 10 days after ouster, Book Fair 2008 wounds yet to heal          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Park Circus Maidan lies ravaged by the preparations for Book Fair 2008, 10 days after the high court threw the annual bazaar out of the green patch.

	Park Circus Maidan is still riddled with potholes, ugly patches of sand and uneven soil, 10 days after Book Fair 2008 was shooed out of it.        
	But the Publishers and Booksellers Guild is convinced that it has restored the ground to its earlier condition, as directed by Calcutta High Court.        
	On January 28, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh had ordered the fair out of Park Circus Maidan and asked the guild, the organisers of the annual bazaar, to repair the ground as soon as possible.        
	We have done our job. The structures have been removed, the potholes have been filled up and the ground has been levelled, asserted Sribindu Bhattacharya, the convener of the guild.        
	Forget restoration, the maidan has only turned worse, countered a local resident. The guild should be charged with contempt of court.                          
	The observation was borne out during Metros visit to the only patch of green in the overcrowded neighbourhood on Thursday.         
	Several potholes, dug up to erect stalls and bamboo poles, are yet to be filled up. Some have been stuffed with sand, destroying the top soil, while a few have been sealed with soil that has not been levelled. The guild has destroyed the ground by filling up the potholes with sand. Grass will not grow on these patches for quite some time, said an environmentalist.        
	The quick-fix job has left local residents fuming. The surface has become uneven, posing a risk to aged morning-walkers. In the dim light of dawn, they can stumble on the rough patches injure themselves, said a member of Darga Road Citizens Committee, which had moved the high court challenging the legality of choosing Park Circus Maidan as the venue for Book Fair 2008.        
	The grass cover is gone and dust is flying thick, adding to air pollution. The guild has done nothing by way of restoration, despite the court order. This is contempt of court, said another resident.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice Nijjar had ruled that the fundamental rights of citizens would have been infringed upon had the fair been held on Park Circus Maidan. The permissions issued... to the guild were unlawful, the bench had observed.

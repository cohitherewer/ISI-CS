                      Unwelcome guests                    Set in the turbulent Bengal of the early 1970s, Buddhadeva Boses Nepathya Natak tells a story that is relevant even to the present. Seventy-year-old Aparesh is a poet who tries in vain to write poetry. His wife, Banani, a former freedom-fighter who had inspired many with her songs, is now an old and frail woman, who can barely look after her household. They live alone in Ramchandrapur, and wait impatiently for a visit from their son and his wife. One evening, Jammu and Imli, a young couple, arrive at their doorstep in the midst of a sudden outbreak of violence in the area. The old couple, though initially wary, offer them refuge. An atmosphere of friendship and hospitality is, however, disturbed when their neighbours plant seeds of fear and suspicion in the minds aged couple, who consequently turn out their guests in the face of danger. Aparesh and Banani experience pangs of shame, despair and regret when they realise what they have done, but it is already too late.

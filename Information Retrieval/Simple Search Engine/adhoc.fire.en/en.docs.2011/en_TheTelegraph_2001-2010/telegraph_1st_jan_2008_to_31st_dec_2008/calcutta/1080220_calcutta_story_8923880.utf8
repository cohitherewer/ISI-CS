The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clinic holds back aged, poor patient
                                                                                                               Clinic holds back aged, poor patient
          RITH BASU                                        
	A 63-year-old woman has allegedly been detained in a Garia nursing home for failing to pay for her treatment.        
	Puspa Ganguly was admitted to Hindusthan Health Point on January 15 with acute pyoarthosis of the left ankle joint  a condition in which pus forms in the joint.        
	She was in acute pain when brought to hospital but responded well to treatment. She was ready to be discharged by January 28, said Bhaskar Ghoshal, the surgeon superintendent of Health Point group and Puspas doctor.         
	But even the plaster cast on her foot has not been removed. The hospital authorities stopped treatment after the bill climbed to Rs 57,095. They have refused to conduct tests worth Rs 400, necessary for removing the plaster cast.        
	The patients sons are blackmailers who want to cheat us Thats why we have stopped treating her. She will be released as and when we get the payment, said Ashok Binayak, a surgeon and co-director of the nursing home.        
	Puspas sons Surojit, an insurance agent, and Abhijit, an autorickshaw driver, say they cant pay the bill. The nursing home is not releasing my mother. I had asked them to check with the health insurance company before starting treatment, said Surojit.        
	The United India Insurance Company and its TPA, Medicare, decided on Tuesday not to foot the entire bill. The minimum sum insured for Puspa Ganguly was raised from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 in August 2007. But till August this year, she would get the entire amount only in case of an accident. We can only provide Rs 15,000 for her treatment, said Alipsa Banerjee, a senior executive at Medicare.        
	A Health Point official said Surojit was told that the insurance cover was Rs 15,000 but he had insisted it was Rs 50,000.        
	Saibalendu Bhowmick, a lawyer of the state medical council, asserted: A patient cannot be detained for non-payment of bill.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar on Tuesday promised to send a team to the clinic to ensure Puspas speedy discharge.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two brothers headed for a wedding on a motorcycle were killed when a speeding minibus hit them at Santoshpur, in Howrah, on Thursday.        
	Hasibul Ali Middye, 20, was riding the two-wheeler and his sibling Rajesh, 18, and cousin Mohammad were riding pillion, followed by a Trekker packed with family members and friends.         
	Elder brother Mohammad Salim said he saw the minibus overtaking a truck before ramming into the motorcycle. We were going towards Amta and the Domjur-Howrah minibus was coming from the opposite direction. The driver overtook a Tata 407 truck at high speed and lost control.         
	While Hasibul and Rajesh died, Mohammad escaped with a few bruises.        
	Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said the driver of the minibus had been arrested and the vehicle impounded. We have charged him with rash driving leading to death. He will be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court, Howrah, on Friday.        
	None of trio on the bike was wearing a helmet. Relatives said Hasibul and Rajesh were flung away on impact. Both suffered fatal head injuries.        
	The Middye family owns a garments shop at Dakshin Jhapardah, in Domjur. Hasibul and Rajeshs sister Rashida Begum got married on Tuesday and they were going to their brother-in-laws house for the wedding reception.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Part-I and Part-II results for Calcutta University (CU)s BA and B.Sc honours and general examinations under the 1+1+1 pattern were declared on Wednesday, revealing a drop in the pass percentage from last year. The success rate has gone down by two to three per cent, said university officials.         
	The students are, however, yet to know their results as the marksheets will reach the colleges on Thursday morning.        
	The results showed that honours students have fared better than those studying general courses. The pass percentage in BA Part-I honours is 82.81 and in the general stream, 58.74. Among B.Sc students, 71.05 per cent have cleared the Part-I honours exams and 50.2 per cent have passed in the general examinations.        
	The same trend is seen among BA and B.Sc Part-II students in both honours and general exams. In BA Part-II honours, 94.94 per cent examinees have passed. In B.A Part-II general, the percentage of successful students is 66.41.        
	In B.Sc Part-II honours, 89.12 per cent of the examinees have cleared the exams. The pass percentage in B.Sc Part-II general is far below, at 64.83.

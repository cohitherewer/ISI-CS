                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Train mows down three gangmen in Bally
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three gangmen were killed and another was seriously injured in two accidents on railway tracks near the city on Wednesday.         
	In the first incident that took place near Bally station at 11.45am, the Up Howrah-Muzaffarpur Express ran over three gangmen.         
	According to police, 13 gangmen were working on the tracks near pole No. 10, barely 500 metres from Bally station.         
	Taking a break from work, three of them  Ramji Gohala, 39, Dilip Kurmi, 35, and Chandrasekhar Yadav  started walking towards the station along track No. 5 of the Burdwan chord line when the Howrah-Muzaffarpur Express knocked them down from behind, said a police officer. All three were from Howrah, he added.        
	We were sitting beside the tracks and suddenly saw a train come at a very high speed and hit them, said Rajendra Gohala, a gangman who was working with the trio. As the train did not whistle, his colleagues did not get a chance to move away, he added.         
	They used to be porters and were recruited by the railways after minister Lalu Prasad announced that gangmen would be chosen from among porters, said a railway source.         
	A GRP team visited the spot and collected the mutilated bodies and sent them for post-mortem. An inquiry has been ordered, said Dipak Jha, the chief public relations officer of Eastern Railway. An ex gratia of Rs 17,000 will be given to the families of each of the deceased, he added.         
	Railway officials blamed the mishap on the violation of track maintenance norms.         
	When work is carried out on the tracks, a red festoon has to be placed at least 30 feet from the spot. But there was no festoon on Wednesday. So the train driver was not aware that gangmen were present on the tracks.         
	In the other incident, gangman Sirajul Sheikh, 50, was severely injured on Wednesday after being hit by an Up Naihati local at 11.20am near Sodepur station. He has been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in a serious condition.

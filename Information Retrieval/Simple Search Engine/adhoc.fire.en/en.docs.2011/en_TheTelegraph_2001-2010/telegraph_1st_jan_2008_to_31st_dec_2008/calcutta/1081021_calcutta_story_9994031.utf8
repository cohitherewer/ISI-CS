                      Pulsating with raw energy                    Contemporary painting in Bengal has synthesised into a unique individuality and shows a rich fusion of the traditions of each successive migration of adventurers, who, in search of the riches of the country, left behind an imprint very much evident in their works. Five artists  Subhabrata Nandi, Sudip Rakshit, Partha Biswas, Partha Pratim Mondal and Koushik Kr. Mondal  all alumni of Government College of Art and Craft, formed Vibes in 2005. These painters are socially committed and the involvement is evident in their selection and depiction of subjects. Nandis abstract works depict his rebellious reaction to the receding skyline due to the emergence of highrises taking over cities after cities. Rakshits mixed media works transform reality in a surreal fantasy, where life travels through a fluid darkness but always seems to miss its destination. Biswas creates sonorous mystic fantasy in his mixed media canvases, where reality merges with dream. Naturalistic renderings are the essence of Partha Pratim Mondals canvases. Koushik Kr. Mondal resorts to decorative, rhythmic beauty through depiction of female nudes. He sets the figures sometimes in a realistic background or at times in an abstract floral environment. He looks for beauty of the human form amid nature. The photograph (right) depicts Offering by Koushik Kr. Mondal.

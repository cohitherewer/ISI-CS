  More answers will be published next week

	As a responsible human being it is our duty to take prompt action to help accident victims. So if anybody fails to perform his basic moral duty, then that person should be penalised.               
	

Amrita Mallik,
  Salt Lake        
	I do not think that mere punishment of the bystanders will help much. Thanks to our legal system, everyone is scared to help an accident victim. Therefore, just punishing the onlookers, by extracting a fine or even imprisonment, will not help. Their conscience has to be roused so that they become aware of their social duties. One needs to act automatically at the sight of an injured man lying on the road.               
	

Santosh Chakravarty, 
  Behala        
	Anybody rarely stops near a victim after casting a glance. Who will identify the offenders from amid the stream of passersby? Who will book them and under what law? Is there any appropriate section under the IPC for this? The apathy and passivity on the part of the watchers is inhuman. No law can cure such moral malaise.              
	

BIPLAB PAUL, 
  Dankuni         
	Punishment is not the solution for apathy towards accident victims. People need to be made aware of their responsibility towards a wounded person. We generally dont want to waste time over things in which we are not gainers. But people should be made to realise how important his role can be in saving a life. Awards for bravery may help.               
	

Dipayan Das, 
  Address not mentioned        
	Morality and ethics cannot be forced on anyone. They are the reflection of the nations attitude. So punishing bystanders who are not showing interest in helping an accident victim is not going to help. The media should try to create awareness by highlighting positive stories where bystanders have helped an accident victim. People have to be inspired to help others.               
	

Munmun Das Neogi, 
  Dum Dum Cantonment         
	Many of us witness accidents which are followed by mob attacks. Vehicles are torched at will. Instead if the accident victim is taken to the hospital a precious life can be saved. So according to me, bystanders should be punished if they do not take an accident victim to hospital. This might urge people to act.               
	

Sunil Ghosh, 
  Bandel        
	The idea of punishing bystanders is totally irrelevant in a place where workers regularly beat up their managers; hospital employees refuse to serve patients for whom they are employed; where people publicly humiliate the governor and the high court  all without fear of any punishment.                S.K. Roy, 
  Chandernagore         
	If you take responsibility for an accident victim, you will be in for trouble. Police, press, court, political party, local goon  nobody will spare you. In this unfriendly and non-cooperative situation I, as a bystander, would safely choose to be a passive sympathiser. No bystander should be punished unless the government or a non-government machinery assures that he will not be harassed.                 Priyanka dutta 
  Nagerbazar         
	No. In the present scenario when helping others often leads us to problems, many a bystander will avoid the duty. Anyone helping out a victim is suspected of committing the crime and often becomes embroiled in police paraphernalia. However, on humanitarian grounds,we should help accident victims. If a bystander has to act, he deserves protection by some laws.                 Satyanarayan Das, 
  Metiabruz   
	Generally when an accident occurs, we just stare at the victim, instead of helping him. People do not want to involve themselves in accident cases. But we should consider the person as one of us. Nor can we punish bystanders.We have to take a decision and take a step forward to help the victim.           
	

Tuhin Purkayastha, 
  Parnashree Palli         
	We cannot force bystanders to take accident victims to hospital. Its their wish whether they want to help or not. But nowadays due to the harassment by the police and hospital authorities, people think twice before helping anyone. It depends on a persons nature. According to me, people should still come forward and help an injured person as the incident may occur to one of our relatives also, in which case we would want some body to help them.               
	

Nidhi Poddar, 
  Salt Lake         
	The first duty of a bystander is to serve an accident victim. In Calcutta, the bystanders are helpful.               
	

Kshama Agarwal, 
  CR Avenue        
	Helping a victim of any accident is a matter of humanity. Enforcing any law or punishing bystanders for not doing their duty is not feasible. Moreover, in todays corrupt and crime-laden environment, no one wants to invite unwanted complication in life. It will be better if the person who helps the victim is rewarded, rather than punishing the bystanders for not extending a helping hand.               
	

Abhinav Narayanan,
  Lake Gardens         
	The bystanders at an accident site or at any kind of mishap are also part of this society, and the truth is that society has transformed so much that it has changed the instincts of people, compelling him to think as individuals. Thus punishing bystanders may not be a solution to the problem. We should rather urge people to follow their human instincts.               
	

Rimli Datta, 
  Salt Lake         
	Yes, bystanders should be punished if they dont take an accident victim to hospital. It is quite often seen that if an accident occurs on the road, people just stand and watch, discussing the issue with others thereby creating a commotion or at the most run after the driver or burn the vehicle causing the accident. The accident victim lies forgotten on the road, waiting for attention. These callous men forget that some day the victim might be a close relative of their own. Passersby should realise that punishing the culprit can be done later but if anything fatal happens to the victim then the case is lost.         
	

Ishita Bhattacharya, 
  Hooghly        
	Our society is becoming more and more selfish every day. People dont even bother about a man dying on the roadside. The motive is to avoid trouble like dealing with the police, getting hold of doctors, informing the family members and all sorts of legal formalities. They can protest, blame the police, set buses on fire but they will never come to help. This villainous act of denying help is surely a punishable offence as it may lead to the victims death. Therefore strict disciplinary action should be taken against inhuman bystanders.               
	

Dipak Datta, 
  Salt Lake         
	It would not be logical or justifiable to punish bystanders for failing to carry an accident victim to hospital. We have to consider the practical problems that a bystander would face by getting involved. First, the person may not have enough money to take the victim to hospital. Second, it is not easy to admit a patient in any government hospital. If refused, the alternative is to take him to a nursing home which may or may not have an emergency facility. They will also demand a certain amount of money to be deposited before admission. Moreover, the victim may expire on the way to the hospital.This will involve the helper in a police case.               
	

INDRANIL SANYAL,
  Dhakuria        
	This is a question of morality. How can one be punished for that? Can the government ensure that bystanders will not face any harassment from the police and the hospital authorities, if one of them takes a victim to the nearest hospital? The bystanders usually think thrice before coming forward to shoulder responsibility coupled with undue harassments. The present scenario is responsible for the moral downfall. Blaming a commoner is not the solution.              
	

ANUSHRI MONDAL, 
  Gol Park        
	The question here is not about inflicting punishment on bystanders for their negligence towards an accident victim. The question to ponder upon is the reason behind such an indifferent attitude towards an unconscious victim. Does the age of technology mean that we should forget the basic human qualities of charity, responsibility, love and support? It is not only pathetic but also pitiful to read, see and hear about people crowding around a victim with the least intention of aiding him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cellphone hunt in twin murders
                                                                                                               Cellphone hunt in twin murders
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths are searching for a missing cellphone of Srabonti Ghosh, who was found murdered, along with her eight-year-old daughter, at her Howrah home on Tuesday.        
	Srabonti had two cellphones, one of which has been missing. The phone may provide a clue to the murder, said an investigating officer.        
	The sleuths checked the call records of the phone that has been seized and learnt that she had got around 30 calls from PCOs in Calcutta, Howrah and North 24-Parganas over the past two months. We are probing why she got so many calls, said an officer of Jagachha police station.        
	Srabontis husband Partha was interrogated on Thursday, along with friends Indrajit Das and Soumen Bhowmik and their wives.        
	The sleuths, however, are yet to recover the murder weapon. It seems the assailants had thrown it into a pond, from where two bloodstained gloves were recovered on Wednesday. We will deploy divers to try and fish it out, said an officer.

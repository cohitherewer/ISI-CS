The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family welcomes order
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Family welcomes order
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rizwanur Rahmans family members have welcomed the order but feel they have miles to go to see the guilty policemen and the Todis punished.        
	It is good to know that the court blamed senior police officers as well as the Todis for my brothers death. Its now clear how he was subjected to harassment and mental torture by senior officers, including the police commissioner, Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur said soon after Justice Dipankar Dutta delivered his order.        
	We welcome the verdict... I thank the people of Calcutta for being with us since the day Rizwanurs body was found on September 21 last year, he added.        
	The family members, however, feel chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had let them down. The chief minister, holding my mothers hand, had assured us of justice. But his government opposed us in court, said Rukbanur.        
	Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan was glued to the TV screen along with her relatives from the afternoon.        
	The loss of my son is irreparable. As a mother, my only wish is that people responsible for his death are punished. Todays verdict seems to be the first step in that direction, she said. Clad in a white sari, she was crying inconsolably holding Rizwanurs photograph to her chest.        
	A source close to the Todis said: The family has decided not to comment before going through the judgment.

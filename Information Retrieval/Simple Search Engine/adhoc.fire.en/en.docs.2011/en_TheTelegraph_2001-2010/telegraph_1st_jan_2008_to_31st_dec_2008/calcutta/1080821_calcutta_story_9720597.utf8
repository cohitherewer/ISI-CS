The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleuths stumble on passport racket
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sleuths stumble on passport racket
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths have stumbled upon a racket dealing in fake passports and detained two persons in the port area on Wednesday.        
	Many individuals possess more than one passport. Some have two passports in the same name, said an officer of Watgunge police station.        
	An organised racket is involved in supplying fake passports. We are collecting the relevant documents before arresting the culprits, he added.        
	The sleuths started a probe following a tip-off that several youths who frequently visit Hong Kong, Singapore and China have two or more passports.        
	Raids are on to arrest the agents who supply fake passports. We have seized two passports belonging to one person. Both passports are in the same name, he added.        
	Investigating officers said many youths visit Hong Kong Singapore and China on tourist visas. Some of them go there to bring electronic items for city-based traders while others work illegally in hotels and restaurants.        
	Their passports are seized as soon as they are caught and they are deported to Calcutta immediately, said an officer. But the youths again visit those countries using another passport.        
	These youths pay anything between Rs 5,000 and 8,000 and get a new passport. It seems a large number of people are involved in the racket and the network spreads across the city, said the officer.        
	But the sleuths are still clueless about the brains behind the racket. We are in touch with immigration officials, said Tenzing Bhutia, the officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station.        
	An officer at Lalbazar said sleuths have intensified their vigil on fake passport rackets following the recent blasts. A team is keeping a tab on infiltrators and those involved in the passport racket, the officer added.

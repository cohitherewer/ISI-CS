The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big-format retail on rural route
                                                                                                               Big-format retail on rural route
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The retail boom is rolling into the suburbs. Giving the cluttered Calcutta market a miss, real estate player RDB Group is unveiling a chain of large-format shopping malls in the interiors of Bengal.        
	Regent Station, which borrows its name from the companys tobacco brand Regent, will be a one-stop shop for FMCG, garments, jewellery and footwear, along with food court, recreation area and car park.        
	Ten outlets have been planned in Bengal in the initial phase. First up is a 26,000-sq-ft, three-tier store in Barasat, to be flagged off by brand ambassadors Prosenjit and Koel Mullick on March 15.        
	We are targeting the suburbs as there is a huge untapped market lying out there. Our surveys have found that people in these areas have the buying potential but no shop to go to. Our price will be reasonable, as we are looking at the middle and lower-middle classes, said R.K. Malu, managing director of Big Space Fashion India, an RDB venture that will oversee the Regent Station outlets.         
	Nine other outlets  on 20,000 sq ft to 65,000 sq ft  will come up in Hatibagan, Behala, BT Road, Sinthee More, Uttarpara, Kharagpur and Durgapur, Haldia and Bolpur.         
	The areas we are focussing on in Calcutta have a high Bengali population that wants goods at competitive prices. We are avoiding the heart of the city because there is hardly any car-parking space available, said RDB Group executive director Krishan Gopal Sinha.

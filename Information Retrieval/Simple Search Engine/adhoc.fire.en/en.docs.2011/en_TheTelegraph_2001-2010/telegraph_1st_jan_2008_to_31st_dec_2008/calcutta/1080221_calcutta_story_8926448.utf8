                      Tribute to language martyrs                    Kazi Nazrul Islams works articulate rebellion against oppression and its various faces. It was this spirit that led thousands of Bengalees to participate in the linguistic movement on February 21, 1952. Their protest against Nurul Amins oppressive administration in East Pakistan resulted in largescale arrests and deaths. The Language Movement gained impetus and February 21 became a red-letter day, observed as Language Martyrs Day. To mark the day, Upoma presents Bangla Bhasha Maa Amaar, felicitating Rabindrasangeet artistes Dwijen Mukhopadhyay, Ritu Guha, Sanghamitra Gupta, Abhirup Guha Thakurta, Pabitra Sarkar, Partha Ghosh and Gouri Ghosh. To be followed by a musical programme featuring Dwijen Mukhopadhyay, Sanghamitra Gupta and Abhirup Guha Thakurta. Students of London-based organisation Nupur will present Shakal Rasher Dhara (dir: Pompa Dhar). Courtesy: Anandabazar Patrika and Friends 91.9 FM.

                      Rooting for roaring comedy                    If life is just a stage, then we are all running around ad-libbing, with absolutely no clue what the plot is. Maybe thats why we dont know whether its a comedy or tragedy  Bill Watterson        Jokes apart Russell Peters, one of the worlds finest comedy superstars, is all set to tickle the funny bones of his audience across India as he performs live on his 20th anniversary tour. A home-coming of sorts for this artiste whose mothers family, going back to his great grandmother, was born in Calcutta, Peters brings Indian enthusiasm into his Canadian upbringing while he performs live on stage and keeps his dedicated audience engrossed with his wry and hang-it-all humour. Peters comedy focuses largely on his Canadian upbringing and racial stereotypes, as he often parodies his parents and South Asian culture. Much of his material explores the cultural divides between different ethnicities and upbringings in a way that includes many impressions. He has been nominated for various prestigious honours including four Gemini Awards. He has been featured in such shows as Montreals Just for Laughs (Juste Pour Rire) Comedy Festival, the Winnipeg Comedy Festival, and the Edinburgh Festival. In February this year, Peters became one of only a handful of comedians to ever headline and sell-out the world famous Madison Square Garden. This show is produced by DNA Entertainment in association with The Telegraph.            Event: Russell Peters 20th Anniversary Comedy Tour, Live When: October 23; 8 pm Where: Science City Auditorium

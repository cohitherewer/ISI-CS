The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Abductor identified by cops
                                                                                                               Abductor identified by cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Officers of Mumbai police on Thursday identified Sadab Siddique, arrested at Calcutta airport on March 19, as the one who had fled from their custody last year.        
	A four-member team from Mumbai told CID officers that Sadab and his men had been arrested on charges of abducting and raping a bar girl.        
	In Calcutta, Sadab was picked up allegedly for kidnapping Howrah-based coal trader Sriram Bochasia. The CID claimed that Sadab had freed the trader after receiving a ransom of Rs 23 lakh.        
	He also reportedly told the sleuths that he had plotted the murder of Sreeleathers owner Ashish Dey in Jamshedpur on November 2.        
	Sadabs arrest is a relief for us, said an officer of Mumbai police. Ever since he fled, his father, lodged in a Mumbai jail, had been accusing us of killing him.        
	The CID learnt from its Mumbai counterpart that Sadab had a house in Nasik, where he had married a couple of years ago.        
	In Calcutta, he had a girlfriend named Nidhi Singh. She is absconding with Rs 17 lakh, part of the ransom paid by Bochasias family, said a CID official.        
	Our prime job now is to track down Nidhi. We have sealed her apartment in Bangur Avenue where Sadab kept the ransom money. Our officers will also visit a few places in Jharkhand, said an officer working on the case.

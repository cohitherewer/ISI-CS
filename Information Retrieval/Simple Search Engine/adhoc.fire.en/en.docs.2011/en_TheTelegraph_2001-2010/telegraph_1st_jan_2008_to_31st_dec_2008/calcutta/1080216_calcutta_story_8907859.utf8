                                                                                                               Parents strangled son before suicide
          A STAFF REPORTER                          LAST RIDE: Three hearses carry the bodies of the Porels in Howrah on Friday, after a post-mortem. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	Prasenjit Porel was strangled, with his legs tied to the bed, and then hanged, a post-mortem on the 26-year-olds body has revealed.        
	His father Ramesh, 63, hanged himself and mother Aparna, 52, drank acid, the tests showed.        
	Police suspect the parents killed Prasenjit before taking their own lives.        
	The three were found dead in their Kaibartapara Lane home in Howrah on Thursday morning  Ramesh and Prasenjit hanging from hooks on the ceiling and Aparna lying on a bed. They died between 5am and 6am. Around Rs 4,290 was found in Rameshs pocket.        
	The couple had entered into a suicide pact following fears that Ramesh would be arrested on charges of financial irregularities brought by Ushangini Girls High School, where he was a clerk, said an officer.        
	Ramesh retired in September 2007 but the charges prompted the school to withhold the no-liability certificate, without which the government does not sanction pension.        
	An officer of the district police said: It seems the couple strangled Prasenjit with a wire while he was sleeping. To ensure that he did not put up any resistance, Ramesh and Aparna tied Prasenjits legs to the bed. After their son died, his body was hanged from the ceiling.        
	Prasenjit was probably in the dark about his parents plan. Neighbours and relatives with whom he interacted hours before the murder did not notice anything unusual in his behaviour, the officer said.        
	The family had dined on Wednesday, as traces of food were found in the stomachs of all three. Leftover chapati, rice and vegetables were found in one of the rooms of the double-storeyed building.        
	Sources said the financial irregularities came to light after Namita Sahu joined the school as head teacher in 2004. She got the accounts of the school from 2001 to 2004 audited. The auditors told the authorities that Ramesh was not producing a few vouchers and bills.        
	The school asked Ramesh to deposit the documents, but he allegedly refused.

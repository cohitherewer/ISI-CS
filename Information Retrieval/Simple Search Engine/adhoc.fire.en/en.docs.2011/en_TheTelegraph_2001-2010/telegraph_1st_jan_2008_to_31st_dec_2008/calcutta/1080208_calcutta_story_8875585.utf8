The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brisk poultry sales make a farce of ban
                                                                                                            Brisk poultry sales make a farce of ban
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	The ban is just a joke.        
	Eggs and chicken are available in markets across the city and on the fringes  only, the buyers have to pay more than the usual price.        
	The government on Tuesday had imposed an indefinite ban on the movement, sale and purchase of chickens, ducks, quails and eggs to contain the bird flu outbreak in the state.        
	Dont bother about the ban. We will provide you with as many eggs as you want. But you have to carry them at your risk and dont demand a bill, said a trader in Sealdah.        
	What if police make a surprise raid? Can the government prove that the eggs we are selling were laid by flu-infected chicken? The state doesnt have the means to carry out a scientific check. The ban lacks logic, he argued.        
	In the Sealdah market, a pair of poultry eggs is being sold at Rs 5.50, around a rupee more than the normal price.        
	Biswanath Das, another trader of the market, said the eggs they are selling are mostly from Andhra Pradesh, which has not been hit by avian flu. So, there is hardly any risk.        
	In the Maniktala market, chicken is available for bulk sale. We sell only dressed chicken. And it is packed so neatly that no one can tell from the outside, said a seller in Maniktala.        
	The trade in the banned items is on in Jagubabus Bazaar, too. The poultry on sale is not infected. So, there is nothing to fear, claimed a shop-owner.         
	In wholesale markets of Maniktala and Jagubabus Bazaar, the price of dressed chicken varies from Rs 70 to Rs 80 a kg. Pre-flu, it sold between Rs 60 and 70 a kg.        
	An official of the civic body-run New Market said poultry products are not available on their premises. But a visit to the market on Thursday proved the claim to be false (picture on right by Pradip Sanyal).        
	A team from state poultry farms association discussed the ban with finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Thursday. There will be another meeting on February 12. The ban may be lifted after that, said Jayanta Bhattacharya, of the group.

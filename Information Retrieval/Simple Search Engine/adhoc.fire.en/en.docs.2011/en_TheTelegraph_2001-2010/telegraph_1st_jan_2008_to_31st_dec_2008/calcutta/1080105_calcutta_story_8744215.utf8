The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All eyes on runaway bride   Jumbo fan club
                                                                                                            All eyes on runaway bride   Jumbo fan club
  - Elephant who stormed out of circus has jumbo fan club          SUBHAJOY ROY                          ROMANCE in the wild: Sabitri performs puja at a circus show at Sodepur. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Sourav Ganguly has a rival in popularity  that, too, on home ground  who is a good two feet taller and 2,450 kg heavier than Bengals biggest hero. Emblazoned on her grey-black jersey is the name children and adults call out to her by  Sabitri.        
	The female elephant that not so long ago trumpeted out of the Olympic Circus tent in Ranigunj  responding to a tuskers call  and romanced in the wild for a week before returning, is now the star of a circus in Sodepur, drawing thousands from near and far.        
	If Sourav ruled the Sydney Cricket Ground for a while on Friday morning, Sabitri has been the queen of the Goshala ground in Sodepur ever since the Olympic Circus set up camp on November 30. The circus is drawing 2,500 people for every house-full weekend show  all thanks to Sabitri and the games she plays.        
	To highlight their star performer, the circus managers have painted Sabitri on her flank, just like on a cricket jersey.                          
	We are running to full houses on Sundays because of her, says Ashim Bhowmick, the assistant manager of Olympic Circus. On weekdays, 60 per cent of the seats in the evening and night shows are always booked, he adds.        
	The excitement over Sabitri has also prompted some people rules to be relaxed. Usually, outsiders are not permitted to feed our animals, but bowing to public demand, visitors are being allowed to feed Sabitri some sugarcane.        
	The elephants fan club cuts across all age groups, but the children were the cheerleaders. I am so excited that Sabitri is here. I love her for what she did in Ranigunj. Her feats in the circus, too, are marvellous, said 12-year-old Payel Gupta, after watching Sabitri perform Ganesh puja and arati and then play cricket with fellow elephant Chanchal.        
	As soon as her show starts, Sabitris escapades in Ranigunj are recounted. Mahout Kalimuddin Sheikh had dared not restrain Sabitri, as she went on the rampage in her desperation to be with the tusker, fondly called Satyaban after the mythical character.        
	Sabitri has calmed down now, says Sadananda Panda, looking after her in the absence of Kalimuddin.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pradip Todi denied   bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The city sessions court that granted bail to Anil Saraogi in the Rizwanur case on Thursday refused bail to co-accused Pradip Todi on Friday.         
	After Saraogis bail, the lawyers representing Ashok Todi and his brother Pradip anticipated that their clients would soon be released as all three were facing similar charges.        
	But the court refused bail to Pradip Todi saying he had used money to break up the marriage of Rizwanur and Priyanka. This is a serious allegation, said the judge.        
	In the high court, Ashok Todis bail petition came up for hearing before Justice D.P. Sengupta, who was assigned the matter after the two judges of a high court division bench held different opinions on his bail.         
	The judge heard the submission of Todis lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi and adjourned the case to December 23.         
	All seven accused in the case appeared in the magistrates court and were asked to be present on December 17.        
	As the accused were being taken to court, a scuffle broke out on the premises. Later, two persons were arrested for assaulting journalists.         
	Police said Vikram Mehta, an employee of Anil Saraogi, and his associate Vivek Agarwal were arrested after a complaint was lodged with Hare Street police station.

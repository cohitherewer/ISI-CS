                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Suicide over birthday bash denial

	Paramita Dutta killed herself the day she turned 19, apparently because her parents turned down her wish to spend the occasion eating out with friends.        
	The girl, who passed her Higher Secondary examination this year and enrolled in an air hostess course, hanged herself in her Pashupati Bhattacharjee Road house, in Behala, late on Tuesday.        
	She apparently committed suicide following an altercation with her parents, who did not allow her to go out with friends for dinner. No suicide note was found. We are probing other aspects, too, said D.P Singh, the additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	Paramitas father Chittaranjan had retired from the army a few years ago and is working for a private company. Mother Meena is a homemaker. Paramitas elder sister is married and lives in Mumbai.        
	The parents had asked Paramita to invite her friends home but she insisted on going out. She spent her birthday alone in her house and had dinner with her parents around 10pm, said an officer.        
	Around 3am, father Chittaranjan woke up and found the door of Paramitas room half-open. He could not see much in the dark but it seemed to him that someone was standing in the room.        
	Chittaranjan switched on the light and was shocked to see Paramita hanging from the ceiling. As he raised an alarm, neighbours rushed in and took the girl to Vidyasagar Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.        
	Paramita was a bright student. The family has been living in the locality for the past 10 years and never had any problems with anybody, said neighbour Arati Chaki.        
	Paramitas parents refused to talk about the incident.

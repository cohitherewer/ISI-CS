	College entry schedules went haywire and examinations were hastily postponed after the Left Front and the Trinamul Congress uttered their favourite B word on Wednesday.        
	For the nearly 2.5 lakh students in the queue for college seats and those appearing for various undergraduate and post-graduate examinations, the back-to-back bandhs on Thursday and Friday could not have been more ill-timed.        
	The sudden deferment of exams scheduled for the next two days will affect our preparations for the papers that were to follow. Im already feeling distracted, said a B.Com Part I student of a college affiliated to Calcutta University.         
	Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Rabindra Bharati University and West Bengal University of Technology have been holding examinations since last month. Officials at West Bengal University of Technology said fresh dates for the BBA, BCA and BE exams would be announced later.        
	Jadavpur Universitys MBA and science examinations that were slated for Thursday will now be held on June 14. The management, however, did not fix alternative dates for the examinations that were to be held on Friday.         
	Rabindra Bharati University, too, did not give revised dates for the tests that were to be held on the bandh days.         
	The deputy controller of examinations in Calcutta University, Debashis Biswas, said the B.Com Part I paper slated for Friday would be held on June 12. Science practical tests that were to be held on Thursday and Friday have been postponed, though we will be able to announce fresh dates only after consulting the authorities of various colleges.         
	The 140-odd city colleges that began distributing admission forms on Monday were in a quandary, too, because most had planned to wrap up the process by early next week.         
	We have requested colleges to be flexible in their admission procedures because of the two-day disruption, Calcutta University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said.        
	Most of these colleges are likely to go beyond the deadline set by the university  first week of July  to complete all admissions. The last date for returning undergraduate admission forms for Jadavpur University has been extended from June 7 to 9.         
	Admission to Class XI in higher secondary schools were delayed as well. Dipak Das, the general secretary of the CPM-controlled West Bengal Government School Teachers Association, said the heads of all government schools had been requested to extend the last dates for returning admission forms.

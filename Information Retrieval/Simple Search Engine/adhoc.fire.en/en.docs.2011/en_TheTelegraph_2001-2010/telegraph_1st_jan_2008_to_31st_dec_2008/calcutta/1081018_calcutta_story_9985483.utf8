The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fever fight lacks sting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fever fight lacks sting
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                         
	Dengue and malaria have claimed several lives over the past few weeks but the state and civic health departments seem far from ready to tackle the vector-borne diseases.        
	Instead of drawing up a fool-proof plan to contain the outbreak, the agencies are busy passing the buck.        
	Health department officials claimed the civic body was keeping them in the dark about the prevalence of dengue and malaria.        
	We are not being told about the new cases. In the absence of an information sharing system, we are not being able to gauge the severity of the outbreak, said an expert at the Indian Council for Medical Research, one of the two nodal institutes for monitoring the spread of vector-borne diseases in the city.         
	The School of Tropical Medicine (STM) is the other nodal centre.        
	The other problems hampering the fight against fever include lack of enough personnel and medical kits to test blood samples. We dont have enough people to join the medical teams that are touring the affected areas. There are also not enough medical kits, said an STM official.        
	Chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay denied that the civic body was ill-prepared to tackle the situation. We have launched a drive to make people aware of the vector-borne diseases. Our technicians have been trained.        
	Government sources said five people have died of dengue in the city and adjoining districts in the past two weeks, while malaria has claimed one life. Many people on the southern fringes and Howrah are suffering from an unknown fever, with symptoms similar to that of chikunguniya.

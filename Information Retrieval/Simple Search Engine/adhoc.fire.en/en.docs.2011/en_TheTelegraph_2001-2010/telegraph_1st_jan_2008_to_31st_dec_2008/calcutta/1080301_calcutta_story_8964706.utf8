The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Screen star not out of danger
                                                                                                               Screen star not out of danger

	Suchitra Sen is not out of danger.        
	This was spelt out by the medical board set up to treat the screen legend at Belle Vue Clinic on Friday. She was admitted late on Monday with chest infection and symptoms of dehydration.        
	Subrata Maitra, leading the team of three doctors, said: She is better but she is not out of danger... She is stable but the breathlessness still continues.        
	Daughter Moon Moon told Metro: She is still the same.         
	The 77-year-old reclusive star, who has shunned the public eye for over 30 years, is on antibiotics, support systems, nebuliser, steroids and oxygen supply.        
	The official medical bulletin on Friday stated: Suchitra Sens medical condition remains stable. Although her general condition is slightly better, she still remains breathless. She is on combination antibiotic therapy, along with other supportive measures. She has started taking normal diet by mouth.        
	Though she has been prescribed normal diet according to her liking, she hardly has an appetite and is sticking to liquids and semi-solids. We are optimistic, added Maitra.        
	A source said she was suffering from lung congestion and pain in the knee, for which physiotherapy will begin. Only if the oxygen saturation level can be maintained at 95 per cent without oxygen support for 48 hours, will she be declared out of danger.        
	Asked to compare her medical status now with that of her stay in Belle Vue last October, CEO Pradip Tondon said: Her condition is worse than last time. If a patient her age suffers from breathlessness, it means it is serious.        
	Sen is not speaking much, except enquiring about her medical condition. The security cordon at the clinic has been strengthened and the veil of secrecy drawn even tighter.

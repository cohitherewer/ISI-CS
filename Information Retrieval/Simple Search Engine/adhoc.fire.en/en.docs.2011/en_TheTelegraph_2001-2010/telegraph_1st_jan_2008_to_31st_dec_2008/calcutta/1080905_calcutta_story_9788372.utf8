                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       High court denies stay in Riz case 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday refused to restrain the CBI from filing chargesheets against three police officers accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The plea for the stay was filed by lawyers representing Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das, who challenged the legality of Justice Dipankar Duttas August 14 ruling asking the CBI to file chargesheets against seven accused in the case.        
	Justice Dutta had stayed the implementation of the verdict for three weeks, till September 7. But the appeals before the division bench will next come up for hearing on September 9. So, the stay should be extended, the lawyer of one of the officers argued before Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Maharaja Sinha.        
	Though the judges refused to extend the stay, CBI counsel Ranjan Roy said the agency would not file chargesheets against the officers till the next hearing. I am assuring the officers that the chargesheets will not be filed before September 9, said Roy.        
	Appearing for Rizwanurs family, lawyer Kalyan Banerjee said the trial court had made some serious observations against former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and former deputy commissioner (headquarter) Gyanwant Singh.         
	The CBI should be allowed to file chargesheets against the two as well, he pleaded.

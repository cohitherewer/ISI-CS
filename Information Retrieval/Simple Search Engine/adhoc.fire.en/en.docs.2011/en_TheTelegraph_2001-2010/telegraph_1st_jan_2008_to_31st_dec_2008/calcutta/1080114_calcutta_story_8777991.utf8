	My head is down in shame and anger. Accidents can happen, but the carelessness with which the state government has handled the fire has no parallel. Our chief minister is inviting investments daily, but what picture of Calcutta is he showing the world? Thousands of traders helplessly watched their shops and godowns being gutted while Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his colleagues were busy with a party rally. The blaze also laid bare the inefficacy of the fire department. The firemen did not even have long enough ladders. There are many buildings in Calcutta, higher than Nandaram market. What if they catch fire?
    
	Mahendra Kejriwal,

 Nimtala Ghat Street
      
	I am shattered to see my neighbourhood in flames. Lack of planning and management is the reason for which the fire is raging after 36 hours. Political leaders are visiting the site and making statements but doing nothing. Everyone is saying that there is shortage of water, but there are at least four pipelines at Pagyapatti and two on Brabourne Road that connect to the Hooghly. Water could also have been drawn from Mullick Ghat and the Manohardas Katra reservoir. 
 
	Neha Choudhury,

 Synagogue Street
      
	A worker at my factory, next to the Nandaram complex, called me around 2.30am on Friday. I rushed to the spot and found only two fire tenders had arrived, even though the blaze started around 1am. The delay by the fire department proved disastrous.
    
	Safi Jauhar,

 Ripon Street
      
	 My godown in Tirpalpatti was gutted in the blaze. There has been some foul play. Had the fire department reacted in time, the loss could have been contained.
 
	Rajiv Jain,

 Howrah
   
	These markets are illegal and do not have fire-fighting equipment. The traders bribe the civic officials and run their shops. There are many illegal markets in Burrabazar but nobody is concerned.
 
	Rinku Shaw,

 Jamunalal Bajaj Street

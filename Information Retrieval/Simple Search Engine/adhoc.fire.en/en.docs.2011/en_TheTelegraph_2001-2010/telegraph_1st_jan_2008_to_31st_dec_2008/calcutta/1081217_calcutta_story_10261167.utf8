                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Youth with 12 SIM cards
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Howrah youth in whose name a cellphone service provider had issued a dozen prepaid SIM cards, 11 of which he claimed to be clueless about, was questioned by police on Tuesday.         
	Vodafone, the service provider, sent an official to 25-year-old Naren Dass Shibpur home when a verification process, started on police recommendation after the Mumbai siege, brought to light the number of SIM cards issued in his name, said cops.        
	Das told the official that he had no clue about the SIM cards other than the one he was using and later lodged a police complaint.        
	Policemen rang the 11 numbers. Nine of the phones were switched off. Of the two calls that were answered, Abhijit Saha of Jangipara in Hooghly said he had bought the SIM from a shop in Singur. The other person did not identify himself and only said he was a resident of Mandirtala in Shibpur.        
	We are looking into the matter and will contact Vodafone in this regard, said Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh.         
	The scan on prepaid subscribers has revealed numerous other instances of discrepancies in data provided by SIM card buyers. The service providers have disconnected thousands of phones over the past week.        
	After the citys SIM card link with the terrorists involved in the Mumbai siege was unearthed, deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim requested all cellphone service providers to verify the data provided by their customers.         
	Shamim said the service providers had stopped issuing pre-activated SIM cards after the meeting. All the 32 SIM cards which were procured from the city and reached the terrorists hands were pre-activated.        
	Buyers will now have to wait for a couple of days for their data to be verified before their SIM card is activated.        
	We are verifying the details of all subscribers, said a spokesperson for Tata Teleservices Ltd. Representatives of the other companies echoed her, though verifying the entire list of cellphone subscribers is an uphill task.         
	As of November 2008, the city has 68,13,062 GSM cellphone users. Telecom industry sources said the verification could take months to complete. Fifteen per cent of the subscribers face disconnection owing to discrepancies. The companies are under pressure to penalise retailers since SIM card sellers overlooked most of the discrepancies.

	The bull run continued for host St Xaviers College at the annual campus economic summit Confluence, held over two days from Friday.        
	From mock stock trading to quizzing, students from the host institution proved their mettle in various competitions designed to test their knowledge of economic theories and ability to apply them to real-life situations.         
	The summit had begun with a team competition called Concatenation, where the participants were required to choose from four topics to write papers on. A panel of judges chose 20 papers for the final round, which Bidhannagar College won with a dissertation on the Implications of the Political Economy of Oil on India.         
	The other three topics were Strategies for Industrialisation in India, Stock Market in India: Its Growth and Prospects, and WTO, Agriculture Subsidy and Farmers  Rural India under Reform.         
	The team from St Xaviers College won Concordance, the collage-making competition where teams had to work on the theme India Unbound: Changing Contours.        
	We were given an A4 sheet of paper to work on. We pasted two maps of India on either side of the paper and depicted how India has evolved, using pictures of flyovers, shopping malls, traffic jams and beggars in such a way that one looked like a shadow of the other, said Anushree Kejriwal, a second-year student of economics.        
	The second day started with Congruence, the Economics Crossword. St Xaviers was the winner in this competition, too. The other event of the day was a panel discussion on Environmental Challenges: India in Global Perspective. The second panel discussion was on corporate-academia interfacing.         
	St Xaviers principal P.C. Matthew was the moderator.        
	Preyoshi Ganguly, a third-year economics student of the host institution, won Conquest, a quiz on the subject. Megha Bagaria, another Xaverian, was adjudged the best debator in Conflict. The topic was whether development programmes in India were anti-poor.        
	St Xaviers also won Conjecture, the mock trading event that was introduced this year. Bidhannagar College was the first runner-up and Presidency College and Scottish Church were tied in third position.        
	Confluence is about providing a platform for students to interact with academia and industry, and we achieved that, said an organiser.

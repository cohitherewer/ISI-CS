                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Exam date showdown in Jadavpur 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Teachers and students of Jadavpur Universitys engineering faculty are heading for a showdown over the dates of the next semester exams.        
	At a meeting of the universitys executive committee on Wednesday, teachers said they would not frame academic calendars if the students stuck to their demand that the tests be deferred to the first week of December.        
	The exams were initially scheduled on November 14. But the students demanded a postponement, arguing that many departments had not completed their syllabi.        
	In response to the students demand, the teachers in the executive committee agreed to postpone the tests to November 24. The teachers said the exams should be completed by December 6 so that classes for the next semester could begin from December 8. The students, however, refused to accept the teachers proposal.        
	The teacher members have given their opinion to the council. Now it is up to the authorities to decide on the matter, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher of the engineering faculty.        
	Why should we waste our time preparing the academic calendars if we have to act according to the students convenience? said another teacher.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Lawyers of the high court have asked for a say in the process of shortlisting candidates for vacant judges posts to ensure that only the most deserving among them are chosen.        
	The high court administration should consult lawyers representatives before nominating anyone, said Bidyut Kiran Mukherjee, the president of the high court bar association.        
	He said lawyers were very often blamed for the appointment of allegedly undeserving judges despite them having no role to play in the process.        
	A panel of three senior judges compiles the list of prospective candidates. Once the state government gives its approval, the names are sent to the Supreme Court, where another panel of judges scrutinises the list and forwards it to the Centre. The President finalises the appointments.        
	Bar association secretary Asish Roy admitted that questions were being raised about the credentials of a few judges appointed recently. I do not want to comment further on this issue. But I am convinced that lawyers of the court need to be involved in the process of appointments, he added.        
	Lawyers and bar councils have been demanding a transparent appointment process over the past couple of years. The forum of state advocates-general has recommended the formation of a panel to assess the performance of judges.        
	The high court has been functioning with 40 judges, 18 short of the sanctioned number.  
	RECRUIT NORM

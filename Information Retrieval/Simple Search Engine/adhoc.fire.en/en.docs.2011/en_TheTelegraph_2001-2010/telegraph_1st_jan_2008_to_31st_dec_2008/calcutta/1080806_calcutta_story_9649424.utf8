                      Unconventional collages                    Blessed with the ability to discover and reveal the richness of life around her, Shakila creates sensitive and powerful visual reflections of humanity in an original, unconventional way. Tearing and pasting paper from magazines, her collages emerge from the basic human desire to build and communicate. The simple act of tearing paper by hand (there is no preliminary drawing or cutting with knife involved) lends a physical immediacy to both her small and sculptural pieces. Whereas her earlier work was more narrative, depicting people in pastoral landscapes, her current body of work, on display at the ongoing solo show of her recent creations, is larger in scale, sculptural and more abstract. It also portrays the darker side of life, specially the victimisation of women in our society. Her unique raw material is another means of infusing her pieces with social and art-historical matter. Form and content critical to her creative process, her large installation pieces make serious social statements. Defying and tearing all conventions, Shakila brings a competitive edge to the art of creating collages.                  Event: An exhibition of recent works by Shakila When: Till August 9; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: CIMA Gallery, 43 Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

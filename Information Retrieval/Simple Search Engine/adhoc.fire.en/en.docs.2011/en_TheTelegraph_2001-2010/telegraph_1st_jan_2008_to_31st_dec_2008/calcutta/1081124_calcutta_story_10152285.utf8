The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lack of beds plagues state-run hospitals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lack of beds plagues state-run hospitals

	Anup Mullick, the fisherman who was injured after being attacked by a tiger in the Sunderbans last Friday, did not get a bed at SSKM Hospital till Sunday.        
	Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty, who survived the train mishap in Belgharia last Wednesday, was kept on a trolley at NRS Medical College and Hospital for three days before he finally got a bed.        
	Lying on the floor or on a trolley because of a shortage of beds is not just painful for critical patients. There is also a risk of acquiring infections.        
	It has become a system in state-run hospitals to keep some patients on the floor. Even a critical patient like Anup Mullick could not be provided a bed, said a doctor at SSKMs neurology department.        
	Mullick was attacked by the tiger while he was catching crabs in a Matla tributary. His left ear was severed and he also suffered head, shoulder and neck injuries.        
	In severe pain, Mullick was lying on the floor of SSKMs New Casualty Block. There are high chances of infection if he remains there. But there is no option, said a doctor.         
	At least three beds are vacant in the block, but the hospital authorities said those were reserved for blast victims.        
	A shortage of beds at NRS Hospital forced Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty to lie on a trolley for three days with broken ribs and femur bone.        
	Brought to the hospital on Wednesday, he was allotted a bed in the surgical ward only on Friday.        
	Doctors kept saying there were no beds, said Sumits elder brother Subir Ranjan.        
	There is great pressure on state-run medical colleges in the city as patients are referred there from across the state. Since we try not to refuse patients, some of them have to be kept on the floor or trolleys till a bed is available. There is no alternative, said a health department official.

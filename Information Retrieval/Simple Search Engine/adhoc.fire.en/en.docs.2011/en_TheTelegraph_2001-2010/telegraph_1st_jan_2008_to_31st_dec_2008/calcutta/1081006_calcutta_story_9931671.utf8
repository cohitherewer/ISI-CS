                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Group of 35 taken for a ride
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Thirty-five holidaymakers have been taken for a ride by a city-based travel agent, Chhabi Roy, whom they had hired for a puja trip to Nepal.        
	The tourists, who had paid advance ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000 to the agent, came to know on reaching Howrah station on Sunday that their tickets had been cancelled the previous day.        
	The group filed a complaint with the Government Railway Police (GRP) against Choudhury Special, run by Roy, a resident of Kalighat Road. Another complaint was lodged with Kalighat police.        
	Pabitra Ghosh, the officer-in-charge of the Howrah GRP, said: A complaint has been received against Choudhury Special, a travel agency on Kalighat Road.        
	Those who had booked berths for the 10-day trip, from October 5 to 14, were issued receipts for the advance. A week ago, they had been given photocopies of second-class tickets for the Mithila Express, which leaves Howrah at 3.45pm.        
	Most members of the group reached the station by 2pm and assembled near platform No. 8, where a representative of the travel agency was supposed to wait with a banner. But none could be seen.        
	Banibrata Maity, 35, a resident of Baruipur, had paid Rs 50, 000 in advance for 25 members of his family. We became suspicious after failing to spot anyone from the agency at the station. We then checked the reservation lists but our names were missing, said Banibrata.        
	My daughter started crying on learning that our Nepal tour had been been cancelled, said college teacher Prajnamoy Pal.

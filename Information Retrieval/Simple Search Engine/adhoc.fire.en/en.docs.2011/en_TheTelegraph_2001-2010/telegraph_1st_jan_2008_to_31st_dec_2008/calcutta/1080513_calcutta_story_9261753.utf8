          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have come across the names of eight more alleged victims of Subhradeb Saha Chowdhury, arrested last week on charges of defrauding credit card holders of lakhs.        
	The unemployed youth from Chandernagore had withdrawn around Rs 10 lakh with the credit cards of these eight people, said an investigating officer.        
	These eight approached senior officers at Lalbazar following Saha Chowdhurys arrest last Tuesday. They claimed that they had been defrauded of amounts ranging from Rs 55,000 to Rs 2.16 lakh.        
	They not only lodged complaints with us but also identified Saha Chowdhury, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department). The youth allegedly collected the personal identification numbers (PINs) of the credit cards on the pretext of upgrading them.        
	According to the sleuths, Saha Chowdhury had earlier withdrawn more than Rs 2 lakh from ATMs using the credit card of Tollygunge resident Shantanu Prasanna Mukherjee.         
	Twenty-five credit cards and a database containing the the names, telephone numbers and addresses of around 500 credit card holders were seized from him.        
	Elaborating on Saha Chowdhurys modus operandi, an officer said: The youth had appointed a woman who would call up a card holder, identifying herself as an executive of the bank that had issued the card. She offered to upgrade the cards and those who agreed to the proposal were told that an executive from the bank would visit them.        
	Saha Chowdhury then met his intended victims, took down their personal details and finally collected the cards. The woman would call up the victims again and ask them if they would like to change the PIN or retain it after the upgrade.        
	Those who did not want to change the PINs were asked to divulge their numbers. Once the PINs were known, Saha Chowdhury went on defrauding the victims, said deputy commissioner Shamim.         
	He refused to divulge the name of the woman accomplice of the youth.

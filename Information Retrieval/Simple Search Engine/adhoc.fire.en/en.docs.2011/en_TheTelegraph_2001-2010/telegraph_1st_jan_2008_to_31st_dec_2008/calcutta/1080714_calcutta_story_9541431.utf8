	Piles of complaints about food quality at NRS Medical College and Hospital have pushed the authorities into taking action.        
	An internal panel set up to assess the quality of food served to patients by a private agency has found it to be alarming.         
	Both the quality and quantity of food are unacceptable. Vegetables, fish, meat and milk are of particularly poor standard. Rotten vegetables and stale fish and meat are often given to patients. Also, fish and meat are not served regularly, in violation of the contract, said a senior hospital official who is part of the panel.        
	Acting on its report, the hospital deducted about Rs 1 lakh from the bill handed over by the agency for the period March to May. Panel members went on surprise visits to the kitchen and wards, said L.K. Ghosh, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	Debasish Ghosh, an official of the private agency, said the allegations were not entirely baseless but the company was helpless since prices have skyrocketed.         
	On an average, there are about 1,700 patients in various wards of the hospital. According to an estimate, about 1,300 of them depend on hospital food. The food budget is about Rs 1.4 crore, which makes it Rs 28.50 for providing breakfast and two meals to a patient each day.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The state government is working on a set of rules to rein in private English-medium schools that are charging exorbitant fees.        
	The move follows complaints from the guardians of the students of several schools that have hiked their fees.        
	We must have an act empowering the government to take action against a private school that is charging exorbitant fees, said school education minister Partha Dey.        
	Even unaided schools do not have the freedom to increase fees as much as they want, he added.        
	Dey, however, clarified that the government had no intention of interfering in the daily administrative functioning of the private schools.        
	The proposed piece of legislation will empower the government to intervene only when there are complaints of gross irregularities, such as excessive fee hikes or illegal dismissal of employees, the minister clarified.        
	The state government had decided last year to formulate an act to regulate all categories of private schools. A draft act was prepared but the Centre is yet to approve it. We are in touch with the Centre about the proposed act, said an official in the school education department.        
	Hike reversed: Bowing to pressure from the guardians, Pratt Memorial School on Wednesday decided to reverse its decision to enhance the fees.        
	Till March, we were required to pay Rs 3,435 quarterly and Rs 5,935 annually as tuition fees. The quarterly fee has been hiked to Rs 5,995 and the annual fee to Rs 11,395, said the mother of a Class VI student.        
	A hike was necessary as we are upgrading our facilities, but the guardians demand has prompted us to consider lowering the rates, said a school official. The guardians had been demonstrating at the school, demanding a rollback.

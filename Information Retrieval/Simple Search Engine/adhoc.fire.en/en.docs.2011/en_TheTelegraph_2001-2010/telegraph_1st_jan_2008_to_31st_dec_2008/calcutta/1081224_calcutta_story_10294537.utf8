The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trade scores over tension 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Trade scores over tension 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	For Muhammad Arshad Alam, the location of the Industrial India Trade Fair (IITF) is of greater concern than the mounting tension between India and Pakistan.        
	A resident of Karachi, Alam has braved the turbulent times in the wake of the Mumbai attacks to set up a stall of onyx items at the EM Bypass fair.        
	Alam is aware of the economic slowdown, which has pared customers ability to splurge on expensive items like onyx. He only hopes that the footfall at the fair is enough to keep the cash register ringing. I hope there will be many visitors. What do you think? Alam asked.        
	He fondly remembers the brisk business he did when the fair was held on the Maidan.        
	The decision to visit Calcutta post 26/11 was a tough call, he said. Only six or seven of us dared to come. There were 300 of us at the trade fair on Pragati Maidan in New Delhi in November.        
	Alam got his visa before the Mumbai attacks but Rao Abdul Wasays father was not so lucky. Wasay has also set up an onyx stall at the fair, which was inaugurated by the chief minister, but it seems his father will miss it. The organisers, however, said the Indian embassy might issue some more visas on Wednesday.        
	Asked what made him come despite the mounting bilateral tension, Wasay said: I am a trader. My track record is clean. What is there for me to worry about?        
	The traders, however, dont feel safe venturing out of Calcutta and have decided not to visit Mumbai and Chennai. Will they come next year? Zaroor, said Alam and Wasay.

                      Infusing life into metal                    The works of renowned sculptor Meera Mukherjee (1923 - 1998) are imprints of the artists life-long search for the spirit of Vishwakarma, the divine technocrat and maker of the universe. She searches for connections between various aspects of Buddhist practices and its influence on traditional crafts and on the artisan community in general. The world of indigenous metal craftsmanship of the sub-continent was familiar to Mukherjee and formed the very basis of her artistic content. Her virtuosity in metal works and her ability to improvise in indigenous method of metal casting through combining it with the European wax process (now extinct) of casting metal made her works look impressive. Mukherjee would combine myth, history and her memories of the various elements of nature into a meaningful metaphor. This often gave her pieces multiple points of view. At times, her works depict a spatial expansion constituting a layered, complex narration. This is considered an achievement, particularly in sculpture since the discipline, unlike painting, seldom looks at the physical expansion of either riverscape or landscape. All said and done, Mukherjees works are a continuation of a rich artistic legacy that is relevant and modern even today.

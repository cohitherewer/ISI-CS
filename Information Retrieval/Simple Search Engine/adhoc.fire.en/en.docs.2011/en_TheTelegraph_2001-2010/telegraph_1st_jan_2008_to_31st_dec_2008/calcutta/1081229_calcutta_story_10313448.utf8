The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe into patient death
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Probe into patient death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state health department has ordered a probe into 76-year-old Kanak Kumar Auddys death at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday after he was allegedly left untreated for two hours as his relatives fell Rs 50 short of the admission fee.        
	There is a standing order to all state-run hospitals that treatment of a patient should be started even if his relatives cannot pay the entire admission fee for paid beds. We will probe the incident, said S.N. Banerjee, the director of medical education, on Sunday.         
	S.K. Saha, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital, had claimed on Saturday that the rule was to pay the entire fee before admission.         
	Banerjee stressed on Sunday that nothing was more important than saving a patients life. It is unfortunate that hospital officials were concerned about Rs 50. In meetings with hospital superintendents, the issue has been discussed many times, said a health department official.        
	When Kanak Kumar started having trouble breathing on Wednesday morning, his brother Arun and nephew Ujjal rushed him to the emergency ward of the hospital.        
	A doctor recommended that he be admitted to the male medicine ward. Kanak Kumars oxygen support was withdrawn during the shift.        
	Only paid beds were available in the male medicine ward. Arun had Rs 100 on him, Rs 50 short of the admission fee. He repeatedly requested the ward master to admit his brother and start treatment while Ujjal got the remaining amount from their home in nearby Gorachand Road.

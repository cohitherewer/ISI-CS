  - Emergency meeting called          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The College Street campus of Calcutta University                                        
	Calcutta Universitys decision to consider holding supplementary tests for examinees who have not cleared a paper in BA and B.Sc Part I and Part II examinations has sparked controversy on the campus.        
	Teachers of colleges affiliated to the university and members of its undergraduate council and syndicate feel holding supplementary examinations will set a bad precedent and disrupt the schedule of next years undergraduate examinations.        
	An emergency meeting of the undergraduate council has been convened on December 2 following a demand for supplementary tests by examinees who had failed in a paper.         
	There is no provision for supplementary examination in the university rules. The examinees should have been aware of this. It is strange that the authorities have called an emergency meeting to consider the demand of a group of students, said a senior member of the universitys syndicate.        
	Nearly 250 BA and B.Sc Part I and Part II (1+1+1 pattern) examinees demonstrated on the College Street campus after publication of the examination results last week. A Part I examinee who fails in a paper can appear for it again the next year, along with Part II. But Part II examinees need to clear all papers to appear in Part III.        
	I have scored more than 50 per cent in both my Bengali (honours) papers but got only 14 out of 100 in political science in Part I. The Part II syllabus is extremely long. How will I manage if I have to study the whole of Part II syllabus and the Part I political science syllabus next year, said a student.        
	Part II examinees have demanded supplementary examinations so that they dont lose a year.        
	CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee admitted that there is no provision for supplementary examination. The demand of the students will be placed before the council on December 2. We will take a final decision on the matter on the basis of the meeting, he added.

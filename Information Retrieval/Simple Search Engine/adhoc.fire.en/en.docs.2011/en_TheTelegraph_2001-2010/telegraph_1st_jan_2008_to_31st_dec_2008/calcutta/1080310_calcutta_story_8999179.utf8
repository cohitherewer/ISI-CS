                                                                                                               Kin join cry for justice 
  - RIZ FRIENDS HOLD RALLY          A STAFF REPORTER                          A blaring microphone and raised fists demand justice in the Rizwanur Rahman death case. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Rizwanur Rahmans mother is still waiting for the justice that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had promised her after her sons mysterious death.        
	Refuting the CBI finding that the computer graphics teacher had committed suicide, Kishwar Jahan said: I am still waiting to see my sons killers punished. When chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee visited our house after the Todis murdered my son, he promised that the killers would be brought to book. But justice is eluding us.        
	She was speaking at a Trinamul Congress-backed rally, organised by some friends of Rizwanur, near her Tiljala Lane home on Sunday.        
	Despite the CBI report, the Rahmans are convinced that Rizwanur, who had married Priyanka Todi against the wishes of her family, had been murdered. There was no reason for him to commit suicide, said elder brother Rukbanur.        
	He also criticised the CBI for recommending only departmental action against former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh, who had played a crucial role in separating Rizwanur and Priyanka.        
	The CBI has failed to explain why it held Rizwanurs death a suicide and not a murder. The state government, exploiting its clout at the Centre, had influenced the probe to protect the tainted officers who are close to the CPM, said Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee.

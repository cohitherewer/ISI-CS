          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A speeding private bus on route 3C/1 knocked down a middle-aged lady doctor at the crossing of Amherst Street and Surya Sen Street on Thursday afternoon.        
	Anima Dasgupta, 68, was taken to Medical College and Hospital but she could not be saved. The driver of the killer bus fled.        
	As news of the accident spread, residents put up a roadblock at the intersection in protest against the polices failure to curb reckless driving. The blockade was lifted after senior police officers intervened.        
	Dasgupta, a resident of Srigopal Mullick Lane in Bowbazar, was crossing the road when the bus hit her from behind. She slumped on the road and the bus, which was headed south, sped away, an officer of the traffic police department.

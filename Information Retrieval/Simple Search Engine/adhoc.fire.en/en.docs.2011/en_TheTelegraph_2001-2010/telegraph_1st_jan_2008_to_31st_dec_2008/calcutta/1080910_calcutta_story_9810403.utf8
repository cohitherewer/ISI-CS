                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       State plea against Riz verdict
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government on Tuesday moved the high court challenging the judgment that allowed the CBI to proceed with criminal cases against seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta had accepted the preliminary findings of the CBI, according to which Ashok Todi, his brother Pradip, their relative Anil Saraogi, three officers of Calcutta police and a family friend of the Rahmans had abetted Rizwanurs suicide.        
	According to the government, the court should not have taken cognisance of the findings since they had not been proved.        
	Advocate S. Pal, who represented the accused police officers, told the bench on Tuesday: The trial judge cannot allow the CBI to initiate criminal proceedings against my clients on the basis of the preliminary findings of an inquiry by the agency.        
	The judges said they did not want to hear the advocate and pass an interim stay on Justice Duttas judgment. Let the paper book of the case be ready. We will hear the appeal and dispose it. There is no need for any interim stay.         
	Pal wanted the judges to hear him before taking a decision.        
	The hearing will resume on Wednesday.

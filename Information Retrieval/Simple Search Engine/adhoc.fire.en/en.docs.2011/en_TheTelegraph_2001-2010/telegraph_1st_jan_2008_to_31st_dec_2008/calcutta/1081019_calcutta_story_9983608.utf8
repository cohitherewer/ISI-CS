										      Flashback                        R.N. Dutt amp; Son in Dalhousie Square. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                           
	At a time when money is in the news for all the wrong reasons, a tiny office tucked away on the groundfloor of Stephen House in Dalhousie Square has been ceaselessly doing business in varicoloured currency from all over the world.         
	Dealers in foreign currency abound in the city today, but R.N. Dutt amp; Son (P) Ltd has been around since late 19th century, and their fourth generation business is still going strong.         
	Bhutnath Dutt tells the story of how his father, whose picture hangs in the Stephen House shop, got the brainwave of starting a business in exchanging foreign currency when the Brits held sway over Indian business.         
	Bhutnath is 83 but he has a clear memory and is a natural raconteur. He says his father, Radha Nath Dutt, was once promenading in the Calcutta port area when he came upon some foreign crew members besieged by urchins. The area used to be very well maintained as it used to be the gateway to the region.        
	However, both the foreigners and the urchins were talking Greek to each other. They were incomprehensible to each other and Radha Nath decided to help them.         
	The crew members told him that their next port of call was Singapore and they were looking for a particular kind of safety pin.         
	But they did not have much time in hand as their ship would set sail by a certain date. Dutt was shown a sample of the safety pins and he decided to produce replicas any which way.         
	Bhutnath says: My father was a very hardworking man and he actually managed to get them replicated. Entry within ships was restricted but the crew members managed to convince the captain to allow my father to embark the ship. He showed them the safety pins and the foreigners were so overwhelmed that they literally showered him with cash. But since it was foreign currency it was of no value to him.        
	However, a Bengali man, who overheard their exchange, convinced my father to return after a few days when the sailors would have earned enough Indian currency. My father did so, and the sailors paid him about 300 times what he had actually spent.        
	It was then that a friend of my fathers, who was accompanying him, suggested that he start a business in exchanging foreign currency as that was in great demand.        
	So Radha Nath began his business in 1887, long before the exchange control department had started.         
	My father had no money and my mother gave him her ornaments to start his business. Then slowly he built up his capital. In those days he made a profit of five annas on Rs 13, and that was a lot of money. We opened shop there  at India Market, near Fancy Market  but of late it has been remodelled. This is the original shop and it continues to flourish.        
	When I joined the trade the port area had already gone to seed. Detritus and goods were strewn all around and one could easily stumble and fall. I was about 15. Even when he made a profit of only Rs 200 a month my father used to think he was a rich man. All over India there were six dealers authorised by the Reserve Bank of India  three in Calcutta, one in Madras and two in Bombay. We did roaring business after Independence when many Indians were hounded out of countries like Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon. Those countries did not have currencies of their own yet so Government of Pakistan was printed on the white section of an Indian currency note, says Bhutnath.        
	His son, Ajay Dutt, who has taken charge, says they have another branch at the Sarat Bose Road-Lake Road junction.         
	Last March he shut down the shop inside the port area  only cargo ships use it today, and passenger ships have avoided the port for long.        
	Calcutta Port Trust had allowed them to open shop at the point where the ships were anchored to facilitate transactions.        
	Ajay Dutt, 59, joined the business in 1969, and before that in 1952, the branch in Stephen House had opened. Now his son, Debasish, continues the tradition.       SOUMITRA DAS

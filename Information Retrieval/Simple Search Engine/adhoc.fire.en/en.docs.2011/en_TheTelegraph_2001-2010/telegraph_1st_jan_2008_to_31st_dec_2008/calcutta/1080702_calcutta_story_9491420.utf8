                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Panel to study CU overhaul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Calcutta University: Soul search. A Telegraph picture		    
	Calcutta University (CU) on Tuesday decided to frame a comprehensive policy to overhaul its administration.        
	The universitys highest policy-making body, the syndicate, set up a four-member panel to study the proposals for the overhaul and prepare a report within two months.        
	The exercise will include rationalisation of the staff transfer policy. The committee has been examining ways to ensure optimum utilisation of manpower, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	The university now transfers non-teaching employees from one department to another at regular intervals. The administrative functioning often gets affected because of this, said an official.        
	For instance, publication of results is hampered when some employees of the examination department are transferred while the process of preparing results is on.        
	The committee will conduct a survey to identify the flaws of the existing policy. If necessary, we will amend the university statute, said Das.        
	The syndicate-appointed committee will study the possibility of creating more posts for better management of the university. There is a proposal to create posts for a public relations officer and a placement officer.        
	The panel will also examine ways to decentralise the decision-making process to save time. For instance, according to the proposals, the approval of the pro vice-chancellor (academic) will be enough to introduce an endowment lecture.        
	Now, only the vice-chancellor can grant such approvals.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Thirty-two Myanmarese nationals were arrested at Calcutta railway station on Wednesday on the charge of infiltration.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that the group, including four women and three children, had come via Bangladesh and was headed for Jammu.        
	The Myanmarese crossed the Indian border at Basirhat. A local tout, Monirul, who they paid Rs 300, brought them to Sealdah, from where they reached Calcutta station by bus hoping to catch the Jammu Tawi Express.        
	The police got suspicious about the Myanmarese after seeing them loitering in a group. We seized some Myanmarese currency notes from them, said Barun Mullick, the superintendent of railway police.        
	The illegal immigrants claimed they were going to Jammu in search of jobs.        
	Toy gun thief: A man who had allegedly robbed shopowners at gunpoint over the past few weeks was arrested on Wednesday. The gun turned out to be a toy.        
	Harshjit Singh, 39, was entering a cellphone store on Shakespeare Sarani on Wednesday morning when the staff of an adjacent garment store recognised him and grabbed him. Singh was later arrested and stolen items worth thousands of rupees were seized from him. Singh had allegedly robbed the garment store on December 12.        
	IIM stipend hike: The IIM, Calcutta, has raised the monthly stipend of Ph.D students from Rs 20,000 to Rs 24,000. The scholars will also receive an annual contingency grant of Rs 20,000 and other benefits.        
	Court approval: The high court on Thursday gave conditional approval to the civic bodys plan to construct a water treatment plant on a 29-acre plot on the Bypass. Construction work should be eco-friendly, a division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held for wife murder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Youth held for wife murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A youth whom police suspected to have been responsible for his wifes unnatural death has been arrested after the postmortem revealed that the woman was strangled.        
	Tarak Das, in his mid-20s, was picked up from his house on Abinash Kabiraj Street, in north Calcutta, on Monday.         
	A few scratch marks were found on the hands and chest of Tarak, suggesting that he fought with wife Sagarika before killing her, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	The police said Sagarika, 19, died at her in-laws house on Saturday night. Tarak initially told neighbours that she died of a cardiac arrest. He called a neighbourhood homoeopath and requested him to issue a death certificate.        
	But the doctor asked Tarak, a fish vendor, to take the body to Medical College and Hospital. Doctors in the hospital declared Sagarika dead on arrival but refused to issue a death certificate before conducting a post-mortem, said Shamim.        
	But Tarak told the doctors that he would go to another hospital and left with the body.        
	He then came home with the body, said an officer of Burtola police station. Neighbours who saw Tarak enter his house with Sagarikas body informed the police. A team immediately went to the house and took the body to the hospital. The doctors confirmed to us that the man had left the hospital after they declared his wife dead. The body was sent for postmortem.        
	Finding Taraks behaviour suspicious, the cops detained him. We were waiting for the post-mortem report. Once it confirmed that Sagarika was murdered, we arrested him, said Shamim.        
	A investigation revealed that Tarak married Sagarika, a resident of Nimta, in North 24-Parganas, six months ago after courting her for two years.        
	The woman had been suffering from some ailments for the past three months. Instead of getting her treated, Tarak used to beat her up, said an officer. He even tried to drive out her of his house.        
	Shamim said the hospital authorities should not have allowed Tarak to leave with the body. We are looking into the matter, said a hospital official.

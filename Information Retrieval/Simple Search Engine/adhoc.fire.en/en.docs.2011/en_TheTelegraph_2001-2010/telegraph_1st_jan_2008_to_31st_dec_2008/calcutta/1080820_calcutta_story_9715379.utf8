	The 8 GB model of the iPhone 3G will be available for Rs 31,000 and the 16 GB version for Rs 36,100 at Vodafone stores across the city from August 22.        
	Apples iconic smartphone will also be available at seven Airtel Relationship Centres across the city from the midnight of August 21-22 but the company has not announced the prices.         
	The phone will also be available at Imagine, the premium Apple reseller at City Centre, from August 21-22 midnight.         
	The seven Airtel stores to remain open all night are at Golpark, Park Street, City Centre, Hazra, Sarat Bose Road, Shyambazar and Jadavpur.        
	The 18 Vodafone stores where the phone will be available include those at 22 Camac Street, Rashbehari Avenue, Sarat Bose Road, NSC Bose Road, Central Park, Kankurgachhi, South City, Southern Avenue, SP Mukherjee Road, Tollygunge and Alipore.        
	Vodafone subscribers who had booked the phone received a text message on Tuesday informing them of the launch and the prices.        
	To get your iPhone before others, visit one of the select Vodafone Stores and confirm your booking by paying Rs 10,000 on August 20 and 21, the message stated.        
	On Saturday, Imagine, Apples premium reseller store at City Centre, was the first to start bookings against a refundable payment of Rs 10,000.        
	We needed to assess how many people were interested. The response has been cautious because of rumours in the market, said store-owner Sanjay Chordia.         
	He felt many of those who booked the iPhone 3G may opt out because of the price.         
	Some though will not think twice.I will queue up for the phone at night. I thought of buying it in Canada but I wasnt sure the cracked version would work here, said 28-year-old businessman Vijay Dugar, whose brother Vaibhav already has the gadget.        
	For the rest, the recently launched Blackberry Bold is one of the options to consider.

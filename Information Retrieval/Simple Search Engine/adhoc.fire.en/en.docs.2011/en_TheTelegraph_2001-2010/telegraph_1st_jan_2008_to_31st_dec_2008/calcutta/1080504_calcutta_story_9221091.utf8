The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Notes from a tourist town
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Notes from a tourist town
  - Residents and officials together promote US holiday spots

	For a change I am not writing this from New York. I am not looking across the East River in Manhattan as I usually do, but gazing at the Severn River and the Chesapeake Bay (picture left) in Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, as I type this article. I had never heard of Annapolis before coming to the US, even though it was once the capital of the country. Today, it is a small harbour city whose claim to fame is that it is home to the acclaimed US Naval Academy, just like the town which houses Indias National Defence Academy.         
	It does not have the Grand Canyon or the Niagara Falls but when I was trying to decide on a last-minute weekend destination within a few hours drive from New York, Annapolis made the shortlist. Yes, the main attraction was the Naval Academy and I am not a navy buff, but a few online searches told me that it would be a great holiday.        
	It is nearly summer (which officially starts on the weekend before Memorial Day, the last Monday in May, in the US) and people are getting ready for vacations. And in true American style, the destination may not have historical pedigree, geographical wonders or spectacular skylines but the residents will make it a tourists delight with the little they have.        
	Annapolis starts with the Naval Academy, but that is just the beginning. It then urges you to visit some of the carefully preserved revolutionary period houses of the 17th and 18th centuries, spend time in the local museums that document the 350 years of the city and the period when it was a bustling sea-port, stroll and shop on the cobbled waterfront of the Chesapeake Bay, take a sightseeing cruise or just sit by the docks and ponder on why the city is the sailing capital of America.        
	If you are an explorer, local fishermen welcome you to their boats to experience fishing in the middle of the bay. Or you can drive to the neighbouring islands and try local cuisine. And for the true urbanite, there is even a range of malls on the outskirts of the city selling all the designer brands.        
	From the municipality worker cleaning the pavements before dawn, to the pigtailed teenager scooping you homemade ice cream, to the grandmother selling umbrellas on a rainy morning, every resident of Annapolis does their best to welcome tourists. It is not just the cut-throat competition that vacation destinations face, but also the direct impact that tourists have on a local economy that makes businesses work harder. Even the local thug will refrain from harassing tourists in fear of giving the city a bad name!        
	Hundreds of people are involved in the initiative. From the local Congressman who pushes legislation to make sure the airports, public transport and roads leading to Annapolis are travel-worthy, to the governor and mayor who encourage businesses to be competitive. The citys facilities are kept in excellent condition by departments such as the police, fire and public works and topped by friendly businesses and residents. All work to make Annapolis attractive for its reputation as a top-notch vacation spot profit all. Yes, its a commercial enterprise, but one that allows all the stake-holders to benefit from it.        
	You may think that I contradict myself  Annapolis did have a lot to offer from the beginning. But the truth is it just had the Naval Academy to start with, but today attracts over 4 million visitors to its shores. Much of the citys tourism is due to the innovativeness and entrepreneurship of residents and government officials who have worked tirelessly to preserve, promote and market even its tiniest slice of history, or past glory.         
	Every vacation I have taken in America from a hip city like San Francisco to a reservation park in Virginia, I always think this is a place I want to come back to. And Annapolis is no different. Can a tourist city ask for more?

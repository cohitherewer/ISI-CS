          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three boys who set out for an adventure on a local train on Thursday morning gave their parents a scare by not returning till late on Friday.        
	Relatives Bishal Roy, 10, Rahul Roy, 8, and Ram Kumar Roy, 6, accompanied by another child named Mahesh, boarded a train headed towards Budge Budge at New Alipore station. Mahesh got off at Budge Budge and returned home on Thursday afternoon.        
	Ram Kumars father Joy Narayan, a factory worker, said his nephew Rahul often took trains from New Alipore to Tollygunge and Lake Gardens but always returned home in a few hours.        
	Officers told me that Ram Kumar and my grandson Bishal had joined Rahul in an adventure, added Joy Narayan.        
	Rahuls father Aurobindo is a cycle-rickshaw puller. Bishals father Dharambir, a driver, is Joy Narayans son from his earlier marriage. The children live in the same house in New Alipore and play together. When the trio didnt show up for lunch on Thursday, parents started looking for them. Around 8pm, Joy Narayan lodged a complaint with police.        
	On Friday morning, the family members and relatives fanned out with pictures of the children. We sent our cousins and nephews to various stations to look for the kids and have also informed the Government Railway Police, said Joy Narayan.        
	We even gave our phone numbers to pedestrians in the hope that someone would contact us if they saw the boys anywhere, he added.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Murder charge on teenagers friends
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Murali Shaw                                  
	Two youths who were with Murali Shaw the last time he was seen on Kali puja night have been charged with murder and tampering with evidence.        
	K. Sankar Rao, 20, and Santosh Das, 18, were produced in the Howrah chief judicial magistrates court on Sunday and remanded in police custody for three days.        
	The body of 18-year-old Murali, the head partially severed, was found near TL Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah hours after he left home with Sankar and Santosh on a motorcycle on October 29. The body was identified on Saturday morning.        
	The duo are being questioned. We hope to get evidence against them in a day or two, said an officer of Howrahs Golabari police station.        
	Sleuths have come to know that after leaving home, Murali, Sankar and Santosh went to a bar near Bally. But what happened after that remains a mystery. The duo have been giving conflicting versions of the events leading to Muralis death, the officer said.        
	While Sankar claimed that Murali, the second pillion rider, fell off the two-wheeler after being hit by a truck from behind on GT Road, Santosh said the goods carrier hit them from the front.        
	We do not have any report of a two-wheeler mishap on GT Road on Kali puja night. Accidents on the highway rarely go unnoticed. Even if we assume Murali had died in an accident, why did the duo flee leaving their injured friend behind? asked an investigating officer.        
	The police are also trying to find out why Murali, the son of a fruit seller, took Rs 15,000 with him when he left with the duo.

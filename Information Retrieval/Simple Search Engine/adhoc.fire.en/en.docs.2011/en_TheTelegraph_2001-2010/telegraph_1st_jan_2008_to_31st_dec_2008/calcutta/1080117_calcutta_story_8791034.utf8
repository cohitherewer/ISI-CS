	Business and political rivalry could have led to the murder of Hare Krishna Gupta in Cossipore on Tuesday night, according to police. 
 
	The 30-year-old building material supplier rsquo;s affair with a married woman in the locality could also have triggered the attack, said an officer investigating the case.
 
	Gupta, who was the secretary of a labour union affiliated to Citu, was shot dead in a playground near his house on Gopal Chatterjee Road while playing badminton with his friends. The six assailants came on two motorcycles around 8.15pm.
 
	 ldquo;The men fired two bullets that missed Gupta. He started running but fell after taking a few steps. The men then shot him in the chest from close range. The gang hurled bombs in the area while speeding off on their motorcycles, rdquo; added the officer.
 
	Gupta was taken to a local nursing home, where no doctor was present. The local residents then took him to RG Kar hospital, where he was declared ldquo;brought dead rdquo;. The body has been sent to NRS hospital for post-mortem.
 
	 ldquo;The six are yet to be identified. It seems they were hired by Gupta rsquo;s rivals, rdquo; said Abdur Razzak, the officer-in-charge of Cossipore police station.
 
	A gang of building material suppliers associated with the CPM were behind the murder, said another officer. ldquo;We are looking into Gupta rsquo;s background. He was a local tough but there are no formal complaints against him. His affair with a married woman in the neighbourhood might have triggered the attack. rdquo; 
 
	According to local residents, there is tension between the CPM and Citu supporters in the area following a boom in the realty business. Gupta had become influential in the area after being appointed the secretary of Janpath Pariwahan Mazdoor Union.
 
	 ldquo;Some local CPM workers were unhappy with Gupta rsquo;s success. They, too, supply building material and were his business rivals, rdquo; said an officer.
 
	Rama, Gupta rsquo;s elder brother, alleged that the assailants were CPM workers.
 
	 ldquo;Our family has been associated with Citu for 10 years. My brother wielded a clout in the area and this annoyed the CPM members. They had threatened Krishna, rdquo; said Rama, who runs a tea stall on Gopal Chatterjee Road.

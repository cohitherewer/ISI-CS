                      A symbolic journey                    In May 2007, Turkish artist Reyhani Akan undertook a journey from Calcutta to Istanbul along the Silk Route, crossing the borders of India, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey in a span of 10 days. Though conceptually inspired by Islamic philosophy and leitmotif, 99 names of Allah, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings and prints, reflects his experiences during this extraordinary expedition. The environmental, social and cultural variations encountered by him are expressed through a visual rhetoric, including natural and symbolic elements like architecture, groundplans, road maps and so on, together with calligraphic effects. Using the Islamic Kufic script style with calligraphic designs on forms, the artist has played with multiple colours on his plate and done his prints in layers, creating a chequered history of his travels. Along the way, he has also experimented with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms, constructing his artistic language in a plastic, pictorial space. Akan has also attempted to accord a space to his poems, his childhood and the memories of his incredible journey in his works.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings and prints by Reyhani Akan When: Till August 27; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road, 2275

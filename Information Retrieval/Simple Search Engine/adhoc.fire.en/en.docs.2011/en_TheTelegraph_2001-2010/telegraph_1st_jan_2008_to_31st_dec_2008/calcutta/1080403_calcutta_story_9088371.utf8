The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Injured girls out of danger
                                                                                                               Injured girls out of danger
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The bus carrying schoolchildren that overturned at Beckbagan on Tuesday evening. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The three students of Shri Sikshayatan, who were injured in a bus accident on Tuesday evening, are out of danger, said officials of Mission of Mercy Hospital, where the trio were admitted.        
	Shalini Gupta has recovered from her neck injury and has been released, while Nandini Jaiswal, who had suffered a waist injury, is under observation, said Indranil Mukherjee, the medical superintendent of the hospital.        
	Deepa Poddar, who had fractured her right femur and also suffered a hip fracture, has to undergo a surgery within a week. Unable to afford the cost at Mission of Mercy, Deepas parents have decided to shift her to a nursing home near their Moulali residence.        
	We have already spent around Rs 5,000 and will have to cough up another Rs 50,000 if she is to be treated there. Its beyond our means to pay that much, said father Manoj, who demanded that the bus owner bear part of the cost.        
	Police are yet to track down the owner, Debasis Maiti. Metro tried to contact him but his cellphone was switched off.        
	Thirty-odd students of Shri Sikshayatan were in the bus when it hit the median on AJC Bose Road, at Beckbagan, and overturned. The students and witnesses alleged that the bus was being driven recklessly, though driver Ganesh Dutta claimed there was a snag in the steering.        
	Dutta, arrested on Tuesday, has been granted bail.        
	Poddar argued that the school could not deny responsibility of the mishap, as during Deepas admission, the authorities had referred me to TD Travels (owned by Maiti) for the bus service.        
	Principal S.Narayanswami, however, said: Since it was not an authorised school bus, we cannot take any responsibility. But since the bus had violated all government norms and did not even have a first-aid kit, the managing committee will soon take up the issue and will try to come up with some control over the travel agencies.        
	Bus attendant Indudhanu Das, who was also injured in the mishap, is still in hospital.

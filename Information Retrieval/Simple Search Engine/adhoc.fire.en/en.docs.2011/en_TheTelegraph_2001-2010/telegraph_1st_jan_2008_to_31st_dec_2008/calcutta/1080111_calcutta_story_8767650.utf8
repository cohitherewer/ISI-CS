     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	A bearer cheque for Rs 2.5 lakh was found lying at the Moulali crossing on Thursday morning.
    
	Anyone could have encashed it but fortunately, it was spotted by a traffic sergeant who submitted it to Taltala police station.
    
	Subrata Banerjee, a sergeant of the Sealdah traffic guard, was manning the busy crossing when he spotted the cheque, supposed to be deposited in the Moulali branch of Federal Bank. Being a bearer cheque, it could have been encashed by anyone.
    
	It was around 11.30am when I saw a piece of a paper lying in the middle of the road. A close look revealed it was a bearer cheque for Rs 2.5 lakh, Banerjee recalled.
    
	The sergeant immediately contacted the Lalbazar control room, where the duty officer asked him for the details and to submit it to the nearest police station in Taltala. I followed the order and lodged a missing diary, he added.
    
	Manoj Verma, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said the bearer might have lost the cheque on the way to the bank. 
    
	The sergeant did a good job and has set an example for others in the force to follow. Had any unscrupulous person found the cheque, he would have encashed it, Verma added.
    
	All police stations have been alerted about the cheque. We have lodged a diary as there is no claimant yet. Our officers will deposit the cheque in the Moulali branch of Federal Bank tomorrow, said Tarapada Dutta, the officer-in-charge of Taltala police station.

                The 34-year-old owner of a medicine shop had a close shave on Sunday night when a youth shot at him from a close range after he refused to give in to his extortion demand. Police said two youths had turned up at Surojit Palits shop in Malanga Lane, off Hind cinema, around 9.50pm. When one of them fired, Palit ducked and the bullet hit a glass casing behind him. The duo, yet to be identified, fled.     A 40-year-old woman was run over by a tram at the Cornfield Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing around 11.30pm on Sunday. The woman was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.    The family of an 11-month-old boy who died at Chittaranjan Seva Sadan Hospital on Monday has lodged a police complaint, accusing the authorities of negligence. Mrinal Das, of Tollygunge, was breathless when he was brought to the hospital on Sunday. Doctors prescribed a few medicines but the child developed rashes all over his body after they were administered. Mrinal was admitted to the hospital on Monday morning and died around 2pm.    A 12-year-old girl was rescued by Belghoria residents while she was being allegedly harassed physically by her mother and a neighbour. Rupa Roy has been suffering from fever for the past few days. Mother Rina thought the girl had been possessed by an evil spirit. On Monday morning, she and a neighbour, Tara Sil, tied Rupa to a bamboo pole to ward off the spirit. Neighbours intervened when the duo started assaulting her.    A policeman was injured while trying to board a bus on Sealdah flyover on Monday afternoon.

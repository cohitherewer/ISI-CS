The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Baby dupe charge on hospital
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Baby dupe charge on hospital
          RITH BASU                                        
	A woman who claims to have delivered twins, one a stillborn, at Chittaranjan Seva Sadan was allegedly told by the hospital that she had given birth to a single, stillborn child.        
	The family members of Lakshmi Ghorui have also alleged that they were shown the body of a premature baby, though the woman had been pregnant for 10 months.        
	The couple, who lodged a complaint with Bhowanipore police station on Wednesday, said they were ready to undergo any test to prove that the baby was not theirs.        
	It was the first delivery of the 24-year-old woman, which took place on June 22.        
	I had given birth to two male babies. The first delivery was normal but the child was stillborn. During the second delivery, performed through a Caesarean section, I saw in the mirror that the child was alive and healthy, Lakshmi told Metro after she was released from hospital on Wednesday.        
	After I was shifted to the bed, I wanted to see the baby but the nurses told me that it was stillborn. When I insisted on seeing the second baby they said I had given birth to only one child, she added.        
	Gynaecologists said Caesarean sections are now performed on spinal anaesthesia and the women can see the delivery in a mirror kept in the operating theatre.        
	Lakshmis husband, Subhashis, 26, said: The hospital authorities did not show me any of the two babies. A sweeper, after I bribed him Rs 50, showed me a dead child which was about the size of my palm. Its facial features had not formed. It could not be our child as my wife was 10 months pregnant. Any test will prove that.        
	The family tried in vain to meet the hospital superintendent. The office of principal Swagata Panja received their complaint on August 2.        
	I do recall having received any such complaint, Panja said. Many such complaints are found to be baseless after probe.         
	Police, however, have started a probe. I have asked the doctors to produce more medical documents, said Badal Kumar Maity, the officer-in-charge, Bhowanipore police station.

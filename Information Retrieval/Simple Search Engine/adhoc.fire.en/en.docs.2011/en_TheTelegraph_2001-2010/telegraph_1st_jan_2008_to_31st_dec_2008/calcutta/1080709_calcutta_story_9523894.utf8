	Officials of the Maniktala branch of the Central Bank of India completed counting two of the four bucketfuls of Lakshmi Dass coins till Tuesday evening. The coins added up to Rs 11,000.        
	Police have also found Rs 4,200 and a ration card in Lakshmis name in her Nandanbagan shanty in Burtola, said an officer.         
	The 60-year-old has saved the coins and the notes since she started begging at the age of 16.

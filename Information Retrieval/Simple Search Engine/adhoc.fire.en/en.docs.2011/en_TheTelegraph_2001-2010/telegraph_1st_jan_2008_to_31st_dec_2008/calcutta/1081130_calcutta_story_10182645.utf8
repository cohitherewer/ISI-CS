The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Returning art to common man
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Returning art to common man
										      eyewitness                        The art mela at Studio 21 on Friday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta A work by Sunil Das				                           
	They were there waiting from six on Friday morning. By the afternoon there was a small crowd at Studio 21 at 17L Dover Terrace and they were all clamouring to be allowed inside the exhibition space although the fair was slated to open at 3 pm.         
	One man had come with a good part of his savings and wondered if he would be allowed to buy a painting. These were not the usual moneyed gallery-goers but people who had perhaps travelled by public transport. They had all read that works by distinguished artists of Bengal would be available here at affordable prices  between Rs 500 and Rs 25,000.         
	Jogen Chowdhury had contributed paintings and Ganesh Pyne had painted a sara (platter). Other artists had contributed idiosyncratic works that are rarely seen on the gallery circuit. Samir Aich had sketched dogs, Jaya Ganguly some quirky drawings, Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar fruits with sexual overtones and Kingshuk Sarkar some platters. Earlier, Suhas Roy had contributed some works. A Sri Lankan artist had created some colourful masks. Sumitro Basak had painted faces and animals on sweet boxes and had created tiny books with drawings that flowed with the pages. Suman Chowdhury made instant caricatures of visitors.                   A work by Sunil Das      
	Litterateurs were also present on Friday. Sunil Gangopadhyay, Tilottama Majumdar, Sirshendu Mukherjee and Utpal Bose participated in poetry recitation with Ganesh Pyne and Jogen Chowdhury among the audience.         
	A shamiana had been put up on the tiny space behind the studio and ghughni and vegetable chops were being sold to underline the fair ambience. Posters had been put up with slogans like Art for lifes sake painted on them. This, said Rakhi Sarkar, the director of CIMA Gallery, who was the moving spirit behind the mela, was an effort to bring back art to the common man.         
	On Sunday, Chandrabindoo will perform there at 6pm.         
	Sunil Das is famous for duplicating ad infinitum the horses and bulls he had sketched aeons ago. These drawings have been exhibited down the ages and they can be seen once again at the current Ganges art gallery exhibition. Some of them date back to 1959, when he used to visit the Calcutta police stables to make his equine sketches. Plenty of paperwork is also on display here, many done over the past decade or so. These are more complex works depicting body parts and arteries and other muscular walled tubes, some dripping gore.         
	Occasionally one can catch a glimpse of a pair of smouldering eyes that reappear in his canvases. Many of the latter feature vampire-like women with racoon-like eyes, but the better ones are structured around male nudes with shaved heads. There is a striking one of a skeleton wearing glasses lolling voluptuously on a couch. There is an even better drawing of a thoughtful face with the dome of another bald head rising like a crown behind it. It is on plain paper with only the heads splashed with crimson. Instead of cloning horses and bulls, this senior artist should perhaps concentrate on creating such dignified and thought-provoking work.       SOUMITRA DAS

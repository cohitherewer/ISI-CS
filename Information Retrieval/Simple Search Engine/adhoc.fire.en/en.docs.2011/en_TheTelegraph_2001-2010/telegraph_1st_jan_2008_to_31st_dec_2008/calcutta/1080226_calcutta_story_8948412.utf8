The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ride of the role model
                                                                                                               Ride of the role model
  - Time for Muslim women to come forward          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Papiya Sultana Alam, the first Muslim woman to clear the West Bengal Police Service exam. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Riding a horse in a sari was the biggest worry for the first Muslim woman to clear the West Bengal Police Service (WBPS) examination.        
	But not any more. Papiya Sultana Alam has convinced her in-laws about a change of gear. So, she will don shirt and trousers instead of traditional clothes when she reports to the deputy inspector- general (headquarters) for training at the Barrackpore police college next month.         
	Once hesitant about letting her work in any capacity, the in-laws of the 27-year-old are now proud that she is going to be the first Muslim woman police officer in the state.         
	Overcoming hurdles is nothing new for this village girl from Howrah. Her friends at Bauria High School settled for domesticity instead of joining college at the instance of their families, but Papiya went on to do an MBA, before marrying a software engineer in May 2006.        
	I always wanted to be a role model for girls in my community. The time has come for Muslim women to come forward and change the mindset of the people, especially those in the community, says Papiya, who now stays with her husband in a two-room flat in Kestopur.         
	The girl, whose role model is Kiran Bedi, did not lose sight of her dreams, even after her marriage and a brief stint at a private firm. Hard work, determination and love for the uniform saw Papiya sail through the written and interview rounds of WBPS in the first attempt.        
	I always wanted to be a part of the administration and serve society. This job will give me enough scope to fulfil my dream, she says.        
	I will be very happy if girls in my community draw inspiration from me. Unless Muslim women take part in the administration, the situation will not change, she adds, thanking her husband for being supportive.         
	Arjahan Haldar, a former engineer at the Uluberia BDO office, is a proud father today. Papiya is a sincere girl and does not believe in compromises, he says.

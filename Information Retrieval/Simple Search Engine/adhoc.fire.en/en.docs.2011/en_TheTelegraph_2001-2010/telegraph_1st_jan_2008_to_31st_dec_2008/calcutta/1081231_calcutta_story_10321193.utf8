          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A Calcutta University (CU) panel has found a teacher of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences guilty of molesting a student.        
	Indubhushan Mondol, who was given a clean chit by a one-man panel before the universitys sexual harassment complaints committee held him guilty, was issued a chargesheet last week.        
	The initial reprieve for Mondol had sparked resentment, with many students and teachers alleging that the accused had been shielded because of his links with the CPM-backed Calcutta University Teachers Association.        
	Mondol will have to reply to the charges, following which the university will decide what action to be taken against him, said an official.        
	The report of the sexual harassment complaints committee was placed before the university syndicate on December 23.        
	The syndicate, the highest policy-making body of CU, accepted the report, as prima facie, the case has been established. The meeting also resolved to frame charges against him.        
	The victim had complained in December 2007 that Mondol, a reader in home science, had molested her in a computer laboratory. The university, after allegedly sitting on the complaint for several months, set up a one-member panel that acquitted Mondol of the charges.        
	But an agitation by students and teachers of the college forced the university to set up a panel in August which recommended a probe by the sexual harassment complaints committee.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das refused to comment on the matter.

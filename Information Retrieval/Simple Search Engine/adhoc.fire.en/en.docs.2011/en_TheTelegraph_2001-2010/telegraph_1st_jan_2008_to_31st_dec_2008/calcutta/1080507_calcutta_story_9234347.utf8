                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Killer driver loses right to advance bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                             
	A truck driver whose rash driving killed a 12-year-old boy in March was on Tuesday refused anticipatory bail by Calcutta High Court despite being booked under a section of the IPC that usually allows offenders like him to get away.        
	Generally, drivers get anticipatory bail as they are charged under Section 304A of the IPC (causing death by negligence, a bailable offence that invites a maximum sentence of two years in prison). But considering the present state of affairs taking place in Calcutta and other parts of (the) state, where many people are dying due to the reckless and rash driving of vehicles, the high court is not allowing the anticipatory bail prayer of the petitioner driver, a division bench of the high court said.        
	The bench, comprising Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice P.K. Deb, said irresponsible driving had ruined several families already and that they would be doing them injustice by granting bail to the truck driver.        
	The situation is quite alarming. Almost everyday a number of people are losing their lives on the roads. Many such deaths have been ruining families. In this situation, the court does not think it is wise to accept the prayer of the driver by following the general rule.        
	The victim in the accident, Khokan, was on his way to the vegetable market at Suri, in Birbhum, on March 24 when the killer truck crushed him in front of the district administrative building. The truck driver increased the speed (instead of stopping) after knocking down the boy and disappeared, prosecutor Pradip Roy said.        
	He pleaded with the court to allow police to proceed with a murder probe under Section 304, a non-bailable offence that attracts a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail. Roy said even the truck owner had admitted that his drivers recklessness led to the death.        
	Lawyer Somnath Banerjee, who had moved the bail application on the drivers behalf, argued that the accused deserved anticipatory bail because he never intended to kill anybody.

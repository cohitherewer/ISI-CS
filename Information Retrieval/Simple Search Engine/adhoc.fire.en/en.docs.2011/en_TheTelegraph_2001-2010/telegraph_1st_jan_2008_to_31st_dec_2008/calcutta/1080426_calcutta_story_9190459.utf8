                      A dramatic canvas                    The paintings of Tarun Dey tell a story, whether imaginary or about human nature and the various mental states that one experiences. The artist believes that paintings do not speak; rather they provide extraordinary insight into life, beauty and aesthetics, carrying the viewer to another world. In his paintings, layers of apparently peaceful, atmospheric scenes camouflage the demonic and the powerful. Though deceptive in their simplicity, there is fascinating drama in the works which appears to spill out of the canvas, almost engaging the viewer in the act. The ongoing maiden retrospective, featuring nearly three decades of Deys paintings, brings out the full force of his narrative. Hosted by Art Border Line, UK and Art Border Line Foundation India.                  Event: Retrospective of Tarun Deys paintings When: Till April 27; 10 am - 6 pm Where: Gallery YapanChitra, 18A Park Street, 3rd floor

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Besu students rejoined classes on Monday, in response to an appeal from Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Normality returned to the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) campus on Monday  after weeks of uncertainty  as students rejoined classes on Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis request.        
	In response to the students move, the universitys board of management decided that the authorities would start the process of withdrawing legal cases against the students. We shall approach the universitys legal cell and the Howrah public prosecutor on withdrawing FIRs against the 61 students, said registrar Biman Bandopadhyay.        
	The professor-in-charge of student affairs Anjan Dutta will explain to the students the legalities of withdrawing the FIRs, the registrar added.        
	Students spokesman Rajarshi Datta said: The authorities should let us know the exact date when the FIRs will be withdrawn. Till then, our relay hunger strike will continue.        
	The board also decided to hold elections to various bodies like the students union, executive council and the court, at the earliest. The university will write to Chancellor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and the state higher education department on appointing a tribunal to hold the elections.        
	On withdrawing police from the campus, the registrar said its being done in phases. Already, a lot of policemen have left the campus. Besu will soon float a tender inviting security agencies of ex-armymen to take charge of the campus security.        
	The one-man commission of former Besu vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chatterjee, appointed to probe the campus clashes, will start work soon, said Bandopadhyay. Chatterjee was not in town for comment.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A team from the detective department intercepted a Maruti van in Scott Lane, in central Calcutta, on Wednesday afternoon and found 100 kg of ganja stashed under the seats.        
	The driver was arrested but another man in the vehicle jumped off and fled.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that the consignment, worth Rs 4 lakh, was brought from Jalangi, Murshidabad.        
	There were 16 packets, all hidden under the seats. The suppliers were supposed to deliver them in pockets across the city and in North and South 24-Parganas, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	The sleuths stopped the vehicle following a tip-off. We were told that the van had entered the city and would be in the Muchipara area in central Calcutta in the afternoon. We also knew the registration number of the vehicle, said an official of the detective departments narcotics section.        
	Teams left for the Muchipara area soon after receiving the information. It was around 3.30pm when our plainclothesmen spotted the vehicle. They intercepted it and challenged the driver, said Shamim.        
	Detective department officials contacted their counterpart in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which had initiated a crackdown on ganja and opium cultivation in Murshidabad and Nadia districts.        
	The city pockets where ganja dealers are active include Bowbazar, Muchipara, Tangra, Ekbalpore, Kidderpore and Lake-Tollygunge.

  - Fire starts from oven          A STAFF REPORTER                          The gutted mill. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                         
	A pulses-processing unit on Canal Circular Road was gutted in a fire early on Tuesday. The 1,000-sq ft mill is one of the 274 in Daspara daalpatti, one of the largest pulses markets in Asia.        
	Twelve engines brought the fire under control in an hour. No one was injured.        
	The fire allegedly started from an oven in Ganesh Daal Mill around 3am, while work was on. By the time the workers had rushed outside, the entire mill was ablaze, said a resident of the area.         
	The West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services has lodged a complaint with Ultadanga police station against the owners of the mill for flouting fire norms.        
	None of the mills in the market follow the norms. The power lines of the mill have been snapped and the owners will not be allowed to resume work unless they acquire a fire licence, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director general of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.         
	The owners of the mill were not available for comment. Ours is a disorganised sector. The profit margin is very low. If we go around taking permissions we will have to follow a lot rules, said Adarsh Mishra, the owner of Durgesh Dal Mill in the area.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       16-yr-old groom in custody
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday denied anticipatory bail to a 16-year-old boy who married a 14-year-old and sent him to judicial custody. A lower court was directed to send the girl to a home for destitute women.        
	Rita Ghosh (name changed), a Class VII student in Canning, had fled home a month ago to marry her neighbour Ashok Mistry (name changed), a student of Class IX. Her father Manojit, a fish merchant, was opposed to her relationship with Ashok, whose father, Chitta, is a mason.        
	After Rita left home, Manojit lodged a complaint with Canning police station alleging that Chitta and Ashok had kidnapped his minor daughter. Chitta Mistry had forcefully confined Rita in his house, Manojit claimed.        
	Chitta was arrested on August 1 on charges of kidnapping Rita and giving shelter to the minor couple. An arrest warrant was issued against Ashok.         
	The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice K.K. Prasad rejected the bail plea of Ashok and asked the trial court to send Rita to the Liluah Home for Destitute Women. Rita is now in police custody and will be produced in an Alipore court on Saturday. The high court also denied bail to Chitta.        
	Rita denied that she was kidnapped. My father used to beat me regularly because of my relationship with Ashok. My mother was a witness to the torture. I requested Ashok to give me shelter in his house. On July 27, I fled from my house and Ashoks father allowed me to stay in their home. The next day, we married at Dakhineswar temple, Rita told the high court on Friday.        
	After a lower court rejected Ashoks anticipatory bail plea, he moved the high court.

	The Energy and Resources Institute will soon conduct a detailed climate study in West Bengal, R.K. Pachauri, the institutes director-general and the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change that won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, announced on Monday.        
	We have been carrying out studies in the Sunderbans. Now we will undertake a study covering the entire state, said Pachauri, who was in the city to speak at a programme on corporate social and environment responsibility organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in India along with The Telegraph.        
	The state government will partially fund the project. The institute, said Pachauri, will bear the rest.        
	According to the scientist, Calcutta, Chennai and Dhaka are the most vulnerable cities in the region.         
	The Sunderbans has already been threatened by a rise in the sea level, Pachauri said.        
	He pointed out that funds were hard to come by for fighting climate change despite the gravity of the problem.        
	American consul-general Beth A. Payne said that every corporate outfit should ensure that they not only support social initiatives but also make them sustainable.         
	It is in the interest of companies that they support such endeavours.        
	A panel discussion on whether corporates engage deeply enough in nation building followed the lectures.        
	Awards were handed over for most innovative corporate social initiatives. Pepsico, West Bengal, was the winner.

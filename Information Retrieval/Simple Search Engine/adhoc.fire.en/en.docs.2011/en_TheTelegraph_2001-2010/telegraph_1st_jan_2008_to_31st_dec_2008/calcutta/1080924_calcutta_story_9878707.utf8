The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fair gun on Maidan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fair gun on Maidan
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Greens await another assault                                  
	The state government has launched a fresh offensive to bring Book Fair back to the Maidan, despite a ban imposed by the high court on rallies and fairs on the greens.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Tuesday that he had sent a letter on the fair to the defence ministry on August 25. I have written that the state government would like Calcutta Book Fair 2009 to be held on the Maidan if we are able to meet the environmental standards, Deb said.        
	The high court had disallowed the fair on the Maidan in 2007 on the grounds of pollution, the chief secretary added. We have told the defence ministry that the Pune-based National Environment Research Institute will be asked to study the impact of the fair on the environment and recommend preventive measures.        
	The government has, however, given a provisional go-ahead to the Publishers and Booksellers Guild to hold next years fair at Milon Mela, off EM Bypass. We have started preparations for Book Fair 2009 keeping the Bypass venue in mind, said guild secretary Tridib Chattopadhyay.        
	Asked why the government was rekindling the venue debate after Milon Mela had been designated, Deb said: The Bypass site is provisional. The final decision will depend on the defence ministrys response. If there is no possibility of holding the fair on the Maidan, the organisers will have to settle for Milon Mela.        
	Fort William, the custodian of the Maidan, does not want the citys lungs to be mauled again by the fair. We are aware of the governments letter to the defence ministry. We have sent a note to Delhi saying that going by the high court order, fairs cannot be held on the Maidan, said an army spokesperson.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta termed the governments move as unethical and said the chief secretarys letter can be construed as contempt of court.        
	The Book Fair, which started on the Maidan in 1976, was held at Salt Lake stadium for the past two years.         
	In 2006, the Guild had planned to hold the fair on the Park Circus Maidan but was stopped by the high court following petitions by a group of residents.

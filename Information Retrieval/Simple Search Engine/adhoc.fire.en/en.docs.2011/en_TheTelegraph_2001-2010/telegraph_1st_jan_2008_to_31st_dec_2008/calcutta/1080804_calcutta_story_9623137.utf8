The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic site to quicken building sanction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic site to quicken building sanction

	The civic body has decided to introduce a website for quicker and easier disposal of big construction projects.        
	Realtors will not need to approach different authorities like urban land ceiling department, Calcutta Improvement Trust, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and controller of thika tenancy for project clearance.        
	The site will be launched after the Puja.        
	The site will host a list of plots where construction has been prohibited by any of these agencies. If the plot for a proposed construction does not figure on the list, the civic building department will not wait for the nod of these agencies for approving the project, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Wednesday.        
	Tata Consultancy Services has been assigned the task to develop the website.        
	The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), too, has been insisting on the simplification of the plan sanction procedure because the delay in approval is resulting in unnecessary cost escalation, pointed out Bandyopadhyay.        
	At present, it takes nearly a year for as many as 10 agencies to approve a construction project of height 24 metres or more. The civic building departments nod comes after that, said Dipankar De, the mayoral council member (building).        
	We welcome the pro-development move of the civic authorities. Not only realtors, even people who will construct their own houses will benefit from this, said Tapan Kumar Ganguly, the secretary-general of Credai.

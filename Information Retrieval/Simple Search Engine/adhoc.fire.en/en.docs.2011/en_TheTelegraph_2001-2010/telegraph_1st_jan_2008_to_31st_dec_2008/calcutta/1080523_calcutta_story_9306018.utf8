          A STAFF REPORTER                          The civic body is installing fire-prevention equipment in New Market and some other civic markets, apart from all its offices. A Telegraph picture                                  
	After making fire prevention mandatory in the trade enlistment policy, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up a scheme to make fire-fighting arrangements in its own offices and markets, including the civic headquarters.         
	Except for the pumping stations, all civic establishments are devoid of any effective fire-fighting equipment. Initially, a fund of Rs 50 lakh has been allotted for the purpose.        
	We have drawn up a scheme for installing fire-fighting equipment in all the civic establishments. The civic headquarters and 24 civic markets will be covered in the first phase, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Chief engineer (electrical) Pradip Jyoti Biswas has been entrusted to carry out the implementation, he added.        
	Work is near completion at New Market, Kankurgachhi, VIP Market, Gurudas Market and Ultadanga Market, said Biswas.         
	What exists in the civic headquarters in the name of fire preventive equipment is about 125 extinguishers. In the conservancy building on Market Street and the Hudco building to the east of New Market, hose pipes were installed but they are not in working condition.        
	The fire brigade, however, has submitted an elaborate prescription for blaze prevention. The civic authorities are in touch with them in carrying out installation of fire-prevention equipment, said a senior fire services officer.         
	There is a big load of combustible material inside the civic offices. The carpets, too, are not of the fire-resistant variety, he pointed out.         
	Fire-prevention measures have of late gained priority following the CMCs e-governance programme.         
	Besides, the recent fires at Burrabazar and Sodepur have compelled the authorities to move ahead with the measures.

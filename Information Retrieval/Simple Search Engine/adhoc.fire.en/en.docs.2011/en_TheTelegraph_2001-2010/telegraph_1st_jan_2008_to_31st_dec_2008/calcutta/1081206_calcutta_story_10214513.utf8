	A flying helicopter greeted students from 41 city schools as they trooped in at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) to check out an exhibition on aviation and space. It left most of the kids amazed. I have never seen a display like this before, said Joimini Seal of Loreto Day School, Bowbazar, of the remote control-operated chopper.         
	Jointly organised by the Aeronautical Society of India (Calcutta branch) and BITM, the exhibition was held from November 27 to 30. At its inauguration, B.R. Guruprasad of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) spoke on Chandrayaan-I, Indias unmanned mission to the moon. A session by Indranil Ray Chaudhury, who flies A380, the largest commercial aircraft in the world, followed.        
	The exhibition showcased an aerial view of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport with models depicting the air traffic control room and the route network of flights in and around Calcutta. It also had posters on the application of INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) in telecommunications, TV broadcasting, radio networking and of EDUSAT, Indias first thematic satellite dedicated to educational services. There were also models of propulsion engines, missiles, cartridges used in modern warfare, fighter aircraft and equipment for air navigation.         
	Guruprasad highlighted how Chandrayaan-I was an example of international cooperation as many of its instruments had come from other countries. He explained the function of terrain mapping camera  which takes pictures of the moon.         
	Ray Chaudhury traced the history of commercial aviation and the making of the Airbus 380.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Inspection teams from Calcutta University have begun landing up at colleges unannounced to keep them from admitting students beyond the prescribed limits for various undergraduate courses.        
	A senior official said on Tuesday that the university had drawn up a list of colleges that were known to overshoot their admission quotas. We have deputed teams to these institutions first to let them know that they are being watched. We need to stop this practice.        
	Online and over-the-counter distribution of admission forms began on Monday, though not many students could access the websites that were supposed to spare them the trouble of queuing up.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said the university had warned colleges over and over again not to admit students in excess of the numbers they could handle. The undergraduate council this time decided to get stricter and form roving squads to keep an eye on them.        
	The university fixes individual admission limits for colleges on the basis of periodic assessments of infrastructure  classroom space, laboratory equipment, library and computers  and the strength and quality of the faculty.        
	Over the past decade, the university has allowed almost every college to extend its range of courses, restricting only the number of students in a batch. But Bhawanipur Education Society College, one of the colleges to be inspected, claimed it was free to admit as many students as it deemed fit. It isnt binding on us to restrict our intake of students. An inspection team did visit our college and asked us to show some documents related to admissions. We did so, principal S.K. Dan said.        
	The first round of inspections focused on geography departments because that is supposed to be the subject most in demand this admission season.        
	Debabrata Chaudhuri, the principal of Asutosh College, and his counterpart at Jogomaya Devi College, Gargi Nath, confirmed that the inspection teams asked for details of previous enrolments in their geography departments.

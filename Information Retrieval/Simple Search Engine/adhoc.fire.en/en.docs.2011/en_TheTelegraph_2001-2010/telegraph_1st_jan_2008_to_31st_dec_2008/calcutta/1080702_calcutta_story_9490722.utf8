          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Simantini Dey, missing since June 24. Picture by Gopal Senapati		    
	A 23-year-old woman has been missing since leaving her Shibpur home for office a week ago.        
	Simantini Deys parents have lodged a police complaint accusing Sonu Chowrasia, with whom she had an affair, and his friend Amar of abducting her.        
	Officers of Chatterjeehat police outpost, which functions under Shibpur police station, summoned the duo on Sunday but they denied having abducted Simantini. No one has been arrested.        
	We have started an investigation following a complaint lodged by the girls family. No one has been arrested, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	The police said Simantini, who works in a private financial firm that has its office on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, left her Kasundia Road home around 11am on June 24.        
	She used to return home by 8.30am. On June 24, when she failed to turn up even by 10.30pm, we lodged a missing diary with Chatterjeehat police outpost. The next day, we lodged a complaint with Shibpur police station, alleging that Sonu and Amar had abducted my daughter, said Narayan Chandra Dey, Simantinis father.        
	The family had called her colleagues and came to know that Simantini had not attended office the day she went missing.        
	Family members said Simantini had an affair with Sonu, a resident of Hanskhali, in Andul, but broke off the relationship a couple of weeks ago.        
	Sibasish, Simantinis younger brother, said: Didi invited Sonu to my wedding reception three months ago. But later, she broke off the affair and returned all the gifts that Sonu had given her. Sonu insisted on continuing with the relationship. We suspect he and Amar have abducted Simantini.        
	The Deys will meet the deputy inspector-general of police (presidency range) Soumen Mitra with the plea to expedite the probe.

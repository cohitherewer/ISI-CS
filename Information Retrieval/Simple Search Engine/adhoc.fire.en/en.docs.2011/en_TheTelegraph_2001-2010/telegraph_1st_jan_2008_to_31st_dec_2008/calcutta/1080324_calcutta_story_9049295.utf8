	The students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), ordered out of campus late on Thursday following clashes, started returning on Sunday amid fears of fresh violence.        
	Second-year students said they are fearing attacks following an assault on two of their batchmates in the afternoon. The students of other batches, too, are apprehensive. We are fearing an attack tonight, said fourth-year student Shyamasish Das, of Richardson Hostel.        
	The Shibpur university, granted the Institute of National Importance status, was rocked by a clash between second-year students and their third-year seniors on Wednesday night. This was followed by another round of violence on Thursday.        
	Police have registered FIRs against a large number of students, said a source. Most of the accused are staying away fearing arrest.        
	The tense situation, however, has failed to slacken the students resolve to sit for the mid-term exams beginning Monday. We are ready to take the exams, said Das.        
	Teachers, too, are on tenterhooks, apprehending a surge of violence. Things are spiralling out of control. Students are getting beaten up by outsiders... the administration has collapsed, said Partha Pratim Chattopadhyay, of Besu Teachers Association.        
	The administration has issued certain rules to be followed by students to ensure peace. They should carry their identity cards on campus and will need the hostel superintendents permission to step out after 10.30pm, said an official.        
	The students have been prohibited from bringing in outsiders and vigil has been stepped up to strictly enforce the ban on drugs and alcohol, he added.        
	Registrar Biman Bandopadhyay said: Adequate security measures have been taken. Eastern Frontier Rifles men are posted at the two gates and police vans are patrolling the campus.        
	Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi expressed concern over the situation at Besu. I am concerned with the state of affairs on the campus. I want the government to provide security to the students so that they can sit for tomorrows exams, Das Munshi said on Sunday afternoon.         
	A delegation of Besu students had earlier called on him at Bidhan Bhavan, the state Congress headquarters.        
	Congress Legislature Party chief Manas Bhunia said he would raise the matter in the Assembly on Monday.

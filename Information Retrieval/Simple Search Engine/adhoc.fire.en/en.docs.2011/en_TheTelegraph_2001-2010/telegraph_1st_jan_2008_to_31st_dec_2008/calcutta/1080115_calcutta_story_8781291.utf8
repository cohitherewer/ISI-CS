     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Thirteen wards in and around the central business district  including ward 42, where Jamunalal Bajaj Street is located  were tagged fire-prone in a study by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) five years ago.
    
	The report of the Calcutta Fire Service Data Management study, carried out by CMDAs environment cell using Geographical Information System (GIS) and sponsored by the fire services, had made a number of recommendations. 
    
	They included regular checks on availability of water in the vulnerable areas; identification of the shortest routes from fire stations to the fire-prone areas; use of small tenders to tackle fires on narrow roads and a bar on parking on at least two roads in each ward to facilitate fire engine operations in an emergency.
    
	The recommendations were ignored. As were the recommendations of a committee constituted by the state government after a midnight fire in December 1996 near the BB Ganguly Street-Phears Lane crossing, that killed four people. The committee had called for a bar on storing inflammable material at congested localities, fire-proof electrical wiring in houses, a hydrant every 50 metres in vulnerable areas and restoration of underground water reservoirs. 
    
	Eleven years after the recommendations were made, they remain only on paper. There are many recommendations and legal provisions that cannot be applied strictly because of economic and social constraints. Perhaps the time has come for a military-like enforcement, said fire minister Pratim Chatterjee on Sunday.
    
	I repeatedly wrote to CESC about illegal electrical connections in Burrabazar but nothing happened, he claimed.

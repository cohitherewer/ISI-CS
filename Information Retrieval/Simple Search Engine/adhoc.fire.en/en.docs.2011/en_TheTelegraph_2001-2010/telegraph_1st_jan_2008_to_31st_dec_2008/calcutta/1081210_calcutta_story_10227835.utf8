                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crack team to guide suburb makeover
          SUBHRO SAHA                                      
	Mahestala is drawing on the expertise of top town planners to make the transition from an underdeveloped suburb to an urban sprawl equipped with modern infrastructure.         
	Mahestala Municipality has approached the CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning amp; Technology) University in Ahmedabad for a comprehensive urban regeneration and infrastructure upgrade plan for the citys south-western fringes.        
	They have sought our expertise to improve connectivity and basic infrastructure within Mahestala municipal limits, which spans around 48sq km, said Utpal Sharma, the director of the School of Planning in the university.        
	Shamik Lahiri, the MP from the Diamond Harbour constituency, said no other municipality had probably attempted a project like this before. This is certainly the first time that a centre of excellence like the CEPT has been engaged to draw up an integrated urban regeneration plan in any part of the state.        
	According to Lahiri, Mahestala Municipality has to deal with three basic issues  a rapidly growing population, poor urban infrastructure and inadequate civic amenities.         
	Experts from the CEPT will chalk out plans for storm water drainage, waste discharge and a comprehensive internal road network.        
	Students and faculty of the School of Planning first did a land-use survey to prepare the base map. It was a tough task because the features on the ground hardly matched those in the civic bodys master plan. We used satellite images, courtesy the Calcutta Riverside project in Batanagar, to draw the base map, Sharma said.        
	The government has promised an elevated road to improve connectivity. The 7.5km-long high road will originate at Jinjira Bazar, off Taratala, and follow the Budge Budge Trunk Road before touching down at Bata More, the entry point to the Calcutta Riverside township.        
	The CEPT team has drawn up a skeleton plan for a better ancillary road network and a hierarchy of hubs as anchors to hold the suburb together.        
	The integrated Calcutta Riverside township and Eden City are two large-format projects coming up in the area.         
	The corridor from Taratala to Budge Budge used to house one of the states most vibrant small and medium enterprise zones. Most of these units have shut shop. The slump in the Bata factorys fortunes added to the decay and the entire Batanagar industrial township became a ghost town.        
	Batanagar is now getting a facelift.

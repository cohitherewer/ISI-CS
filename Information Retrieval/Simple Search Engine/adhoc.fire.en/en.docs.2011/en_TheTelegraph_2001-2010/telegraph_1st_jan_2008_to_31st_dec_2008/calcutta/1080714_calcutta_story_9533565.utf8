The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civil police in aid of civic fathers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Civil police in aid of civic fathers

	A civil police force will soon be raised to help the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) enforce its writ. The cost to the civic exchequer for the force will be around Rs 2 crore a year.        
	Around 250 youths will initially be enlisted for the force which will function under a joint commissioner of police in parts of the city that are manned by Calcutta police.        
	The youths, who will not carry arms, will help the civic body pull down illegal billboards and structures, prevent illegal felling of trees and littering of roads, and assist the police in controlling traffic where repairs of roads or sewers are on.        
	The personnel of the civil force, which will be stationed in select pockets, will also be responsible for coordinating with the police station concerned in executing a civic order.        
	For instance, if there is a complaint of an illegal construction, the personnel will go to the spot and ask those responsible to stop work. If their order is ignored, they will complain to the local police station and arrange for the demolition of the structure, said a CMC official.        
	The personnel will be recruited from the 550-odd neighbourhood clubs enlisted with the police. They will be deployed after training at Calcutta Police Training Institute.        
	The civic body will pay around Rs 2 crore a year to the city police for the upkeep of the civil force, the official added. In the CMC, a joint municipal commissioner will coordinate with the police for the effective functioning of the force.        
	The decision to raise the force was finalised on Friday in a meeting between police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and the civic authorities.        
	It will be something like community policing and the force will be a bridge between the CMC and the police stations, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who attended the meeting with Chakrabarti and civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The CMC is badly in need of such a dedicated force under the police, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	We need this force to serve the city and civic authorities better. The CMC has agreed to bear the cost of maintaining the force, said Chakrabarti.

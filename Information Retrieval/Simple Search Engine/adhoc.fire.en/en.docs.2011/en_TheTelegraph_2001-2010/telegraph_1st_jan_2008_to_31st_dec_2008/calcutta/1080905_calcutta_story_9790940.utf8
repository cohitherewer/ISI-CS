                ESI Hospital in Maniktala plunged into darkness for over two hours on Thursday evening following a power cut. According to CESC, power supply to the hospital was disrupted between 6pm and 8.30pm because of a fault in a high-tension feeder at Kankurgachhi. Doctors and around 400 patients suffered because of the disruption, said Debasis Chaudhury, the hospitals medical superintendent.     Two hand grenades were found in a gunny bag at Manik Bose Ghat on Strand Bank Road on Thursday. In the morning, the unattended sack created a flutter among residents, who informed the North Port police station. The police brought a team from the bomb disposal squad and opened the bag to find the grenades. The cops then contacted the army. An inquiry revealed the grenades were made in 1993 but the place of manufacture could not be identified. Army officers are probing how the grenades found their way to the Hooghly banks. Forensic experts are also examining the grenades.     Three morning walkers noticed some men cutting a tree near Salt Lake stadium around 6.30am and tried to stop them. Though the tree cutters explained that they had been engaged by the Bidhannagar municipality, the residents paid no heed and even lodged a police complaint.

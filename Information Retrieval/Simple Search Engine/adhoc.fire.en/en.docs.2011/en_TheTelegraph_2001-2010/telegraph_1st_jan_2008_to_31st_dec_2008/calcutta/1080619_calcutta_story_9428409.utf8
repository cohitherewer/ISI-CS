                      Monsoon hues                    Music and poetry are by far the most majestic expressions of monsoon, a season rich in its romantic, emotional associations. As the rain clouds create euphoria in our souls, inspiring our imagination with colours as varied as a peacocks plumes, the duo of Sudeshna Basu and Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee capture the magic of the season with enchanting renditions of prose, verse and music. Basu will sing classical bandishes in monsoon ragas like Desh, Miyan Ki Mallhar and Megh depicting biraha, milan and tandava associated with the season. She will also sing compositions by Tagore (Jhoro jhoro borishe, Kotha je udhao holo), Nazrul (Shaono raate jodi) and Atulprasad (Bnadhu emono badole tumi kotha) inspired by these ragas. She will conclude her presentation with a contemporary Bengali song, Chhelebelar brishti manei.... Chatterjee will take the audience on a journey of life through poetry and narratives comprising works by Rabindranath Tagore, Nirendranath Chakrabarty, Nabaneeta DevSen, Joy Goswami, Sunil Gangopadhyay and others. He will also read translations of regional poetry in Kannada and Malayalam, crowning off his readings with an excerpt from Shankars Chowringhee. The entire programme will be a jugalbandi between the duo, bringing out various facets of monsoon. Hosted by Creations India.

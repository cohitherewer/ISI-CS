                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Park turns into goat market

	There is no place for children in Rainbow Park on Canal East Road. Local traders have turned it into a grazing ground for goats.        
	Since last week, more than 200 goats have been herded into the over 1,500sq ft park in ward 29, near Rajabazar. If the traders have their way, the animals will continue to occupy the park till they are sacrificed on Id-ul-Zoha in the second week of December.         
	The traders, who will make a fortune by selling the goats during the festival, are destroying the park. They have the support of the parks managing committee. Cadres of the CPM and Forward Bloc are also involved in the racket, said a resident of the area.        
	The parks grass cover has disappeared and the ground is littered with goat droppings. It is the only place in the locality where children breathe fresh air and play. Unfortunately, it is being ravaged, said Bikash Chatterjee, another resident.        
	The park was built by a group of social workers with money contributed by residents about a year and a half back. A hooch and gambling den occupied the plot earlier. Goats used to be sold in the adjoining lanes then.        
	Members of the managing committee (all of whom are residents) claimed that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had permitted them to allow goats to be kept in the park.        
	Local councillor and mayoral council member (health) Subodh Kumar Dey said: There is a large unorganised goat market in the area. The traders lack space to keep the goats but that does not mean they will take over the park. I will look into the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer duo traceless 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Killer duo traceless

	The two youths who allegedly strangulated Sashi Ganeriwal in her flat in an upscale housing estate in Behala and decamped with valuables were probably criminals masquerading as domestic help, according to police.        
	The duo  identified as Pankaj, hired a fortnight ago, and Santosh, who joined work a month ago  havent been seen since the 54-year-old womans body was found by her son on Tuesday evening.         
	It seems that the two were professional killers and had taken up the work with a motive. They got the opportunity to execute the murder plan on Tuesday. We are questioning the four security guards who were on duty in the estate in the afternoon, said an investigator.        
	The family employed the youths without finding out their antecedents. The Ganeriwals did not even submit the duos profiles to the local police station. Apparently, the help were from Bihar. We are yet to track them down, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.         
	Pankaj and Santosh fled with cash and jewellery the family had kept at home for a wedding. Sashis husband and son are yet to come to terms with the tragedy and havent managed to compile the list of stolen items. It was certainly a murder for gain, added Ranade.         
	Flat owners in the estate held an emergency meeting on Wednesday and decided to submit photo profiles of their domestic help to the local police station.         
	Last Friday we had put up a notice at the gate asking the residents to submit details of their helps to the police. We are scared and will complete the formalities in a couple of days, Abraham Stephanos, the president of Purti Seasons Flat Owners Association, told Metro.

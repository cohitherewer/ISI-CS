The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hike too little: bus owners
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hike too little: bus owners
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The new fare structure for city buses that transport minister Subhas Chakraborty announced on Monday left bus owners and the Left Front dissatisfied.        
	While the owners were looking forward to a steeper hike and have threatened to take their vehicles off the road from July 11 if their demands are not considered, the Front wanted more relaxation in the initial slab.        
	The new fares for buses, minibuses and taxis will come into effect on July 11, instead of July 1 as proposed earlier. The minimum fare for buses stays at Rs 4 for the first four km.        
	From four to seven km, the fare is Rs 5; Rs 5.50 for seven to 10 km, Rs 6.50 for 10 to 14 km; Rs 7.50 for 14 to 18 km and Rs 8 for the 18 to 22 km.        
	The fare for the first seven km has remained unchanged for buses. This is not acceptable. We see no point in announcing a revised fare structure if it does not bail us out of our plight, said Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.                    
	The bus owners had suggested a minimum fare of Rs 4 for the first two km and a hike ranging between 50 paise and Rs 2 for every successive four km. They also demanded a further reduction on the sales tax on diesel in order to cushion public transport from the hike in fuel prices.        
	Chakraborty attended the Left Front meeting hours before announcing the fares. We told him to provide relief to commuters and not to hike the fare for the first four km, Front chairman Biman Bose said.        
	Other Front leaders, including CPI state secretary Manju Mazumdar and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, insisted on a minimum bus fare of Rs 4 for the first six km.        
	The revision has made the calculation of taxi fares simpler. The passengers will have to pay twice the meter reading plus Rs 2. For example, if the meter reads Rs 25, one has to pay Rs 52.

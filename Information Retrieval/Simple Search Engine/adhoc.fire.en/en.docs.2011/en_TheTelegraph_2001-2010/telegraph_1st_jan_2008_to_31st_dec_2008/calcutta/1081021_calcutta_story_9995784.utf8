          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have ordered a probe into whether a security breach allowed a young man on a motorcycle, with his girlfriend riding pillion, to come close to the chief ministers convoy at the crossing of Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Nasiruddin Road.         
	The two students sped past two vehicles in the convoy on Sunday before being stopped by commandos. They were allowed to go after interrogation.        
	The incident was an eye-opener. We are reviewing the chief ministers security arrangements. The probe will ascertain whether there was a lapse on the part of police, said an IPS officer at Lalbazar.         
	Traffic policemen and a senior officer of the police station through whose jurisdiction the convoy is passing are responsible for blocking vehicles in its vicinity. Traffic on lanes leading to the convoys route is stopped while it is passing by.         
	Why did the traffic policemen allow the motorcyclist to speed down the road? We are trying to find out whether an officer of Karaya police station was present when the incident took place, the officer added.        
	Senior police officers expressed concern over the possibility of a security breach. They blamed some complacent traffic policemen for the incident.         
	Another officer said the traffic policemen who were on duty at the crossing would be penalised. We have put on alert the officers-in-charge of the police stations through whose jurisdiction the convoy passes daily, he added.

                      Lens vision                    The twin concerns of a naturalist and an artist have shaped Dr Noazesh Ahmeds response to nature, life and experience. His photographs explore the inner life of things in colourful forms and poignant expressions. Quest for Harmony: Bangladesh, the ongoing exhibition, puts together selected images taken in a span of more than 60 years. Involving the viewer in dialectics, his photographs have a quality of uncertainty and indeterminacy. Despite giving rise to haunting visions of a dissolving reality, they leave one with a feeling not of emptiness but of profound contentment. Hosted by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts and Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts.                    Event: An exhibition of photographs by Dr Noazesh Ahmed When: Till March 31 (except Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

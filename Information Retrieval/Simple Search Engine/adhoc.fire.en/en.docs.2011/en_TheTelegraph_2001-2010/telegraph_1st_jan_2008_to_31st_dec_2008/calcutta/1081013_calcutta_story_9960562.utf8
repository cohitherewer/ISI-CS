                      Divine impressions                    To the people of Bengal, Goddess Durga represents a union of divine forces against the negative forces of evil. The image of Durga, the eternal mother figure, destroying the demon Mahisasura, is symbolic of the final confrontation of the spiritual urge of man with his baser passions. She is Shakti, the sacred feminine force, latent in all human beings. Her devotees pay homage to her valour in ridding the world of evil and, at the same time, welcome her as a daughter visiting her natal family. Also, they seek her blessings as the supreme mother. Over the years, the Goddess symbolism has undergone a slow and steady change. Increasingly, women look upon Durga more as a symbol of feminine power than as a divine mother, an inspiration to reclaim the rights that they have been denied over centuries. Featuring works that envisage Durga in her diverse aspects, Devi- II, the ongoing exhibition featuring works by 25 well-known artists of Bengal, is a celebration of all that the Mother Goddess represents. Participants: Ramananda Bandyopadhyay (a painting by him appears here), Dhiren Sasmal, Ashok Ganguly, Tarun Chakravarty, Subrata Das, Goutam Sarkar and others.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Total recall in gas chamber 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              Jibon Saha (picture by Pranab Biswas) after his arrest on Monday; (right) Readymade Centre in Sodepur, which caught fire on May 16				                                 
	The CID took Jibon Saha, the co-owner of Readymade Centre, to the Sodepur garments store on Thursday to reconstruct the chain of events after a fire broke out on the first floor on May 16.        
	The fire did not cause much damage, but 13 people suffocated to death because someone pulled down the shutter at the only exit from the first floor. Jibon was arrested on the basis of allegations that it was he who brought down the shutter to prevent shoppers from taking advantage of the chaos and fleeing without paying for their purchases.         
	 Our focus is on finding out exactly what happened on that day and thats why Jibon was taken to the store, P. Nirajnayan, the special inspector-general of police in the CID, told Metro.         
	During their hour-long stay at Readymade Centre, the six-member CID team asked Jibon to point out the spot where he first noticed the flames, estimate how many people were there in the store, describe what he was doing at the time and explain why the shutter was brought down.        
	He (Jibon) told us that he pulled down the shutter to save the customers from the flames, an officer said.         
	The CID will match his statements with that of his brother Narayan, a partner in the business. Narayan is out on bail, while Jibon will be produced in court on July 13.         
	Sources said Narayans statements were different from his siblings version of what happened.        
	Some of the survivors who spoke to CID officials said most of the victims would have escaped unscathed had the exit from the gas chamber remained open. We have recorded the statements of eight customers who were trapped and had to be hospitalised for breathing problems, a CID officer said.        
	Some customers told us that they were pleading from inside to lift the shutter, but their pleas fell on deaf ears.         
	Around 30 people, including some employees, had been trapped inside. There are also allegations about Jibon and Narayan trying to mislead fire services personnel. We are probing this as well, the CID officer said.

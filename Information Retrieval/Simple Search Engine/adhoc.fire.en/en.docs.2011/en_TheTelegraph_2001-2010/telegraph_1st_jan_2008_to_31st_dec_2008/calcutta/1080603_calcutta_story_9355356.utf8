                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Duo make off with store cash
  - ROBBERS STRUCK WHEN AREA WAS DESERTED FOR T20 FINAL          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Alipore store that was raided. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Two armed youths entered a department store in Alipore as customers on Sunday night and looted Rs 1.2 lakh at gunpoint. A third man was waiting outside on a motorcycle, on which the trio fled.        
	The youths had timed their operation well, said a police officer. They came around 9pm when Krishna Super Bazaar was empty, except for the owner and two employees and the roads were deserted because of the T20 final.        
	Owner Pawan Shah, 55, was preparing to close the shop  spread across 2,000 sq ft  when the youths turned up.        
	They were clad in shirts and trousers. One of them asked for a deodorant can and a shampoo bottle. They picked up the items and walked over to the counter, asking me to prepare the bill, recalled Shah.        
	As he was making the bill, the duo brought out revolvers and pointed one at Shahs temple. Sob taka diye dao, noy to shoot kore debo, one of them told Shah. Without waiting for him to act on the order, the two cleaned out the cash box.        
	After the youths stepped out, Shah and his two employees, Manoj and Amar, tried to give them a chase but failed to catch them. A youth on a motorcycle was waiting nearby. The duo fled on the two-wheeler, Shah recalled.        
	He immediately informed Alipore police station and a team rushed to the spot. We suspect the involvement of a local gang, said an investigating officer.        
	Shah and the two employees were taken to Lalbazar on Monday afternoon and shown the photographs of some criminals active in the area. But none among them seems to have raided the shop.        
	We are drawing the sketches of the youths. The employees are being questioned. We are not ruling out insiders involvement, the officer added.

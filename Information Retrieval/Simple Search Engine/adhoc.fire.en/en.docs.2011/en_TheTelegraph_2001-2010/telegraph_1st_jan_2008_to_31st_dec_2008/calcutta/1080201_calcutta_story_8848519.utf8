 - WORLD IT PLAYERS KEEN TO JOIN UP
     A STAFF REPORTER
                  
	An information technology (IT) product park, spread over 25 acres and involving an investment of a few thousand crores, will come up in Jagadishpur. 
    
	The West Bengal IT department will set up the park on a 160-acre plot it owns.
    
	We are also looking at building a telecom/wireless hub and an animation hub on the plot. The hubs, like computer chip designing units, need only quality manpower, not large tracts of land, Debesh Das, the state IT minister, said on Thursday.
    
	Das, along with IT secretary Sidharth, Webel managing director Debanjan Dutta, has recently returned from a tour of Europe. Representatives of Infosys and Capgemini were part of the delegation.
    
	The team met officials of telecom major Alcatel Lucent, based in France, who have expressed a keenness to set up the infrastructure for the telecom/wireless hub. 
    
	A Denmark-based telecommunication products company, Wireless Innovation Platform, has offered to set up Wimax technology in the hub.
    
	Webel and London-based venture capital company Cannacord Adams organised a seminar in London, which was attended by the top 35 venture capital companies and IT firms from the UK.
    
	We want to create an infrastructure in these three hubs so that any young entrepreneur with a product can come, plug in his computer, pay the rent and start his company. The concept has drawn the attention of venture capital companies, said Sidharth.
    
	A team of venture capital and IT firms  including Atlantic Bridge Ventures, Amadeus Capital Partners Ltd, PwC and Rothschild Zurich  is slated to visit Calcutta in April.
    
	The delegation from Bengal also visited Munich and Berlin. Munich, part of the Bavarian region, has a strong IT base. Bavaria will invite IT companies from Bengal for its biggest IT event in March, said an official of the state IT department.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kin blame cops, NRS for death
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Accident victim Saheli Roys parents will file a complaint against police and NRS Medical College and Hospital, holding them responsible for their daughters death.         
	A source close to the family said the accounts of witnesses to the accident on EM Bypass and senior police officials admission of a blunder had convinced the Roys that she could have been saved by shifting her to the nearest hospital instead of one 6km away.         
	Apollo Gleneagles is just a minutes drive from the accident site, as a senior police officer in Lalbazar pointed out on Sunday.         
	Saheli, who worked with the airline Deccan, was going to the airport in an Ambassador with two of her colleagues and the driver when it collided with a lorry coming from the opposite direction at 3am on Saturday. She died two hours later.         
	Saheli and the others had a bumpy 20-minute ride to NRS Hospital, where she battled for life for over two hours before passing away. They (the policemen who escorted her there) have been asked to clarify why they took the trouble of admitting Saheli to NRS Hospital, he said.         
	A Deccan colleague who had gone to NRS on hearing of the incident said medical attention was not prompt. We cannot forget how Saheli lay bleeding at NRS while the medical staff there were dilly-dallying with procedures. She could have been saved if promptly attended to. We will pursue this case to the very end.        
	The special additional commissioner of police (traffic) Ranvir Kumar said the four personnel from Phoolbagan police station who took Saheli, Sulekh Roy and Manish Singh to NRS not only blundered in choosing a hospital that far, but also violated the rulebook.         
	Removing an accident victim to the nearest healthcare unit is the prime job of a policeman. But in this case, the guideline was not followed, Kumar said.         
	Sahelis family believes doctors at NRS could have undone the damage by quickly referring her and the other victims to better-equipped hospitals.         
	The familys third-floor apartment, near Garia bus stand, received a stream of visitors throughout Sunday. Sahelis colleagues at Deccan paid a visit around 8.30pm.         
	The last rites will be performed tomorrow, the family source said.        
	Sahelis mother has not spoken since she came to know of her daughters death.         
	Saheli, a member of Deccans ground support staff for three years, was due to marry in December. Her father Prabir Roy is a retired bank official.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A techies take on kissing the world

	The city saw another of those STMs, a book belonging to the science/technology/management genre being launched at Starmark on August 22.         
	Bald and sauve, needless to say articulate, sipping tea at the Taj lobby, author Subroto Bagchi, of MindTree, the IT solutions firm, was doing the promotional rounds for his second book Go Kiss the World.         
	Behind his rather intrepid title is a personal story. Subrotas mother, on her deathbed, asked him to go out in the world. The son in turn asks his compatriot small town professionals to do that, get out of the rut and hug the world, and plant a kiss, while youre at it.         
	Hes done it. From small-town Orissa, Bagchi moved to Bangalore and then to California and back. Armed with a graduate social science degree (no he has NOT studied management), this IT professional-cum-entrepreneur is now a gardener (of MindTree).        
	Why should a company providing IT solutions be called MindTree is another management story, he says. Perhaps his third in line.                   Tejeshwar Singh       
	In memory of TS         
	Remember the deep baritone reading the news on Doordarshan much before the 24x7 channels? It had girls drooling. The man behind the voice, with a distinguished persona and a salt and pepper beard, had more laurels resting on his shoulder.         
	He headed a publishing house, Sage India, and took it to unprecedented heights. The publishing world lost a stalwart when Tejeshwar Singh died late last year alone at Mussourie. In his memory, Sage India will soon start a fellowship for promising publishing talents. Nice way to remember TS, as he was known. He had trained many publishing professionals.         
	Truly special        
	Its a special story about a special girl. Mouri has cerebral palsy. She narrates her own story of growing up in a middle-class Bengali family surrounded by the love and care of parents and grandparents. Music is an integral part of her life, as is literature and Bengali culture.         
	I am a Special Girl by Amitava Banerjee published by East West Books is largely a work of fiction, but based on the experience of the author and his daughter Oishi, also afflicted with cerebral palsy.         
	The book was launched at Oxford Bookstore on September 2 where Banerjee and the director of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, Sudha Kaul, spoke. Tanushree Shankar , who was slated to release the book and lend some glamour to the event, was held up by some pressing engagements.

	Calcutta rsquo;s trek to modern malls, which started with Forum four years ago, hit a high on Tuesday with the unveiling of the city rsquo;s largest mall mdash; also the first retail address designed by an overseas firm.
 
	 ldquo;At South City, you could be anywhere in the world, rdquo; said Darryl Skinner, the managing director of Bentel Associates. The Johannesburg-headquartered retail architecture and interiors specialist provided the design solution.
 
	 ldquo;In today rsquo;s competitive scenario, good design can be the first tool to fight obsolescence, creating the right tenant-mix and zoning, rdquo; stressed Skinner.
 
	The swank shopping address on Prince Anwar Shah Road boasts an expansive atrium, which itself acts as an organiser, and a ldquo;double-mall rdquo; effect with the multi-level car park, another first in the city. Glass balustrades aid visibility and at the upper level, the mall is pulled back to create punctures giving shoppers a wider sweep.
 
	 ldquo;There rsquo;s a science to design within the paradigm of organised retail. Our primary objective is to get the circulation pattern right so that we can get more people past shop-fronts and there rsquo;s an uninterrupted view of at least 30 per cent of all the line-shops at a glance, rdquo; Skinner pointed out.

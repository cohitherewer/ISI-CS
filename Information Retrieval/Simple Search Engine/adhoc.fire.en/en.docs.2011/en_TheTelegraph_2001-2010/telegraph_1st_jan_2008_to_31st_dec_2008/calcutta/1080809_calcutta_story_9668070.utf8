                      Laughter galore                    Laughter is the best medicine to ward off stress and heres a golden opportunity for Calcuttans to laugh heartily, courtesy the city-based theatre group, Theatrecian. Their bouquet of three short rib-ticklers, Bottled Spider (penned by Alistair Faulkner), The Marriage Proposal (by Anton Chekhov) and The Philadelphia (by David Ives) is bound to brighten up the audiences evening. Bottled Spider is a whacky, surreal comedy about a group of people who suddenly storm a courtroom and put a youth, Richard, on trial. As it turns out, the guy is none other than King Richard III! The prosecutor insists its high time (not less than 500 years) for the world to pass a verdict on whether Richard was a villain or a saint. The Marriage Proposal centres around Ivan Vassilevich, a hypochondriac, who visits his neighbour intending to marry his daughter. Everything seems to go smoothly in the beginning, but soon a squabble erupts over a disputed property and the evening erupts into a hysterical farce of quarrels and heart attacks. In The Philadelphia, the protagonist, Marcus, is having a nightmare of a day as nothing is going his way. His friend, Al, diagnoses his situation as being in a Philadelphia state of mind, where contradiction is a normal way of life. Direction: Dhruv Mookerji.

                      Of countenances                    In an age where good drawing seems to have become unfashionable, the paintings of Sabita Dhar offer a welcome departure from the trend. A self-taught artist, she declares that her extensive travels around the world have allowed her the opportunity to see works by great masters and imbibe from her experiences. Deeply influenced by Rembrandt as well as by the Impressionists, her style reveals a combination of realism and impressionism. Fascinated by the myriad expressions on peoples faces, she paints portraits that reflect the diverse nuances and shades of human character with great maturity and subtlety. Painting with great attention to symmetry and anatomical correctness, her fluid brush strokes convey a life-like impression of her subjects. Legends and Other Portraits, the ongoing solo show of portraits by Dhar, features works in two categories: celebrities and unknown women. Developed on the theme of beauty, the faces in the latter category mirror a thousand emotions and portray her vision of both physical and inner beauty.

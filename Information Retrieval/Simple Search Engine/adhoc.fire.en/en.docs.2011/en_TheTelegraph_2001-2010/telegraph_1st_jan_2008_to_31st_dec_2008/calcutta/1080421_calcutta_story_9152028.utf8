	BM Birla Heart Research Centre is planning to expand its chain of hospitals in the city and abroad.        
	We have plans to set up multi-speciality hospitals in Rajarhat, Siliguri, Haldia and Jharkhand, and also in Dubai and Bangladesh, said Suyash Borar, the chief operating officer of the centre.         
	According to Borar, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has promised to provide the centre two acres in the proposed Rajarhat health city.        
	The multi-speciality hospital will be set up in Rajarhat in the first phase. It will have 150 to 300 beds along with a cardiac unit, he said. The initial investment will be between Rs 80 and Rs 100 crore.        
	The centre also plans to open a chain of centres for collecting samples for pathological tests and diagnosis in the suburbs and other states.        
	In Siliguri, the hospital will be set up on a five-acre plot, which has not been identified. Another 150-bed hospital will come up on three acres in Haldia. The work is yet to start, added Borar. The centre will invest about Rs 200 crore in the two projects.        
	Talks with the Jharkhand government for building a multi-speciality hospital there are at a preliminary stage.        
	Discussions are on with the administrative authorities in Dubai for setting up a multi-speciality hospital.         
	We will be paid to build the hospital and run it, said the chief operating officer.        
	In Bangladesh, the centre is acquiring a hospital.

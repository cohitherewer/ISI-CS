          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man trying to mediate between two acquaintances quarrelling over money lost his life in the bargain on Wednesday night.        
	Dhanjuram Nishad, 65, stepped in when he saw Ramsabad Nishad and Jaipal Nishad abuse each other and almost come to blows on Amherst Street. Jaipal then picked up a brick and hit Dhanjuram in the head, police quoted witnesses as saying.        
	Dhanjuram was taken to Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	The police said the victim was in conversation with a group of labourers, including Ramsabad, around 10.30pm when Jaipal arrived. He asked Ramsabad to return the money  Rs 1,000  borrowed from him seven months ago.        
	Jaipal was drunk and started abusing and threatening Ramsabad. Ramsabad asked him to come the next day and this angered Jaipal even more, an officer at Amherst Street police station said.         
	Dhanjuram intervened when the quarrel dragged on for nearly 15 minutes. He asked the two men to stop fighting and go to sleep. He also tried to convince Jaipal that he would persuade Ramsabad to repay the money. It was then that Jaipal turned hostile and asked Dhanjuram to mind his business, the officer said.        
	Jaipal was produced in court and remanded in police custody till July 17.

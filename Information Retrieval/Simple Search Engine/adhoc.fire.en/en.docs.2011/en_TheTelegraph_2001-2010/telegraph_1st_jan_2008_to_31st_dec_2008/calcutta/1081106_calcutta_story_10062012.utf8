                      Colours and spaces                    A specialist in painting landscapes in oil, veteran artist Sudhangshu clearly deviates from the convention of celebrating nature in its idealised image. His works are never repetitive either, though, at a subtle level, there is an invisible thread running through all of them. Looking at his paintings, one does not feel as if one is looking at people, objects or landscapes from a fixed point of view. Instead, one becomes aware of the personality of the subject. Possessing the rare quality which makes the viewer want to look at his paintings over and over again, his images of rickshaws, women, flowers or tawny landscapes are very realistic without attempting to imitate appearances. Blank Spaces-Crowded Spaces, the ongoing solo show of his works, illustrates his response to daily life. Space is a mobile element in his works; paper colour merges with his compositions and changes the very identity of his images. His paintings are like a series of concentric circles where the outermost periphery represents what lies on the edge of the artists experience, while the inner rings relive ideas that dwell in his imagination. Blank spaces, crowded spaces, spaces with people, spaces without, all tell a story, at the same time leaving space to create new ones.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Sudhangshu When: Till November 8; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

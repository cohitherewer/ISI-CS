                                                                                                               Madhyamik shift in 09
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government will introduce grades and lower the pass marks in Madhyamik from next year. The academic session will also change to January-December from 2009.         
	State school education minister Partha Dey announced the changes while replying to a question by Jaane Alam Mian (CPI) in the Assembly. The state government is overhauling the school education system in tune with the recommendations of the National Council of Scientific Education and Research (NCERT), said Dey.        
	The preparations for introducing grades in addition to marks in Madhyamik are complete. The final notification will soon be issued, said the minister.        
	From next year, aggregate marks and divisions on the marksheets will be replaced by a seven-point grade. Students in the seventh grade will be declared unsuccessful.        
	Examinees currently need to get a minimum of 20 per cent marks in each subject and at least 34 per cent in each of the three groups (language, science and social science), comprising two or more subjects, to clear Madhyamik.        
	In the new system, students will not have to pass each group. They will need to score a minimum of 25 per cent marks in each of the eight subjects, stated Dey.        
	The main reason for overhauling the system is to reduce examination-related stress among students and make the system of learning more enjoyable. The grade system is expected to help the students improve their learning skills, added the minister.        
	According to him, the shift in academic session from May-April to January-December will increase the number of classes in a year.        
	Mamata Roy, the president of the Madhyamik board, said that only five instead of eight unit tests would be held in schools affiliated to the board from the current academic session.

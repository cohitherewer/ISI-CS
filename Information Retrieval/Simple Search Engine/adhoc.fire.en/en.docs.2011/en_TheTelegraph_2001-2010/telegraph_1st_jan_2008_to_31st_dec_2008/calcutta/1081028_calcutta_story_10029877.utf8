The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxis stand on way
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Taxis stand on way
                              On Diamond Harbour Road in Behala                            
	Where: Behala Manton Supermarket on Diamond Harbour Road        
	Status: Around seven to eight taxis remain parked near Behala Manton Supermarket. At stretches of Diamond Harbour Road, traffic moves at a snails pace because of hawker encroachment, parked commercial vehicles and several autorickshaw stands. The taxi stand near Manton Supermarket, located on the western flank, adds to the woes.         
	Pedestrianspeak: There are many encroachments on the road from Manton till Behala Tram Depot. Often the taxis stand in double queues. The situation worsens during peak hours, from 9am to 11am and from 5.30pm to 8pm. Surprisingly, there are hardly any traffic police in the area apart from Behala Tram Depot and Behala Chowrasta. At other places, there are homeguards. But the drivers dont pay any heed to the homeguards, said Debayan Basu, a resident of Sakherbazar, who frequents the place.                         On CIT Road at Ananda Palit bus stop      
	Where: Ananda Palit Bus Stop on CIT Road        
	Status: On both the eastern and western flanks of CIT Road where CIT Road meets Ananda Palit Road, taxis remain parked. On the eastern side through which southbound vehicles move, a board of Calcutta Taxi Workers Union, CIT Road Unit, affiliated to Citu is tied to a tree trunk. This despite a No Parking board and a police kiosk within a few metres. On the western flank, meant for vehicles coming to Moulali, a board of West Bengal Taxi Workers Union, also affiliated to Citu, is up.         
	Pedestrianspeak: Taxis remain parked here always. But the police never take any action against them, said P.K. Mullick, who comes to the place everyday.                         At Garia crossing on Raja SC Mullick Road      
	Where: On Raja SC Mullick Road near Garia crossing        
	Status: The situation near Garia More is alarming. A large number of vehicles going to and coming from places like Narendrapur, Sonarpur and Boral pass through this stretch. The autos plying on Garia-Gariahat route have their stand here. Almost two feet of roadspace remain encroached by hawkers, autorickshaw and taxi stands. Here, too, a board of the South 24-Parganas Zilla Taxi Workers Union affiliated to Citu hangs overhead.         
	Pedestrianspeak: Just opposite the taxi and auto stands is a state bus depot. Also the Garia-BBD Bag route minibus has its terminus on a lane opposite the stand. When the buses come out of their terminus, it creates a traffic snarl. The parked taxis add to the mess. At times, traffic here remains standstill for 10 minutes. Things can improve if the stands are moved a few metres away, said Surya Subha Bandopadhyay, a resident of Garia.                         At Rashbehari crossing.

	Where: Near Rashbehari Crossing        
	Status: Taxis are parked at the intersection of Rashbehari Avenue and Sadananda Road. A board of Inttuc (Indian National Trinamul Trade Union Congress) hangs on a tree. A large number of vehicles, mostly autorickshaws and private vehicles, coming from Behala and Chetla towards Rashbehari traverse this road. There are also some bus routes through here.         
	Pedestrianspeak: No less than 10 taxis are parked in this stand. They leave no room for pedestrians to climb on to the footpath. There is an entrance to the Metro railway station, which remains obstructed, said Kalyan Bhandari, a resident.         
	Policespeak: The police alone do not directly authorise any taxi stand. The municipality, in concurrence with the police, authorise taxi stands. As a rule, stands on busy thoroughfares are illegal. To put a stop to such stands, better policing is required. But we have very little manpower to do it, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, under whose jurisdiction the stands in Behala and Garia fall.        
	Unionspeak: Members of Bengal Taxi Association, a union of taxi owners, always instruct their drivers to park only in police-authorised taxi stands. We never protect errant taxi drivers, said Bimal Guha, the secretary of Bengal Taxi Association.         
	I have never seen taxis parked in double lines at Rashbehari Avenue-Sadananda Road crossing. We dont seek permission before assigning a taxi stand but if the police opposes, we shift them, said Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the president of Inttuc.         
	Only three taxis are permitted to wait at the taxi stand in Garia. But often 10 taxis are parked there. If the police order us to move, we will comply, said Pramod Jha, the joint secretary of West Bengal Taxi Workers Union.

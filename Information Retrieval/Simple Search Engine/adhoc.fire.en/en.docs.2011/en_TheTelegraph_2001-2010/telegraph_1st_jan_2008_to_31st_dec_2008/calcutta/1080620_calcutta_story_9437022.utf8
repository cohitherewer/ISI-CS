                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mob fury as school bus kills aged man
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mob overturned a bus in Kadambagachhi, Barasat, after it ran over a 62-year-old man on Taki Road on Thursday afternoon.        
	The residents later blocked Taki Road to protest rash driving. Senior police officers rushed to the spot and persuaded the protesters to lift the blockade.        
	The police said the mishap occurred at Battlala around 4pm, when the school bus was ferrying home 40-odd students from a private school in Kadambagachhi.        
	Moslem Ali, who lives in nearby Kathalia, was crossing the road. The driver failed to slam the brakes on time and ran over Moslem. The man was bleeding profusely and died on the spot, said Rabiul Sheikh, who witnessed the accident.        
	The residents stopped the bus and were about to damage it when a few people intervened, seeing the children inside. I saw many people had surrounded the bus and were shouting slogans. The driver and his help were looking around helplessly. They asked us not to get off the bus, said Amit Ghosh, a student.        
	Sadikul Islam, a local resident, brought down the children and took them to his house. The mob then dragged out the driver, Shahjahan Ali, and thrashed him. A group rescued him and took him to a shop, where he was locked up.        
	Some youths, armed with bamboo sticks, broke the glass panes of the bus and deflated the tyres. Then they overturned the bus, said Islam.        
	A police team soon arrived on the spot and dispersed the protesters. The body of Moslem was removed around 6pm, after normal traffic movement resumed.        
	The school had sent another bus on which the students were taken home. None of the students was injured, said an officer of Barasat police station.

           Brilliance of the being
          Sharmila Roys multi-faceted personality is reflected in each stroke that she makes with her masterly hand. Her love-affair with the arts began early in life and over the years each has enriched the other. Roys schooling began at Patha Bhavan, Santiniketan, and later at Kala Bhavan, where she studied drawing, painting, art history and specialised in graphic arts. She was trained in Rabindrasangeet by such stalwarts as Santidev Ghosh, Kanika Banerjee and Suchitra Mitra. She studied literature, but her urge to explore the fields in the non-performing visual arts led her to wander through the wide world. Roys sensibility, therefore, has been tuned by her vast experience, her repertoire proving that she pursues all forms of art and expression with an almost lustful devotion. Roys outstanding talents always provide an astonishing result and the ongoing exhibition of her artworks is no exception. A painting, titled The Pastoral Two, from her present offering, appears right.
         Event: An exhibition of graphic paintings and drawings by Sharmila Roy When: Till January 20; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Artspace India, 7 Deodar Street, Calcutta 700 019

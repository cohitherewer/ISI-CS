                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Buddha takes stairs, babus gasp
  - Power cut at Writers forces CM to skip lift for first time in over 2 years          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           STEPS TO GOOD HEALTH: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers in 2005                                                 
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee walked down a flight of stairs at Writers Buildings for only the second time in two-and-a-half years on Tuesday.         
	It couldnt have been half as difficult as climbing 26 steps at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street every morning, and Bhattacharjee didnt make a fuss either. But there was no shortage of apologies for the inconvenience caused to the chief minister by a transformer fault that had led to a power cut at Bengals seat of power.         
	 I am so sorry the chief minister couldnt use the VIP elevator. A power surge triggered the transformer blast, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, whose department is responsible for the upkeep of Writers Buildings.        
	Hemmed in by his guards, Bhattacharjee walked down 32 wooden steps to reach his car and head for a meeting of the National Mineral Development Corporation at a hotel. The last time he had done so was when a snag stalled the VIP lift in 2006.        
	It is not known whether the chain-smoking Bhattacharjee, who turned 64 last March, uses the stairs at the party office instead of the lift to keep his heart in shape. But cardiologists do recommend climbing stairs. It is a good exercise. Climbing the stairs till the third floor once every day is one way of staying fit, said cardiologist Kunal Sarkar.        
	Bhattacharjee does not have a weight problem but Sarkar said physical activity was a must, irrespective of size. It is even more important for someone like the chief minister, who has long working hours, is stress-prone and continues to be a smoker.         
	Bhattacharjee had jocularly asked for a stress-relieving potion on being offered a sample of ayurvedic beauty cream during the inauguration of an ayurveda college in Kalyani in August 2006. I dont need beauty cream but please give me something that will ease tension, he had said.        
	He would perhaps be better off following Sarkars prescription, ignoring the worried faces as he climbs or walks down the stairs at Writers. Minister of state for labour Anadi Sahoo is the only VIP who takes the stairs there regularly.

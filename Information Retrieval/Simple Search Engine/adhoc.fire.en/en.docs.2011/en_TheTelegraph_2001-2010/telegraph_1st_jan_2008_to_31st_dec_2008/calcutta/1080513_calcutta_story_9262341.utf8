          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two service tax officers walked into a CBI trap on Monday afternoon by taking a bribe from the representative of a company outside their office on Old Post Office Street, near the high court.        
	The company had approached Narayan Bhattacharya and Arup Chatterjee, officers of the superintendent rank, for regularising its accounts.        
	The duo demanded Rs 1 lakh, saying that they would have to conduct a thorough scrutiny. The company authorities then lodged a complaint with us, said an official of the CBIs anti-corruption wing.        
	Bhattacharya and Chatterjee asked the company officials to meet them outside their office with the money on Monday. The moment the duo turned up, we surrounded them. We arrested them after they accepted the money and touched the notes, added the official.        
	According to CBI sources, the company representative was asked to drop in at the investigating agencys Nizam Palace office before meeting the two officers.        
	We applied invisible chemicals on the currency notes to mark them and collect the fingerprints of the accused. This is our usual practice: it helps us prove the accused guilty in court, said the source.        
	The CBI authorities urged people to inform the agency if any central government employee seeks a bribe from them. If people come forward, our job will become easier, said a CBI official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A middle-aged woman was swindled out of Rs 20,000 by a man on Ultadanga Main Road on Friday, right after she withdrew the amount from a bank.        
	Niyoti Kundu, a resident of Muraripukur, came out from United Bank of Indias branch near Aurobindo Setu at 11am.         
	As soon as she came on Ultadanga Main Road, a man in his 30s stopped Kundu, identifying himself as a bank employee, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	He told Kundu she had forgotten to sign on one of the withdrawal receipts. He also took the money from her, assuring her that he would bring it back in a few minutes.        
	The man told Kundu that she need not take the trouble of climbing the stairs to go to the bank and asked her wait outside.        
	After waiting for 15 minutes, she entered the bank but couldnt find the man. When Kundu inquired about him, bank officials told her that none of them had approached her, said an officer of Maniktala police station.

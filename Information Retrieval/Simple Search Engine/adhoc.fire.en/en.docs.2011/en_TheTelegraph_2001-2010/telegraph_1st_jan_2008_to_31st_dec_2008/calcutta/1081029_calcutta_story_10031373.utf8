The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu wants width, Centre gives height
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu wants width, Centre gives height
  - Singur shadow on Shibpur as varsity upgrade hits expansion plan landblock          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NEW DELHI                                                  
	The shadow of Singur is looming over Shibpur. The Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu)s demand for more land to expand its campus is holding up its planned upgrade with the Centre wary of land acquisition in the wake of the Nano fiasco. The Shibpur campus wants to spread itself wide while the Centre has prescribed vertical growth.        
	Delhi is uneasy about the Besu demand for more land ahead of a change in status that would catapult it into the league of the IITs and the NITs, top officials told The Telegraph. It has placed before the ministry plans to expand the existing campus in Shibpur and build a new campus in Salt Lake.        
	The government is in the midst of finalising a detailed project report for the upgrade of Besu to an Indian Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (IIEST). Proposed by the Centre to meet the growing demand for engineering and scientific manpower, IIESTs are to be created under a new law that will recognise them as Institutes of National Importance.        
	At the first meeting of a committee set up by the human resource development ministry to formulate the project report or blueprint for the upgrade, Besu asked for more land to expand its campus, sources said. The demand came up again at a meeting earlier this month between Besu vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea and senior ministry officials.        
	Crucial to Besus upgrade is a plan  accepted by both the state government and the Centre  to try and double the intake of students at the institute during the XIth Five Year Plan, a senior technical education official said. Besu, with around 2,500 students and 250 teachers, is pushing for campus expansion to achieve this target.        
	We differ in the approach required for the expansion in intake. Land acquisition, especially in Howrah, is tricky as it is densely populated, a source said. Instead of acquiring more land, the ministry has suggested that Besu expand vertically to accommodate more students and teachers.        
	Any land required for an expansion in the Besu campus technically has to be acquired by the state government, not the Centre. But as the project is centrally funded, another ministry official said Delhi will most certainly be drawn into any controversy that arises.        
	Besus upgrade was announced in 2006 and has been held up over the past two years over a series of disagreements between the state government  that currently runs the university  and the Centre. Those disagreements, largely pertaining to the terms of control, have now been sorted out, officials said. It has been decided that the Bengal government will have more say in the upgraded institute than state governments do in an IIT on their soil.

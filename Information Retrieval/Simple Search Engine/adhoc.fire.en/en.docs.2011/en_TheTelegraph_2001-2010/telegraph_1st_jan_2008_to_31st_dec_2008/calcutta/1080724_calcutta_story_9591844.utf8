          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 23-year-old courier returning from Bangkok with electronic goods on Wednesday morning was arrested on charges of drunken misbehaviour with airhostesses and co-passengers.         
	Dinesh Kumar Gupta, who was returning on a Jet Airways flight that touched down in Calcutta at 10.50am, was detained by the CISF and later handed over to police.         
	Gupta has been charged with drunken misbehaviour, said an officer of the airport police station.         
	Airline sources said couriers, especially on the Bangkok-Calcutta route, often get drunk on flight and misbehave with passengers and crew.        
	The police said Gupta had boarded the flight with a bottle of liquor and started drinking soon after take-off. An hour later, the co-passengers started protesting against the Behala youths misbehaviour.         
	Gupta controlled himself for a while after an airhostess told him that drinking from ones own bottle while flying was not permitted.         
	But he soon started shouting and abusing the co-passengers, daring anyone to stop him from drinking from his own bottle. Immediately after the flight landed in Calcutta, airline security staff took Gupta, who was still drunk, to the CISF outpost.        
	He apologised for his behaviour, said an official. Gupta said during interrogation that he often flew to Bangkok to buy electronic items that he sold in Calcutta.

                      Painting with commitment                    Formed in 1980, Painters 80 is a group of artists with serious social responsibility. To some extent the group is rebellious, for it challenges the decadence of modern society. Though the profile of the group has changed somewhat over the last three decades, its basic ideology remains the same. Its ongoing 36th group exhibition showcases works of nine artists. Amitava Dhar (founder and former member) expresses his angst through figures of birds and beasts. Amit Chakrabarti creates an environment of turmoil, with distorted figures placed against a stormy background. The dream-like images of Alik Das give the sensation of a nameless tension, appearing and dissolving among the colours of his canvas. Dipankar Dutta tries to dissect the idiosyncrasies of life caused by a globalised community. Debashis Chakraborty uncovers the enigmatic veil that separates appearance from reality. The landscape and foliage of Pradosh Paul symbolise the violence that has penetrated all spheres of life. Tarun Dey (a painting by him appears here) explores the mythical layers of subconscious existence. Bhabatosh Sutar strives to find a balance between life and nature through his figurative exposures. The meditative forms of Tanmoy Biswas unveil the inner harmony of consciousness.                  Event: Group show by members of Painters 80 When: Till June 26; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Samokal Art Gallery, 23 Gariahat Road, 1st floor, Gol Park

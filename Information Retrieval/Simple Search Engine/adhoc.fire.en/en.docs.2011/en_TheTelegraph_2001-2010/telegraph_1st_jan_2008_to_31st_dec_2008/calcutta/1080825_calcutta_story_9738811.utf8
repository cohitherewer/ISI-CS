The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Denied shirt, teen found hanging
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Denied shirt, teen found hanging
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A teenager who had been rebuked by his father for demanding a new shirt was found hanging by a towel from the ceiling of their residence at Bijpur, in Barrackpore, on Sunday.        
	It appears that the boy committed suicide out of grief, said P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of police of Barrackpore.         
	Subrata Das had asked for a shirt after coming to know that father Sameer, who works in a sweetmeat shop, had earned some extra money by doing overtime. The family was having dinner on Saturday when Sameer raised the topic and Subrata, the second of his three sons, suggested that they have a non-vegetarian meal and buy new clothes with the money.        
	Kalpana, the boys mother, told the police that her husband decided to buy meat the next day and a new shirt and trouser for their youngest son, Raju.         
	This angered Subrata, who said he wanted a new shirt, too. We have three sons and our elder son is studying Higher Secondary. We find it difficult to fulfil all their wants with our meagre income. When Subrata began to nag my husband, he received a tongue-lashing and we all went to sleep a little later, Kalpana, who works as a midwife, said.         
	Sameer scolded his son again on Sunday morning, when the teen repeated that he wanted a new shirt. Both parents then went out for work. Subratas elder brother, who had gone for tuition, returned home around 9.30am and found him hanging from the ceiling. He immediately informed us and we called the police, said Samir Mondal, a neighbour.

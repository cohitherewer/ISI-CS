          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trains on the Howrah-Delhi route have been disrupted following the derailment of a goods train near Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday.         
	All trains bound for Delhi and those returning to the city from the Capital have been affected, said an Eastern Railway spokesperson on Wednesday.        
	He added the Howrah Rajdhani and the Sealdah Rajdhani were expected to arrive in Calcutta around midnight. The Howrah Rajdhani was scheduled to reach at 9.55am and the Sealdah Rajdhani at 10.15am.        
	The New Delhi-Howrah Sampark Kranti Express, also running over 12 hours late, was slated to arrive around midnight.         
	Early on Tuesday, three railway employees were crushed to death as a goods train hit another at Jhingura railway station near Mirzapur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, about 70 km from Varanasi. Several coaches of both trains were derailed        
	The Eastern Railway authorities were forced to cancel the Howrah-Delhi Kalka Mail and reschedule the Chambal Express and the Himgiri Express owing to the delay in the arrival of the corresponding Down trains.         
	We are working round the clock to restore normal services, said an Eastern Railway official, refusing to state when the trains were expected to be back on schedule.        
	Passengers on the trains that are stuck are being provided free meals, said the spokesperson.        
	Railway officials will be present at Howrah and Sealdah stations to receive the passengers, he added.        
	Anticipating trouble when passengers disembark at Howrah and Sealdah stations, railway officials have also taken precautionary measures.        
	We have sought the help of the state police and Government Railway Police and they have promised to extend support, said an official.        
	We will ensure that there are adequate taxis available outside both stations. The cops have been requested to ensure that taxi drivers dont take advantage of the situation and fleece passengers, added the official.

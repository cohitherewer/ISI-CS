	A man in his late 30s walked into Burtola police station on Thursday morning carrying a packet which he and many others thought contained a bomb.        
	The handful of visitors at the police station made a dash for cover and cops swung into action, bringing life in the north Calcutta pocket to a halt for two hours.        
	Experts from the bomb disposal squad found two tiffin boxes and a watch in the pink packet, which was kept on the pavement in front of the police station. Onlookers and traffic were kept a few hundred metres away.        
	The man who had brought the packet  he had identified himself as Lakshmi Narayan Gaur, alias Mallu  had disappeared by then. The cops are looking for him.        
	The packet was found in a vat in Masjid Bari Lane around 10am.        
	Everyone in the locality was saying that the police would have to be called in I thought you would take time reaching the spot. To avoid any casualty, I decided to bring the packet over to the police station myself, a cop quoted Mallu, clad in trousers and a shirt, as saying.        
	We have learnt that he is an alcoholic. Its true that most people in the locality had no clue what to do when they spotted the packet, said an officer.        
	Though wrapped in paper, the tiffin carriers and the watch were partially visible. The residents thought they were parts of a big time bomb.        
	Someone shouted that the police should be informed. But before the cops could be called, Mallu picked up the packet and walked off, leaving people around him stunned.

	A 60-year-old retired BSNL employee suffered a cardiac arrest and died on Sunday morning after being allegedly pushed to the ground by his landlords son.        
	Gopal Mitra, who had undergone two cardiac surgeries, was trying to save his son Gautam from being assaulted by his landlords family, said police.        
	We have arrested 54-year-old Sumati, the wife of landlord Ratan Das, their son Debabrata, 27, and daughter-in-law Kalpana, 32. They have been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, said an officer of Taltala police station.        
	The Mitras have been tenants in the Sirish Chandra Chowdhury Lane house, in north Calcutta, for 45 years. The family pays a monthly rent of Rs 30 for three rooms and a kitchen on the ground floor of the two-storeyed building.        
	The landlord has tried every trick in the book to remove us from the house, said a member of the family. A case is pending in the high court over payment of rent. According to police, on Sunday morning Kalpana had asked the Mitras to turn down the volume of their television so that her son could study.         
	I turned the volume at once but Kalpana and her brother-in-law Debabrata came down hurling abuses and started beating me. Sumati tore my mothers sari and slapped her. When my father tried to intervene, Debabrata hit him in the chest. He fell head first on the floor and died, said 34-year-old Goutam, also a BSNL employee.         
	Gopal was taken to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. Doctors said a sudden shock led to his cardiac arrest.        
	Gopals daughter Rupa alleged: Every time there was a fight between the families, Debabrata and Ratan used to hit my father in the chest.        
	Ratans sister Shibani Dutta said: There were frequent quarrels between the families regarding sharing of the common bathroom. Sundays incident was particularly bad but I am certain that Mitras death was accidental.

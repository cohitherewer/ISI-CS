                      Magic of Odissi                    Indian classical dance is commonly considered an exotic, exclusive and illusive art form, with very little connection to real life. It is perhaps this idea that attracts some and makes others stay away from it. Performances of classical dance also give the impression of a distance between the artiste and the audience; a distance that is enhanced by complex techniques, layers of costume and make-up. What is usually not projected on stage are the many facades of dance and the numerous creative inputs that transform a concept into a performance. More importantly, what remains unexpressed in the creative process is the individual vision of dancers, who dance for the sheer joy of it and for whom it is a way of life. Living With Odissi explores this creative process. It invites the audience to get involved and experience the magical powers of Odissi. This evening, Sharmila Biswas, Oindrilla Dutt and the Repertory Dancers of Odissi Vision and Movement Centre share with the audience the sacred domain within which they experience and celebrate dance. Items to be performed include Nava Pallavi, Images of OVM and Abartan Bibartan. Participants: Ayona Bhaduri, Shashwati Garai Ghosh, Neelay Sengupta and others. Also, release of the book, Knowing Odissi.                     Event: Odissi dance performance by Odissi Vision and Movement Centre When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Gyan Manch

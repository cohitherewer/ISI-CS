          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday awarded custody of a 10-year-old girl to her maternal grandparents instead of her mother, as the child had wished.        
	Under the Hindu Marriage Act, mothers enjoy custody of their children till they turn 14. The court bypassed the rule in the interest of the childs future.        
	The division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee asked the child to identify her parents. Nilu first pointed out her mother Anamika (names changed), an artist, and her father, a doctor , said sources.        
	When the court asked Nilu who she wanted to stay with, the child replied: I want to stay with my grandparents, who live in Asansol. The bench awarded her grandparents custody soon after.        
	Anamika had moved a petition in the high court demanding custody of the child. She had claimed that her father, a businessman, had forcibly taken away Nilu from her on October 20 as she refused to stay with her drunk husband.        
	The artist had alleged that her husband used to torture her. My feudal father was against my decision to divorce. He had threatened that he would not allow me to bring up my child if I did not stay with my husband, she had stated in her petition.        
	After hearing the plea, the bench had asked the grandfather and father to produce the child before it.

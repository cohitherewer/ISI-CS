The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu habit dies hard
                                                                                                            Besu habit dies hard
          A STAFF REPORTER                          CAMPUS UNREST: Upgraded Besu is in the midst of another confrontation. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Elevation or no elevation, students at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) will not change their stripes.        
	Two days after the Shibpur campus received official intimation from the ministry of human resource development about its upgrade to Institute of National Importance (INI), Besu students boycotted their semester exams starting on Wednesday.        
	This comes three weeks after the campus was declared shut, sine die, following clashes on the premises. Students were forced to leave the campus, only to return before the exams began.        
	The continued unrest on campus is disastrous for the image of Besu, that is poised to attain the status of a central institute of excellence, said a teacher at Shibpur.        
	The boycott on Wednesday was to protest the authorities decision not to allow 10 undergraduate students to sit for the exam on grounds of unsatisfactory sessional (lab work).        
	Bhaswati Mitra, the registrar of Besu, made it clear that the authorities would not bow to the students pressure tactics.        
	We hope good sense prevails and they appear for the rest of the examinations. But those who have not appeared for todays semester examination will be considered failed, clarified Mitra.        
	The students, too, hardened their stand. Shyamasis Das, the spokesperson for the Besu students union, said: The undergraduate students will continue to boycott semester examinations till the university authorities bring a transparency in the system.        
	Elaborating on the points of conflict, he said: Earlier, 141 students were declared discollegiate (for lack of attendance). Later, the authorities admitted that the list was faulty. On December 27, they released a list of 100 discollegiate students. That list is also faulty, as it includes the name of a student who has 90 per cent attendance. Before taking any action against students, the college authorities must be transparent in their dealings.        
	After the Shibpur campus was shut down on December 13, an academic council meeting had decided that the discollegiate students would be allowed to sit for their exams upon their furnishing an undertaking that they would abide by university rules and have 75 per cent cumulative attendance.        
	The undergraduate students refused to give any such undertaking and demanded that all students barred from taking the examination be allowed to write the papers. The authorities did not allow that.

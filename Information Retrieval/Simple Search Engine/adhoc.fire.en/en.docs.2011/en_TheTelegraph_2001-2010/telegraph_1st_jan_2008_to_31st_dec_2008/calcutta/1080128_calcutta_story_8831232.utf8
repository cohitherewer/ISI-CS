	Johnson Ekka and Sanjib Jha were arrested on Friday in connection with the death of 22-year-old hotel management student Mrityunjay Kumar, whose body was found floating in the Hooghly on January 21.        
	Ekka and Jha have given us contradictory statements regarding the incidents on January 17 when Kumar had attended a party with them aboard a cargo ship anchored in the Calcutta Port Trust area. The two are in police custody, said Sukumar Ghosh, the additional officer-in-charge of South Port police station.         
	Jha, an engine manager of the cargo ship, had invited Kumar and Ekka to the party. The two reached around 9.30pm and got drunk. Around 2am, Kumar borrowed Rs 200 from Ekka to take a taxi to his Behala Parnasree home.

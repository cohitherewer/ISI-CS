          A STAFF REPORTER                          Milan Molla                                  
	Milan Molla, whom police threatened to brand a terrorist if he didnt pay a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh, was arrested on a theft charge on August 6, an inquiry has revealed.         
	Officers of special staff port division (SSPD) had picked up the slumdweller three days after four members of his family died in a freak explosion in Cossipore.        
	Milan was arrested on a theft charge. I have submitted a report to my superiors. Action will be taken accordingly, assistant commissioner (port) S. Das, who has been asked to investigate the incident by the police commissioner, told Metro on Sunday. He refused to elaborate on the contents of the report.        
	A senior officer at Lalbazar said Milan was implicated in a theft case to extort money from the family. He was produced before the Alipore court and remanded in police custody for three days before being granted bail on August 12, he said.        
	Das met Milan and his mother Anwara Bibi in North Port police station on Saturday afternoon and recorded their statements. He also met Milans father-in-law Ayub Ali, relative Musha Ali and a trader who had pooled in resources for the youths bribe fund.        
	Milan told the assistant commissioner that his mother had paid Rs 35,000 to an SSPD officer to secure his release.         
	CPM parliamentarian Mohammad Salim, who learnt about Milans harassment a fortnight ago and requested the police commissioner to intervene, said: I have asked the police to return the money to the family. I have asked my secretary to provide them with all possible help and ensure that they get justice.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Plea against stay on shift
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Esplanade bus terminus: to be shifted or not to be shifted                                  
	The state transport department had misled the Supreme Court while obtaining a stay on a Calcutta High Court order asking it to shift the Esplanade bus terminus, environment activist Subhas Dutta has alleged in a petition submitted to the apex court.        
	The state transport department had obtained the stay from the Supreme Court on a wrong plea, Dutta has claimed in his petition, pleading for the order to be vacated.        
	The department had claimed that the high court had passed the order on some vague recommendations by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and that it had not been given enough opportunity to present its case. These are all false, Dutta claimed.        
	He submitted that the high court had ordered the shifting of the terminus on the basis of a 400-page report submitted by Neeri in July 2007. The organisation had recommended the removal of the terminus to a place 3 km from Victoria Memorial to control air pollution around the marble monument. The copies of the report were sent to all respondents, including the state government. All parties were given adequate opportunities to clarify their stand, Dutta said.        
	The Supreme Court will take up Duttas allegation on July 28, when the states petition against the high court comes up for hearing.        
	Last year, on September 28, the high court division bench headed by Justice B. Bhattacharya had ordered the government to shift the Esplanade bus terminus within six months and to stop parking of vehicles on the roads around Victoria Memorial.        
	During the next hearing, two months later, the government and police had informed the high court that the order relating to parking of vehicles had been carried out.         
	After the state failed to meet the deadline to relocate the terminus, Dutta, the petitioner of the original case related to pollution around the Memorial, moved the high court again.         
	During the hearing, counsel for the state informed the court that the government had obtained a stay from the Supreme Court.

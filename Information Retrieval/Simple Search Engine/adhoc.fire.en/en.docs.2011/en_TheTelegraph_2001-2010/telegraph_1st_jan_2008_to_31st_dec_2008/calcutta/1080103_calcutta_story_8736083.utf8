The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fliers cameras stolen
                                                                                                            Fliers cameras stolen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 27-year-old student from Calcutta, doing his Ph.D in electrical engineering in Cleveland, US, has alleged that two digital cameras worth Rs 13,000 had been stolen from his baggage on his way to the city.        
	My luggage reached Calcutta two days after I arrived. When I checked it at home, I found two digital cameras had been taken out of a sealed packet, said the student, who did not want to be named.        
	I will lodge a complaint through my travel agent after I return to the US on January 20, he added.        
	The student had travelled on British Airways flights from Cleveland to Calcutta, via New York and London. The last flight, from Londons Heathrow airport, was BA 147.        
	When he reached Calcutta early on December 26, he found the luggage had not yet arrived. Over the next 24 hours, he alleged, no official of the airline responded to his queries about the luggage.        
	I managed to obtain a tracking number and found out that the luggage had reached Mumbai from New Yorks JFK Airport, the student recalled.        
	On December 29, he was informed that the luggage had arrived in Calcutta from Mumbai on an Air India flight (IC 274). He collected the luggage the same day but checked it after reaching home.        
	The packet containing the cameras was cleaned up, except for the batteries and memory cards, the student said.        
	He called up British Airways, only to be told that the airline was not liable to pay compensation for loss of electronic items.        
	An airline official said no probe has been ordered as the student has not lodged any complaint.         
	An Air India official said their duty was to carry the luggage for British Airways.

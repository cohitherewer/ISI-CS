The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why I love the American elections 
                                                                                                               Why I love the American elections 
										      Made in Manhattan                                          
	I had promised myself that I will not write about the American elections. So many others were doing it, doing it so well and frankly I never thought I would be so engaged with the choosing a President process that the US is currently undergoing. But in spite of my initial scepticism, here I am, caught in the midst of election fever. And the real election is yet to start  we are still only in the primaries where the Democratic and Republican parties are picking their nominees through a Byzantine state-by-state voting process.         
	What is it about the American elections that makes it so captivating? Is it my newly acquired American citizen status, or the fact that news networks are speaking of little else? Or the rising rhetoric of this being a historic race for America with the first woman or first African-American nominee? I dont think its any of these  so let me try and explain my fascination with the elections.         
	 A few months back on a sunny autumn Friday I asked a British intern at my office what plans she had for the weekend. This was her final weekend in New York before heading back to cold, rainy Britain, and I was expecting some big touristy agenda. But guess what she said? She was going to volunteer for the Clinton Campaign.        
	Doing what, I asked? Folding T-shirts to be distributed at election rallies; stapling flyers that would be mailed out to potential voters; and setting up a hotel room for a fundraiser.        
	As the campaign war progressed and the debates heated up, my husband fell in love with the charismatic Barack Obama and signed us up to volunteer for the campaign on weekends. Volunteering can mean anything from going door to door and urging people to vote for your candidate to sitting at your own home and making calls to undecided voters. And you do it all for free.        
	The point is, non-political activists, ordinary people like you and me, can own a piece of the campaign. The more creative a campaign is at tapping into the grassroots, whether rich or poor, student or elderly, the more effective the support.         
	But in order to engage, you have to first get excited and thats where the stories come in. American elections tell stories and candidates are more than happy to share them.        
	John Edwards, who has since dropped out, always reminded people that he is the son of a mill worker. Or, Barack Obama, raised by a single mother when his Kenyan father left at the age of two. The press is also complicit but then everything is a fair target  their personal lives, their voting record, who donates to their campaign and so on.        
	This public scrutiny used to seem a little unfair to me till I realised that what this exposure does is give the voter a chance to formulate a three-dimensional picture. And its not just the candidates  their families too are pushed into the limelight. It never ceases to amaze me how active the wives or husbands have to be on behalf of the candidates. They are a constant part of the campaign trail, and in many events the primary speaker. Serving as surrogates for the candidates, they reveal another dimension regarding the contenders.         
	These stories also tell another tale. It excites a newcomer to the US by revealing the origins of the contestants, making you believe in the American Dream. You dont have to have rich parents or great connections, or attend Ivy-league colleges. You can be from a working class family, from a small town, from a regular neighbourhood school and still dream of running for the highest office in America.         
	And then there is television that brings the candidates even closer to home. In live debate after debate, the candidates have to explain every policy idea, defend every one of their arguments, their past records, why they voted for a bill or against a bill, and through all that they have to look good. Perfect make-up, perfect clothes and perfect grooming. They have to smile, shake hands with hundreds of studio audience members and maintain their cool in the face of intense criticism.         
	I dont know who will end up becoming the President of the United States in November. But as much as it matters who that person will be, equally important seems to me what the election process achieves  a sense of belonging and ownership to every person. Not just by asking them to vote, but by soliciting participation, engaging and moving the voter much before Election Day dawns. And that certainly seems worth writing home about.

	The blaze in Burrabazar was waiting to happen. On August 31, The Telegraph North Calcutta supplement had defined Nandaram Market as a ldquo;serious fire hazard rdquo;. Just how serious, was proved on Friday night.
 
	A warning was sounded in 2003 when a fire had broken out in the Nandaram Market basement. ldquo;We have upgraded safety measures after the fire, rdquo; Purusottam Agarwal, president of the Nandaram Market Traders Welfare Association, had claimed.
 
	But there was no sign of any fire-safety measure mdash; forget upgraded mdash; at the complex in August. In the hour that we spent in the market complex, no fire-fighting equipment was visible mdash; it was floor after floor of small rooms and cramped corridors stockpiled with textiles, fabrics and what not.
 
	 ldquo;Corridors should be at least two ft wide and there should be no kind of obstruction, rdquo; D.P. Biswas, the director of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services had said then. Overcrowding and lack of fire-fighting tools apart, hooking had made Nandaram a fire hazard. ldquo;Many traders in Burrabazar instal ACs but carry on with the existing electric line. Hooking is rampant. This may cause a major accident, rdquo; Aniruddha Basu, the general manager of CESC, had warned.

	But the traders could not be bothered. For them, Nandaram Market was like a cash cow, to be flogged till it dropped dead. ldquo;Renovation of the market is ruled out because for that, we will have to shut shop for some time at least. That is impossible, rdquo; said a trader on the 12th floor.
 
	 ldquo;Why single out Nandaram? There are so many markets like this in Calcutta. We will go on like this till the next fire breaks out, rdquo; another trader had shrugged nonchalantly.
 
	What he did not know then was that the ldquo;next fire rdquo; would spell doom for Nandaram.

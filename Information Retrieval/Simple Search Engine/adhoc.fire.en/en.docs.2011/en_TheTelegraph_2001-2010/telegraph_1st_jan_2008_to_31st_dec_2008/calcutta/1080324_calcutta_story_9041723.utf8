The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic workers occupy school
                                                                                                               Civic workers occupy school

	Group D workers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have occupied a central Calcutta school, run by the civic body.         
	More than 11 families  with eight to 10 members each  are staying in the 13 classrooms of the two-storey Urdu-medium primary school at 141 Rabindra Sarani, next to Royal Indian Hotel. The residents wash clothes and utensils and take their bath in the corridors. As a result, classes have not been held in the over 40-year-old school for several years.        
	The Group D civic employees who have occupied the school, mostly from the neighbouring states, claim that the building is under their control. Their families have moved in with them.        
	I work in the conservancy department of the CMC. I am staying here for free. This used to be a school but now the entire building is occupied by civic workers and their families, said Sandeep Mahato, who stays in a room on the first floor.        
	The school had about 200 students before the classes stopped, he added.         
	Once holding classes in the school became impossible, the teachers were transferred to other corporation schools in the city.        
	The residents of the area said that local councillor Sunita Jhawar has not looked into the problem despite repeated requests. A letter to mayoral council (education) Kalyani Mitra also did not elicit a response.         
	When contacted, Mitra passed the buck to councillor Jhawar. It is the duty of the councillor to bring the matter to our notice. Sunita Jhawar did not inform us about the situation, said Mitra.         
	Jhawar said: I am not aware that people are illegally occupying classrooms. I have not received anything in writing, so I cannot take any action.         
	Local residents insist that they have written several times to the councillor, but she did not take any action. We cannot afford to send our children to big schools. A primary municipal school is very much needed in our locality, said local resident Zahid Nehal.         
	Dinesh Bajaj, the MLA of the Jorasanko Assembly constituency, said: There was a corporation school at 141 Rabindra Sarani. It ceased to exist after people occupied the rooms. The school should be re-started immediately as that will help the local residents immensely.

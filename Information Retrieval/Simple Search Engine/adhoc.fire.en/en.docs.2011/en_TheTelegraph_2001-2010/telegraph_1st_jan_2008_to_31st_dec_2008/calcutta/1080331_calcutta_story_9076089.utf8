          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth from Patna was arrested in a Regent Park school on Sunday afternoon for allegedly writing a Staff Selection Commission test for an examinee.        
	Rajiv Kumar, 28, claimed he was taking the examination for his friend Santosh Kumar. Police, however, said he was part of a racket.        
	An invigilator in the school became suspicious after noticing that the photograph on the admit card Rajiv was carrying didnt appear to be his. When he could not provide a satisfactory explanation, the invigilator alerted Regent Park police station.        
	The police said Rajiv had confessed to the crime.

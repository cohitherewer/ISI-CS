          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high courts holiday pill for estranged couples has worked wonders again.         
	A Howrah homemaker who till the other day was accusing her estranged businessman husband of forcibly taking away their two children to Raipur patched up with him after a brief holiday.        
	Mrinalini (name changed), 27, had moved the high court in the last week of September for custody of her six-year-old son Raj and five-year-old daughter Rani (not their real names).        
	On November 24, the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee sent Mrinalini and her husband Ranjeev, 34, to a place of their choice for a weeks holiday. The couple cut short the trip and appeared before the bench on Friday to say that they had decided to stay together.         
	The couple and their children then left for Raipur, where Ranjeev runs a business.        
	The patch-up was possible because of the high court. On Friday, they told the court that they were ready to resume their conjugal life, said advocate Pradip Roy, who represented Mrinalini.        
	She had married Ranjeev in 2000. Their first child, Raj, was born the next year. In 2003, Rani was born and Ranjeev moved to Chhattisgarh to start a business there.        
	Mrinalini stayed with her in-laws in Golabari till early 2004, when she shifted to her parents house in Dum Dum Park.        
	With no trace of Ranjeev, Mrinalini and her children had to suffer at the hands of her in-laws. So she moved out. On April 4, 2004, Ranjeev went to the house of Mrinalinis parents and forcibly took away the children. She lodged a complaint with police but in vain. She then approached the State Legal Aid Authority, which engaged me as her advocate, said Roy.        
	 Mrinalini moved the high court seeking an order that would require her husband to produce their children before the judges after Puja. When Ranjeev appeared in court with the children, the judges asked him to go with Mrinalini and their children on a seven-day holiday, added Roy.        
	State additional advocate general Nisith Adhikary and public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami counselled the couple. The first two trips did not yield result but the division bench judges asked the couple to make another attempt to stay together for the sake of their children. The third trip worked, said Roy.

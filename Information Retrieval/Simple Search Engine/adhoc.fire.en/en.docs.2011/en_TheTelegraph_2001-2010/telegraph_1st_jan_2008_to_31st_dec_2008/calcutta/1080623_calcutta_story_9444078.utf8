          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A move to beautify the riverfront opposite Howrah station has run into a legal hurdle.        
	The owners of 115 shops in the area that have been asked by the state pollution control board to move out have challenged the order in the high court.        
	The owners, who have been illegally occupying Calcutta Port Trust land, argued before the green bench that the board had no right to evict them without providing an alternative place to set up shop.        
	The petition came up for hearing before the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh on Friday. After hearing out the owners, the bench asked the board to file an affidavit stating its stand on the petitioners demand.        
	The case, taken up as an urgent issue, will be heard again on June 27.        
	The board has issued the eviction order following a recommendation from the high court-appointed Ganga Monitoring Committee. The panel wants the stretch to be beautified to reduce the pollution in the Hooghly and visual pollution in the area.        
	The area will be beautified like Millennium Park. The Howrah Municipal Corporation and Calcutta Port Trust will seek help from private entrepreneurs for the project, said an official of the civic body.        
	Subhas Dutta, a member of the Ganga Monitoring Committee and an environment activist, said: While recommending the removal of the shops, we had suggested that the government make available an alternative site to the owners. We feel these establishments can be allotted space opposite the new station complex, where a railway guest house is being constructed.        
	Dutta said the establishments, mostly eateries, have been polluting the river. There is also visual pollution. The entire area will look different if these shops are shifted to other places.        
	A port trust official said: Only one of the 105-odd eateries had taken land on lease. But that lease had lapsed long ago and a plea for its renewal has been turned down.

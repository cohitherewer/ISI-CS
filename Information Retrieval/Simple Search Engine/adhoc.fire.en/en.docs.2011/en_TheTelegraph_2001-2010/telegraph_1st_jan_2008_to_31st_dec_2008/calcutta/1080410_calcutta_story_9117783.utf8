                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SUCI leader missing
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bidhan Chatterjee, a member of the SUCIs state committee, has been missing since Sunday.        
	The Behala resident has sent an undated letter to SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh, saying he would end his life because of corruption in the party, for which he held the leader responsible.        
	The letter, which came by speed post, arrived at the party headquarters on Lenin Sarani on Tuesday night.        
	Police have no clue whether Chatterjee, in his mid-50s, is still alive.        
	Neither the party nor the family has lodged any complaint. We have heard that a complaint letter has been sent by speed post but have no idea who is sending it. A probe has been ordered suo motu, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	Chatterjee was last seen on Sunday morning while leaving his Satyen Roy Road apartment, where he lived with wife Bulbul Aich.        
	Immediately after receiving the letter, party activists called Chatterjee on his cellphone. The phone rang once and the line got disconnected. Since then, whenever they tried to call him, the phone was switched off. The records with the service provider show he was in Puri when his party colleagues called him on Tuesday afternoon, said an officer working on the case.        
	Chatterjees five-page letter  four pages were computer-typed and one was hand-written states: A section of the state committee members has been protesting the corruption in the party but the leaders are not bothered. So, I have decided to end my life and the state secretary will be responsible for this.        
	When contacted, Ghosh said: I feel he has been suffering from depression for reasons not related to the party. Just because he said he would end his life does not mean he would kill himself. He might have wanted to end his political career.        
	Chatterjees wife refused to comment.

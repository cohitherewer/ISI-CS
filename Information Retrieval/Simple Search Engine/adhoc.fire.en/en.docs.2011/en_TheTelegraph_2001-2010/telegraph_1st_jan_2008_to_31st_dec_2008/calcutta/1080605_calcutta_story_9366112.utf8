          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Mehta Building ablaze on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture		    
	A case of negligence has been slapped on four men for Tuesdays fire in Mehta Building. Of the four, two are the owners of the Canning Street market, Purusattam Rajgharia and son Gautam.        
	The third is Partha Sen, the owner of SB and Company where the fire broke out, and the fourth is his manager, Mahesh Gandhi.        
	The case against the four has been lodged following a complaint by the fire services department, said an officer of Hare Street police station.        
	The charge against the Rajgharias is that they had not installed fire-fighting equipment in the five-storeyed building, while Sen and Gandhi have been accused of running their chemical godown without a no-objection certificate from the fire department.        
	We want to complete the investigation before arresting the four. The forensic report will play a key role in the probe, said the officer.        
	A team of forensic experts visited the market and collected samples from the godown. We suspect the presence of diethyl ether, a highly flammable liquid with a low boiling point, in the godown, said an expert.        
	Some shop-owners alleged that the Rajgharias had thrown every inch of the building, including the toilets, up for sale, ignoring the safety aspects.

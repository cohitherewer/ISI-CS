          SOUMITRA DAS                          Paintings being restored for the archive of the Government College of Art amp; Craft. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	The Government College of Art amp; Craft, Calcutta, will celebrate its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2014, and six years ahead of that it is making a desperate bid to preserve its invaluable treasure trove of paintings and drawings done by students who became the leading lights of Indian contemporary art later in their careers.        
	The college discovered this legacy about four years ago during spring cleaning when the works used to lie neglected on a loft and scattered here and there. That was the first time that the idea of creating an archive was mooted.        
	But nothing could be done about it then as funds were lacking. Earlier this year in June-July, Paris-based Indian artist Sakti Barman had donated Rs 6 lakh so that the college, of which he is an alumnus, could put its records straight.        
	The college is affiliated to the University Grants Commission and has received Rs 7 lakh for buying equipment, and this could further work on the archive. The Centre would also be requested to release funds for its 150th anniversary celebrations.        
	About 20,000 works have been discovered and some still lie scattered. Most of the works by eminent artists belong to the 1950s when they were students. There is an Abanindranath (the institutions first Indian principal) painting of Kach O Debjani, a Somanth Hore portrait, Ganesh Pynes oil of a still life, Sakti Barmans still life, a painting by Arun Bose, Lalu Prasad Shaws still life and a study by Musafa Manwar of Bangladesh. Their sketch pads revealed more.         
	Lalu Prasad Shaw had sketched a cockerel, an ostrich, a village with date palms, Ashes Mitra a scene of children fishing, women knitting, a Calcutta street by day and by gas light. Ganesh Haloi had done a drawing of refugees (the artist was himself one), of Nakhoda mosque and Jagannath ghat on the Hooghly.         
	Jogen Chowdhury was responsible for doing a series on huts with tin roofs and some with tiles as well.         
	The only point of departure was a picture of an ancient banyan tree with aerial roots. Jogen Chowdhurys oil painting of the woman in a sari is quite remarkable for its brilliant painterly qualities. His drawings are, however, far from that.         
	There is a canvas by Ramkinkar Beij, who had visited the college in 1978 but was never its student.        
	Some of these works were in a sorry state. Work on restoring them began in October.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Its thumbs up for King Khan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We Ask You Answer      Its thumbs up for King Khan
          Todays question: Who is the star of Kolkata Knight Riders  Shah Rukh Khan or Sourav Ganguly?                     Star Burst: Shah Rukh Khan hands over the man of the match prize to his team rsquo;s captain Sourav Ganguly 
                                    
	Lalita Agarwal, 
  Kankurgachhi									      
	Sourav is from Calcutta so despite his failures he gets the support of his Bengal fans. Shah Rukh can be called a bigger hero in comparison. He has raised the games glamour quotient.                   Saptadweepa Saha,
  Address not mentioned								       
	With successive defeats, KKR captain Sourav Ganguly has turned Kolkata Knight Riders into Kolkata nightmares. King Khan may be a star onscreen, but off it, he failed to pull the crowd after the KKR hat-trick of losses. In my opinion, neither can be crowned the star of KKR.            Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar  
	SRK is the star and Dada is the (disa)ster.         
	Suparnaa Sinha Dutta,
  Golf Green   
	Undoubtedly, Shah Rukh Khan. He has nurtured and motivated his team like a doting parent. It was a delight to see him cheering them at Eden Gardens. The team looked incomplete without the twelfth man. His incredible energy and dimpled smile are simply infectious.             Diptimoy De, 
  Barisha								       
	Shah Rukh continued as the star cheerleader of the team with inexhaustible zeal. In comparison Sourav was a twinkle twinkle faded star.                 Qutbuddin Tasira, 
  Taltalla Lane								       
	Shah Rukh is definitely the real star behind brand KKR. If it hadnt been for his ownership the team wouldnt have had got all the hooplah and fan following behind it.                 Priyanka Dutta, 
  Nager Bazar								       
	Undoubtedly, Shah Rukh Khan is the star of Kolkata Knight Riders. The twelfth man was more popular than the entire team. The spotlight had been on him ever since he stepped into the IPL arena. The crowd mostly went to watch the KKR matches because of Shah Rukh. Cricket became a secondary issue.                 Amrita Love,
  Address not mentioned								       
	Undoubtedly, SRK is the star of Kolkata Knight Riders, and not Sourav Ganguly. Even on Souravs home ground, Eden Gardens, it is SRK who ruled the masses. He is the reason why Eden was packed with people even after Knight Riders lost so many matches.                 Deblina Chakrabarti, 
  Behala								       
	Sourav is definitely a star player, but Shah Rukh is the magnet who was pulling nearly 90,000 spectators in every home match of KKR. King Khan made a mediocre team like KKR a must-watch in the IPL. His presence and absence made a difference in the performance of his team as well.                 Chitralekha Bhowmick, 
  Kaikhali								       
	Common people will always be moved by the presence of Shah Rukh Khan. Sourav is just a cricketer and entertains people only through the game but King Khan can motivate a larger section of our country.                 A.S. MEHTA 
  New Alipore       
	King Khan is the undisputed star of KKR. His presence at the Eden Gardens made all the difference.                 Basudeb Bhattacharya, 
  Salt Lake       
	Shah Rukh Khan is a star because of his consistent performance; and Sourav is a star because of his inconsistent performance.       
	Sujit De,
  Sodepur  
	Shah Rukh is the star of KKR. He is the man of the match for every match that KKR won. Sourav should be held responsible for the teams defeats and the bad weather. If KKR wins, it is for SRK. If it loses, blame it on Sourav!             Ashis Kumar Bhowmick, 
  Kaikhali								       
	The star of KKR is Sourav Ganguly. It is so because cricket fans love cricket and enjoy the sight of Dada emerging victorious against odds.            
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur  
	In a film, the hero is the star; not the producer. Similarly, only a cricketer can become the star of a team, not the owner. It is the cricketer who sweats it out on the field and helps the team to win. Not only did he ensure victory for his team, but also helped himself to two consecutive Man of the Match awards. Cheering from the stands is fine, but the real work is done by the cricketers and thus Sourav Ganguly is undoubtedly the star of Kolkata Knight Riders.             Nabanita Roy, 
  Dum Dum								       
	The star of Kolkata Knight Riders is obviously Shah Rukh Khan. Millions came to the ground just to have a glimpse of SRK, to hear his voice and dance to Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re. He has been on the front page of every newspaper. His presence dwarfed that of others, be it Souravs or anyone elses.            Subir Bhowmick,
  Shyamnagar Road  
	Generally producers and directors of films do not become the stars. But in this case, financier Shah Rukh Khan was the non-playing attraction to the Knight Riders supporters.         
	Suranjan Bonnerjee,
  Salt Lake      
	Shah Rukh Khan is my choice. He has proved that only his presence can draw more people at Eden Gardens than KKR. Sourav is our dada, but Shah Rukh is borda.             
	Dilip Kumar Biswas,
  Green Park  
	Shah Rukh Khan is the star.            Pankaj Bhatia,
  Loudon Street					       
	Both are kings. I wish both well.          Satyajit Biswas,
  Barrackpore								       
	People mostly went to Eden Gardens to see Shah Rukh. His enthusiasm is infectious In comparison, Sourav is just a cricket team captain.  
	Next week  
	What can the people of Calcutta do to defy bandhs?

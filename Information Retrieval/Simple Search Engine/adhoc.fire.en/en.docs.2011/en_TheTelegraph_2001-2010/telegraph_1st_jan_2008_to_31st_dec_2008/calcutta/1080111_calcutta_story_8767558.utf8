   Save animals from beastly folk

     Todays question: Who needs better protection at the zoo  animals or visitors and why? More letters will be published next week
                           
	PRATIKA,

	 I think security should be provided to the animals at the zoo. If we give love and respect to them, they will undoubtedly reciprocate. How would a human being feel if he is insulted, humiliated, mocked and not given proper food? He would burst out in rage. Men can fight for themselves but animals cannot and its high time that we stop our atrocities.

	No civil society needs zoos. Zoo-hopping reveals the sick mindset of people who get sadistic pleasure by curtailing others liberty. Animals are our fellow creatures. The way man tortures and captivates others is simply not acceptable. Anyone visiting zoos endorses this type of barbarism.
       
	

SUBHANKAR MUKHERJEE,

	 The death of Jayprakash Bezbaruah at the Assam state zoo raises an accusing finger against the deceased for his risky attempt to take a close shot of a wild animal. He was mauled by the tigress for encroaching into her enclosure. Tolerance cannot be expected from a fierce animal confined in a cage. A few days later a number of people teased a chimpanzee at the Alipore zoo by throwing stones which the animal threw back. It might have been fatal for both the animal and the visitors. To make fun of an animal brought away from its natural habitat is an inhumane gesture and deserves punishment. The government should ensure effective steps in preserving these animals. They need to be protected from the reckless visitors.

	 It has been observed that some people are inclined to tease innocent caged animals for their merriment. Sometimes they get injured and even fatally wounded. I feel the proximity between the visitors at a zoo and the caged animals is too close. This should be taken into consideration seriously, to ensure the protection of the animals from some hooligans.

	 A zoo or a sanctuary is for the protection of wild animals. Keeping them safe along with a better upkeep will not only increase their longevity but also enable the visitors to feel secure. It will also assure more footfall throughout the year. Taking into consideration the suggestions and complaints of visitors will help the zoo authorities in functioning in a better way. 
     
	

SAURABH DHANUKA, 

 Address not given
    
	 Visitors are already protected on the zoo premises since the animals are in cages. But nowadays the animals need to be protected from visitors. The accident at the Assam state zoo was due to the irresponsibility of a visitor. The warning Do not go beyond this pointis written outside the cage but visitors hardly take notice of it. In most zoos, the animals are not properly fed. Therefore, they are naturally more aggressive towards visitors who are bothering them. Anyone caught teasing should be severely punished. 
       
	

MOUMITA SENGUPTA,

      Man has become too insensitive towards animals. Animals never attack people without provocation. They have been kept in zoos for our knowledge and entertainment. But we have a queer tendency to disturb them and even hurt them at times. The zoo has security guards for our safety. But now the animals need security against human attacks. 

      
	

JOYDEEP CHATTERJEE,

	Protection has to be given to both the animals and the visitors. Some mishaps occurred last year due to the lack of strictness of the zoo authorities. Closed-circuit cameras may be installed in cages and important spots across the premises. People causing mischief in any manner should be punished.
       
	

KAJAL CHATTERJEE, 

 Sodepur 
      The animals, of course, need better protection at the zoo. During my recent visit to Alipore zoo, I saw a gutka- chewing man making faces at the animals and throwing stones at them. It is a shame that the animals, who have been kept captive in zoos, do not get adequate protection from the authorities and are left at the mercy of the mob. Security personnel should be posted in front of each and every cage and culprits who are bothering the animals should be punished. 

      
	

UJJAL BHATTACHARYYA,

 Entally 
      Providing adequate protection to the animals in a zoo is mandatory. However, taking into consideration the recent incidents, protection of visitors indeed has become an urgent requirement. Proper maintenance of the zoo is required so that the animals do not escape out of the enclosures and attack visitors. More guards need to be deployed. Visitors who violate the rules of the zoo should be penalised severely so that it sets an example. 

      
	

PRAHLAD AGARWALA, 

 Nadia 
      It is good to learn that a pair of chimpanzees which attempted a futile attempt to escape have been brought back to their enclosures. But the fact remains that they posed a threat to the visitors. On the other hand, the upkeep of the primates deserves to draw flak from the visitors. The zoo authority should look into the matter.

	With visitors being so irresponsible at the zoo, I think the animals need better protection. Troublemakers disturbing animals is a common sight. Hurting animals for the sake of having fun should be condemned. I think the zoo authorities need to be more rigid with the rules and a fine should be imposed on whoever tries to break them. Security should be beefed up to check that nobody gets close to the wild animals because it is not possible to curb their natural instincts. The visitors also need to be careful.
      SAUVIK PANDEY,

	Animals need better protection at the zoo. It is a place where animals are kept for entertaining people. But during last festive season, there were several instances of animals being provoked by the visitors. They throw stones at the animals in the name of mere entertainment. So, I feel authorities should take adequate action to protect the animals.

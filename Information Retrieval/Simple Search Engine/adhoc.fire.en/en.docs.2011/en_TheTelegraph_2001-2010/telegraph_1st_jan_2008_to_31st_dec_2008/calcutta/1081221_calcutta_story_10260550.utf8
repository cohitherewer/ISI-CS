										      eyewitness                            Works by Jamini Roy on display at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR                           
	Bengali beauties, they say, have eyes resembling two halves of a wax gourd extending from the nose to almost the point where the hairline begins adjacent to the ear.         
	This is, of course, a hyperbolic description of female pulchritude as conceived by the men who made decisions on almost everything that mattered to us well ahead of our times.         
	But Indian artists have down the ages interpreted this simile quite literally and have depicted beauties thus. Folk artists, too, continued this tradition and Kalighat patas are illustrative of this time-honoured convention.         
	Of the modern artists of our country, Jamini Roy famously did it, but not before he had passed through a phase when he painted in the post-impressionist style and even made copies of Van Goghs famous self-portraits reflecting the troubled mind of the artist who had taken his own life.         
	An exhibition of Jamini Roys works loaned from the department of information and cultural affairs of the West Bengal government is being held at the Bengal gallery of the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR.         
	Although the exhibition is titled retrospective there are too few works for it to deserve that name.         
	Most of these works had been displayed at the eye-opener of an exhibition organised nearly a decade ago almost single-handedly by Ganesh Haloi, when Jamini Roys post-impressionist phase had taken many viewers by surprise.         
	The surprise element is missing from this exhibition, and save the uncharacteristic caricature pata, most of the exhibits had been seen before.         
	Jamini Roy was so prolific an artist that it was difficult to keep count of his creative output. He allowed his students to help him with paint application, quite in keeping with the folk traditions, and that didnt help matters.        
	Apart from the Van Gogh, flower vases and landscapes there are of course Jamini Roys folk doll-like horses, royalty, farmers, warriors, elephants, deities and ox, all defined with bold lines and in brilliant colours.         
	A few deft brushstrokes had brought to life a remarkable dark-skinned peasant with a golden backdrop. Perhaps tired of this folk mode that became his trademark, he had already started experimenting and that was taking his work in a different direction. In a monochrome, he equated feminine curves with feline contours with a single lotus eye and single breast.        
	The most striking exhibit is his blonde Durga in skirt and armed with fan trampling a skinny man, a Bengalee, one suspects. The priest is a suited-booted Brahmin. This is more like Gaganendranath than Jamini Roy. Quite a revelation.       SOUMITRA DAS

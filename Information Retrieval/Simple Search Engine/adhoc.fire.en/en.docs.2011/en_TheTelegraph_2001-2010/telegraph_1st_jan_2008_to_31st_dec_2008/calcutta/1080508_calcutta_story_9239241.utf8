          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Childrens Academy remained closed on Tuesday, a day after its owner-rector B.N. Das killed himself following allegations of child abuse against him.        
	Classes will resume on May 9. Many parents have expressed solidarity with us. The charges against the rector are baseless, said Mita Mukherjee, who has been associated with the primary school for past 16 years. Local residents and Trinamul leaders demanded protection for students of unrecognised schools like Childrens Academy.

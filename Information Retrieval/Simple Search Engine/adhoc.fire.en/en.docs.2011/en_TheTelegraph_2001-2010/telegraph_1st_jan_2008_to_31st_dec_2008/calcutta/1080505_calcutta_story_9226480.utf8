                      Expedition through art                    Showcasing the works of five members of the Ash family, Journey Continues, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, presents a range of art works spanning over six decades. Tracing the evolution of art over the years in terms of theme and style, it offers valuable visual evidence of the dominant trends of artistic expression in each generation. Expounding a frank desire to convey the value of uncompromising artistic sincerity, the paintings of Gobardhan Ash (a painting by him appears right) are conceptual in nature, demonstrating eloquent mastery over diverse styles, techniques and mediums. Displaying equal competency in both material and abstract art, Nirban Ash uses the colour black in prolific measures as a symbolic tool. Deborshi Ash paints figurative themes, with lonely women symbolising freedom in his paintings. The creative genius of Jyotirmoy Ash finds expression in geometrical forms and structure. The works of young artist Chinmoy Ash reveal an interesting blend of impressionism and expressionism.

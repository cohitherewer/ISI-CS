          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had a horror ride in Howrah on Thursday without a police escort as his car got stuck in slush and another car in his convoy fell into an overflowing roadside ditch.        
	The parliamentary affairs minister had to travel around 7 km without an escort as the pilot car supposed to steer him to a Howrah puja from Vidyasagar Setu failed to turn up on time.        
	The sub-inspector assigned to escort the vehicle and the driver of the pilot car were suspended for the security breach after the ministers convoy floundered in waterlogged Belillious Lane.        
	Sub-inspector Sanat Bhattacharya and the driver of the pilot car, Pradip Manna, have been suspended for dereliction of duty. They were late in reaching the spot from where they were to escort the minister, said Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh.        
	Sources said the convoy was escorted by a team from Calcutta police till the toll plaza on Vidyasagar Setu, from where sub-inspector Bhattacharya was to take over.        
	Though the pilot car did not turn up, the minister decided to proceed towards the Jatiya Seva Dal pandal where he was to inaugurate the puja.        
	The convoy of three cars  a Sumo and two Scorpios  drove down Kona Expressway, Drainage Canal Road and Kadamtala before entering Belillious Lane around 11.30am amidst heavy rain.        
	As the driver of Das Munshis Scorpio swerved off the road to enter the puja ground, the wheels got mired in the muck. Then, the Scorpio in the convoy fell into a waterlogged ditch.         
	The four people travelling in the car escaped unhurt but the driver was injured. He was given first-aid by members of the club.        
	Subir Roy, the president of the puja committee, said: It was raining heavily but the minister managed to step out and inaugurate the puja. We were shocked to find that not a single constable was around.        
	The pilot car meant to guide the minister finally caught up with him at the pandal around 1.30pm, just he was preparing to leave.         
	It escorted Das Munshi  who had to switch to the Sumo on the way back  till Vidyasagar Setu.        
	A club member said: Every time it rains, the lane goes under knee-deep water. Besides, a part of the drains wall has broken, posing a risk to both pedestrians and motorists. We asked mayor Gopal Mukherjee to repair the drain but he has not taken any action.

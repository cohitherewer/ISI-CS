          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	All 48 police stations in the city will get bullet-proof jackets and helmets as part of the security beef-up following the Mumbai siege and its SIM card link with Calcutta.        
	Officers and constables in the police stations will also be provided sophisticated firearms of the AK series shortly.        
	The units of Calcutta police meant to take on terrorists, commandos and Special Action Force (SAF) have been using bullet-proof jackets and helmets.        
	Specialised forces have been set up to fight terrorists. But policemen are the first line of defence. So we need to equip the police stations properly, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner (headquarters). The police top brass had asked for advanced weapons and protective equipment after the Mumbai attack. A senior officer at Lalbazar said the government had assured the cops that funds would not be a problem in the procurement of apparatus.        
	The jackets and helmets will be distributed in phases. Each police station will get about five jackets and helmets in the first phase.        
	About 250 bullet-proof jackets and 200 helmets will be purchased initially. More equipment will be bought soon.        
	Three or four AK series rifles will also be given to policemen. Officers and constables will be trained in handling the firearms, said another officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.        
	According to him, special care has been taken to ensure that the jackets are of high-quality and capable of resisting bullets from AK series weapons and 9mm pistols.        
	Testing of bullet-proof helmets is going on at the Police Training School. We are purchasing the helmets from a leading company, said an officer.

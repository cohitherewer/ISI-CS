	Name: Kuber Sircar (picture right by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)        
	Age: 74         
	Claim to fame: Sircar uses his thumbnail to sketch portraits and figures on paper. He has won accolades for making wooden ties, which have an international market. His latest creations are a wooden wrap, which can be worn over a dress, and jewellery from the seeds of Krishnachura.         
	Early start: I started etching out figures on cigarette packet foils with my nail when I was in Class X, says Sircar, an retired employee of UP Export Corporation. I have no formal training; its more of a hobby. I always carry sheets of paper with me and start etching whenever I find an interesting subject.         
	He also pens jewellery designs before executing them a couple of days later. I collect the Krishnachura seeds when I go for my morning walk.         
	Wooden ties, some of which are embellished with gold foil and semi-precious stones, have been his most successful creations.        
	Modus operandi: Sircars workshop is a table, scattered with pieces of wood, seeds, colours and even shells. His room is filled with wood carvings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Ganesh, bicycles and lampshades.        
	I designed the wooden wrap for my granddaughter. She can wear it over her dress, he says. He also makes birds out of sea shells.        
	I am a jack of all trades. After retirement, I had a lot of time in my hands, so I felt this was the best way to utilise it.         
	Tips for the future: Sircar trains students in wood work, drawing and making birds out of shells. Art requires a lot of time, perseverance and an eye for detail, he says.

A Higher Secondary candidate from Shyambazar AV School got back his admit card, which he lost near Sovabazar Metro Railway station on Tuesday afternoon. Passersby who found it gave it to a traffic sergeant. The cop took the card to the school authorities, who called the students father and handed it over to him. The student was allowed to appear for the examination on the basis of a photocopy of the admit card that he was carrying with him.

He fled with the cash.

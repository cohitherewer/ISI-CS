          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A taxi driver died after ramming his vehicle into a divider on VIP Road early on Monday. He was speeding to the airport to pick up passengers landing at dawn.         
	The axle hit Sitaram Prasad, 35, in the chest. Police found him unconscious in the car at 5am, about 15 minutes after the mishap. The driver was declared dead on arrival at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	Prasad, who lived in the Biwibagan area of Tangra, used to queue up at the airport taxi stand every morning, said an officer of Airport police station.         
	On Monday, he was about to take a turn near the airport gate No. 1, which leads to the taxi stand of the domestic terminal, when his vehicle hit the divider, he added.        
	A preliminary investigation has revealed that Prasad was driving very fast and did not have the seat belt on.         
	The secretary of the North 24-Parganas Taximens Association, Aparesh Roy, said many drivers were flouting safety norms.        
	We have tried very hard to make them understand that the rules are for their own good but they refuse to listen. Accidents like these will continue unless the taxi drivers are more careful, said Roy.

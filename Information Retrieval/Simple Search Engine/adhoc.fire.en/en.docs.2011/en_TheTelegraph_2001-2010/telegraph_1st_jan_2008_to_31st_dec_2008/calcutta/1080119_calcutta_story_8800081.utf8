 - DECISION ON REOPENING TIRPALPATTI

             Traders clamour for coupons to enter Nandaram Market when it was opened to them on Thursday. A Telegraph picture
                    
	The state government on Friday decided to set up a committee to inspect the Nandaram complex and Tirpalpatti in Burrabazar and assess if trading can resume there on Monday.
    
	The committee will comprise representatives of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), police and CESC. 
    
	Even if the government decides to reopen the markets on Monday, the portion above the sixth floor of Nandaram building and the second floor of the adjoining Kashiram building will be out of bounds for the traders. They will also have to use battery instead of electricity for power.
    
	The decision to constitute a committee was taken after traders from the Nandaram complex and Tirpalpatti met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state finance minister Asim Dasgupta.
    
	Police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said the meeting was called primarily to allay fears that the complex would be pulled down.
    
	Even if a few floors need to be demolished, it will not be done immediately. Everyone concerned will be consulted before any step is taken. The chief minister has received a primary report on the market. A decision will be taken after he receives the final report, said Dasgupta.
    
	The traders will be given financial aid, after assessing the extent of damage. The assessment would be done within seven days, added Dasgupta.
    
	The traders of Tirpalpatti have asked for permission to operate from their old premises.Over 250 tirpal shop-owners have suffered losses of hundreds of crores. Unless the state lends us support, we will be ruined, said Mohammad Bhati, the president of the Bengal Canvas and Tarpaulin Merchants Association.

	Ruchi Todi was shocked when her name was announced as the junior-category winner of Tata Building India Essay Competition. This Loreto House student had been reluctant to participate in the event. It was my teachers who egged me on, she gushed.        
	Fifty city schools had participated in the meet. The winners were felicitated at Vidyamandir Hall, Birla High School on July 16. Education for all and the importance of primary education were the clinching points of Ruchis essay. Mitul Islam and Debamita Chakraborty, both from BD Memorial Institution, bagged the trophies for middle level (classes IX and X) and senior level (classes XI and XII) respectively. Debamita proposed a 10-point programme for a better India in her composition.        
	The winners received trophies and certificates from chief guest Surabhi Banerjee, the vice chancellor of Gourbanga University, Malda. While the winners went home with handycams, the runners-up got digital cameras.         
	Welcoming the initiative, Banerjee said, The competition will motivate students to understand the values of nation building. The essays of these students reflect the mindset of our future leaders.         
	The judges were all praise for the students too. It was a hard task to choose just three winners from this bunch of talented and intellectual write ups, said I. T. Myers, principal of Frank Anthony Public School.         
	The competition was launched in November last year in six cities. This year it extended to 12 cities . So far the city-level winners of Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Calcutta have been announced, who would compete with the winners of other cities for the national level competition to be held in August.         
	According to a Tata spokesperson, the competition reached out to 441 schools this year.         
	Last-years national winner had received the trophy from former President APJ Abdul Kalam. The organisers are trying to rope in the President again for the final felicitation programme in New Delhi.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a middle-aged trader was found floating in a Karaya pond on Sunday morning.        
	Abdul Majid had been missing from his Karaya Road home for the past two days. There were no injuries on his body. Residents of Kasiabagan saw it and informed police.        
	The cause of death will be known after the post-mortem. He might have been drugged and thrown into the pond. We are open to all three possibilities  suicide, murder or accident, said a Karaya police station officer.        
	Majid left home for his printing press in the neighbourhood on Friday morning, telling his wife Afia Bibi that he would be late. The family members do not have an idea where he was since then, said deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarna.        
	The inquest report suggested that Majid died at least 36 hours ago. He might have died on the same day when he left home, added the Karaya officer.        
	Employees at Majids printing press were questioned by police. We are trying to find out if he had any business rivals. But we could not get any lead in this aspect, said an investigator.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sidhartha Sen, in his mid-50s, was arrested on Friday for allegedly duping a private bank of Rs 34.5 lakh.        
	His accomplice Gauri Biswas, who had allegedly approached the bank for a home loan with forged documents, was arrested earlier. She told police during interrogation that she was paid Rs 3 lakh as commission.        
	Sen not only prepared the forged documents but also created a bank account under two fictitious names. The two were portrayed as the promoters of a housing complex in Rajarhat. The bank issued the cheque in their names, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (detective department).        
	An officer said Sen prepared forged papers of a flat and created false income statements for Biswas.

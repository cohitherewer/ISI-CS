										                                    Students perform during the western dance competition at Odyssey rsquo;08 on August 9.               
	School fests are no longer a simple mix of quiz contests, dance performances and songs. They also include Air Hockey and War of the DJs, with celebrities like Karan Singh Grover and Zubin Garg gracing the event. Such was Odyssey 08  organised by Birla High School in association with TTIS last week  that was lapped up by students who attended it. The 12 schools that participated in the extravaganza included St Lawrence School, The Heritage, Calcutta International School, La Martiniere for Boys (LMB), South Point High School (SPHS), Carmel High School, Shri Shikshayatan, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), Army Public School, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School and Birla High School (Boys and Girls).

	The event kicked off on August 2 with a computer gaming competition at Zapak World, Elgin Road and inter-school volleyball and basketball championships held on the school campus. At a Reps event on the following day, school representatives came together for a relay at E-mall on Chandni Chowk. They had to run down from the third floor, gulp a cold drink and run upstairs again, explained Nibeer Dewan, one of the organisers.        
	Other events in the week included Laughter Challenge, bowling, indoor cricket, mobile gaming and hair styling competitions.         
	On August 5, an Air Hockey contest was conducted at Space Circle, VIP road. Its an indoor game where points are scored when a puck is sent down a hole on the hockey table.        
	But the best was kept for the weekend. The high point of Saturday was a western dance competition that saw a packed auditorium cheering wildly. Students of LSA, clad in sequinned red tops and black pants, grooved to I like to move it from the film Madagascar. Students of LMB did a shadow dance. The host school scored points for creativity, doing a ghost dance wearing bloodstained masks and black wigs. The crowd could not stop cheering.        
	But the show stealer of the evening was Karan Singh Grover, Dr Armaan Mallik of primetime serial Dill Mill Gayye. And what mass hysteria he generated! Girls waved posters while one pecked him on the cheek. Karan in turn sportingly jived with the girls and walked the ramp with the boys. I spent most of my school life outside the principals office for all the wrong reasons, he joked.         
	A fashion show marked the end of the days excitement with students sashaying in a range of colourful garments. The Carmel girls draped in saris, salwar suits, harem pants and skirts walked the ramp holding books, flowers, even a belt in hand. We practised for about a week. This was my first time on the ramp and I was very nervous. But I loved the limelight, said Class XI student Rimi Matharu.         
	The Army Public School students wore summery outfits while students of SPHS showcased Indian outfits, some painting an Om symbol on their backs. Though amateurish, the fashion show showcased a gamut of talent.        
	It was followed by the war of the DJs where every school was asked to mix music on the console for five minutes. The event was judged by DJ Akash and Sumit who later performed to a thrilled audience.        
	The final day (August 10) saw schools participating in a Neon Dance competition clad in shining costumes. LMB put up an energetic performance. For Abhimanyu Joggani, it was the sixth performance this year. Our strength lies in our co-ordinated dance moves, he said. But again, the host team won most cheers.         
	Green Days Boulevard of Broken Dreams was a popular choice in the western music category, but classics like Imagine, Knocking on Heavens Door and Californication also found favour with the audience. SPHSs rendition of Green Days Wake me up when September ends was soul stirring. Drummer Sambit Chatterjee of Birla High also excelled as singer in his rendition of Hey There Delilah. The multifaceted student had also imitated instruments and percussion beats in the 60 Seconds to Fame contest.        
	We didnt want this to be a simple run of the mill fest. It had to make a difference, said Birla High student council president Vandit Shah.         
	After the recent bomb scare, our fest was nearly cancelled, said Vandit.         
	Zubin Garg, who shot to fame with songs like Ya Ali and Jhoom barabar jhoom was the guest performer on the final day. Belting out one hit after another, including Bachna ae haseeno and Mere umar ke naujawano, he left the students screaming for more.         
	The hosts were the overall winners, making a clean sweep of most of the prizes. Birla High School for Girls and SPHS came second and third respectively.

	Along with hosting a super fest, Birla High School for Boys decided to help out people in need as well. The students set aside a part of their Rs 11.5 lakh budget to fund cataract operations for 40 underprivileged patients. The operations were done at a camp conducted by Lions Bimal Poddar Eye Hospital and Shraddha Eye Care on August 3. The patients were from villages in the Sunderbans and Midnapore areas.         
	The operations cost Rs 500 per patient, and were done using Manual Phaco, or small incision cataract surgery. We offered a subsidised rate for the students, said Dr Divyesh Shah who helped organise the camp.

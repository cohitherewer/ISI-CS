The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ramp work to start and stop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ramp work to start and stop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police have come up with a new time-table and traffic diversion plan for the construction of a ramp on the AJC Bose Road flyover barely a week after finalising one and discarding it the next day.        
	K. Hari Rajan, the additional commissioner of police (traffic), announced on Wednesday that the stretch from Loudon Street to Theatre Road would be off-limits for buses for a month, beginning Thursday.        
	The road will be reopened to all traffic after that and the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners can resume work only after the school and college examinations are over.        
	The original plan was to divert buses from AJC Bose Road for as long as the project continued. The police top brass, however, developed cold feet a day before the project was to start last week.        
	Officials associated with the project appeared unhappy with the new plan, saying a start-stop-start strategy would lead to cost escalation. The original timeline for the project was 160 days.        
	After May, it will be monsoon. The area is a low-lying one and it will be difficult to work, an engineer said.        
	Sources said the HRBC was in a hurry because Delhi had released Rs 1.6 crore of the promised Rs 6 crore  the budget is Rs 28 crore  and could be asking for a progress report soon.        
	Two intersections on AJC Bose Road  the Ballygunge Circular Road crossing and Auckland Place  will be dug up in the first phase. One of the flanks will allow cars if the police are able to control traffic snarls.

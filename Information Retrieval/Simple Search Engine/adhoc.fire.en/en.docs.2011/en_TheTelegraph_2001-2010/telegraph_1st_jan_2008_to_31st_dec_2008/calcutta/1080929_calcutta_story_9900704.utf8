The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lost cash found   in bin
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lost cash found   in bin
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A polythene packet filled with Rs 2.15 lakh in cash was lost under a lounge chair at the airport, only to be found in a garbage bin. It was retrieved and returned to the woman who had dropped the packet by the cleaner who had dumped it.        
	Ranibala, 45, was on a routine round of the international terminal around 8.45pm on Saturday when she spotted the packet and tossed it into the nearest bin, thinking that it contained leftover food. S. Deshraj, who was carrying the packet of cash, was then busy greeting a group of 54 tourists from Myanmar.        
	I had left my seat and gone to the arrival arena as soon as my guests arrived. I realised the packet was missing around 9pm. The money was to be paid to someone, Deshraj recalled.         
	She contacted the airport manager, who showed her recorded CCTV footage of the seating area. But it revealed nothing.        
	When the public address system was used to ask employees and passengers whether they had found any such packet, Ranibala heard it and entered the airport managers office. She then headed straight for the garbage bin and fished out the packet.        
	I was touched by her honesty. The packet was wet and covered with dirt, but not a rupee was missing, Deshraj said.        
	For Ranibala, an employee of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) who earns about Rs 15,000 per month, it was all in a days  or nights  work. But Deshraj said she would write a letter to the AAI authorities on Monday, requesting them to reward her.

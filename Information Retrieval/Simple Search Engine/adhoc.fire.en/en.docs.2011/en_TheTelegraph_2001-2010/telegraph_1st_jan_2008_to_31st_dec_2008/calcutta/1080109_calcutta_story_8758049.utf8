The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vital facts buried with Riz
                                                                                                            Vital facts buried with Riz
  - CBI submits preliminary report, admits gaps in probe          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Rizwanur Rahman has taken the most vital clues about his death to his grave.        
	A CBI official told Metro this hours after submitting to Calcutta High Court on Tuesday a preliminary report of its probe into the death of the 30-year-old computer graphics designer.        
	Several unanswered questions leading to his death were buried with his death. There are some vital gaps in the reconstruction of the case which probably only Rizwanur himself could have filled, admitted the CBI official.        
	On receiving the CBIs report in a sealed cover, Justice Dipankar Dutta fixed the matter for hearing on January 11.        
	In the crowded courtroom No. 22 on Tuesday morning, he said: I am adjourning the matter till Friday. On that day, I will take the decision about circulation of the copies of the report to the parties of the case. The respondents will be given liberty to make their submission, if any, on the said report before the court passes further order in the matter.        
	According to the CBI official, the agency has failed to piece together the events on the morning of September 21, the day Rizwanur was found dead on the railway tracks in Patipukur.        
	We do feel that he committed suicide. We have reconstructed almost everything, but some vital questions  like what was going on in his mind on that day, why did he go to Patipukur, was he called by anybody  have not been answered, said the official.        
	The CBI, he added, would only submit its final report to the Bankshal court. We have submitted the preliminary report to the high court on Tuesday but the final report will be submitted to the lower court. The chargesheets will be filed soon and the trial will be conducted there.        
	The decision on how many people will be chargesheeted in the case has not been taken yet, said a CBI source.        
	This is not the final report. Senior officials are working on it and discussing who to chargesheet and what charges to press. It is still not clear whether the two IPS officers will be chargesheeted or which members of Priyanka Todis family and Rizwanurs family will be named, he said.        
	Counsel Kalyan Banerjee, appearing for the petitioners  Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan and elder brother Rukbanur Rahman  said: Before circulating the copies of the CBI report to the accused police officers and the Todis, the court should ask them to file their affidavits.        
	Joymalya Bagchi, representing the Todis, said: My clients want to file the affidavit only after they receive the preliminary CBI report from the court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pilot admits mistake 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pilot admits mistake 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The pilot of a Kingfisher flight had mistakenly steered it too close to the city airports secondary runway while another flight was about to land on Wednesday afternoon. The Calcutta airport authorities have stated this in a report to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in Delhi.         
	The Kingfisher pilot admitted his fault in his flight safety report. The aircraft should have waited behind the holding point on the taxiway, said a senior airport official on Thursday.        
	We have sent our report to the DGCA. The next course of action will depend on their response, he added.        
	Kingfisher officials were unavailable for comment.        
	The airlines flight to Aizwal had been asked to wait until a Jet Airways flight from Guwahati landed and cleared the runway. But the Kingfisher pilot overshot the holding point forcing the other plane to hover in the air.         
	Air traffic controllers had sent a message to the Kingfisher pilot asking him to back away behind the holding point. Once he complied, the Jet flight landed.        
	The holding point is a yellow line on the taxiway, which is painted a safe distance from the runway. It is one of the several safety measures in place to ensure that there are no mishaps, said an airport official.        
	The probe the airport authorities ordered into the incident continued on Thursday with several airport officials of different departments, involved in monitoring aircraft movement, being questioned. Their statements and the flight safety reports of both pilots will be included in the final report.         
	We expect to complete the inquiry and file the final report by the end of this week, added the airport official.

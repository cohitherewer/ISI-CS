The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Meeting flouts rules
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Meeting flouts rules
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The meeting at NRS Hospital on Monday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	The Trinamul Congress unit at NRS Medical College and Hospital flouted rules by holding a rally on the campus using microphones.        
	The meeting, organised by the State Government Trinamul Employees Federation to protest the alleged malpractices in the hospital, continued for six hours, starting 10am.        
	Calcutta High Court had banned the use of microphones on hospital premises.         
	It was held close to the lone entry and exit, near the Centenary Building that houses the gynaecology, paediatric and haematology departments, said L.K. Ghosh, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of the institution.        
	The meeting was illegal and unethical as it disturbed the patients. Many outsiders had blocked the gate, said Ghosh.         
	I asked the cops deployed on the premises to intervene but they didnt.        
	The superintendent said the organisers had promised to set up the loudspeakers in a way that would not inconvenience the patients.        
	I had obtained permission for the rally from Entally police station and the stage was erected quite far from the wards, said Trinamul leader Madan Mitra.        
	The police station denied having given consent for the rally. Neither did the organisers seek our consent and nor are we empowered to give such consent, said an officer of Entally police station.        
	The meeting, Mitra said, was organised to press for the employees demands, which included re-electrification of their quarters in Cossipore, introduction of compensatory appointment and recruitment of casual employees.        
	Asked whether it was unethical to hold a rally on the hospital premises, Mitra said: Every one does so. But we will try to find out if the patients were inconvenienced.

	The alumni of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta have offered to help students pick up vital rules of the glocal business game.        
	The graduates of the 1983 batch, who visited the Joka campus on December 28-29 for the annual alumni meet Reminiscence, have offered to prepare case studies based on their experience.        
	Some of the alumni members have shown interest in preparing case studies based on their experience in the business world. The real and live case studies will be useful for teaching, said Saibal Chattopadhyay, the dean (programme initiatives) of the institute.        
	As 20 of the 48 graduates of the 1983 batch were entrepreneurs, the institute hopes to get case studies rich in local inputs set against a global perspective.        
	The students and the teachers are excited with the offer. Case studies are integral to management education, enabling students to face real-life business situations and sharpen their managerial skills in diverse fields.        
	Like most Indian B-schools, IIM Calcutta depends on partnerships with foreign institutes, such as Harvard Business School, for case studies. Live data on multinationals is crucial to management studies, but the students miss out on local flavour in the inputs.        
	You cant get live data in India because there is very little industry-institute partnership. So, we have to depend on Harvard Business School and other institutes abroad that have easier access to the world of business, said Ashish Bhattacharyya, a professor of finance at IIM Calcutta.        
	Apart from the restricted access to boardrooms, Indian business lacks interesting cases  barring a few like the ones on Reliance and Mumbai dabbawalas  that the students can learn from.        
	A closed economy offered little scope for case studies on corporate experience. But things have changed in the past few years, with the Indian economy becoming more dynamic. If the alumni can provide interesting Indian case studies, it will be of great help to the students, said Bhattacharyya.        
	During their stay on the campus, the old boys and girls from the class of 83 also decided to extend a range of other supports, including mentorship programmes.        
	We have even been told that we can get in touch with the alumni members if we want to know the tricks of their trade, said Rohan Mahajan, the secretary (external relations cell) of IIM Calcutta.

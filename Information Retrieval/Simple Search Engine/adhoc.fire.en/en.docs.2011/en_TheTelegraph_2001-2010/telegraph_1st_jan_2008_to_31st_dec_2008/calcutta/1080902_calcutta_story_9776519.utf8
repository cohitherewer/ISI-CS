The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Race against time for cramped Patuapara
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Race against time for cramped Patuapara
										      ONTHESPOT - KALIGHAT PATUAPARA                            Inside Nikhil Pals studio in Kalighat and (above) idols line Parbati Chakrabarty Lane. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                
	With a month to go for Mahalaya and a fortnight to go for Viswa-karma puja, patuapara in Kalighat is buzzing with activity. Artisans are fighting the odds to meet the deadlines. But frequent rains and a crippling space crunch are giving them the jitters.        
	While the western side of Kalighat Road is dotted with work-in-progress idols covered with plastic sheets, the eastern side is lined with homes-cum-studios of the men at work.        
	Inside the dimly lit shanties that double as workshops, half-finished clay models jostle for space. Nikhil Pal, who delivers around 70 Durga idols each year, has a 250 sq.ft room that can barely hold 10 of them. The rest are out on the street weathering the frequent downpours.        
	Space crunch        
	Most workshops in the area are small and chock-a-block, forcing artisans to push their idols out in the open. Around 900 idols are made at the Kalighat patuapara every year.        
	Artisans bitterly complain about the lack of space. The orders start pouring in just after Rathayatra, in June-July every year. If we had adequate space we could have started work around that time. That would ease some of the pressure that invariably mounts during the final days, says Arun Pal, the joint secretary of Patuapara Mritshilpi Samiti. Besides, we cant stock raw material as there is no space to keep them. As Puja approaches, the price of raw material shoots up, grumbles Nikhil Pal.        
	Those who have orders for more than 10 idols are compelled to take some nearby plot on rent for a couple of months before Puja. This year I have taken a 1,000 sq ft plot on Harish Chatterjee Street paying Rs 10,000 for two months, says Nikhil Pal. Theres another plot on Ritchie Road where he makes idols. But shuttling between workshops causes him to lose precious time and this pushes up costs.         
	Taking advantage of their plight, some Puja organisers arrange for space for the artisans and in return they want their own idols made free. Those who make fewer images have no choice but to take up such an offer or be confined to their pigeon-holes in patuapara. Sanjay Chitrakar, who makes around 40 Vishwakarma idols and 10 Durga idols each year, works in the open on Parbati Chakrabarty Lane, a small bylane off Kalighat Road. I cant afford to take any place on rent, he rues.        
	Water woes        
	The water supply at patuapara is not adequate for the artisans. Every day, each of us requires around 15 large buckets of water for idol-making. Also, there are so many labourers working here who need water for bathing. We have only four tubewells and water taps in the area. Fights often break out among artisans, helps and the local residents over water, says Arun Pal. If water could be brought in pipes from the Hooghly it would help us a lot,he added.        
	Kerosene crisis        
	The artisans desperately need kerosene for their blowtorches to dry their idols in the countdown to Puja. The artisans at Kumartuli get extra kerosene for a month before the Puja. But here we dont get such facilities. One needs kerosene to keep the blowtorch burning and dry the colours on the images, explains Nikhil Pal. (An artisan of Kumartuli confirmed that they get five litres of kerosene each week for a month before Durga puja and for two weeks before Kali puja.)        
	False hope?        
	There was some sign of government intervention at patuapara when on September 2007 the standing committee on information, culture, sports and youth services led by chairman Tapas Pal, who is also the local MLA, visited the area to inspect the ground reality. The artisans had placed their demands before the committee then. Its festive time once again, but nothing has happened in the 11 intervening months.        
	Councillorspeak: The pressure of water supply in the area is optimum. And it is not really possible to get water from the Hooghly here since there are no such connections nearby and it is not possible to make a new connection now, says Ratan Malakar, the Trinamul councillor of ward 73. The artisans never told me that they needed extra kerosene. I will discuss the matter with the local MLA, he adds.        
	MLAspeak: I submitted a report to the ministry of information and culture about the plight of the artisans of patuapara immediately after the visit last year. Later, I also raised the matter in the Assembly but till date I have not heard from the ministry, says Tapas Pal.        
	There is no immediate solution in sight. I dont know why the committee submitted the report to the ministry of culture. Ideally, it should have been with the urban development ministry, says Dilip Chakrabarty, the secretary of the department of culture, government of West Bengal. We are preparing a report based on the recommendations of the committee and will place it in the next session of the Assembly. And in the meantime the patuas in Kalighat will continue to make clay images of gods fighting all odds.

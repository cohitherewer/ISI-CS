                      Inspired by music                    Collages first became an acknowledged artistic technique in the early 20th century, when it drew much of its material from the proliferation of mass-produced images in newspapers, periodicals, advertisements and so on. An ad-world wizard, Indrani Sen is one of the few genuine collage artists of our time. Using fragments of paper, her deft, nimble fingers create unique works of art depicting the different forms, shades and moods of modern, urban life. The ongoing show, Feelings, is a collection of 10 collages inspired by the songs of the music album, Ghoom Nei Raat. Each work on display is a visual representation of the moods and emotions that the songs evoked in Sens mind. Listening to the songs of the album, she fell in love with its tunes and lyrics, and they instantly touched a chord in her heart. Her feelings, as she heard the songs, took vibrant shapes and colours in her imagination and she found herself translating her thoughts in the form of collages. Based on the theme of human emotions in all its subtle nuances, some of the emotions expressed through her works include the intense loneliness of a rainy afternoon, the nostalgia of favourite old songs, the fleeting vision of a loved ones face amidst the clouds, the pain of unrequited love and the euphoria of travelling in the hills.                  Event: An exhibition of collages by Indrani Sen When: Till October 7; 4 pm - 7 pm Where: Gallery 79, 79 Raja Basanta Roy Road, 1st floor

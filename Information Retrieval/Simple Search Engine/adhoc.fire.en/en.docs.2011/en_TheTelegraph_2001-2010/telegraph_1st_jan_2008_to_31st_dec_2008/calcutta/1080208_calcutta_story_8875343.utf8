The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sportsman, teacher and a gentle priest
                                                                                                            Sportsman, teacher and a gentle priest
                              Father Joseph Paul Remedios                            
	A sportsman in his youth. A kind and gentle priest in later years, known for his preaching, counselling and guidance.        
	A student and later a teacher at St Xaviers Collegiate School, Calcutta, Father Joseph Paul Remedios passed away on January 10, 2008, following a heart attack. He was 74.        
	Father Remedioss Months Mind Mass will be held at the St Xaviers College Chapel on February 10, 2008, from 10am.        
	He was suffering from Parkinsons disease and arthritis and for the past couple of years was almost confined to bed, said his nephew Peter.        
	Father Joseph Paul Remedios was born on August 11, 1933. After his Senior Cambridge from St Xaviers Collegiate School in 1951, he went on to study in St Xaviers College. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1954 and taught in St Xaviers Collegiate School and St Lawrence School.        
	He served as a prison chaplain in various jails and also ministered the young girls of Loreto Entally, where he taught Catechism. They fondly referred to him as Father Jesus.        
	As the dreaded Parkinsons took over, Paul accepted this heavy cross but not fatalistically He fought it with all the strength and vigour that was reminiscent of his football and hockey days, of his days in St Xaviers and St Lawrence, at Dhyan Ashram, but always with the proviso Thy will be done, read the tribute of Father Boris DSantos of St Xaviers Collegiate School, whose friendship with Father Remedios goes back to 1943.        
	Father Remedioss funeral was held at the St Xaviers College Chapel on January 12 and the last rites were observed at Dhyan Ashram, in Joka.

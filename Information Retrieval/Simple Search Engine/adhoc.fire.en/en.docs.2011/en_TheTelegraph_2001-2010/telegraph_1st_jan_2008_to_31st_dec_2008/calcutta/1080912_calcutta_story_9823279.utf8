The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A dream team for fab Friday
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A dream team for fab Friday
  - Pacino-De Niro, Brosnan amp; Bachchan in rare all-English filmi fare          A STAFF REPORTER                                                        
	They are the two best actors in Hollywood. She is the best actress in Hollywood. He is the most stylish and successful Bond. He is the biggest brand in Bollywood history.        
	Thank god its Friday has a whole new meaning for a section of cine goers with Robert De Niro matching forces with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep matching steps with Pierce Brosnan, and Amitabh Bachchan matching up to a Shakespearean king.        
	Righteous Kill, Mamma Mia! and The Last Lear stir up a rare all-English multiplex menu on September 12  17 shows for Amitabh Bachchans first English film, 14 shows for De Niro-Pacinos third film together (after Godfather II and Heat), and nine shows for the screen adaptation of the ABBA musical.        
	Content is king now and thats why such quality actors are piling up on a single Friday, says Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum). This is why multiplexes came to Calcutta in the first place.        
	If Meryl Streeps single mother act in Mamma Mia! bowled over co-star Brosnan enough to announce shes truly the worlds greatest actress, Pacino and De Niros partnership as two veteran New York City detectives in Righteous Kill has prompted producer Avi Lerner to term it as an event in world history.        
	And The Last Lear  the premiere of which will bring the biggies to town on Friday  has been described by director Rituparno Ghosh as Bachchans first film in English, first film where he plays an actor and also his first art film.        
	Bachchan plays a retired Calcutta-based stage actor Harish Mishra (Harry), who is cast in a film, alongside Preity Zinta, by director Arjun Rampal. I would place this pretty high, Bachchan has told t2 about his role in the film based on Utpal Dutts play Aajker Shahjahan.        
	Brosnan has spoken about how he had the time of my life playing one of the three potential fathers of Meryl Streeps daughter in Mama Mia!         
	But all the rich talent of Pacino-De Niro, Streep-Brosnan, and Bachchan may not mean rich dividends at the box office sold on Bollywood.        
	Despite the great actors on show, the advances have not been too great with Rock On!! still being the first choice for viewers this weekend, says Abhishek Raina, marketing head of Fame Cinemas. The Last Lear and Righteous Kill will only pick up after the first few shows depending on the content. They are very, very niche movies and in English. Bottomline: They are no match for Bollywood.        
	But then there are those like actress June, for whom this is a fab Friday. They are all my favourites - Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep. If I was free on Friday, I would have gone for back-to-back shows. I would start with Righteous Kill and then go for Mama Mia!. I love Ritudas work and I love Amitabh Bachchan, so I would round it off with Last Lear!

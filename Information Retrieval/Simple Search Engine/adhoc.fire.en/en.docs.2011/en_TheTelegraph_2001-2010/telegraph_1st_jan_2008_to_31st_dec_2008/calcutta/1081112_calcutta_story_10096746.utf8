The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land-locked IT giants await allotment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Land-locked IT giants await allotment
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The land impasse for IT majors willing to invest in Bengal continues as the state government is yet to allot land to companies like Satyam Computer Services, Infosys and Wipro.        
	Satyam had requested the state government for 25 to 50 acres to set up an IT campus in the city a couple of years back.        
	The IT major had been allotted a three-acre plot in Sector V in Salt Lake in 2004, but it later wanted an alternative site.         
	We are still in talks with the state government regarding the alternative plot, said Ramalinga Raju, the chairman of Satyam, at a Nasscom meet in the city on Tuesday.        
	Work at the three-acre land in Sector V hit a roadblock as the proposed floor area ratio (FAR) of Satyams building plan was turned down by the Bidhannagar civic authorities.         
	Satyam later wanted over 25 acres so that its proposed tech campus could enjoy the status of a special economic zone.         
	State IT minister Debesh Das said on Tuesday that the government was in the process of identifying land for Satyam.         
	We are trying to identify land for Satyam either in the 1,200-acre IT park behind Vedic Village or in Jagadishpur, 3 km from the Rajarhat IT park, said Das, refusing to comment on the allotment price.         
	He also said the government expects to hand over a 90-acre plot to Wipro and 100 acres to Infosys in the proposed IT park behind Vedic Village by the year-end. Both Infosys and Wipro have been waiting for around two years for the land.         
	With the IT industry witnessing a slump, there are apprehensions that the companies may go slow on their proposed expansion plans.         
	Raju, however, sounded optimistic. The IT industry depends on human resource and West Bengal provides quality manpower. The government has been proactive and some temporary setbacks should not be taken too seriously, he said.

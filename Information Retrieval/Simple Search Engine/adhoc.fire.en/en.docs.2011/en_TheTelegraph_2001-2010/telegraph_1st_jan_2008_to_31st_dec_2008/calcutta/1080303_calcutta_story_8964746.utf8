The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest over landfill bid
                                                                                                               Protest over landfill bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The watery tract in Golf Green that is being allegedly filled up. Picture by Talat Salahuddin                                  
	A 15-bigha water body opposite Golf Green market is allegedly being filled up by its owners in collaboration with promoters. The owners, however, claim that the property is a low-lying plot of land.        
	Chandi Sardar Orao, one of the owners, said: Rainwater accumulates on the land since it is low-lying. It was never a pond. The land is, in fact, arable.        
	Local residents and the Trinamul Congress councillor of the area, Shyamali Bhadra, refuted the claim. Not only is the property a water body, it never dries up, said the councillor.        
	It is quite possible that the owners of the property are frontmen of the promoters. The ownership of the tract should be investigated, she added.        
	The civic assessment records, however, mention Bijon Sardar Orao, Chandi Sardar Orao and Mona Sardar Orao as the owners. Chandi currently looks after the property.        
	Recently, the owners started to build a wall around the property. Local residents saw this as the first step towards landfill and resisted the attempt.        
	Bhadra alleged that promoters had made at least three attempts to erect a boundary around the pond. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has sanctioned a construction proposal on the plot, she stated.        
	Mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma said the CMC had not sanctioned any building plan on the property.        
	He recently met the councillor and members of the Golf Green housing board and asked them to submit a status report on the property. Sharma also called for a bamboo fence to be built around it.        
	My department has issued a notice to the owners of the plot. If they dont come forward, we have the provision of taking over control of the water body under the Inland Fisheries Act, said Sharma.        
	Sridhar Debnath, who runs a garage near the disputed property, said: It is impossible to say who the pond belongs to since different people have claimed to be its owner at different times.        
	Minto Das, an elderly resident of the locality, said: I used to fish in the pond as a child, but I dont know who the owner is. It is probably a vested property.

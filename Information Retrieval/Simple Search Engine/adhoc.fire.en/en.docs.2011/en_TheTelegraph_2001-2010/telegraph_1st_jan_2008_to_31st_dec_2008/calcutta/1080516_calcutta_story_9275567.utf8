The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Creators of chaos in uniform
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Creators of chaos in uniform
                      
	Two thousand leaflets and a mention on the Calcutta police website  this is all that the traffic department of Calcutta police did to inform the people of the city about the revised timings of one-way movement on 44 important roads. Even that was done only a day before the change kicked in.         
	As a result, students on their way to write exams, people on their way to office and shoppers on their way to markets were forced to make unexpected turns and twists.        
	Manoj Verma, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), however, claimed that the change happened smoothly. It took some 10-15 minutes for things to smoothen and, apart from a few hiccups, there were no problems.        
	Metro was witness to the harassment of motorists on some of the major roads at 1pm (2pm earlier), the time when the one-way movement of vehicles reversed.                                 
	Where: Lord Sinha Road-Shakespeare Sarani crossing        
	When: 1.50pm        
	What we saw: Motorists caught in the middle of the traffic changeover were walking to their destinations. Gautam Shaw from Tollygunge had to cover the entire stretch from Lord Sinha Road till Little Russell Street on foot, dragging his two-wheeler along. Generally, I take a left turn (to Lord Sinha Road) from AJC Bose Road and reach my office on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. But as the traffic flow was reversed before 2pm, I had no option but to walk in this scorching heat, said Shaw.                 
	Where: AJC Bose Road-Park Street crossing        
	When: 1pm        
	What we saw: Most motorists who had no clue about the change automatically turned left (coming from the south) from AJC Bose Road into Park Street. But they had to immediately turn their vehicles back and proceed straight to avoid a head-on collision.         
	I was about to enter Park Street when I saw many cars coming from the opposite direction. Then a sergeant came running to me and said that from Thursday, the traffic changeover was taking place at 1pm. At least the traffic department should have informed the people about the change beforehand, said Prashant Banerjee, on his way to his office in Lalbazar.                                       
	Where: Russell Street-Park Street junction        
	When: 1.20pm        
	What we saw: Vehicles coming out of Russell Street and intending to head towards Chowringhee were being turned towards AJC Bose Road. As a result, a major congestion built up at the crossing in front of Park Hotel.         
	Every day, I take Park Street and Mayo Road to reach my office. Even on a bad day, I reach office in 30 minutes from my residence on Shakespeare Sarani. But due to this new schedule, I will either have to leave for office early or take Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. If I take that road, my first option will be SN Banerjee Road, which is notorious for snarls. The second option is Ganesh Chandra Avenue, also marred by congestion. I will either have to take BB Ganguly Street or Mahatma Gandhi Road. This is nothing but harassment, said Abhishek Jhunjhunwala.                 
	Where: Shakespeare Sarani  Karaya Road crossing        
	When: 1:35pm        
	What we saw: A student, who was going to appear for her financial accounting exam, got stuck in the congestion for seven minutes. I take the route from the Park Circus seven-point crossing to Mullickbazar and head straight to my college. But today, I had to make a detour via Shakespeare Sarani. I am late because I had no idea about the changed timings, said Gaurangi Chhotaria, a first-year student of commerce at St Xaviers College.                
	Where: Shakespeare Sarani-AJC Bose Road crossing        
	When: 1.10pm        
	What we saw: Cops struggled to divert the traffic according to the timing. The traffic signal at the Shakespeare Sarani-AJC Bose Road crossing was directing the vehicles towards Park Circus but, according to the changed timing, they should have been pointing them towards Shakespeare Sarani. I came to know about the change of timing only this morning when I reported for my duty, said a home guard, struggling to control the flow of traffic.                
	Where: Casuarina Avenue Queensway         
	When: 12.45pm        
	What we saw: The no-entry signposts that are used by the cops when the traffic changeover takes place were seen bearing the old timing.         
	On the Casuarina Avenue-Queensway connector, a policeman had blocked the road to stop vehicles going towards Cathedral Road, but the no-entry board behind him still bore the earlier sign. At the Shakespeare Sarani- Camac Street crossing, too, the no-entry boards bore the old timings. Some, like one on the Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing, however, had the new timings on them.                            
	Where: Park Street-Free School Street junction        
	When: 1.30pm        
	What we saw: A car came out of the building at 17G Park Street. Oblivious to the changed timing, the driver turned the car towards Jawaharlal Nehru Road, when he saw many vehicles racing towards him. He braked immediately. It was scary. There is not a single traffic cop here, said Deepak Sabharwal. (Pictures by Amit Datta and Pradip Sanyal).

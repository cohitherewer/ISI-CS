          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Ghosals would not have died had the level crossing between Agradwip and Patuli, on the Bandel-Katwa section, been manned.        
	There are 20,000-odd unmanned level crossings across the country, of which around 1,000 are in Bengal.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad, while presenting the 2008-09 budget, had announced that personnel would be deployed at all unmanned level crossings in the country in phases.        
	But not a single unmanned crossing in the state has been converted to a manned one since the ministers announcement in March.        
	It is not immediately possible to implement the decision because of a manpower crunch, said a senior official involved in railway safety management.        
	The decision on whether to leave a level crossing unmanned depends on its train vehicle unit (TVU), which is arrived at by multiplying the number of trains on the section with the number of vehicles passing through the crossing.        
	The level crossing where the Ghosals met with the fatal accident has a TVU of 1,300, which is quite low, said an Eastern Railway official. It means that only one vehicle passes through the crossing every hour.        
	The manned crossings have a TVU of 20,000 or more. When the figure touches a lakh, we consider building road bridges over the level crossing, said an official.        
	The less the TVU, the more are the chances of accidents, pointed out another official. We build speedbreakers and put up caution boards. After that, it is the responsibility of the people to pass through the crossings safely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seats for cash in colleges
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seats for cash in colleges

	Mohammed Ali (name changed) aggregated 60 per cent in the Higher Secondary examination, 5 per cent less than the cut-off for the B.Com course in the college of his choice. When his name did not appear in the admission list of Umesh Chandra College, on College Street, he got in through the backdoor by paying Rs 8,000 to some leaders of the student union.         
	Arnab Dutta (name changed) took admission in South City College for evening B.Com classes because his 59 per cent aggregate in the Higher Secondary examination was six per cent less than the cut-off score for a seat in the day section. But that was a temporary measure; he later paid Rs 10,000 to an ex-student to arrange for his transfer to the day section.        
	Some colleges in Calcutta are treating money and merit as two sides of the same coin this admission season.        
	Mohammed Ali and Arnab Dutta are just two of the many who have gained entry into courses in the colleges of their choice this year on the strength of money. As Metro went around the city to find out the extent of the seat-for-money syndrome, students and their parents reeled off names of several reputable institutions where this was happening.        
	The list includes Scottish Church, Asutosh, Surendranath, Umesh Chandra, City College (North), City College (South) and Jaipuria.         
	I always knew about foul play in college admissions But as I visited colleges with my daughter this year, I learnt how rampant it has become, said a father who had to buy his daughter a seat in the course and college she wanted to get into.        
	Some senior officials of Calcutta University admitted to being aware of money being equivalent to marks in admissions.        
	We are receiving verbal complaints of irregularities in college admissions. Complaints about some colleges admitting undeserving students in return for donations are coming in, too. But we are unable to take action in the absence of written complaints and concrete proof, said a member of the Calcutta University Syndicate.        
	The rates are between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000, depending on the demand for a course, the reputation of the college and the gap between the cut-off percentage and the students aggregate.         
	The rates are higher for subjects like microbiology, computer applications or bachelors in business administration. Some of the conventional favourites like English and Geography command high prices, said a leader of the Students Federation of India who is associated with some north Calcutta colleges.         
	According to him, student unions, former students, teachers and some members of the non-teaching college staff are the brokers.         
	Arnab met the ex-student who arranged for his transfer to the day section through an acquaintance. Manas Chakrabarty (name changed), another such student, was waiting in front of Bangabashi College of Commerce in Sealdah last week for some ex-students and union leaders to strike a deal for his sisters admission.         
	My sister has fared badly in the Higher Secondary examination, and I was looking for a source in the college to get her admitted through the backdoor. I bumped into these youths who promised to get her admitted for Rs 6,000, he told Metro.         
	Former students-turned-brokers hang around Scottish Church and Jaipuria, too. Those willing to pay money are told that admissions will be done through a special quota.         
	In most cases, such admissions take place after some applicants who make it to the first list forego their seats.         
	Backdoor entry is not possible without the support of unions, said a teacher of a north Calcutta college.         
	SFI leader Koustav Chatterjee claimed seats were not being sold in any college. I have never heard of something like this. Such things dont happen in Calcutta, he said.         
	But Sourab Chakraborty of Chhatra Parishad admitted that seats-for-money was the reality of this admission season.        
	Chinmoy Sekhar Sarkar, the principal of Surendranath College, said admissions in colleges of the city had always been based on merit. It is, however, a matter of concern if students complain that people are demanding money. I would appeal to every student to come and tell us immediately if anybody approaches them and offers a seat for money.

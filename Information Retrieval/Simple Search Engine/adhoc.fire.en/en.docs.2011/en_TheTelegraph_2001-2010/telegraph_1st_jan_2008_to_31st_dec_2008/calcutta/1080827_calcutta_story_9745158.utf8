                      Between dreams and reality                    Associated with the Indian film industry since 2002, Devashish Makhija makes his debut as a poet-artist with Occupying Silence, a book of graphic verse. Each work in it skillfully dissects human experience, laying bare the other side of real vision. His references are daily occurrences in our common world, viewed with a completely different perspective. Exploring a new medium where poetry and graphic art combine seamlessly to express his perception of life, Makhijas work is blatantly told, hitting the reader with effortless ease. His work very often takes a graphical shape to complement the visual image and has references to both pop as well as graphic art. This evening, Starmark and Gallery Kanishkas host Coffee, Tea or Me, the launch of the book, Occupying Silence, to be followed by an interactive session featuring the author, Aparna Sen and Anurag Kashyap. Coinciding with the launch is the ongoing exhibition of graphic verse by Makhija at Gallery Kanishkas, till September 10, 11 am - 8 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic plan for Bypass hub 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Traffic plan for Bypass hub 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	The civic authorities have decided to draw up a traffic plan for the EM Bypass-Park Circus intersection well before a proposed hospitality hub comes up in the area.        
	This is the first time the civic managers have come forward with a traffic scheme before the implementation of private sector projects.        
	The traffic plan will be prepared in consultation with the city and district police, civic sources said.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhayay is scheduled to inspect the area on Thursday along with the additional commissioner of police, K. Harirajan, and the inspector-general of police (South Bengal), Surajeet Karpurakayastha.        
	The traffic plan will include construction of an underpass, graded separators and flyovers as joint venture projects with the private sector.         
	The CMDA is constructing a flyover connecting bridge No. 4 with Dhapa. It will be a great advantage if a flank is added to it from the proposed hospitality hub, said the civic deputy chief engineer (civil), Soumitra Bhattacharya.        
	The area will have a fair ground (Milon Mela), five hotels of international standard and six multi-speciality healthcare facilities by 2011. The civic authorities predict that the volume of traffic in the area will increase 10-fold once the hub comes up.        
	Over Rs 5,000 crore will be pumped into the hospitality sector in the area in the next three years and it will increase the total hotel accommodation available in the city by 2,000, said Bandopadhyay.         
	If we do not draw up a traffic management plan now, there will be a tremendous traffic chaos in the area from 2011, he added.        
	Two private groups have already contributed Rs 3.5 crore for the purpose. Others are also expected to pump in money, the municipal commissioner said.        
	ITC is building a 30-storeyed extension of their existing multi-star hotel, The Sonar. DLF has bought several acres of land for Rs 155 crore to build a hotel with 500 rooms and 84 suites. The APJ and MRMG groups are also planning hotels in the area, civic sources said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Santa arrived under heavy security cover, and so will the New Year.        
	The Lalbazar top brass have issued directives to the 48 police stations asking officers to remain extra vigilant during the holiday season and carry out continuous checks, even at the cost of holding up commuters and vehicles.        
	Following the Christmas Eve false alarm of a terror attack on Metro Railway, nearly 3,500 policemen, including from the Reserve Force, will be on vigil on the road.        
	Five police stations, including Beniapukur and Topsia, have been asked to hire an additional car so that there is no shortage of vehicles for on-road raids. The special raid section of the traffic police has been directed to conduct late-night checks.        
	Certain aspects of the security arrangements cannot be revealed. There will be no change in the security arrangements that have been put in place in view of inputs from intelligence agencies, said a senior IPS officer at Lalbazar.        
	Every police station has been asked to submit a daily report of vehicle checks and inform divisional control rooms every hour about the location of officers conducting checks. Night vigil at the city entry points also has to be stepped up.        
	Markets, malls, vital installations and places of worship have been brought under the security net.        
	The Coast Guard and the River Traffic Police are supposed to co-ordinate among themselves to prevent infiltration through water routes.

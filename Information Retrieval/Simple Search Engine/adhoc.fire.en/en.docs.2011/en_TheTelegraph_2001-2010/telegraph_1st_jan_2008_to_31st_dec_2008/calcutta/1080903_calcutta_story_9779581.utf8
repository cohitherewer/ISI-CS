           Gone with the axe: Branches of trees lining VIP Road chopped off without permission from the forest department to increase the visibility of billboards dotting both sides of the thoroughfare                             
	The ambience within the campuses of major educational institutions is degenerating because of the utter disregard for values and civility of a section of students and teachers (War cry after JU bosses rescue, July 25).           
	Brawls among students are on the rise, inspired by politics from outside campus. Political considerations force the authorities to turn a blind eye and the government, which has been boasting of fair governance for the last three decades, has failed to tackle a handful of campus goons. Education and careers are being sacrificed and politics without vision stoked.           
	Psephological politics has entered the Besu, JU and SSKM campuses. From criminal intimidation to wrongful confinement and abusive slogans, students now stop at nothing. Only drastic measures may help improve the atmosphere on campuses. It is high time to enforce the law in letter and spirit. Let a few offenders face police hazards, court processes and trials. Their high-handedness will vanish overnight.

	With reference to your report Trees fall prey to display ads, July 21, it is heartening that residents took action and informed the forest department about pruning and felling of trees. A helpline should be set up and its numbers widely published so that the public has easy and instant access to the authorities to lodge complaints in this regard. The authorities concerned, especially police, should also be prompt so that the damage can be prevented or contained, instead of taking action after it is already done.

	It is discouraging that the citys trees are being chopped mercilessly to display billboards. It is astonishing that while the whole world is working against global warming, the civic authorities remain negligent merely to bag revenue from advertisements.           
	In the last few years, many large trees and water bodies have been wiped out in the city, yet the government cannot be shaken out of its indifference.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala           
	It is a harsh truth that the forest department  the green guardians of the city  has been flooded with complaints regarding the clandestine felling of trees or cutting of branches by local goons. To ensure eco-friendly surrounding and stop environment pollution, advertising agencies commissioning the cutting of trees for displaying billboards should be brought to book.

	Apropos the report HS students lose out in admissions, July 9, I think the colleges should reserve at least a few seats for candidates from the Higher Secondary background. It was surprising to read that only a handful of students from HS board was selected in JU. I was shocked to read that even a score of 67 per cent in English wasnt enough to secure a seat for a one candidate in Presidency College. The selection board of every college must distinguish between ISC/CBSE and HS applicants. Or else, HS students will be left out at every step, now academically and later professionally.             
	Anushri Mondal, 
  Gol Park                       
	The decision of municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to appoint a third-party ombudsman in civic administration (July 16) is a welcome move. This will bring about transparency in services. The municipal commissioner should immediately announce the date of appointment and address of the ombudsman.             
	Like a banking ombudsman sorts out bank-related problems, a municipal ombudsman will help solve civic problems of citizens.

	The report about a first year student of the architecture department of Jadavpur University being ragged made me sick (Drinks, drug in JU ragging, July 19). This campus virus shows no signs of being curbed despite numerous instances of freshers in engineering and medical colleges being terrorised by seniors in the past. No word is enough to condemn the heinous act of the students who are supposed to be the future builders of the nation.             
	P. B. Saha,
  Salt Lake           
	The ragging of a fresher in Jadavpur University shows how teachers are treating this horrific incident lightly. Despite the Supreme Courts directives against ragging being displayed prominently on campuses, such incidents keep recurring. The authorities must caution seniors students that they will be expelled for such behaviour. Freshers should be encouraged to report incidents of ragging and students unions should keep vigil on campuses.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                   
	Apropos the article London flight set to resume, July 18, I would like to point out that of late, Air Indias services have become abysmal. Flight schedule, cleanliness and work culture need to be improved. The aviation minister himself found his AI flight from New York to be dirty. If AI treats VIPs in this manner, what service can the common man expect?

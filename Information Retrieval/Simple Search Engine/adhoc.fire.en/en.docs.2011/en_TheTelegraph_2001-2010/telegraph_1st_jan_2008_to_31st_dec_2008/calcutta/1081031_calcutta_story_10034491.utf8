The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic service centre for each borough
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic service centre for each borough

	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will start 13 service centres to serve its 15 boroughs by the last week of December.        
	Residents can collect birth and death certificates and pay house tax, water tax, licence fee, drainage service charge and other fees at the centres.        
	Initially, only civic bills can be paid at the centres. We hope to offer railway reservation and utility bill payment facilities later, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.         
	The service centres will be housed in the offices of boroughs I, II, IV, V, VI, IX and XV. The other centres will be located at Kankurgachhi Market, Lake Market, Santoshpur Market, SN Roy Market, Bagha Jatin New Complex and KN Sen Road.         
	The service centres at Bagha Jatin New Complex will serve boroughs X and XI and the one at SN Roy Market, boroughs XIII and XIV.        
	Tata Consultancy Services has set up the computer network between the centres, enabling decentralised bill payment. For example, a trader from Behala will be able to deposit trade licence renewal fees at the Lake Market service centre. Similarly, for registering a birth, a resident will not necessarily have to approach his local borough office.         
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said Rs 100 crore was spent on setting up the network. The money was part of a Rs 220-crore capacity-building grant from the department for international development of the British government.        
	We have plans to open citizen service centres in the central business district, off EM Bypass and Burrabazar, said the municipal commissioner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nandaram traders to clear debris 
                                                                                                               Nandaram traders to clear debris

	The Nandaram Market Traders Association will clear the debris from the charred structure from Monday.        
	Dissatisfied with slow removal of trash from Nandaram market and adjoining Kashiram block, the traders body on Friday expressed the willingness to take up the work.        
	A high-level committee set up to decide the fate of the market, with representatives from the civic body, fire services, police and CESC, accepted the proposal and asked the traders to submit a scheme for the operation.        
	At a joint meeting in the civic body on Friday, the police, the fire services and CESC admitted the need to remove the debris quickly. With the demolition of the unsafe portion of Nandaram and Kashiram starting before the removal of the charred debris, the volume of trash has reached 400 tonnes. The trash must be removed to help a state-appointed five-member panel assess the buildings structural stability.        
	It will take about a week to remove the debris, said director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol.        
	According to chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar, the debris can be removed only at night because of parking problems and congestion in the area.        
	The traders also sought a nod to reconstruct Nandaram above the sixth floor and the Kashiram block. The committee did not decide on the matter.        
	We have asked them to submit a plan. The permission may be granted if the traders employ a government-approved labour contractor and carry out the work according to norms, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

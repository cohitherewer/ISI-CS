                      Unity in diversity                    The creative output of artists of modern Bengal, though copious, versatile and of immense calibre, has never quite gained the recognition it deserves owing to the fact that artists of the region have never been identified as an integrated group. The ongoing maiden art exhibition by Bengal Painters, a group of six artists, attempts to put this right. Coming together for the first time, the artists wish to give a distinctive individuality and character to the art of Bengal. Abhijit Bhattacharya explores relationships and themes of topical social relevance in his works. The paintings of B.V. Sikder present a blend of realism and surrealism. His faces, figures and forms are expressions of his quest for reality amidst lifes falsities. Dhiren Kumar Saha specialises in pencil drawings and landscapes. The two series of paintings on owl and horse by Prabir Das (a painting by him appears above) are a reflection of his passion, energy and enthusiasm. Sandip Bajpeyis digital creations bear testimony to his sophisticated creative insight. Swapan Pauls outstanding works of painting and sculpture are traditional in concept but contemporary in style and structure.                  Event: An exhibition of drawings, paintings and sculpture by Bengal Painters When: Till June 8; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

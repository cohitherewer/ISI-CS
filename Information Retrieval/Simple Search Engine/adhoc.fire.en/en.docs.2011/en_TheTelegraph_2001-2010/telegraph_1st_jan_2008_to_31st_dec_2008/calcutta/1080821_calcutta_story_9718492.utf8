                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU admission deadline to be extended
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Admission to degree courses in city colleges, supposed to be over by August, is likely to continue till the middle of next month.        
	Calcutta University is considering a proposal from college principals to extend the last date of admission to BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses by two weeks.        
	When the process started in June, the university asked its 100-odd affiliated colleges to complete admissions by August 23.        
	The principals have sought an extension of the admission deadline to admit students in the additional seats likely to be granted by the university.        
	The colleges have also requested the university to extend the last date of registration of first-year students from August 31 to September 15.        
	Suranjan Das, the CU vice-chancellor, said: We will examine the proposal to extend the dates once we receive a written petition from the colleges.        
	Noticing the demand for seats in some subjects, a number of colleges approached the university last month to increase their seats. CU officials visited the colleges to inspect whether they had the required infrastructure.        
	The inspections were held in two phases last month. The colleges are yet to get the official nod, said Gyanankur Goswami, the principal of Shyamaprasad College and the president of the West Bengal Principals Council, a CPM-controlled organisation of the principals of state-aided colleges.        
	University sources said the inspection reports are being examined and final clearance certificates will be sent to colleges soon.        
	Nearly 50 colleges, including Asutosh College, Deshbandhu College, Maharaja Srish Chandra College, Bhangor College, Gour Mohan Sashi Mohan College, Mahestala College and Shyamaprasad College have sought permission to increase seats in some subjects. For example, Shyamaprasad College wants the geography (honours) seats to be increased.        
	Students who are waiting for a berth in various honours courses after the increase in the number of seats said they would be inconvenienced if the last dates for admission and registration were not extended.        
	I have scored nearly 80 per cent in geography and 74 per cent in aggregate in Higher Secondary exams. But I was refused admission to the geography honours course in at least three colleges and had to take admission in the BA general course, said a student of a south Calcutta college. My college has promised to admit me in the geography honours course if the seats are increased. But I cant get a berth if the last dates of admission and registration are not extended, she added.

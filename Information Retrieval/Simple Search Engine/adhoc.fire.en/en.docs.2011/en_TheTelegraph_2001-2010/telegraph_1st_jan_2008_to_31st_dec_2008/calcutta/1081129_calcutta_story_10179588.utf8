          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A door at high court registrar-general Shyamal Chakrabartis office was damaged on Friday during a demonstration by members of an employees union affiliated to the CPM-backed West Bengal Co-ordination Committee.        
	Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar took serious exception to the incident, said a senior court official. Rallies and demonstrations are prohibited on the high court premises.         
	Police said the door was damaged when more than 100 union members tried to enter the registrar-generals chamber to protest the delay in implementing their pay commission.        
	L.C. Seal, the chief justices secretary, said: There was a demonstration in front of the registrar-generals chamber. I do not know more than that.        
	An employee in the registrar-generals office said the chief justice had called Shyamal Chakrabarti over to his chamber.        
	A few days back, members of the union had taken out a rally in the court corridors when a condolence meeting was going on in the chief justices court room to mourn the death of barrister Ajit Panja, said the senior officer.        
	The chief justice, who attended the meeting, reportedly came down heavily on the employees when they met him to hand over a memorandum. The union later wrote a regret letter to the chief justice and submitted an undertaking that the incident would not be repeated.

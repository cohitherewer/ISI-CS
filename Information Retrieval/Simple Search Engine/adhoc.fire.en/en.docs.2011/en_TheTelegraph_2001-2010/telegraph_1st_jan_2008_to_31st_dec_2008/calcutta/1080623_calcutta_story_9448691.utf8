                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Plane tyre gets punctured
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A plane with 39 passengers on board developed a flat tyre after landing at Calcutta airport on Sunday morning.         
	GMG Airlines Dhaka-Calcutta flight landed safely around 8am and was entering taxiway C when the left tyre got punctured. Excessive heat caused the tyre to deflate. The pilot stopped the aircraft immediately and there was no chance of a mishap, an airport official said. But the plane blocked the taxiway for nearly an hour and had to be towed away. It took off around 12.30pm, after a tyre was brought from Dhaka on a Bangladesh Biman flight.

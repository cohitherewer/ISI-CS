          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will share more power with the 15 boroughs.         
	The proposal for sharing of power, as suggested by a panel set up by the CMC in July to strengthen the functioning of the boroughs, will be placed before the mayoral council for ratification this month. From the fiscal 2010-11, the civic budget will have two parts central and borough, said an official.        
	According to the proposal, the functioning of most departments  including roads, solid waste management, sewage, water supply, health and parks and gardens  will be decentralised. Only the licence, building and assessment departments will function from the civic headquarters on SN Banerjee Road, the official said.        
	For any development project worth up to Rs 5 lakh, all boroughs can draw up a budget and start work independently.        
	Till now, only the five boroughs in the added areas  comprising Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur  have the freedom to work independently on development projects worth up to Rs 5 lakh. For the remaining 10 boroughs, all in the city proper, the limit is Rs 1 lakh.        
	The discrimination has been a source of resentment among borough chairpersons and councillors in the city proper.        
	Following a plea from the aggrieved chairpersons, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay had set up a committee under mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera, who is also a member of the CPMs Calcutta district committee, to suggest ways to strengthen the functioning of the boroughs. The committee has recommended elimination of the dual policy.        
	The decentralisation of power will provide more scope to the citizens to work for the betterment of their localities, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said.

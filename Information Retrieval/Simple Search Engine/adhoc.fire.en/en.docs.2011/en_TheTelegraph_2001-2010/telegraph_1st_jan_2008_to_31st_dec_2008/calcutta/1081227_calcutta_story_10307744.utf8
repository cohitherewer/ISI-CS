                      Castro in Calcutta                    Fidel Castro was the undisputed leader of Cuba from 1959 till 2008, when he stepped down after nearly 50 years in power. His revolutionary overthrow of dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 is widely regarded as one of the greatest Marxist victories of the modern era. During his brief transit visit to the city from Vietnam, President Castro addressed the citizens of Calcutta, recalling Indias glorious freedom struggle against British imperialist colonial rule and emphasising the citys long tradition of peoples movement against imperialism. His historic visit created a living bond between Cuba and India. To commemorate the 35th anniversary of this visit and to mark the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, Prabha Khaitan Foundation, in collaboration with Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre and Embassy of the Republic of Cuba in India, hosts Fidel in Kolkata, an exhibition of photographs by late Satya Sen. Featuring 35 blow-up black-and-white photographs, it covers his arrival to Calcutta airport and his reception in the city, his meeting with prominent Left leaders, leaders from the womens organisations, the then Soviet consulate representatives and government officials.

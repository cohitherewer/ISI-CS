  - SECOND 24-HR HELPLINE ON CARDS          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta police, in association with the NGO Dignity Foundation, will soon launch a project to provide security to the aged.        
	The project, to be started on June 29, will run on trial in areas under the jurisdiction of Lake police station. Thereafter, the rest of the city will be brought under its ambit.        
	Instances of abuse against elderly people are on the rise. Those living alone are the easy targets of criminals. We hope to provide security to them so they could live with dignity, said Preeti Roy, the director of Dignity Foundation.        
	A 24-hour helpline for senior citizens has been in operation at Lalbazar for some time. As part of the project, another 24-hour helpline (24187937) will be launched.        
	The new line will be manned by Dignity Foundation members from 10am to 5pm and by the police for the rest of the day.        
	There is an ambulance at Lalbazar which senior citizens can ask for during an emergency, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	During the two-month trial run, two officers from Lake police station and volunteers from Dignity Foundation will visit the elderly people at regular intervals and make a note of their problems.        
	The project will also create a database on senior citizens, registration for which will start at 11am on June 29 at Madhusudan Mancha. The registration forms will later be available from Lake police station and the Dignity Foundation office in Dhakuria.        
	The NGO has a database on people associated with it but we are trying to create an extensive database covering the entire city, said Subarno.        
	The police will look after security, while we will look after social issues such as counselling and companionship, said Roy.

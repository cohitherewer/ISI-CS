The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pond notice in court
                                                                                                            Pond notice in court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Mani Group, a private real estate firm, has moved the high court challenging the legality of a notice issued by the state inland fisheries department on a contentious piece of land.        
	The department, in its notice issued on January 8, had asked the company to clarify by January 16 why it had filled up a water body at 32 Canal Circular Road to build a housing estate.        
	The company had earlier claimed that the plot was land, not a pond, as alleged by the residents of an adjoining housing estate. On January 5, the residents had alleged that the companys men had fired in the air and unleashed dogs on them when they tried to resist an attempt at landfill.        
	In the petition, likely to be heard in a couple of days, the company has argued that the fisheries department has no authority to issue the notice because the plot in question is not a wetland, said a source in the high court.        
	The company mentioned in the petition that the court had asked the civic commissioner to determine the character of the plot. Since the commissioner has started the process, the notice issued by the inland fisheries department is not in accordance with law, the source added.        
	Mani Group also argued that the notification was illegal on another count  it had reached its office after January 16, the deadline for submitting the clarification.        
	Alok Ghosh, the civic bodys lawyer, said his client had primarily stated that the plot is a water body. But the company is claiming that since it owns the plot, it does not require any permission from the civic body to construct a wall around it.

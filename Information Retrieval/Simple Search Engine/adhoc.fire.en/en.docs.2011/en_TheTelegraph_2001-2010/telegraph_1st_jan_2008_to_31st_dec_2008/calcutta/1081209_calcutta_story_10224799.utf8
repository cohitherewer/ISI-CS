                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Identity crisis in SIM arrest, card count up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The identity of Mukhtar Ahmed, arrested on Friday in connection with the Mumbai blasts, remains wrapped in mystery but police on Monday revealed that a second SIM card found on a slain terrorist had been traced to the Calcutta cartel.        
	If the first SIM card had been issued in the name of the late uncle of Tausif Rehman, also arrested for procuring the SIM cards from Calcutta, the second one sourced by Mukhtar had been issued in the name of the late Ashraf Numan.        
	In its efforts to establish the identity of Mukhtar, who is claiming to be a constable of the Jammu and Kashmir police, Calcutta police on Monday wrote to director-general Kuldeep Khoda, asking him to confirm the identity of the 37-year-old. A picture of Mukhtar has been sent along with the letter.        
	According to the Special Task Force (STF) of the Calcutta police, which is probing the case, Mukhtar bought 32 cards from the city, at least two of which found their way to the terrorists in Mumbai.        
	The officials of STF first arrested Tausif on Friday near Howrah railway station on charges of procuring SIM cards by submitting his late uncles voter identity card and handing them over to Mukhtar. After grilling him, a team of officers arrested Mukhtar from Delhi.        
	Now that the letter has been sent, we are awaiting a response from the Jammu and Kashmir police, said STF chief Rajeev Kumar.        
	Despite reports about Mukhtars claims of being a Jammu and Kashmir police constable, no one from the police of that state has contacted us, he added.        
	According to STF sources, an inquiry was conducted to find out whether Mukhtar was an agent in the counter insurgency wing of the Jammu and Kashmir police, but it drew a blank.        
	We have enough evidence to nail Mukhtar for procuring the SIM cards illegally. We have not labelled him a terrorist but have charged and arrested him only for the cards, said an STF official.        
	Kumar said that Mukhtar was poised to pick up another 50 SIM cards from the city. For this, he had done a deal with Tausif and asked him to keep the cards ready. He was scheduled to visit the city soon to collect them, Kumar said.        
	STF officials said that it is hard to believe that if Mukhtar was a constable of the Jammu and Kashmir police, he would have spent seven years in Calcutta.        
	He left the city when he was 35 years old and that is a rather late age for anyone to land a police constables job, said an official.        
	In any case, even if he had got a constables job then his bio-data would have been sent to us for verification as he had spent so many years in this city, he reasoned.         
	Another officer of the STF said that even after reports were flashed that some of the SIM cards found on the Mumbai terrorists had been traced to Calcutta, Mukhtar never made any attempt to contact his superiors in the police for protection.        
	He must have been aware that the trail could lead to him. So why didnt he come clean? demanded an STF source.

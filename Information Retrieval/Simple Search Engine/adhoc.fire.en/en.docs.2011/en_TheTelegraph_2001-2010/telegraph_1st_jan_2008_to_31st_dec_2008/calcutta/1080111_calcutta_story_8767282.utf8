 - Alternative routes to evade traffic trauma
     A STAFF REPORTER
                  
	Ask any senior Lalbazar officer about the traffic trauma awaiting Park Circus during the 12-day Book Fair from January 29 and he will assure you that things are under control. But that is the official line.
    
	Off the record, every cop worth his uniform is dreading the inevitable car chaos around the Park Circus Maidan, where the Book Fair will be held.
    
	If you do not want to be stuck in a traffic jam at the Park Circus seven-point crossing those 12 days, we would request you to avoid the route altogether, especially during peak traffic hours, said a senior traffic cop.
    
	Metro offers a few alternatives for those wanting to follow the advice of the friendly policeman and avoid the Park Circus roundabout during the Book Fair. Is it feasible? Your guess is as bad as ours...
    
	If you are heading into town via EM Bypass: For north or central Calcutta, says an officer of Sealdah Traffic Guard, it would be prudent to drive down Beleghata Main Road, Maniktala Main Road or even Narkeldanga Main Road. For south Calcutta, opt for the Gariahat connector. As a middle path, take Congress Exhibition Road, off the Bridge No. 4 flyover.
    
	If you are at Ballygunge Phari, heading into the heart of the city: The best escape route would be Hazra Road-Sarat Bose Road/Ballygunge Circular Road-AJC Bose Road.
    
	If you are on CIT Road: It is best avoided, but in case you cant, take the help of the nearest traffic cop to avoid Book Fair parking and pedestrian crush.
    
	If you are headed south off the AJC Bose Road flyover: Turn right and head straight towards Ballygunge Phari. If below the flyover, dont turn left from the Mullickbazar-Park Street crossing or drive adjacent to the flyover ramp. Cut through Beckbagan or Ballygunge Circular Road.
    
	Statutory warning: Most motorists will try to avoid Park Circus Maidan, so every alternative crossroad in the vicinity will be clogged.

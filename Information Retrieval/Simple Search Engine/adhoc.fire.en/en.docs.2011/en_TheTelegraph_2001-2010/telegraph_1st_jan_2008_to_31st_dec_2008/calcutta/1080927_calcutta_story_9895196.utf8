                      Where music-masti go hand in hand                    When women are depressed, what do they do? Why, they eat or go shopping. Cynics interpret shopaholics as a breed who spend money they havent earned, to buy things they dont want, to impress people they dont like. We shall not go into long-drawn debates, but rather take a sneak peek into a world of goodies through the magic door that has been left ajar for all Calcuttans who want to shop till they drop for the festive season. The ongoing pre-Puja shopping festival at Salt Lakes swanky shopping mall, City Centre, is already a big hit with more than 70 shopkeepers participating in the mega-event. The camaraderie is palpable as young, beaming shop attendants try to please the harried customer, who, on the other hand, tries to find out the most bang for the buck. Unfortunately, with the economy the way it is today, customers have to walk a tightrope and save as much as they can. For them, there are discounts and free gifts galore. The mood is upbeat with cultural programmes lined-up daily to entertain visitors and help beat the monotony of the shop attendants. This evenings programme features a kinetic performance of Tanmoy Boses (picture here) Taaltantra. Boses nimble fingers glide from drumming the tabla to a plethora of instruments from all over the globe to catch the spirit of rhythm and harmony. Also, interactive game shows, including quiz competition, Antakshari, fashion shows, etc., are held in the evenings where one can participate and win exciting prizes. So, all shopaholics, gear up! Heres the chance to hone your skill and confess proudly, I dont shop because I need something, I just shop for shoppings sake. Organised by City Centre in association with t2.

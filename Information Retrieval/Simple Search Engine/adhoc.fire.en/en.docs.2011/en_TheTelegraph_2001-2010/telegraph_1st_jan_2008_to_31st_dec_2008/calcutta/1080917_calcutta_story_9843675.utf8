          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Class VIII student of Belur High School was injured in the forehead after a teacher banged his head against the wall on Monday for spitting during the morning prayer.         
	When Bubai Das started bleeding, the school authorities took him to a nearby health centre. The 13-year-old was brought to the school, not allowed to go home and forced to sit in the waiting room for five hours.         
	Jiban Das, Bubais father, lodged a complaint against the teacher, Aghor Chandra Saha, with Bally police station on Tuesday morning. But till late on Tuesday, the police had not taken any action.         
	Bubai, who lives on Padmababu Road in Bally, said: Aghor sir called me after prayer and slapped me for spitting. I had spat during prayers as my throat was itching. When I explained it to him, he banged my head against the wall. I started bleeding.         
	They took me to a primary health centre, where I received two stitches on my forehead. I wanted to return home, but they made me wait till 5pm, the boy said.        
	Bubai said he took a bus in the evening to reach home. While walking through the Bally market, he felt sick as his head was reeling. Some of his friends saw him struggling to walk home and informed his father.         
	Tania Das, Bubais mother, said: Bubai generally returns from school at 5pm. When he did not turn up at the usual time, I rang up the school. The man who received my call asked my sons name, class and roll number. When I gave him the details, he suddenly disconnected the call.         
	After lodging the complaint, Jiban went to the school, along with some neighbours, to seek an explanation. He alleged that they were not allowed to meet the accused teacher.         
	Later, head teacher Tapas Chattopadhyay met them. He said: I was busy as school examinations were on. Though I was aware of the incident, I did not have the time to find out the details. The managing committee of the school will look into the matter.

                              Radhadamodar Jiu dressed as Ganesha for Poila Baisakh at Chorbagan Silbari                            
	Poila Baisakh may only mean a holiday to most and a haal khata to many, but there will be a whole lot more happening under century-old arched portals around town on Monday.        
	At Marble Palace, Rajendro Mullicks family seat, the day begins with family members wearing new clothes and worshipping household deities Gopichandballav and Radhakanta Deb.        
	The custom of chakradarshan (a privileged close-up view of the circular mark on a Narayanshila, a pebble with special characteristics worshipped as Lord Vishnu) starts the day before, says family elder Hirendro Mullick. All members of the family gather with offerings of a mango, a sacred thread, a betel nut, a fragrant white flower and a coin. Even married daughters must also join in.        
	A jhara (sprinkler) each is placed atop Lord Mahadev, Sridharshila, Narayanshila and the holy basil tree. From Poila Baisakh, scented water drips down, bathing the deities all afternoon for a month. Fruits are then offered as bhog and prasad is partaken of.        
	As per the directive of Rajendro Mullick, fruits are distributed all through Baisakh among employees of the estate and the trust, numbering 100. Our women are busy supervising the phol bhog every day from 3.30pm to 5pm, he says. Goddess Chandi is worshipped for three days, from Saptami to Navami.        
	The thakurbari of the Sils in Chorbagan at 42 Muktarambabu Street, reverberates with music from early in the morning. The songs we sing are either from those written for the occasion by our ancestors or select devotional songs of Rajanikanta, Rabindranath or Atul Prasad. Our chakradarshan starts from Chaitra Sankranti, on the Bengali new years eve, and continues daily through Baisakh, says Ashok Sil. Only dikshito (initiated into the religious order) and married women are entitled to this rite, with five types of fruits, a sacred thread and a betel nut. For this, even married daughters of the house come back at least once in the month.        
	After the puja, the jhara is placed above the lord at noon. Baikali is an evening ritual in which seasonal fruits are offered. Mango is a must, smiles Sil. Radhadamodar Jiu, the Narayanshila, is then dressed up as Ganesha.                    S.B.

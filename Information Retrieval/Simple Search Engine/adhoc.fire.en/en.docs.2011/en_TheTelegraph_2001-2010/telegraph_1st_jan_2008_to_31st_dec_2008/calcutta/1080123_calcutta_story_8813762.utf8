     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta University is working to reconstitute its sexual harassment complaint cell for students, teachers and employees.
    
	The cell had stopped functioning last October after dissolution of the universitys two policy-making bodies  the senate and the syndicate. 
    
	The new senate and syndicate have been set up. The new cell for monitoring sexual harassment complaints will be constituted soon, said Ishita Mukherjee, a teacher in the universitys economics department and the convener of the previous cell.
    
	Metro had highlighted on Tuesday how the university authorities had sat on a complaint of sexual harassment by a student of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences against a teacher.
    
	The student had lodged the complaint in the first week of December. The university authorities ordered an inquiry last week, after several teachers of the college met the vice-chancellor and demanded action against the accused.
    
	A Supreme Court order makes it mandatory for universities to act immediately on a complaint of sexual harassment. The University Grants Commission, too, had issued a directive for keeping the sexual harassment cell open throughout the year.

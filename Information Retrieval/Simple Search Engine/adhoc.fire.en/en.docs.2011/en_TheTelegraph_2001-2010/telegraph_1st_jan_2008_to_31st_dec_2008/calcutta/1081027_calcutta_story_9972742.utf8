The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crores lost to illegal power syndicate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crores lost to illegal power syndicate
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Power is drawn illegally from electricity poles, such as this one, in Metiabruz. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Name: Chunna        
	Profession: Illegal power distribution        
	Office: A 4 ft x 2 ft room with a meter box and a clump of wires connected to it        
	Customers: Sixty households              
	Power comes cheap in Metiabruz. No meter readings, no worrying about inflated bills. For just Rs 100-120 a month, families get a 24/7 connection with the licence to consume as many units as they require.        
	Both Chunna and his customers have nothing to lose and everything to gain from this arrangement.         
	The only loser is the CESC  executive director Santanu Chatterjee estimated the annual loss at Rs 80 crore. Another official said around 250 million units  each costing Rs 3  are stolen every year.        
	Speaking about the modus operandi, Chunna, 19, told Metro: We collect the subscriptions at the end of each month. A register is maintained to keep track of transactions. Our boss has links with a political party.        
	Chunna was unemployed till his well-connected boss decided to start the business of illegal power distribution and made around 15 local youths his partners.        
	The youths now take turns in collecting fees and guarding the hub of the illegal power distribution network. If they get a whiff of a raid, the wires attached to the CESCs feeder boxes are promptly disconnected.        
	We get to know in advance if CESC officials intend to raid the area, Chunna said.        
	Apart from Metiabruz, the racket is active in Rajabazar, Beleghata, large parts of the port area and some pockets in Howrah.        
	Last year, 70 per cent of the units consumed in these areas were stolen from the CESC network. We had filed several police complaints but no action has been taken, said a senior official of the power utility.        
	Metro visited the port area and spoke to some youths who supply illegal power to 60 households in a slum in Babubazar. The 15-member group is led by a criminal, who grabs bulk of the money and distributes the rest among the others.        
	Officials said power theft was becoming difficult to detect as the culprits were adopting innovative techniques. The wires are well-concealed. The racketeers have started stealing power from our underground cables, too, said CESC executive director Chatterjee.        
	The police accompany us during raids but there have been occasions when we have had to retreat in the face of aggressive resistance from residents. We are planning to intensify raids, the official added.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (port), Anand Kumar, said several power thieves had been arrested but many more were active.

           Probing alleys of the urban mind
          Fascinating parallels have often been drawn between physical, psychological and social conditions of contemporary urban society and the works of artists who represent reality in a transparent manner. The works of Sudhir Patwardhan are examples of this constant dialogue between art and society. His paintings allow viewers a panoramic view with multiple perspectives. They explore with finesse the urban milieu of rapid transformation, alienation, dislocation and anonymity in a typical modern metropolis. Citing the City, the ongoing show of his recent works, reflects the artistic inquiries he has conducted for decades. His paintings and drawings of urban landscapes are snapshots of events in the life of its dwellers. A painting like Death on the Street (picture right) presents within a single frame a tense moment. A man lies fallen on the footpath and a crowd has gathered around him to offer help or view the scene detachedly. Patwardhan understands deeply the collective psyche of the city and its dwellers. The works are done mostly in acrylic and charcoal on paper.
         lEvent: An exhibition of paintings and drawings by Sudhir Patwardhan lWhen: Till January 25; 11 am - 7 pm lWhere: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

          A STAFF REPORTER                                              The bus that ran over a pedestrian in north Calcutta. Picture by   Pradip Sanyal          
	A pedestrian and a cyclist were run over by two private buses on the same route in central Calcutta on Friday.         
	Manu Shaw was crushed under the wheels of a bus on route 3C/1 (WBR 3578) at the intersection of Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road around 3pm.        
	The 67-year-old, who ran an electrical goods shop on Vivekananda Road, was returning home to Madan Mitra Lane for lunch when the mishap occurred.        
	Shaw was trying to cross Vivekananda Road without realising that the signal had turned green for vehicles. The bus travelling down Bidhan Sarani knocked him down while taking a right turn to enter Vivekananda Road. He was crushed under the wheels, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.        
	Residents and pedestrians immediately blocked the crossing to protest rash driving and tried to damage the bus.        
	A large police contingent reached the spot and erected barricades at the crossing. The protesters were persuaded to lift the blockade around 3.30pm after they had handed over the driver and the two conductors to the police. A case of rash driving was slapped on the driver and the bus was towed to Amherst Street police station.        
	It was a terrible sight. We were waiting to board a bus when we saw an elderly man being knocked down by the 3C/1 bus. The next moment we saw him lying on the road, his head smashed, said Rinki Jaiswal, a student of Class XII.        
	In the other mishap, 50-year-old J. Roy was knocked down while he was cycling down AJC Bose Road, near Moulali, around 6.45am.        
	Roy, a resident of Entallys Sambhu Babu Lane, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he died two hours later. He had suffered a haemorrhage, said an officer of Muchipara police station.        
	The police said the bus (WB25Z 2155) was impounded but the driver fled. The driver had spotted the cyclist but did not bother to slam the brakes, said an officer of Muchipara police station.        
	He was trying to flee with the vehicle but had to stop after some residents blocked his way. Two youths caught hold of him but he managed to run away in the melee, the officer added.

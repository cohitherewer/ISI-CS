  - Silver lining in cloud cover      
	The wet Mahalaya weekend has cast a cloud over the Puja preparations of organisers, idol-makers and shoppers              
	Organisers                  
	The pandal at Suruchi Sangha (picture right by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), New Alipore, is mostly being made of bamboo poles. We are using green bamboo poles that need to be dried in the sun for the right shade. The rain has slowed down work, said Swarup Biswas, of Suruchi Sangha.        
	Beadon Street Sarbojanin, too, is having a tough time. The pandal is being made of plywood, which is peeling off in the rain, rued Goutam Ghose, the president of the organising committee.        
	Painting has been stopped because of the shower, said Dipankar Mukherjee, of Adi Ballygunge Sarbojanin Durgotsab Samity.        
	Bikash Majumdar, of the College Square puja, said: Work outside the pandal has been held up. The lights are yet to be put up.              
	Idol-makers        
	Kumartuli artisans are racing against time to ensure that the idols are ready well before Shasthi. The rain has melted the clay covering of the idols. We are having to redo things, said Nemai Chandra Pal, the president of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskrity Samity.        
	We are trying our best but it might be difficult to deliver the idols on time, said Babu Pal, the joint secretary of the Samity. We hope customers will understand our problems and cooperate with us.              
	Shoppers        
	I had to cancel shopping plans thrice in the past week because of the        
	weather, said Piyali Chatterjee at New Market.         
	I have not been able to go out shopping this weekend. If it rains next week as well, it will certainly be a blow to the festive spirit, said Subrata Dutta, 51, a doctor.              
	There was a silver lining for the rain-hit city on Puja-eve  the Met office said on Sunday that the skies were likely to clear from Monday as the low pressure was weakening and moving northeast.

                      Faces and expressions                    Renaissance Europe first discovered the face as an index of its owners humanity and as a physical projection of his unique nature and being. Thus was born the art of the portrait. Over centuries, new conceptions were brought to bear on the artistic representation of the face, until Picasso broke up its contours, spelling out the myriad planes, angles and fractures that constitute it. Prabir Sen seems to have looked at faces done by past masters and imbibed something from each of them. His faces are worked down to their constituent planes and lines: they resolve into elements that seem to hold dialogue among themselves. A Different Face, the ongoing exhibition of his drawings, features works that help the viewer understand the human face through its formal attributes. These attributes are a window to its personality and also to the abstracted world of forms and lines. The two infuse and complement each other. Each face in this collection thus houses a universe of its own.                  Event: An exhibition of drawings by Prabir Sen When: Till August 26; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

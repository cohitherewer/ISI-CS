          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hundreds of motorcycles lying unattended on the road were seized from different parts of the city following the terror alert last week.        
	Officers from the police stations seized the motorcycles as they were lying abandoned. We are not taking any chances in the wake of the red alert, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	Last week, Delhi issued a warning that six to 10 Indian Mujahideen activists were set to enter Calcutta from Bangladesh and regroup before carrying out terror attacks in the city between November 15 and 30.        
	We have seen how the terrorists have used motorcycles and bicycles to conduct blasts in Delhi and Ahmedabad. Officers of all 48 police stations have been asked to seize motorcycles lying unattended for hours or without papers, added the officer.        
	The civic police volunteers have been instructed to inform the police if they notice any abandoned vehicle in a crowded area.        
	Plainclothesmen have been deployed outside markets and cinema halls round-the-clock. We have seized several motorcycles near New Market over the past couple of days. The bikes were lying abandoned and some of the owners did not have papers, said an officer of New Market police station.         
	Officers of Watgunge police station impounded over 100 motorcycles near Five Star Market and Fancy Market over the past week.         
	We have stepped up vigil in and around the markets and intensified patrolling. Most of the impounded bikes were without papers, said T. Bhutia, the additional officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station.

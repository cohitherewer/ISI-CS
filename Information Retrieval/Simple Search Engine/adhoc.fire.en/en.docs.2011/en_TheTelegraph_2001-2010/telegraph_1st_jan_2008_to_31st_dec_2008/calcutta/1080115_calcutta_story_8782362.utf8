             GRAB AND GO: Burrabazar traders flee the area around Nandaram Market with their wares on Monday, refusing to take chances. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta
                 
	The first day at work since the Nandaram fire saw the traders of all adjacent market buildings clearing out with their wares in panic.
    
	Business is the last thing on our minds now, Bishwambhar Pal, who runs a shop in Tamapatti, said on Monday, staring at the Nandaram blaze that started late on Friday.
    
	The fire can spread to Tamapatti or Nandaram can collapse any moment. Who will take a chance? asked Pal, who feels it will take at least a fortnight for the situation to return to normal and trade to limp back.
    
	The 70-year-old and his two sons spent the day removing cotton and plastic ropes and fishing nets from their shop to a godown nearby.
    
	Inside the three-storeyed building at 62B NS Road, labourers hired by the owners of the 150-odd shops were screaming for space in the narrow corridors as they were carrying goods packed in gunny bags on their head.
    
	Most of the items stored in this market  cotton, plastic and cosmetics  are inflammable. A small spark from Nandaram is enough to set Tamapatti on fire. So, weve decided to clear out, said Panchanan Bhattar, a member of the Burrabazar Tamapatti Merchants Association. 
    
	Tamapatti trades in goods worth Rs 15-20 lakh daily. A few days closure means a loss of crores. We are ready to suffer the loss, but not the sight of our source of livelihood going up in flames, said a trader.
    
	The mood is the same in Sutapatti, Rani Kothi Market and Khangrapatti.
    
	We are just behind Nandaram and hence, have to clear out, said Sushil Agarwal, who owns a cloth shop on the ground floor of Rani Kothi. Since Monday morning, almost all the 100-odd shop-owners of Rani Kothi have taken out their wares.
    
	We have been running the business for generations, but this is the first time we are witnessing such a huge fire, said Subhas Agarwal, who runs a garments shop in Rani Kothi.
    
	The average daily sale in Rani Kothi is around Rs 7 lakh, said a trader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kitchens hit by LPG crisis
                                                                                                               Kitchens hit by LPG crisis
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Sudipta Chatterjee of Birati, on the northern fringes of the city, has never faced a crisis like this in her kitchen.        
	A mother of two, the 37-year-old homemaker has been pleading with the local LPG distributor for a refill.        
	He is telling me that he cant help as there is an acute shortage of LPG cylinders, said Sudipta, who has bought a kerosene stove to tide over the crisis.        
	She is not alone as the shortage of cylinders has hit kitchens across the city.        
	Oil companies admitted the drop in supply of LPG cylinders, which can be linked to problems in bottling plants and impediments in offloading imported LPG at Haldia port.        
	According to an industry insider, bulk import of LPG by the Haldia unit of Indian Oil Petronas was hit after huge containers struggled to offload due to draft problems. The imported LPG had to be offloaded into smaller ships from the containers and brought to the port, causing delay.        
	One of our bottling plants in Durgapur, which can produce nearly 100 trucks of cylinders per day, is facing problems owing to unrest by those handling the cylinders. We are trying to meet the gap by ferrying in cylinders from Bokaro and Balasore, said an Indian Oil Corporation official.         
	This year, the winter lingered well beyond the season and as a result the demand shot up unexpectedly, said Siddhartha Banerjee, the head of LPG distribution for the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited in this region.        
	Besides the technical reasons, the shortage for the home segment can be attributed to diversion of subsidised domestic LPG (Rs 300 per 14.2 kg cylinder) to commercial usage, for which a 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs 1,030.         
	LPG dealers, struggling to meet the demand from consumers, allege that most of the firms are not making sincere efforts to defuse the crisis.         
	The demand for LPG cylinders rose by nearly 15-20 per cent this winter. We had requested the companies to gear up for a spurt in demand in the domestic segment, said a distributor. But the companies stuck to their usual quota of production, which resulted in the shortfall.        
	The plight of the common people has reached the petroleum ministry, which has decided to import an extra 52,000 metric tonnes of cooking gas. Besides, the oil firms have been asked to step up the operation of LPG bottling plants and also to function during holidays. The state governments have been alerted to take measures to curb diversion of domestic LPG stocks.        
	These steps will have some positive effect. But it will take at least two to three weeks for the situation to normalise, said an industry expert.

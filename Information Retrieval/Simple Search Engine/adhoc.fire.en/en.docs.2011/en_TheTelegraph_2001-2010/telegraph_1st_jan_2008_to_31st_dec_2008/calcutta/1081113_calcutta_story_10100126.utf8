                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       College results next week 
  - Two deadlines missed          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Students and parents check Part II results at a south Calcutta college. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Calcutta University will announce the BA and B.Sc Part I and Part II (honours and general course, under 1+1+1 pattern) results next week, after failing to meet two deadlines. Nearly 1.7 lakh students appeared for the examinations.        
	The authorities had initially planned to announce the results before the colleges closed for the Puja holiday. The target date was revised to after Kali puja.        
	The process of preparing the results is almost complete. The results will be declared next week. We will announce the date after taking care of some formalities, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).        
	According to university rules, results of undergraduate examinations have to be declared within 90 days of the last test.        
	The last written test of BA and B.Sc Part I and Part II was held on July 30. The practical examinations ended in the first week of September.        
	The Part III examinations will be held in April. When will we prepare for it? said a student of a south Calcutta college, who appeared for Part II this year.         
	Teachers assigned to check answer scripts did not send marks in time forcing the university to miss the deadlines, said sources.         
	An official of the examination department attributed the delay to complications arising out of changes in the system.        
	For example, a BA Part I examinee who fails in a maximum of three subjects, including the two elective papers, can now sit for both Part I and Part II the following year.        
	A team from the state committee of the SFI, the CPMs students wing, had met Chatterjee on Tuesday and demanded that the results be declared immediately.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       B-brains script Plan B for jobs
  - Joka students look at life beyond foreign finance firms          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AND SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                                  
	Plan A has gone haywire. But like all good managers, students at IIM Calcutta are busy getting a Plan B ready for the next placement season.        
	Lehman Brothers, which has filed for bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch, whose ownership has changed hands, were until last year the fat cats every IIM student wanted to impress during the placement rounds. But neither is expected to play Santa Claus on the Joka campus during the next placement season.        
	There is no doubt that the lucrative offers from international investment banks will be in short supply. But its not the end of the world. Most students will be targeting placements with Slot Zero consulting firms and domestic investment banks this year, said Debtosh Mishra, a final-year student at Joka.        
	Slot Zero is the top rung in the placement roster, reserved for the best B-brains and the companies with the most lucrative offers.        
	Most students set to graduate in the summer of 2009 could grab the first good offer that comes their way instead of waiting for the kind of deals that were up for grabs in previous years. All the Rs 1 crore-plus offers during last years final placements were from foreign investment banks.        
	But it is not only about salaries. The health of a company and the business environment, too, determine our choice of companies, said a second-year student.        
	Saibal Chattopadhyay, the dean of programme initiatives at IIM Calcutta, echoed him. Students will definitely be more careful while considering jobs with investment banks unless stability returns by then, he said.        
	According to Chattopadhyay, students who would otherwise have liked to work only for finance companies might now settle for traditional management roles.In the last round of recruitment, around 34 per cent opted for jobs in the finance sector, 26 per cent accepted offers from consulting firms and the remaining 40 per cent were placed in marketing, human resource and IT companies.        
	The turmoil in the world of finance could benefit marketing companies and domestic banks. Given the aspirations of IIM students, it had become very difficult for us over the past few years to recruit them. We hope it will be easier this time, said Sanjay Santhanam of Canara Robeco Mutual Fund.

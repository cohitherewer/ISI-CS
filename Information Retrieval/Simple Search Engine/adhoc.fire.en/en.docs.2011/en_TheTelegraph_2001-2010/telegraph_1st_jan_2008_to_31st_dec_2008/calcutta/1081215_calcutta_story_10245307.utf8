The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cell snatchers on the prowl 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cell snatchers on the prowl

	Tulsi Mehta (name changed) was sending an SMS sitting in a taxi at the Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing on Wednesday. A youth reached through the window, grabbed her multimedia phone and ran away. The 25-year-old ran after him but he jumped over a broken wall and disappeared in the direction of the Park Street cemetery.         
	Cellphone-snatching cases are on the rise in Calcutta and the perpetrators have new tricks up their sleeve.        
	The targets are no longer limited to pedestrians. Police have recorded several complaints from people whose cellphones were taken away while they were using them in taxis or cars that had stopped at traffic signals.        
	According to the cops, the modus operandi of the snatchers has changed over the past few months. They used to move around on foot but have lately started using motorcycles to make a faster getaway. In some cases, the snatcher grabbed the phone and immediately handed it over to an accomplice on a two-wheeler, who disappeared with it.         
	On October 10, there were three cases of cellphone snatching. One of the victims, Sahadeb Das, a resident of Cossipore Road, was fiddling with three cellphones on Aurobindo Sarani. The criminals came from behind and took away all three, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	Gariahat, Lake Gardens, Entally, Beniapukur and Karaya are some of the areas where cellphones have been snatched. In November, cellphone snatchings were reported in Phoolbagan, Shyampukur and Topsia. In September, cellphones were stolen from Amherst Street, Karaya, New Market, Park Street, Hastings, Topsia and Muchipara police station areas.        
	Most of the snatchers are drug addicts in their late-20s and early-30s, hailing from Ekbalpore, Watgunge, Garden Reach, Sonarpur and Ghutiari Sheriff, said officers investigating the cases. Some of the sets are sold in Bihar and Nepal.        
	A couple of weeks back, a cellphone was snatched near the Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing. Then too, the snatcher had fled in the direction of the cemetery, which has become a den of drug addicts, said a security guard.        
	Seikh Anish from Ibrahim Road in Ekbalpore, Mohammed Khaled from Aga Mehendi Street off Park Street and Anwar Hussain from Fenik Bazar Street in the New Market area, held on the charge of cellphone theft, have told the police that stolen sets did not fetch a high price unless they were new or sophisticated. The snatchers sell the sets to receivers who in turn sell them outside the state.        
	There is a problem in tracing a cellphone if it goes outside the state. There appears to be a huge market for stolen cellphone sets in Bihar, Jharkhand and Nepal, said an officer.

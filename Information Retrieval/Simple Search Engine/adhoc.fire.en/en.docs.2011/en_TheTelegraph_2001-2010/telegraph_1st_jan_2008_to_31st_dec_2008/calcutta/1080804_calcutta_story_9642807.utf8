          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	About 150 residents of Ramlalbazar in Kasba scuffled with 60 policemen on Sunday morning to prevent a liquor shop from re-opening in the locality. The shop was opened with the help of police.        
	Apurba Kumar Das opened the shop in 2006 after obtaining a licence but residents forced him to down shutters soon after. He moved court, which ruled in his favour.         
	Trouble started around 11am on Sunday after Das opened his shop after two years, said an officer of Kasba police station. Residents first had an altercation with customers and then demanded that the shop be closed.        
	Residents said they did not want a liquor shop in a residential area with a temple and a school.        
	Das tried to open the shop on Friday as well. We asked him not to do so. When he again opened the shop today, we had to protest, said Swapan Maity, a resident.        
	Officers of Kasba police station arrived at the spot as the situation was threatening to spin out of control. Residents resisted the policemens attempts to drive them away.        
	There is a court order allowing Apurba Kumar Das to open his shop. We sent a team to Ramlalbazar to ensure he was able to do so, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Policemen were outside the shop till evening, when Das closed it for the day.

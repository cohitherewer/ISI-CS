          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 42-year-old man was killed after he got trapped between two speeding trucks at the VIP Road-Jessore Road intersection on Poila Baisakh.        
	An 11-year-old boy and a woman in her late 30s were injured in separate accidents during the day.        
	The mishap at the VIP Road-Jessore Road crossing occurred around 10.10am. Rabindranath Mullick, a car mechanic, was cycling across the busy intersection when he was crushed between the two trucks, said an officer of Dum Dum police station.        
	Both the trucks were racing down Jessore Road towards Barasat.        
	Apparently, neither of the truck drivers saw the victim stranded in the middle of the road. Both were negotiating the traffic rush and trying to overtake vehicles when Mullick got caught between them, said the officer. The drivers fled leaving behind their vehicles.        
	Witnesses said policemen posted at the crossing rushed to the victims aid. Mullick, unconscious and bleeding, was taken to a nursing home where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	The accident resulted in snarls on both roads.        
	In another mishap, a bus on route L238 knocked down and injured 11-year-old Binoy Hela at the crossing of Nandanbagan Street and APC Roy Road.        
	Local residents stopped the bus and smashed the windscreen, said an officer of Burtola police station. The vehicle was impounded though the driver and the conductor fled.        
	Binoy has been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	In the third mishap, a private bus on route 59 rammed into the concrete railing of Bankim Setu, in Howrah. A part of the bus was hanging out from the bridge overlooking a slum.        
	As the 30-odd passengers hurriedly got off, the driver and conductors fled. The district administration later arranged for a crane, which pulled back the bus. Rekha Mandal, 38, was admitted to the Howrah district hospital with an injured arm.

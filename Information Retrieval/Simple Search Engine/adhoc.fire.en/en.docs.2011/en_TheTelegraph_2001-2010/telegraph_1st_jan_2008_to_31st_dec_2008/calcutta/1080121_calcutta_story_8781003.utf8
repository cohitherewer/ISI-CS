           Poking gentle fun at foibles
          We all have faults and customary ways of looking at things which are perhaps neither very indicative of reality nor nearly as important as we think they are. Francis Beaumonts The Knight of the Burning Pestle is exactly 400 years old, yet it is actually very young in spirit, and very relevant today. Theatrecian and Coffee Pai Melange celebrate this event with a presentation of this play. Beaumont, who was Shakespeares contemporary, wrote for the same company in London, the Kings Men. He put this comedy together to poke fun at the popular culture of his time. While retaining the same text, this production contemporises it to refer to virtually identical devices nowadays in the worlds of popular music, television and cinema, whether English or Indian. Set to live pop music (no lip syncs) this musical farce or a farcical musical laughs at the stereotypes we see in popular culture about romance and heroism which are in fact hundreds of years old. Beaumont also pioneered a very modern way of doing theatre, which will be presented in this Jude production, directed by Dr Ananda Lal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Green bags to carry festive buys

	Retail chain Spencers is readying to offer customers a choice of green bags to carry their Puja shopping.        
	Members of self-help groups will make the biodegradable bags from tissue paper, jute and other natural fibres. They will be promoted by the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Ltd.         
	Videocon, Shyam Steel and some other companies are sponsoring a lakh eco-friendly bags. Production has started, said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, the managing director of the corporation.        
	But the green bags wont be free. Shoppers will have to pay a couple of rupees for each bag. They can, however, choose not to take these bags.         
	Customers will be offered the choice at the cash counter. The idea is to promote environmental consciousness, said Gon Chaudhuri. We had a meeting with RPG Enterprises and they are keen to promote the bags. They said they would introduce the bags at their Spencers outlets.

          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Rash driving claimed two lives in the city on Monday.        
	At 3.45am, a goods carrier ferrying 14 passengers overturned on the Vidyasagar Setu, killing one and injuring 13. A few hours later, a speeding bus mowed down a 55-year-old man at Esplanade.        
	Fourteen cloth traders were heading for a Howrah market from Calcutta in the early hours of Monday when the vehicle they were travelling in overturned, leaving one of them dead.        
	Qurban Ali Gazi, 28, died of head and chest injuries. The injured passengers lay on the road for more than 25 minutes as the stretch was deserted.         
	Policemen in a patrol van spotted them and arranged for the passengers to be taken to hospital. They were treated and discharged in the afternoon.         
	The driver was speeding and lost control while turning on one of the ramps of the bridge. We are trying to trace the driver and his help. The vehicle has been impounded, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	We asked the driver to go slow. Before we realised what was happening, the vehicle overturned, said one of the passengers.        
	Around 10am, Shakir Ali, a resident of Nodakhali in South 24-Parganas, was walking near the south-east gate of Raj Bhavan when a private bus on route 205 knocked him down while turning right towards Esplanade Row.        
	Ali, who worked at Birla Jute Mill, was taken to Medical College and Hospital with head injuries. He died in the afternoon.         
	The driver has been arrested and the bus impounded by Hare Street police.

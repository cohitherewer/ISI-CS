                      Beyond boundaries                    Music is the only universal language which transcends all frontiers and limits. Through it can be expressed all human emotions, whether happy or sad. The power of music is such that it cannot be constrained in a particular local sphere, for, with its ubiquitous appeal, it reaches out to everyone irrespective of geographic and demographic boundaries. Music-makers Deb Sankar Roy and Jyoti Sankar Roy, popularly known as the Violin Brothers (picture right), have a penchant for music that is global in nature. They assimilate alien strains into the rich repertoire of Indian and Western music, recreating them with their own innovations to compose a new form of music. This evening, the brothers present these creations and more in a performance, where they will render light western classical and global music based on Indian ragas. To be accompanied by the String Orchestra featuring 25 violinists, Shankar Chatterjee (keyboards), Saradindu (Cajon), Indra (tabla) and Bhola (drums).                  Event: Music concert presented by the Violin Brothers When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

	Rajdeb Sharma, a carpenter who lives on Picnic Garden Road, has a problem. He is of an average built, but has the appetite of 10 men.         
	He is in his early 30s and hails from Bihar. His appetite comes in the way of getting work. He demands food in exchange of his labour.         
	He got work at a local hotel two years ago. On the third day the owner told me that he will pay me wages instead of giving me food, says Sharma. He used to have 700 grams of rice, 200 grams dal and 10 pieces of fish for lunch and up to 70 rotis at night, says the owner.         
	With prices going up is it possible for a man earning Rs 100 daily to have 500 grams of rice and 70 rotis a day? asks Sharma.       DEEPANKAR GANGULY

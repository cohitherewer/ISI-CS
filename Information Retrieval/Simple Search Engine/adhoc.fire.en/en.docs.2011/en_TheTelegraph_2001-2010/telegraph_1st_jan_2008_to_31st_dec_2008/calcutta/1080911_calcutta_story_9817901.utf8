	A CBSE school on Jessore Road joined hands with Punjab Technical University (PTU) recently to start graduate and postgraduate courses in information technology, management and applied technology.        
	For Sudhir Memorial Institute, this is yet another feather in its cap after one of its students, Kaustav Chatterjee, stood second among West Bengal examinees in the Class X CBSE exams. An official announcement of the tie-up was made at an event held in the school auditorium on September 3. Karuna Sindhu Das, the vice chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University, was the chief guest.        
	Its a proud moment for us. After imparting quality education at school level, we are now entering higher education, said Sharmila Rakshit, the principal of the school.         
	Sudhir Memorial Institute will run six undergraduate and two postgraduate courses under PTU. The undergraduate courses  to be started from mid-October  include computer application, business administration, mass communication, biotechnology. The postgraduate courses  to be started from early November  are business administration and biotechnology.         
	Each stream will have 60 seats and admission will be based on marks. The classes will be held on the third floor of the school building. We have eight laboratories of 2,000 sq ft each, said Subrata Bhattacharya, founder and chairman of the school. The school also plans to introduce a PG course in microbiology from next year.         
	The institute will help to realise the dreams of students in and around Madhyamgram, said Mihir Dasgupta, the chairman of Madhyamgram municipality.         
	Students who enrol for these courses can study here for a year and at a foreign varsity for the next two years, said Goutam Banerjee, in charge of PTUs activities in the state. The study abroad facility is, however, optional. PTU has a tie-up with four foreign universities  Birmingham City University, University College, Birmingham, City College, Norwich and New College, Nottingham.         
	The students studying abroad will get a two-year work permit after they complete their course, added Banerjee.         
	For students opting to study in India, the cost of an undergraduate course will be Rs 1, 35, 500 while a postgraduate course will be Rs 1,35,500.         
	The school has also acquired 18 cottahs of land adjacent to its campus. We will start engineering courses here, under West Bengal University of Technology, added Bhattacharya.

	Whats on your mind this week  Travel travail  
	A student in Calcutta, a city with a well-developed transport system, has several options to reach his school or college, including bus, train, auto or Metro. But the scenario changes in the villages. In the Sunderbans area, for instance, there are few modes of transportation. To attend college in the city, bicycles and boats have to be availed for a considerable distance. Bicycles have to make their way through unpaved roads that turn into slush during the rainy season. Pupils taking boats have to wait in long queues to find a place. A lot of time is lost in travelling. The government should pay more attention to the plight of students who try as hard as their city counterparts to build a career for themselves.

	In school, we never cared if our friends belonged to the backward castes. Now though, we are always on the lookout for those who have had it easy thanks to the quota system. The Centre introduced the reservation policy to remove bias and bring the less-privileged classes at par with others. Unfortunately, it has lowered academic standards in places of higher education like the much-coveted IITs and IIMs. The quota system has also brewed bitterness among students. Those belonging to the general category feel deprived, as many deserving candidates lose out on opportunities. Lets hope the government realises the damage they are doing. Merit should be the only deciding factor in competitive exams.

	Quota martial        
	When we saw the merit list for the postgraduate courses in Calcutta University, we knew there would be a long list of names under the reserved seats category.         
	I had remained oblivious of the quota dagger hanging over us until now. It was a big jolt to see that my friend, who had secured over 50 per cent, had not made it to the merit list. Instead many, who had scored far less, had been admitted because their surnames made them members of the backward caste. This is sheer injustice to potential and excellence. Our careers are being jeopardised by politicians who dont bat an eyelid about compromising merit to meet their own agendas.

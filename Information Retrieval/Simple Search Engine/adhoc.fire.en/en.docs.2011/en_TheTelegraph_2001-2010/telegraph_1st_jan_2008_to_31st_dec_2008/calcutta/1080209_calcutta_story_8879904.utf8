The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU spat puts off meeting
                                                                                                            JU spat puts off meeting
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A meeting of Jadavpur University (JU)s executive council had to be adjourned on Friday because of a difference of opinion among teachers on recruitment policies.        
	The main topic on the agenda was the appointment of teachers in the science and engineering faculty. The university authorities had recently selected candidates for filling up several vacant teaching posts. The list of candidates was placed before the council  one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university  on Friday for approval.        
	A section of the teachers objected to the selection process, leading to heated exchanges for around four hours. Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh adjourned the meeting around 6pm.        
	I cannot comment on an internal administrative matter, Ghosh told Metro.        
	The executive council is controlled by members of the Left parties, mostly the CPM.         
	A meeting of the executive council was adjourned around four years ago following a difference of opinion over the introduction of a course. The council had then failed to reach a decision because of opposition from the anti-Left members.        
	The meeting had to be adjourned because some members felt that discussions were necessary on key recruitment policies, said a member of the council.         
	For instance, the university wants to have a concrete policy on reservation of posts for SC and ST candidates. Some council members are opposed to this, he added.        
	We are going to be the worst sufferers because of the delay in filling up the vacant posts, said a student of the physics department.         
	The posts of six lecturers and two readers in the physics department are to be filled, said a JU official.        
	The date for holding the adjourned meeting will be announced soon, said Ghosh.

                      The art of troubled times                    With the ever-increasing proliferation of the electronic media, images have become the currency of communication in todays world. The transience of television images is symmetrically balanced by the permanence of the print media. This forms the point of departure of the paintings of Roy Thomas. In presenting his images, he intentionally subverts the original perspective, transforming them into a world of imagined possibilities. Born in Kerala in 1966, Thomas is very much an artist of our times. His imagery is apparently photorealistic with scenes of happenings we confront in our daily lives. But a closer look affords his paintings an entirely new significance. What appear to be insects at a distance are toy helicopters or war-planes in apparently bucolic surroundings, reminding us that we live in times where there are dangerous toys to play with. Yet, his works permeate an enormous element of hope, even where he is obviously warning us against global perils.                  lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Roy Thomas lWhen: Till December 15; 2 pm - 8 pm lWhere: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame parties, not people 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We Ask You Answer      Blame parties, not people 
          Todays question: Who is to blame for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh? More responses will be published next week                                                      
	Amrita Mallik, 
  Salt Lake									      
	One cannot clap with one hand. Both the government and the people are equally responsible for the bandhs. People always enjoy a break in their daily routine, so they keep quiet. The government pays less attention to the health of the state and more on power play. It forces people to participate in the bandh.                Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur								       
	When a bandh is called by the ruling party or its affiliated trade-unions, the administration needs to be blamed for failing to keep the city on track. And when called by the Opposition, the citizens are to be blamed for not going to office and enjoying a holiday.                 Ishita Bhattacharya, 
  Hooghly								       
	Surely it is not the citizens who can be held responsible for the shutdown because if trains, taxis, buses and trams do not ply, then how will they manage to reach their workplace? To add to that is the fear of confronting the people calling the bandh. Therefore it is wise for them to stay at home. In order to have a successful bandh party workers shout slogans, conduct long rallies and force people to stay indoors and at the end of the day announce that they had the full support of the people. If these people are given an opportunity to get out of their houses without fear, then the political parties will get an answer.                   Priyanka Dutta, 
  Nagerbazar								       
	The success of a bandh depends on the people and the political party calling it. People have become so accustomed to bandhs that at the mere mention of one they declare a holiday for themselves which makes the bandh a success. The problems that occur on a bandh day are also a reason why people avoid going out. Hence, both the common people and the political parties are to blame.                Alpana Chakraborty,
  Dum Dum       
	Calcuttans are to be blamed for the complete shutdown on a bandh day. They never get any advantage from the bandhs but they never protest it. They fear all political parties and forget that these parties constitute ordinary men. Moreover, people treat bandhs as holidays and stay home.                   R. Subhranshu, 
  Chandernagore								       
	We should first find out the cause of the bandh call  price rise, nuclear power pact or something else and would a bandh arrest the cause? Also does any sane person support anything that prevents a daily wage-earner from earning his bread or disrupt traffic, communication, education or health service? None is to blame because it is we who can stop a bandh.                  Paramananda Pal, 
  Karaya Road								       
	For forcing life to a standstill on a bandh the immediate responsibility lies on the political party and its musclemen who resort to obstruction and intimidation of all sorts against the free movement of vehicles and people. The administration cannot avoid its responsibility if it fails to maintain normalcy. A state where the government cannot take action to prevent such disruptive activities on a bandh day for fear of violence will be doomed into a phase of anarchy. The gates of democracy are now manned by musclemen who can do and undo anything during a bandh and go scotfree.  Mudar Patherya,   What kind of a society do we belong to that exhorts me to pay more tax as an honourable citizen and then robs my right to work to earn it in the first place? What kind of a society can destroy incomes and retard progress and then have the gall to claim that its bandh was lsquo;successful rsquo;?   What kind of a society can hide behind curtains at the first whisper of lsquo;bandh rsquo; on the supposed fear of violence when the real reason is lsquo;kaaj koraar kono ichchhey nei? rsquo; What kind of a society supports bandhs as a form of effective protest when not one bandh has helped correct inflation or bring down oil prices?   What kind of a society will watch lethargically as one party uses the bandh as a political tool to discredit another at the cost of millions who have nothing to do with both? What kind of a society exercises the right to disagree on every point possible but agrees almost spontaneously and unanimously when it comes to the most despicable of all mdash; the right to make oneself useless?   What kind of a society is this where we teach our children that lsquo;work is worship rsquo; but when it comes to breaking a bandh, we would rather call friends over, play cards and watch a film while the rest of the country earns an honest living?   What kind of a society is this where some people can fool us all with words like lsquo;strike rsquo;, not lsquo;bandh rsquo;, and get away scot-free from legal consequences? What kind of a society is this where an organisation can put a state back by millions of person- days and not be taken to court for damages? What kind of a society is this where we all happily stay away from work without knowing even the reason why the bandh was called? What kind of a society is this where it takes repeated reminders to get people to do something and only the whisper of a lsquo;bandh rsquo; to get them to not do anything?   What kind of a society is this where if I disagree respectfully with anyone calling bandh then I should be disrespectfully coerced to think their way with brick or bat or both? What kind of a society is this where after not having attended work for a full day someone actually has the cheek to ask lsquo;Shey ki, won rsquo;t we get paid for yesterday? It wasn rsquo;t my fault that I couldn rsquo;t come to work hellip; rsquo;   What kind of a society calls itself the lsquo;mind of the nation rsquo; when it does not even have a bloody spine?

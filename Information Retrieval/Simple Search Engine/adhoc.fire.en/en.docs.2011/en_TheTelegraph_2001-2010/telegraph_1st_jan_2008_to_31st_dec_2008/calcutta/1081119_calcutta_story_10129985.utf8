                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu classes resume

	First and second year classes at the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) resumed after a fortnight on Tuesday with nearly 90 per cent attendance.         
	The university had been indefinitely shut down on November 6 and male undergraduate students were asked to vacate the campus. Eighty per cent of the boys returned to their hostels on Monday.        
	I am happy to be able to attend classes again. The day was peaceful. We need this kind of an atmosphere at a prestigious institution like Besu, said second-year student Ayan Mohan Ghosh. There was only one police vehicle on the campus on Tuesday and eight cops kept vigil.        
	Over 770 of the 850 first and second year students have signed an undertaking promising to abide by the code of conduct recently formulated by the authorities. Parents had to sign the undertaking as witnesses. The authorities will soon decide on the dates for resumption of the third and fourth year classes, said sources.         
	The Besu authorities have met two groups of 50 guardians to explain why the written undertaking was necessary. The guardians have reportedly asked the authorities to be stricter in maintaining discipline on campus.        
	Many students are unable to attend classes because of intimidation by third and fourth-year students, we were told, said registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.

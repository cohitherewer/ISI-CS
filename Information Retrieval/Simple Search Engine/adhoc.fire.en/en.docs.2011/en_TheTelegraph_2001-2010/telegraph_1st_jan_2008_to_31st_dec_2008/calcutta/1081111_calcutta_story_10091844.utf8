The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flyover for south fringe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flyover for south fringe
        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The government is poised to construct a 12-km two-lane flyover connecting Budge Budge on the southern fringes to Taratala for faster connectivity with the city proper. There is also a parallel plan to marry the flyover with a monorail.        
	As Calcutta is growing along the southern fringes, the need for easier and smoother access to the heart of the city is felt every day. So, we have decided to construct a flyover that can be used by cars for a toll fee, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said on Monday.        
	The project, to be executed on a public-private-partnership model, will cost around Rs 600 crore.        
	According to sources in the PWD, the government has already held discussions with real-estate developers like the Eden Group and the United Credit Belani Properties, which have evinced interest in joining hands with the PWD for the project.        
	A lot of projects are coming up on the southern fringes of the city and a flyover will make these projects more attractive, said a senior PWD official.        
	During preliminary talks, the government has said it would chip in with one-third of the project cost while the rest would be borne by the private players, who would form a consortium.        
	We are keen on the project. The government has already hired IL amp;FS for a detailed project report, which should be ready by end-November, said Indranil Dey, the chairman of Eden City.         
	To be executed in a phased manner  the first phase would connect Budge Budge and Jinjirabazar  the project would be implemented through build, operate and transfer (BOT).        
	Besides planning a high-speed corridor for people who can afford to pay a price for a faster ride, the government is planning a mass transit system, an adaptation of the Japanese model of elevated tram tracks below flyovers.        
	Our department is working on a proposal for a monorail below the flyover for mass transit. The population has grown manifold in those areas and so a mass transit system is a necessity, said minister Goswami.         
	According to the PWD proposal, the monorail project would connect Budge Budge in the first phase and later it would extend from Joka to Ranikuthi and then move to Rajarhat via EM Bypass.        
	A prospective investor will be meeting us soon for another round of presentation, said Goswami.

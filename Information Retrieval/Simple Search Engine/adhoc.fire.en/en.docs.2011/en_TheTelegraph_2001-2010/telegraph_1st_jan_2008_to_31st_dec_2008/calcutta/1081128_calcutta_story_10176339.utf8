                      Sufi confluence                    Conceived eight years back with a view to promote and popularise Sufi and mystic music, the Ruhaniyat festival has evolved into one of the biggest, most prestigious and eagerly-awaited music events for connoisseurs across India. Having featured over 2000 Sufi and mystic music artistes, it serves as a huge platform for folk, baul, qawwali and shabad singers to perform at various international festivals worldwide. Riding its awesome success during its maiden tour to Calcutta last year, Ruhaniyat 2008-09 returns to the city with a totally fresh line-up of singers from India and abroad. Featuring singers from remote villages to internationally-acclaimed artistes, each performing in their unique, powerful style, it is an event that true lovers of music will try their best not to miss. Explaining the wisdom of Sufi saints and mystics, the songs are a timely reminder of the human capacity to evolve and show love and compassion. Participants: Sawan Khan and Akhe Khan (picture here) and Sali Mohamad Khan of Rajasthan (sufi kalam and mystic songs); Parvathy Baul of Bengal (baul songs); Mohamed Farghaly amp; group of Egypt (Arabic sufi songs); Latif Bolat of Turkey (bektashi sufiana songs); Rakesh Bhatt amp; group of Uttaranchal (jagar) and Shameem Nayeem Ajmeri amp; group of Jaipur (sufi qawwali).

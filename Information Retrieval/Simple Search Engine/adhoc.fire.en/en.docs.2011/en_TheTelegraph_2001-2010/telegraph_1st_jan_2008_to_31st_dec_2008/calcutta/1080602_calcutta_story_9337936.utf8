          ROMILA SAHA                                    
	When Richard Bartholomew came to Calcutta in 1996 to look for his fathers grave, he didnt expect it to be as cumbersome a task as it turned out to be.        
	The only information the Briton had was that his father, an officer in the Raj, had been buried in the Lower Circular Road cemetery. Exactly where in that sprawling burial ground Bartholomew Senior lay, nobody could tell. Bartholomew did find his fathers grave after several visits, but it could have been easier.        
	The good news for foreigners planning similar trips is that the Christian Burial Board (CBB) has begun digitising the burial records of the Lower Circular Road, Park Street and Kidderpore cemeteries.        
	The British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia has already built an archive for the past 29 years, based on feedback from visitors. The British Library, too, is creating a database of pre-Independence burials. But it is the digital CBB archive, based on information culled from torn, almost illegible record registers, that could be the most authentic and helpful.        
	The digitised information will be stored under eight heads: date of burial, last person buried in the plot, location of the graveyard, name of the purchaser of the plot, date of death and title deed number. The archive will contain details of all burials since 1840.        
	One can search for records by the location of the grave in the cemetery or the last person interred in the grave, said Arijit Mitra of Computax Consultants, the systems development company in charge of the digitisation process.        
	The Rs 1-lakh project began in 2003 and is almost 80 per cent complete.        
	These are all public cemeteries, open to everybody. Each grave can contain up to eight bodies, usually from the same family. But since the lease of a plot can be transferred, there is no guarantee that a grave where people were laid to rest five decades ago hasnt been used again. In such cases, locating the graves would be almost impossible, Ranojoy Bose, an executive member of the CBB, said.        
	The Lower Circular Road cemetery alone contains more than 10,000 graves, spread over 77 bighas. The burial records are now available at the Lower Circular Road cemetery and Computax Consultants Gariahat office. One can search through the archives for a fee of Rs 50.

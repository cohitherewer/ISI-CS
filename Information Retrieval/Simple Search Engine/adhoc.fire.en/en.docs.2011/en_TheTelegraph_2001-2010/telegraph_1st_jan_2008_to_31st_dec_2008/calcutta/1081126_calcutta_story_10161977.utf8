	The Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Bill, 2008, was passed in the Assembly on Tuesday, paving the way for the second private university in the state.        
	The Dhirubhai Ambani Memorial Trust, run by Anil Ambani, the chairman of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, will invest about Rs 150 crore to set up the institute on a 60-acre plot near Haringhata.         
	The institute will be modelled on the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. We accepted the groups offer considering its experience, said higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury.        
	According to him, the institute will offer education, training and research facilities in information and communication technology.         
	We will take around a year to set up the institute after getting possession of the plot, said a spokesperson of the group.        
	The institute will function as a non-affiliating university and will not accept financial aid from governments and funding agencies like the University Grants Commission.        
	In 2005, the group had sought the state governments permission to set up the institute. The first private university in West Bengal, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University, was started the same year. The Ambani institute was granted permission in 2006.        
	Opposition MLAs on Tuesday opposed the bill and criticised the government for not consulting them before introducing the legislation.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Swarup Biswas in court on Monday                                  
	Alipore criminal court on Wednesday granted bail to 27 people arrested for allegedly attacking policemen and setting four vehicles on fire after a bus accident near Charu Market on October 5.        
	Swarup Biswas, brother of Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Biswas and the alleged leader of the mob that attacked cops, is being treated at Medical College and Hospital (MCH) and could not be produced in court on Wednesday.        
	Swarup Biswas will be produced in court once he recovers, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.         
	Swarup was admitted to the medicine ward of MCH after being produced in court and denied bail on Monday afternoon. Within minutes of the magistrate remanding him in police custody till October 15, Swarup complained of severe pain in his chest and abdomen.        
	The drama on the court premises continued till 9.45pm with Trinamul supporters demanding Swarups release on bail.         
	According to hospital sources, Swarup complained of stomach pain in the morning. A CT scan was done on his lower abdomen. He is stable. We carried out some blood tests and are waiting for the results, said a doctor.        
	Doctors suspect that Swarup is suffering from either an ulcer or pancreatitis. He will undergo more tests on Thursday.        
	Two constables are guarding him round the clock in hospital. The Trinamul activist was arrested last Wednesday from Kona Expressway on October 8 and was charged with arson, rioting and attempt to murder.         
	Last week, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had given a clean chit to Swarup while addressing a rally in south Calcutta and described him as a social worker. She had also claimed that he was framed because of police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabartis personal grudge against him.        
	An officer of the detective department said the 27 released on bail were asked to report to the investigating officer at the police station every day.

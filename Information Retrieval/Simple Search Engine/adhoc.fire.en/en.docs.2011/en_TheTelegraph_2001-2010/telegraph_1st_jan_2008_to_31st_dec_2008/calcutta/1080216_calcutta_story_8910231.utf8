                      Introspective canvas                    An intense maturity in thought and execution distinguishes the paintings of Debjani Datta. Her canvases are filled with tenderness, compassion for mankind and a yearning for the unattainable. The ongoing exhibition speaks volumes of the passion, power and energy that drive her to create works of art. The monks she portrays are soft and ethereal. In their quest for divinity, they appear to have reached a state of being that transcends the tangible and the mortal. The lotus, an embodiment of peace and serenity, occurs as a recurring motif in Dattas works. It often features as a counterpoint to the style and substance of her canvases, a zone of tranquillity amidst a riot of vibrant colours and brushstrokes. While at times it serves as a symbol of satiation for a passionate woman reaching beyond sensual pleasures, at others, it reflects the state of the mind of the pilgrim, travelling across the bedlam of his immediate being. Though dominated by stark, bold hues, her canvases propagate the message of peace attained through reflection, meditation, silence and solitude.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Debjani Datta When: Till February 17; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Four Jadavpur University students have been proved guilty of misbehaving with New Year Eve revellers.        
	The four  two each from the engineering and arts faculty  were temporarily suspended from their hostel in January following a preliminary probe.        
	The final report of the two-member committee set up by the university to probe the allegation was placed before the executive council on Wednesday.        
	The council will discuss the report in the next meeting and decide whether further action will be taken against the four, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the executive council.        
	The committee has confirmed that the students had misbehaved with December 31 revellers, including a woman. They also violated a university rule by breaking open the main gate of the hostel. The rules state that boarders should not step out of the hostel premises after midnight.        
	The university had asked the dean of student affairs to maintain a vigil on the activities of the hostel inmates on December 31 night.         
	The probe panel has found out that the students had also misbehaved with the official when he asked them not to leave the hostel.        
	The revellers who were harassed had alleged that the students were all drunk.        
	The executive council on Wednesday also approved the report of a four-member committee set up to suggest ways to stop ragging on campus. The council accepted the panels suggestion that the two hostels on the campus be kept reserved for first-year students.        
	The panel was set up after a second-year student of engineering was forced to drink kerosene days after he moved into a hostel last year.

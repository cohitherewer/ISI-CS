                                                                                                               Puzzled, but aims for ISC
  - Friends rally around Orphaned brothers          A STAFF REPORTER                          Hridesh Shaw and brother Dilesh (in red shawl) the day after their mother and sister died in a blaze at their one-room home in Howrahs Shibpur. On Monday, they lost their father, too. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Hridesh Shaw has one aim in life now  to sit for the ISC exams, which start next Monday.         
	But he has no clue how to realise his dream  all his books and notes were destroyed in Wednesday nights fire that killed his parents and sister.        
	How will I study? I do not have money to buy books. And I am also down with chicken pox. I have no clue what will happen, said the 17-year-old, who had topped his school in the ICSE, scoring 97 per cent.         
	With their one-room rented house at 276 GT Road, Shibpur, now reduced to ashes, Hridesh and brother Dilesh, 15, have moved to a temporary shelter arranged by their friends.        
	But the brothers will have to vacate the house after the owners  relatives of one of Hrideshs friends  return next week.        
	Ever since the fire, allegedly lit by landlord Kashinath Jaiswal who wanted to drive away the tenants, the friends were taking turns in keeping the brothers.         
	But after Hridesh was diagnosed with chicken pox on Saturday, we arranged a temporary accommodation for them, said Hrideshs friend Vishal Tiwary.        
	The friends are paying for his treatment and also bringing the brothers food.        
	I am grateful to them. They have always stood by us. As I cannot afford to buy books, some of my classmates are sharing theirs with me. They even organised the last rites of my parents and sister, said Hridesh.        
	But the teenager is mature enough to understand that this cannot continue for long. They cannot keep looking after us forever. What will happen when the support dries up? I do not have the means to support myself and my brother, said Hridesh, who escaped the blaze as he was at his tutors home.        
	Dilesh, who survived the fire with minor injuries, is too shocked to react.        
	The principal of Marias Day School, in Howrah, where the brothers study, fears the tragedy will affect the mental growth of the duo. I plan to take them to a counsellor once they overcome the initial shock, said principal Amitabha Dutta.

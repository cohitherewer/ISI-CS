The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free flow of banned katatel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Free flow of banned katatel
          JAYANTA BASU                          An autorickshaw driver carries katatel                                   
	Adulterated fuel for autorickshaws, popularly known as katatel, is still being sold across the city, despite a high court injunction and a state government ban on its use.        
	According to an estimate, close to a lakh autorickshaws in the city and its adjoining areas run on katatel.        
	The trade in adulterated fuel stopped briefly after the high court passed the order and police raided some shops selling the banned item. But its back to square one. Only the places from where they were sold have changed, said environmentalist S.M. Ghosh.        
	Somenath Mukherjee, who owns an autorickshaw in Behala, said katatel is freely available near Thakurpukur college, Behala Chowrasta police outpost and the Taratala auto stand. You will always find auto drivers refilling tanks with katatel at these places.        
	Tests carried out by the state pollution control board and Jadavpur University  Metro published the reports  revealed that katatel comprises petrol, kerosene and naptha, a toxic mix that contributes significantly to the citys air pollution.        
	The state government issued a notification under Air Act 1981 in July, banning manufacture, storage and sale of any fuel without permission of the pollution control board and other appropriate authorities, such as Indian Oil Corporation, the fire services department and the local authorities.        
	The notification, based on a decision of a high court-appointed committee monitoring the implementation of a court order on controlling vehicular pollution, also barred running vehicles on fuel that do not meet the specifications laid down by the Central Motor Vehicles Act. The committee felt the need for a notification as there were loopholes in the existing anti-adulteration act.        
	The notification was issued following talks with the Indian Oil Corporation, said environment secretary M.L. Meena, who is also the member-secretary of the court-appointed committee.        
	We are trying to take action against the ban violators, who are liable to be fined and jailed for up to two years. Other departments and agencies, too, will crack down on violators, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department, and a member of the committee.        
	The officials assertion, however, has little impact on the road, even though transport unions have pledged to shun katatel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sit-in after JU party-pooper decree
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sit-in after JU party-pooper decree
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fetsu members at a demonstration on the Jadavpur University campus last year. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Trouble broke out on the Jadavpur University (JU) campus again on Wednesday after students staged a sit-in and gheraoed the vice-chancellor and other senior officials in the evening.        
	The students gathered in front of the universitys main meeting room to protest the JU executive councils decision not to allow students to use the universitys indoor stadium to organise department-wise freshers welcome programmes.         
	They also opposed a decision by the university authorities to bring forward the dates of the semester examinations.        
	Last month, the students  mainly members of the engineering and technology faculty students union (Fetsu)  had demanded the authorities withdraw a number of proposals, particularly the decision to bring forward the semester exams.        
	The issues were placed before the meeting of the executive council on Wednesday for approval. The students started their agitation around 6pm when they came to know that the council had rejected their demands.         
	According to the council, instead of organising the freshers welcome separately, the university will allow three programmes  one for each faculty, engineering, science and arts.        
	The council members unanimously felt that freshers welcome programmes should be held within one or two weeks from the first day of the session every year. We have noticed in the past few years that freshers welcome programmes stretch to mid-September, more than a month after classes begin. Academic activities get disrupted if the programmes are held for so long, said a senior member of the council.        
	The council members said that if the departments wanted to organise students welcome programmes separately, they could do so in their own departments.         
	But the students dont agree.        
	We will not accept the universitys decision. The authorities will have to allow us to use the indoor stadium, said a Fetsu supporter.         
	The students were also opposed to two other proposals of the authorities  segregation of first-year boarders in the hostels to save them from ragging and reduction of the Puja vacation from a month to nine days.        
	From this year, the Puja vacation will be for nine days. But between Lakshmi puja and Kali puja, only remedial coaching will be offered. Moreover, it wont be mandatory for students to attend the coaching. As for the hostel segregation, we are yet to take a final decision, said P. N. Ghosh, the vice-chancellor.         
	The gherao was lifted around 8.30pm after the authorities promised to discuss the issues with the students again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadmap for budding scribes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Roadmap for budding scribes

	Students of Calcutta University (CU) and NSHM Knowledge Campus organised an interaction between students of mass communication from the two institutions and James Richard Dickenson, a veteran correspondent and political editor of The Washington Post, USA, on April 24. The 75-year-old journalist answered the queries of students regarding the present US election campaign and also listed the dos and donts to become a successful journalist.        
	I disagree with the notion that journalists are born and not made. But one can only be a journalist if one has the temperament for it, said the scribe who covered every US presidential campaign from 1964 to 1988.        
	He advised the students to cultivate the qualities of a good political reporter, that include scepticism, inquisitiveness, objectivity and the importance of rechecking facts. Once a senior editor told me that even if my mother said she loved me, I should check it, joked Dickenson. He spoke of the relevance of internships in honing the skills of budding journalists and about the evolution of new technology in media.        
	Dickenson, who covered the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, said: At times, the politics is neither exciting nor neat, but it is mesmerising nevertheless for the ones who cover it. In the two-hour session, he elaborated about the present election campaign. Although Republican candidate John McCain has spoken about excluding Russia from the G8 countries, it has received little attention in the mainstream media, that prefers to focus on the Obama-Clinton rivalry, he remarked. About his distaste for tabloid journalism, he said: I would never call chasing down Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan journalism.        
	Dickenson feels that this years election is unique, as with the win of either Democrat: Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, US would have its first Afro-American or woman president. He believes that Barack Obamas ideologies, mass appeal among the young and veterans, his immigration policy and call for a unified nation keep him ahead of Hillary Clinton.         
	Dickenson also spoke about US stand on Tibet. The US media has always supported the Tibetans, said Dickenson, who works as a spokesperson for government agencies and private corporations now and continues freelancing. Dickenson also seemed surprised by the good quality of students in the Indian media schools and by the quality of the Indian newspapers. India has a huge potential in journalism both in the country as well as in US        
	I was in a dilemma about taking up a two-month internship in a mainstream economic journal in Delhi. But after this session I am satisfied that it will only help my career prospects, said Krishnakali Sengupta, a final year media student of the CU.

	Rehabilitation Centre For Children (RCFC)  a resource institute for children with orthopaedic disability  celebrated its 35th Foundation Day on April 24 in its first-floor auditorium.         
	To mark the special occasion, children danced to the popular tune Dhadina Natina while some sang We Shall Overcome to a cheering audience.        
	Established in 1973 by a 22-year old British nurse, Jane Pamela Webb, the centre now boasts of a well-equipped operation theatre, X-ray unit and child development department.         
	Over 100 underprivileged children, below 14 years, avail its residential facilities. Many with Flat Foot and Flexor Deformity have been operated on at cheap rates here. The Centre has two wings, one in Behala and the other in Bolpur.         
	We value every child who stays here and help him cultivate their natural abilities and rebuild their confidence, said AB Choudhuri, president of RCFC, in his inaugural address.         
	Henry Jardine, the US Consul General, surprised everyone with his flawless Bengali: Aamar ekhane eshe khoob bhalo legeche (I have really enjoyed myself over here). He elaborated on the USAID and Hope Foundation projects, stressing on the need for social awareness. Chief guest Kshiti Goswami, state PWD minister, listed the national statistics of youths suffering from malnutrition and the measures taken by state governments to counter the problem.         
	Thirteen-year-old Sarina Khatoon, diagnosed with left tibia deformity, is now on a corrective plaster, having undergone three major operations. I would sit and cry all day because I thought my future was doomed. But, after the operations, I feel confident. I am trying to concentrate on drawing, sewing and other vocational programmes here, she said, after her dance performance.         
	My three-year-old daughter was born with a limb deformity. But we could not afford her treatment. A relative sent me here. I have full faith in the doctors, says Aparna Mali. The centre also educates the children who live there.         
	The curriculum is rigorous, like any normal school. The teachers help us a lot and are very understanding, said Shabana Khatoon, another 13-year-old student.         
	The most important thing is to treat these children normally. Once they sense too much sympathy from a person, they become self-conscious. That hampers their psychological development, said Kakoli Samaddar, a teacher in the centre.

	THE DIARY
	Alias        
	Sounds caress my lips, 
  I do not speak.
  Reflexes abandon 
  Frozen fingertips.
  You can never see my ghost 
  Walk past you 
  Im just... nobody.

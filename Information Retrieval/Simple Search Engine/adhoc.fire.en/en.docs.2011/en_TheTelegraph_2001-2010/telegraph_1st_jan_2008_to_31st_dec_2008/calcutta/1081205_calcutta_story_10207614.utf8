                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Soldier with bullet in body denied dues
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER      
	Former BSF constable Pijush Kanti Bhattacharya has been living with a militants bullet in his body for over a decade but it is the pain of being a forgotten soldier that hurts the most.        
	Justice S.P. Talukdar of Calcutta High Court eased some of that pain on Thursday when he gave the director-general of the BSF two weeks to ensure that Pijush got everything that a soldier injured in the line of duty was entitled to.        
	Critically wounded in an encounter with extremists in Manipur in 1997, Pijush has been surviving on a monthly pension of Rs 1,913, far less than what he had been promised.        
	 I wrote to the director-general in July 2006 and waited a year for a reply but he didnt bother sending one. I have faith in the judiciary but I will believe that justice has been done only after receiving my dues, the former constable told Metro from his home in Adi Kasempur village, Barasat. He lives there with his 72-year-old mother, wife and teenaged son.        
	Pijush was in transit with his colleagues from the BSFs 55th Battalion when militants ambushed them at Wangjing, in the Thoubal district of Manipur, on May 21, 1997. The battalion fought back but lost 11 men.        
	Of the five bullets that Pijush took on his body, four were removed at the military hospital where he had been admitted but one remained embedded in his abdomen. He resumed work after spending a month and 21 days in hospital but found it difficult to maintain the punishing regimen.        
	Pijush underwent a second operation at a city hospital in January 2003 but that aggravated his condition. The bullet was stuck in the fifth lumbar of his spinal cord, his lawyer Subroto Mukherjee said.        
	A BSF medical board declared Pijush disabled in 2005 and asked him to take voluntary retirement. He agreed after being told that he would be paid half his last salary drawn plus Rs 400 as monthly pension. He was also entitled to Rs 1 lakh in compensation and gratuity, Mukherjee said.        
	But Pijush received Rs 61,740 as gratuity, as against Rs 84,000 that someone in his position is entitled to. His pension was fixed at Rs 1,913, something a constable gets on retiring under normal circumstances.        
	I wonder whether the BSF bosses will follow the courts order, Pijush said.

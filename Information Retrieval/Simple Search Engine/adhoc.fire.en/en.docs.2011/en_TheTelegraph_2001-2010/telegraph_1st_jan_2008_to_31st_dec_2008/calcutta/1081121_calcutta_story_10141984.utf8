                      In search of the sublime alter-ego                    Ashoketaru Bandyopadhyay was a versatile Rabindrasangeet exponent who distinguished himself from his peers by introducing various innovations in mode of presentation and performance. Specialising in offbeat, experimental numbers, he loved to explore areas left largely untouched by his more austere predecessors. He was the first to present a solo performance of Tagore songs way back in 1969, beginning a trend that has gained much popularity since. But he always remained true to the tradition of Rabindrasangeet, preferring the classic style of rendition instead of improvising on it in any way. As a tribute to the departed singers 78th birth anniversary (observed last month), Taru Shruti presents Dosar Je Jan  an evening of introspection through Tagores music interspersed with a bouquet of modern poetry renditions. His daughter Koushiki Bandyopadhyay (picture left) pays tribute to her father through an extraordinary musical journey that undertakes a search for an alternate self. In her maiden performance, the artiste attempts to discover, understand and forge a bond with the elusive, anonymous self which complements her own being. Readings by Shankar Chakraborty.            Event: An evening of Tagore songs by Koushiki Bandyopadhyay When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Sisir Mancha

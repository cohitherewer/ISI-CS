The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bust goes the big screen
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bust goes the big screen
          PRIYANKA ROY                            Dostana is not a draw now; Sorry Bhai! is terror-struck                          
	Shomik Sengupta has decided to press the pause button on a weekend family ritual. Irrespective of what film it is, we all go for a Saturday night show at a plex. But the mayhem in Mumbai kept us at home last Saturday and we plan to give the movies a miss this weekend too, says the Golf Green resident.        
	Near-empty box-office counters and auditoriums in town mark the big screen going bust at the beginning of the festive month.        
	Blame it first on the films  Bollywood biggies fizzling out  and then on the fear factor, with the war on Mumbai making Calcuttans choose the small screen over the big.        
	There has been a 40-50 per cent drop in occupancy. The films havent been great and the terror attacks have been the final nail in the coffin, said Arijit Dutta of Priya Cinemas.        
	The single-screen theatres are the worst hit with a visible lack of security. But the multiplexes are not much better off.        
	Our occupancy has gone down drastically over the weekend. The lack of a Friday blockbuster and the peoples tendency to avoid confined spaces post the terror attack has meant a bad weekend, rued a spokesperson for Big Cinemas in Sector V.        
	The Friday releases Sorry Bhai! and Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! have been hit where it hurts. A film with decent reviews like Sorry Bhai! suffered badly because of the terror attacks, said Debashish Dey of Roxy and Paradise. Dey, who also distributed the Chitrangda Singh film in town, put the weekend losses incurred by his two standalone halls at Rs 30,000-40,000.        
	The woeful weekend has capped off a bleak month at the movies, with the latest 007 flick Quantum of Solace falling short of expectations, Subhash Ghais mega-budget Yuvvraaj flopping badly and the three-week-old Dostana running out of steam.        
	With this Fridays roster not boasting any big Bolly release, city cinemas are waiting for the Khans to bail them out. Shah Rukh Khan hits the halls with Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi on December 12 and Aamir Khan arrives with Ghajini on December 25.        
	No terror attack can keep people away from a good film, said Capt. Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX, which insists it has not recorded a significant dip in footfall at its three plexes, except for night shows. The two Fame multiplexes in the city have recorded a marginal dip in footfall, blaming it on the poor fare and the peoples fear.        
	We would rather be safe than sorry, summed up Manoj Joshi, who took his wife and 10-year-old son out for dinner but not a movie on Sunday.

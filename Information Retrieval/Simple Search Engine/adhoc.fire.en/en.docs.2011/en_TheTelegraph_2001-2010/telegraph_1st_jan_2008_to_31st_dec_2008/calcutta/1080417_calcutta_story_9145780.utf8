                      Treasure trove of melodies                    Occupying a very dominant position in Indian classical music, a raga is a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is founded. Each raga has its own specific features, elements and moods that define it. Ragas on Celluloid features two documentaries that unfold the magic of some of the ragas. In Khayal (dir: Usha Deshpande; 6 pm), sitar maestro Ravi Shankar and santoor virtuoso Shiv Kumar Sharma explain their concepts of raga, gharana (school) and their world of music. Characteristics of various schools are explained along with contribution made by leading exponents. Dhrupad (dir: Mani Kaul; 7.10 pm) pays musical tribute to the oldest surviving style of music in the Hindustani tradition. The four broad stylistic variants of dhrupad are tentatively linked to the five singing styles (geetis) known from the 7th century. Jointly hosted by Films Division, Government of India and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre.                  Event: Screening of two documentaries on Indian ragas When: Today; 6 pm amp; 7.10 pm Where: Nandan II

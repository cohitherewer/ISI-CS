The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surprises in suicide note
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Surprises in suicide note
        A STAFF REPORTER                                                    Rizwanur Rahman      
	Rizwanur Rahman named an uncle, a legislator and a police officer other than the chargesheeted trio among the six persons morally responsible for his death.        
	The people actually morally responsible for my suicide are Anil Saraogi, Sukanti Chakraborty, Gyanwant Singh, Ajoy Kumar, MLA Jawed Khan and my uncle Saidur Rahman, Rizwanur wrote in the suicide note retrieved from his cousins computer.        
	Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) when Rizwanur committed suicide, was one of the five police officers under the CBI scanner for allegedly threatening him to leave his wife Priyanka Todi.        
	Khans name came up during the course of investigation, but he was never regarded as a suspect. Saidur Rahmans involvement in the case  he passed on information about Rizwanur-Priyanka to the Todis for a fee  was exposed by The Telegraph.        
	When CBI lawyer Partha Tapaswi read out Rizwanurs note in the special city sessions court on Wednesday afternoon, defence counsel Milan Mukherjee pounced on it. How is it possible? Why were the trios names not included in the chargesheets when their names figure in the suicide note. Why did the CBI deliberately drop their names? he asked.        
	Tapaswi said the investigating agency did not file chargesheets against them for lack of evidence.        
	The suicide note was appended to the chargesheets against the seven accused, including Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, his brother Pradip Todi and the three police officers who were granted bail on Wednesday. Saraogi, a relative of the Todis, and Rizwanurs family friend Pappu are the other accused.        
	Khan, a Trinamul Congress MLA, said he was unaware about Rizwanur naming him in the suicide note. If it is so, then why hasnt the CBI chargesheeted me? I had gone to Rizwanurs home after his marriage to Priyanka on the advice of an IPS officer, but I did not threaten anybody.         
	He also claimed that Rizwanur was murdered on September 21, 2007. I still believe its a murder case and the government is trying to shield former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and Gyanwant Singh for their role in trying to separate Rizwanur from Priyanka.        
	Singh expressed surprise when told that Rizwanur had held him morally responsible for his suicide. Is it so? I have never commented on this issue, so I am not going to say anything now, he said.        
	Saidur Rahman could not be contacted.

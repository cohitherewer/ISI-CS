The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Past cast in iron
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Past cast in iron

	During a discussion on the beauty of cast iron, artist Tapas Konar mentioned how he had stumbled upon the discs with the likenesses of double adjutant storks, that were once the emblem of the Calcutta Corporation, in two corners of a park in Alimuddin Street.         
	The street is famous as the headquarters of the political party that has ruled West Bengal for the past 30 years and a little more is located here. I entered the street that turns really narrow after a couple of yards, from its APC Road end. On the right hand side is located Royd Square, and at its other extreme is Haji Mohsin Square (formerly Wellesley) with the Tamil church behind it.        
	Ramazan having started the day before, the narrow stretch had turned into a crowded market where iftar fare was being sold. The shopkeepers around Royd Park had never seen the discs with emblem. So I walked all the way up to Wellesley, and on my way back I suddenly noticed a cast iron railing with a simple but elegant design, and at the bottom of it were two discs with the double adjutant storks.         
	The railing in front of a shanty was used to dry clothes, and behind it was a corporation school with civic staff quarters (actually a hovel) adjacent to it. Not just in front, behind the railing too were double discs facing the ones in front. Adjutant storks known as haadgila in Bengali once used to stalk the streets of this city. These scavenger birds of prodigious appetite used to flock Government House and used to stand along the terrace like statues. Hence they had found their way into the civic emblem of those times.        
	Such Raj relics made of cast iron can still be found scattered all over the city, particularly in the central districts. Water pumps with leonine heads have dried up but they still stand in front of the Accountant Generals office. A similar but a better preserved cast iron pump can be found in front of a kabbadiwalas shop in the lane in which the IFA office is located. It is concealed under a heap of garbage.

	At a time when Calcuttas tapestry of terraces is fast turning into a jagged silhouette of highrise buildings and towers, it is amazing that lamp posts and even fencing made of cast iron dating to Victorian times have survived. They are like fragments of the past that have suddenly ricocheted into the present. Many of these were forged in the Sheffield of India, as Howrah was once called. Here some iron foundries are still operational in spite of charges of these being major pollutants being brought against them.        
	At the same time tonnes of cast iron architectural features in intricate designs were imported from the UK. Even now, if one looks carefully enough one can detect balconies with Radha Krishna and Ganesh motifs all over the older sections of the city and also in newer neighbourhoods like Hindustan Park that came up in the 1930s. However many of these houses have either collapsed with age or have been demolished. And along with them their wealth of cast iron too has been scrapped.         
	Howrah foundries were so well known that manhole covers for New York streets were exclusively exported from here. In the early 1990s a Jewish sculptor named Ilan Averbuch had discovered this fact. He came all the way from New York to give shape to his cast iron sculpture inspired by the leather casks that a handful of bhistis carry in Calcutta and is suburbs. This curios piece of sculpture stands in front of City Centre in Salt Lake.        
	In Calcutta, the only man who exports cast iron balustrades, street furniture like lampposts, bollards, litter bins, signage posts and benches is T.S. Sangha, 68, a chartered engineer who is Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical and of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, UK. He says that in the UK during World War II, gates and railings were removed from churches and buildings for the war effort. During the last few years awareness has increased so much that the cast iron is being restored from photographs and samples. English Heritage is actively involved in this project.        
	Sangha took up the task of making these project-oriented products only after retirement in 1989.         
	He developed contacts with companies in the UK looking for sources outside for cost reasons. Knowing their standard of aesthetic and quality, I supplied for a number of projects, he says. To promote these objects he only depends on word of mouth and nothing more. He does not even have a website.         
	Earlier, he supplied normal engineering castings. His biggest project involved the Cathedral Church of St Philip in Birmingham. The railings, lampposts, benches and litter bins were designed to match the windows of the church. He has supplied cast iron products for Brighton, Blackpool and Clapham Common in London. These are made in Howrah but he oversees the finishing himself.        
	He says in Calcutta mostly mild steel and not cast iron is used today. This does disservice to Bengal as it is still known for its quality cast iron. Architectural concept in lacking. Every design element should be coordinated. Otherwise architectural integrity of a building is ruined.        
	Cast iron has a high carbon content. So it does not corrode or rust easily. It is brittle but lasts over a century. So it has become a byword for everything firm and unchangeable.       SOUMITRA DAS

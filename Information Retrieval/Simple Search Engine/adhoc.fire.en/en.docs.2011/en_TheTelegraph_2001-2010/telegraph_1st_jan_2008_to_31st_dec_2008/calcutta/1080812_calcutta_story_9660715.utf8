                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Home away from home for elderly 
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Shila Sinha at the Chetla home                                  
	 Words are 65-year-old Heena Basus passion. After her husbands death, she wanted to devote her time to writing. But overseeing household work kept her busy while she stayed with her son.         
	 Shila Sinha, 62, was consumed by loneliness after her husbands death. She had few relatives and no friends in hometown Behrampore and hence decided to move to Calcutta to be near her son, who is pursing his Ph.D at Jadavpur University.         
	In Kalyan Ashram, Basu and Sinha have found a place where they can live the way they want to. The two make up the inaugural batch of residents at the first old-age home opened by Helpage India in eastern part of the country.         
	The Chetla home, on the first floor of a three-storeyed building donated by a governing body member, was inaugurated in July. It has five residents and three more will move in soon.        
	We can accommodate 10 residents currently. Once we get possession of the ground floor, 20 more women can be accommodated, said Anuradha Sen, the deputy director (programmes) of Helpage India (eastern region).        
	There are library and physiotherapy facilities and round-the-clock access to a doctor apart from weekly health check-ups. The living area is like a dormitory. The residents dine together.        
	We believe in active ageing. Residents can help in preparing meals or tend to plants on the terrace, added Sen. They themselves suggested that the rooms be shared so that they are not lonely.        
	Basu, who has started contributing to journals, is very happy at Kalyan Ashram. I have found the time and the space to pursue my interests.         
	Helpage is only charging a deposit, which will be used to provide emergency medical care. The money will be refunded if the residents leave.

                A bullet was recovered by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel during a routine patrol of the airport late on Tuesday, prompting the airport authorities to beef up security. A live .303-bore cartridge was found in the western toilet in the domestic terminal lounge around 10.30pm, an airport official said on Wednesday. The CISF later handed the bullet over to airport police. A probe has been launched. It is suspected that the bearer of the bullet had dumped it in the toilet after noticing passengers being frisked by the CISF. On Monday night, a grenade and 14 bullets were found in two abandoned plastic bags at Howrah station.    The bail petition of Sutapa Bag has been rejected by the district and sessions judge of Howrah, Raghunath Roy, after it was moved by Sutapas lawyer, Shyamal Kanti Mukherjee, on Wednesday. Mukherjee prayed for bail citing Section 467, that grants women some concessions. But public prosecutor Mrinal Kanti Deb said Sutapa was the prime witness to the murder-and-suicide case of her husband, a quack, and their daughter, and also a co-accused and so, could not be granted bail.

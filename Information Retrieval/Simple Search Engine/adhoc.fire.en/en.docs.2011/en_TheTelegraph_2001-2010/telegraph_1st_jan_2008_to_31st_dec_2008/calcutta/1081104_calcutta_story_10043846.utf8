The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bumpy ride on Broadway
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bumpy ride on Broadway
                                        
	The three-km stretch of battered bitumen from the Beleghata-Bypass crossing to the Netaji statue in Salt Lake bears no resemblance to its namesake in New York  Broadway. One of the busiest gateways to the township  lined with a stadium, housing estates, hospitals, offices and a mall  the cobbled carriageway is a nightmare for commuters. Metro runs a check              
	Bumpy ride        
	Minor accidents occur almost every other day as the craters force us to slam the brakes and swerve without taking note of other vehicles, said Ravi Saha, an autorickshaw driver.        
	Drivers of cars and taxis frequenting the stretch are unanimous that it is unsafe to accelerate beyond 20 km per hour on Broadway. The traffic flow in the entire township goes haywire because of this stretch. There is mayhem after football matches at Yuvabharati Krirangan, said a resident.        
	Shubhadip Basu, an engineering student who lives in Karunamoyee, said motorcycles tend to skid on the cobbled surface which becomes dangerous during rain. While passing by the FD rotary and AMRI Hospital, I fear a big accident every day.        
	Patients woes        
	The pothole-paved thoroughfare, especially the parts near the rotaries, poses a risk to patients bound for AMRI and other hospitals on the stretch.        
	Every second is precious for critical patients. At times, the patients families tell me to speed up. But when I try to do so they ask me to slow down again as the jerks become unbearable, said Rashid Khan, who drives an ambulance.        
	Vehicle damage        
	The 63 autos that ply on the route need regular repair because of the poor condition of the road, said auto driver Rajib Saha. The surface in some parts started coming off about five months back. The situation has worsened since. We spend thrice the amount drivers on other routes spend on the upkeep of vehicles.         
	Littered sidewalks        
	Pedestrians are the worst sufferers  the thoroughfare is unsafe as vehicles swerve dangerously and the dedicated walkways are out of bounds because of garbage.        
	I loved walking down Broadway in the evening but its no longer safe. Pebbles shoot towards pedestrians as cars speed past, said 80-year-old Probal Ranjan Chowdhury of KB block.              
	Officialspeak: Nandagopal Bhattacharjee, the chairman-in-council member (road) of Bidhannagar Municipality, admitted that the road was in a sorry state. Repairs are on in full swing and should be complete by November.

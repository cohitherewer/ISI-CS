The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cameras and cops on alert
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cameras and cops on alert
                            
	The recent bomb blasts in Delhi have put the city and state police on high alert for the pujas. The puja committees, too, are taking special security measures.         
	We are stepping up vigil in view of the blasts in other cities. We will deploy more men, both in uniform and plainclothes, said Sujoy Chanda, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar, who supervises Lake Town thana.         
	The cops are on their toes, briefing puja committees on the dos and donts during an emergency and inspecting security arrangements.         
	The big-budget pujas have been asked to instal CCTVs. We have asked all puja committees to give us a list of volunteers. Officers from police stations are guiding the volunteers on what to do with unclaimed objects and how to tackle strangers loitering around the pandal for too long, said P.K. Ghosh, the deputy commissioner of police, north.         
	Most of the crowd-puller pujas of north Calcutta have drawn up elaborate security plans. Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durga Puja has got 10 CCTVs to monitor the pandal, along with a 24-hour vigil by private security guards.        
	College Square Sarbojanin, one of the top draws in north Calcutta, will have four CCTVs as opposed to two last year. Apart from the main gate opposite Calcutta University and the VIP entrance on Bankim Chatterjee Street, all the gates of College Square will be sealed. The emergency exit towards Surya Sen Street will be manned by volunteers and the police.         
	As Sealdah station is pretty close, we have a huge crowd every year. But we have a police camp inside College Square to monitor the situation, said committee secretary Bikash Mazumdar.        
	Apart from installing four CCTVs, Sreebhumi Sporting Club, one of the biggest pujas on VIP Road, has increased the number of security guards to 100 from last years 70. Thirty of them will be on constant vigil, while 70 will help control the crowd. There will be constant monitoring at the parking zones to ensure that no car is parked for too long, said Jyotirmoy Bakshi, the secretary of Sreebhumi Sporting Club.         
	The smaller pujas are also doing their bit. Though only 22 years old, Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha has carved a niche with its gimmicky themes. To manage the crowd surge this year, the puja committee has increased the number of volunteers to 180 from 80 last year. An NCC scout group will also be deployed.                    JHINUK MAZUMDAR

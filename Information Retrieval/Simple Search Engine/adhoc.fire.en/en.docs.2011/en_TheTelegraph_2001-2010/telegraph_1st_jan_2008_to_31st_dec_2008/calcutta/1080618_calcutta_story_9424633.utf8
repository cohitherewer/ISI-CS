The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apathy adds to anguish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apathy adds to anguish
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rainy seasons come and go but the waterlogging woes of Behala and Thakurpukur persist. This year has been no exception, courtesy inaction by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, incomplete projects and shallow canals.         
	The worst affected of the two areas, made up of 18 civic wards, are Surya Sen Nagar, Pramod Nagar, Shyama Pally, Kazi Para, Indira Devi Road, Parnasree, Sil Para, Narayan Roy Road, Sagar Manna Road and Rabindra Nagar.        
	We were so distressed by the prospect of waterlogging that we could not sleep last night after it started to rain. By morning, there was knee-deep water around our house, said Rinku Naskar, a Kazipara resident who could not go to office on Tuesday.        
	The only way we could go out was by hiring a rickshaw. We had to pay at least Rs 30 to travel half a kilometre, said Rajiv Bhattacharya, a resident of Sil Para.         
	At the crossing of Diamond Harbour Road and SN Roy Road, mud had been heaped in the middle of the road by Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) workers. The rain made the entire area slushy. Ratna Sur, the chairperson of Borough XIII, said: The CEIP authorities did not bother to finish the work before monsoon despite repeated requests.        
	The CEIP authorities blamed the shallow Calcutta Port Trust canal for the waterlogging.        
	Sekhar Basu, a Parnasree resident, also said the area gets waterlogged as the canals had not been dredged by the irrigation department.

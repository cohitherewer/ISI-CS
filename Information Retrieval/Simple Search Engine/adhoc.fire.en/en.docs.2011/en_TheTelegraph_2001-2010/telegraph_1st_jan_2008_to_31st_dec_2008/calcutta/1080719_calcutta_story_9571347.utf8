	Classroom lessons for students of Calcutta International School (CIS) goes beyond the chalk-and-talk method. Working in collaboration with College Marx Dormoy in Paris, the two institutions publish French magazines every year and exchange it between themselves.         
	We teach an international curriculum and we do not believe in keeping education restricted to text books. There is a lot of difference between gathering information from the Internet and acquiring knowledge. In order to make our students knowledgeable we try to initiate them into such projects, says Anuradha Das, principal of CIS.         
	French is the second language here, compulsory for classes III to VIII. Le Miroir (the mirror) is an eight-page magazine published by the students of Class VIII while their counterparts in Paris publish Calcupar.         
	This years theme for Le Miroir is the French influence in India. From writing articles, drawing pictures to designing the pages, the students have done it all, taking care of every detail.        
	The magazine describes through comic strips how and when the French came to India, short profiles on people like Aurangzeb, Jahangir, Francis-I, Louis-XIV and write ups on French colonies in India like Pondicherry, Surat, Chandannagar and Mahe and why the French left India.         
	The students have also added a fun page with quizzes and jumble birds to test the readers. We started this project three years ago and when Rosine Hamel of College Marx Dormoy visited Calcutta. Both of us were interested in forging a stronger bond among the students, says Chai Eng Dutta, the French teacher at the school and in charge of magazines.         
	The concept is to have a cultural exchange between the two nations, she added.         
	The theme of the magazine is decided around September, and the students begin working on it right away. They are divided into groups with the language head, layout head, art head and chief editor chosen from among them. Every student of Class VIII is involved in the project, which meant 40 of them this time.         
	The topic being historical, their history teacher briefed them about the period. The final layout was done after the annual examinations and the magazine will be sent across to Paris around end of July. The CIS students will receive their copy Calcupar from Paris around September. Work for the magazine was spiced up with a trip to Chandannagar where the students got a taste of the erstwhile French influence. Besides exchanging magazines the students from the two countries have established a personal bond. They correspond with each other through letters, writing about their hobbies and campus life.        
	It was fun to combine history with French. A trip to Chandannagar helped the children to get an idea of the French architecture and incorporate it in our magazine, quot; says Ashvika Dalmia.         
	We have drawn pictures of monuments made by the French and also sketched kings of the period. We have designed the cover page with the pictures of Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower, with the flags of the two nations in the background symbolising unity, says Smita Chowdhury, one of the art heads.

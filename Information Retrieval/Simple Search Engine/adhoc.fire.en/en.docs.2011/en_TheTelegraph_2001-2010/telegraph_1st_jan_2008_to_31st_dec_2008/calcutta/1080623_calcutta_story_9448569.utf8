The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pension plan goes for a toss
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pension plan goes for a toss
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Himanshu Shekhar Das and daughter Sanjukta at their Bansdroni home. Das, who is a retired professional, is finding it difficult to curtail expenses. Picture by Malini Banerjee                                  
	Himanshu Shekhar Das has given up his habit of shopping for the week. The retired professional now visits the market daily, which, he believes, turns out cheaper.         
	Buying in larger volumes inevitably transforms into spending more and also waste. We have stopped storing vegetables and other food items. So I go to the market every morning, said Das, who retired from ITC last April.         
	A resident of Bansdroni, Das draws a monthly pension of Rs 22,000, which he had thought would be enough to meet the expenses of his three-member family, including wife Swapna and daughter Sanjukta. Sohini, his elder daughter, lives in Mumbai.         
	My income has become one-third of what it used to be. Before retiring, I used to think that my pension would be sufficient to meet our monthly expenses. But with prices rising, I am finding it difficult to balance my budget, Das said.         
	Asked if cutting wastage was a solution, he said there was no escaping the price spiral. The prices of basic things like cooking oil, rice, vegetables, cooking gas and even poppy seeds have gone up. How can one curtail expenses?        
	Dass monthly expenditure on bare essentials  food, conveyance, healthcare, electricity and phone  has shot up to Rs 18,000 in the past few months despite several belt-tightening measures.         
	The retired ITC executive has had to heavily reduce his travel expenses. Earlier, he would travel only in taxis or hired cars, but has now started using public transport.         
	Now that I have retired, I dont have to travel much Even when we do, we use public transport to save as much as we can, Das said.         
	The one thing he cannot compromise on is his medical expenses, which have increased along with his age. On an average, I spend more than Rs 2,000 on healthcare for myself and my family. I cannot cut down on that, he said.         
	Das is also finding it difficult to economise on electricity and telephone. The monthly electricity bill is around Rs 800, and he spends around Rs 2,600 on the telephone landline and the cellphones that he and his family use.         
	Sanjukta took up a job last month after completing her studies, but has yet to get her first salary.         
	With a reasonable nest egg, Das can balance the mismatch between monthly income and expenses by drawing from his savings. But the fact that his calculations have gone wrong upsets him.         
	I made my plans two years before I retired. But I could never imagine that Rs 22,000 a month would not be enough, he said, wondering what people with lower incomes were doing.         
	Inflation hurts everyone, but it affects the salaried class the most. Among them, the retired people are the worst sufferers as their earnings dont increase. So, their ability to buy goods continues to decline as prices rise, said Anindya Sen, professor of economics at IIM Calcutta.

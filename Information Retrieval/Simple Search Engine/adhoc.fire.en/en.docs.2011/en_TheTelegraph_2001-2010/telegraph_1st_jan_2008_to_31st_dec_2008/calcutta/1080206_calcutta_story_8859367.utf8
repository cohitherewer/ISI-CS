The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pedestrians hold up traffic
                                                                                                            Pedestrians hold up traffic
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          Vehicles crawl along VIP Road. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Traffic snarls on VIP Road are set to continue with no sign of the promised footbridges at Kestopur and Baguiati.         
	Shortage of trained policemen and modern traffic lights have worsened the problem. Snarls extending half a kilometre or more are now a common sight on the citys primary link to the airport.         
	We are worried at the manner in which traffic is coming to a standstill on the busy road. The advertising agencies, which are to build the footbridges, havent even decided when the work will be started. We have met the police, advertising agencies and the PWD several times, without any result, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. The project was to start in January 2008.         
	On an average, nearly 1,200 people cross Baguiati and nearly 800 people cross Kestopur in an hour during the peak period. We are forced to stop vehicles to allow people to cross the road, resulting in traffic jams, said a police officer manning the stretch.         
	Absence of stop lines and timer-based lights make traffic control difficult. Two men are needed to operate each of the manual lights, straining the resources of the department short on manpower.        
	People obey traffic lights only if there is an officer on the road. If we are in the signal room, motorists flout rules causing snarls, added the policeman.         
	Local residents cite other problems. People dont want to wait several minutes to cross the road and violate the traffic rules. We have also noticed that vehicles are stopped by the cops when a group of people get down on the carriageway, said Bela Basu, an elderly resident of Baguiati.        
	Allowing vehicles to make a u-turn at Kestopur is a mistake by the police, according to the residents. Each car holds up several vehicles at the crossing while turning around. Autorickshaws and rickshaws parked on the road make the process difficult, said another resident of the area.

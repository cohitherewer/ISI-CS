          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The cloud over Satyajit Rays Sikkim has darkened, with three days of the 14th Calcutta Film Festival to go.        
	Nandan sources said on Friday that the screening of Rays last unreleased film was uncertain as the Indian governments no-objection certificate was still awaited.        
	We cannot screen Sikkim unless the central government gives us a clearance certificate, said the Nandan CEO and festival director, Nilanjan Chatterjee.        
	The American Center, which has procured a DVD of Sikkim from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles and obtained a clearance certificate from the Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim, is waiting to hear from Nandan.        
	Nandan hasnt informed us about the screening yet. They are supposed to get the no-objection certificate from the government, said Douglas G. Kelly, the American Center director.        
	The Indian government and the Sikkim monarchy had banned the 60-minute documentary that Ray had shot in 1971.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Many risks in mishap zone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Many risks in mishap zone
                                          
	Two persons were killed and eight were critically injured in seven accidents between Taratala and Thakurpukur on Diamond Harbour Road in November. In the last week of September, two persons died and as many were critically injured when an autorickshaw was sandwiched between two private buses near Behala police station.        
	Residents blame rash driving on the stretch, which has been widened over the past three years, for the mishaps. Police, on the other hand, want pedestrians to be more cautious. Metro tours the stretch to identify the problems.        
	Auto menace        
	More than 400 autorickshaws ply on different routes on the stretch daily. Residents said the autos generally carried more than four persons, drove rashly and took U-turn where it was prohibited.        
	An autorickshaw recently rammed into a middle-aged trader, who fell head first on a stone and died before he could be taken to hospital, said Saibal Hajra, the owner of a stationery shop at Behala Manton, near which the mishap took place on November 18.         
	Pedestrian woes        
	Footpaths are inaccessible to pedestrians between Taratala and Behala Chowrasta. From Taratala to Pathakpara, illegal shanties occupy the footpaths on the west. Shops have encroached on the footpaths between No. 14 bus stand and Manton, forcing pedestrians to walk along the thoroughfare.        
	Shops and roadside stalls keep their wares on the footpath. We have no option but to walk down the thoroughfare, alongside vehicles, said 42-year-old homemaker Anuradha Goswami. She claimed to have been hit by autos and rickshaws several times while walking down the throughfare.        
	Driving in the dark        
	The stretch has enough traffic signals as well as street lights but most of them are out of order. For example, the traffic signals in front of the Behala end of Taratala flyover, the ODRC housing estate and Ajanta cinema hall do not work. Empty police kiosks and booths also are a common sight.        
	The stretch has become hazardous after it was widened. Accidents have become a daily affair due to lack of policemen, said Pulak Halder, a resident of SN Roy Road. Home guards are posted at the intersections at times but the drivers hardly listen to them.        
	Parking hurdle        
	According to transport department officials, the average speed of vehicles as they descend from the Taratala flyover is above 65kmph. Illegal parking and protruding tram tracks pose a major threat to fast-moving vehicles.        
	Tram tracks were to be uprooted from the stretch after the Taratala flyover was constructed, but in many places, they were simply covered with pitch. The surface has worn off with time leaving the tracks exposed.        
	I had skidded on a protruding tram track last week, said Dinesh Agarwal, who owns a cellphone shop in the area and commutes by motorcycle.        
	Repairs on the stretch have raised the height of the thoroughfare above that of the unmetalled road on the side. Small vehicles often overturn while moving off the thoroughfare.         
	Official version        
	We have received complaints regarding illegal parking and rash driving by auto drivers. Once pipeline installation under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project is completed in the next four months, we will handle matters, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade.        
	A senior officer of the traffic department of state police voiced helplessness saying that more than half the traffic constable posts were vacant.                    TAMAGHNA BANERJEE

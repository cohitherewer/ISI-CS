The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One-stop civic cell for senior citizens
                                                                                                            One-stop civic cell for senior citizens
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	Senior citizens of Calcutta will soon get one-stop centres to avail themselves of civic services in homely comfort.        
	All services that do not require verification of records at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters will be delivered from the centres, being set up as part of the e-Calcutta project.        
	The first e-Calcutta outlet  in Business Tower, at 206 AJC Bose Road  is likely to be commissioned by March, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. Fourteen more are in the pipeline.        
	You can call it a spin-off effect of the capacity building programme and e-governance being carried out in the CMC with funds from the British governments department for international development, said the mayor.        
	The centres will be air-conditioned and senior citizens can rest on couches and watch TV while civic officials attend to their problems. They will also be served tea.        
	Mutation forms, birth and death certificates, revenue clearance certificates and duplicate demand notices of property tax will be available from the outlets.        
	The beneficiaries can also get their mailing address changed on submission of residence proof and mutation-related queries answered.        
	For the inaugural centre, to come up on 1,000 sq ft in the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project office, we will install dedicated elevators for the senior citizens, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.         
	We dont want them to stand in queues for elevators or climb up the stairs, he added.        
	Nearly 18 per cent of the 1,5000-odd people who come to the CMC headquarters or borough offices are aged. They find it inconvenient to move from one official to another to get their work done. The single-stop centres have been planned keeping this in mind, said an official.        
	There is another problem. Some of the departments that deal directly with the public  like assessment, revenue and building  are not located on the ground floor.         
	Since the CMC headquarters does not have enough elevators, many visitors are forced to climb up the stairs to reach the offices.

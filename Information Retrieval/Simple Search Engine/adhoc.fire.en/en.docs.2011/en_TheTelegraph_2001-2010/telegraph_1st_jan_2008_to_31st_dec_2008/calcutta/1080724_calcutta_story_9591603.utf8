                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citu prevents auto raid
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A car fitted with an illegal LPG kit. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Nearly a thousand Citu activists stopped transport officials from booking illegal autorickshaws in Salt Lake on Wednesday in the second such incident in less than a week.        
	Around 10am, after the team from the regional transport authority had caught two autorickshaws, a large group of youths claiming to be supporters of the CPM-affiliated union descended on the Punjab National Bank island led by their leader Soumen Chakrabarty.        
	We had booked 33 vehicles for failing to produce documents for plying on the road. Some people disrupted our work but we still managed to continue our raids by rotation in different parts of the township, said C.K. Banerjee, the regional transport officer of North 24 Parganas.        
	An official said they had received complaints that nearly 4,000 of the about 10,000 autorickshaws operating between Salt Lake and Ultadanga, Phoolbagan and Kankurgachhi did not have licences.         
	The team was forced to stop checking autorickshaws as more and more Citu activists gathered at the spot, demanding that the officials should not seize any vehicle as they were conducting the raids without informing the union.         
	Chakraborty said: We are not against booking autorickshaws but the officials are doing this without giving any time. Many families are dependent on the income from autorickshaws. So we need some time to streamline the entire process. Till then we cannot allow our members to get booked and their vehicles to be seized.        
	Last week, over 100 autorickshaw drivers blocked Prince Anwar Shah Road in the south and pelted a depot where seized vehicles had been kept with stones after a similar raid.        
	The raids follow an order from the high court to crack down on unauthorised autorickshaws.        
	A transport official confirmed being told by Chakrabarty not to book unlicensed autorickshaws. When we insisted that we cannot allow illegal three-wheelers to ply they gheraoed us, preventing us from checking the vehicles.         
	The district secretary of the autorickshaw union, A. Dutta, did not support the action by the supporters. We will not allow this in future as we too want to remove illegal autorickshaws, Dutta said.        
	The transport team cancelled the fitness certificates of eight of the booked vehicles. Even some doctors were found riding vehicles without the necessary documents. When we stopped them they too tried to use their influence, said an official.

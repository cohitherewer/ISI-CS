The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Todi denied bail in SC
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Todi denied bail in SC
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The Supreme Court on Friday refused to grant bail to Ashok Todi. The prime accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case was asked to serve notice on the respondents and move a fresh plea on January 6.        
	The court refused to hear the plea ex-parte. Todi had moved the apex court after being denied bail by Calcutta High Court on Wednesday.        
	Appearing for Todi in the apex court, lawyer Mukul Rohtagi highlighted the difference of opinion between the two judges of a high court division bench on granting bail to Todi.        
	The case was referred to a third bench.        
	While denying bail to his client, Rohtagi submitted, the high court had ignored the fact that the apex court had stayed trial in the case till a petition challenging the legality of the CBIs chargesheet against him was disposed of.        
	The apex court has rightly decided to hear the case in our presence. We will oppose the petition, said Kalyan Banerjee, the lawyer for the Rahmans.        
	In the high court, Rizwanurs mother and elder brother moved a petition before Justice Dipankar Datta seeking an order directing the state to allow the CBI to prosecute the three accused police officers on the charge of abetment to suicide.        
	Rahmans family claimed that the state had only allowed the CBI to proceed with the charge of criminal conspiracy and criminal intimation against the cops. The judge did not hear the case on personal grounds and sent it to the chief justice for reassignment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bail for Kaushik, but not for Sabitri
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bail for Kaushik, but not for Sabitri
  - Domestic help gets 14-day jail remand in terror mail case           A STAFF REPORTER                            Kaushik Basu and Sabitri Dandapat                                       
	Terror mail accused Kaushik Basu returned home to wife and newborn child on Wednesday after a month behind bars but no such luck for co-accused Sabitri Dandapat, the domestic help with an Orkut account.        
	Sabitri has to remain in judicial custody for at least 14 more days, though there is no known evidence yet of her having had anything to do with the emailed bomb warning that sent police on a wild goose chase on July 29. The reasonably computer-proficient Class VIII dropout has to spend more time in jail simply because she was in charge of the cyber caf from where the mail was sent.        
	Looking weary, the first words that caf owner Kaushik uttered in front of the media after coming out of the chief metropolitan magistrates court were: I am innocent.        
	He did not say whether Sabitri was innocent, too, but members of his family said they would soon move another bail application on their domestic helps behalf. The past month has been a nightmare. I cannot explain how horrible this phase of my life has been. I have not even seen my newborn baby properly, Kaushik, an MBA, said.         
	Father Asim Ghosh said he always knew that his son was innocent. We have lost our social reputation. I dont know how my son can put behind the damage caused by his arrest.         
	Kaushiks wife Malini, who had been staying with her parents for some time, returned to her house in Salt Lakes IA block on hearing that her husband had been granted bail.        
	The court has asked Kaushik to meet the investigating officer whenever summoned and submit a bail bond of Rs 5,000. His and Sabitris lawyer, Bishnu Charan Ghosh, had argued that not a shred of evidence had been found against them to justify the charge of waging war against the state. Public prosecutor Ashok Bakshi opposed the bail petitions by saying the accused needed to be constantly interrogated for the truth to emerge.        
	Sabitri has told the police that a youth in his mid-20s had visited the cyber caf after a gap of three months around the time the email was sent. Police have yet to trace him.

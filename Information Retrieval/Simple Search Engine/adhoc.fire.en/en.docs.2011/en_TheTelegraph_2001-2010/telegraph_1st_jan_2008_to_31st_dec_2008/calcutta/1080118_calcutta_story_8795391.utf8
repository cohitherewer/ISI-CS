     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Mohammad Shamim Akhtar, the alleged ISI agent arrested on Tuesday, is said to have recruited a Border Security Force (BSF) head constable now posted in North Bengal.
    
	The constable, identified but not yet arrested, had reportedly leaked information to Shamim about the strength of his force in various camps.
    
	This is the first time we have come to know that a person from the BSF has joined hands with jehadis. It shows the ISIs level of penetration, said a CID official, who refused to name the head constable.
    
	Akhtar spoke about his operations, including the recruitments he had made, during a 10-hour grilling at the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan, the sleuth added.
    
	Akhtar, 48, reportedly told the sleuths that he had recruited the head constable when he was posted in Malda. He is now in north Bengal. We hope to track him down in a day or two, said another CID official.
    
	Investigations revealed that Akhtar had also recruited an officer of the Indian Navy, K.S. Singh, who was arrested three years ago in Varanasi.
    
	Akhtar and Alam Abdul Malik, alias Alamgir, both alleged activists of Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami, were arrested in Howrahs Shalimar by the CIDs Special Operation Group.
    
	The sleuths managed to track them down with the help of a retired CRPF jawan, Arabinda Biswas, who met the duo while looking for a job in Bangladesh.
    
	Biswas started suspecting Shamim and Alam after they quizzed him about the deployment of Indian security forces, including the army.
    
	Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector general of CID, said: It seems Akhtar and Alam had recruited a number of agents in and around the city.

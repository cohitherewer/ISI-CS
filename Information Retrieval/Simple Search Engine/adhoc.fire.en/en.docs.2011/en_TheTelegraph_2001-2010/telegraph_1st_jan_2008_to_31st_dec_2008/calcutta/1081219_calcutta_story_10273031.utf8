                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ramp plan put on hold
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police have developed cold feet about traffic diversions on AJC Bose Road for the construction of a ramp on the citys longest flyover.        
	The timeline for the project had been fixed at 160 days and copies of the alternate bus routes were distributed on Wednesday.         
	But on Thursday morning, senior officials realised that keeping the AJC Bose Road stretch between Loudon Street and Theatre Road off-limits for buses and also for cars in times of congestion would affect students during exams in March-April. So the ramp project has been put on hold.

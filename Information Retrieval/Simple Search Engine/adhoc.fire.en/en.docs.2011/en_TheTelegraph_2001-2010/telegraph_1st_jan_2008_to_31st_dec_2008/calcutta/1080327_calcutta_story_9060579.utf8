                                                                                                               CU eyes fee hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is set to increase the tuition and other fees in both postgraduate and undergraduate courses.        
	Fees to be collected from postgraduate and undergraduate students in the current academic year are expected to meet about 9.15 per cent of the total expected expenditure. Against this backdrop, a general feeling is in favour of enhancement of fees, pro vice-chancellor (finance) Tapan Kumar Mukherjee said, while tabling the budget proposals in the senate meeting on Wednesday.        
	The fees set to be hiked include tuition, examination, registration and review.        
	The tuition fees, last raised around 10 years ago, vary between Rs 50 and Rs 125 a month.         
	Mukherjee also urged the Centre to bear the rising cost of higher education.         
	According to the budget statement, the university expects an expenditure of Rs 1428,454,100 in 2008-09.        
	We hope to raise Rs 191,854,600 from our own resources, he said. Tuition fees will account for Rs 32,400,000, examination fees for Rs 87,300,000, and registration and migration fees Rs 14,500,000. Proceeds from the sales counter and other miscellaneous receipts are likely to be Rs 20,400,000 and Rs 29,350,800, respectively.        
	Mukherjee regretted that the funds provided to the universitys faculty members for research is incredibly low.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Non-teaching staff of Lady Brabourne College tried to disrupt work on Tuesday after taking offence at the principals alleged directive to the accounts section not to release their months wages until the teachers salary bill was ready.        
	Some non-teaching employees owing allegiance to the Citu-affiliated West Bengal State Government Employees Federation laid siege to the office of principal Sanghamitra Mukherjee on hearing that she had asked the accounts section not to open the cash counter till it completed the teachers bill. The employees called in leaders from the CPMs district committee to add muscle to the protest.         
	The authorities, however, remained firm and refused to open the cash counter until the salary statements of the teachers were ready.        
	The siege continued till 3pm, by which time the accounts section completed the work and started paying the non-teaching employees.        
	Mukherjee said later that she was not gheraoed. There was some confusion among the employees as I had to take a step to check negligence of duty by a section of the staff.         
	Sanatan Chatterjee, one of the employees involved in the protest, said the teachers dues could not be cleared on Tuesday because of an error in the salary bill. The staff of the wage section were working hard since morning with the salary statements of the teachers so that the payments could be cleared by the bank by Wednesday. The authorities had no right to stop our pay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Browse amp; buy: Netizen now means business
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Browse amp; buy: Netizen now means business
  - Paying bills and booking tickets, planning holidays and insuring life dominate online habits in town          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	If we indeed are what we seek, the Calcutta Netizen has emerged as driven rather than doodling, professional rather than political, utilitarian rather than Utopian.        
	The Google Zeitgeist 2008 report for Calcutta  an examination of the fastest rising and highest volume search terms on the web  shows Calcutta Telephones replacing Calcutta, INOX scoring over Mithun Chakraborty, Mandarmani substituting Nandigram.        
	The top 10 things Calcutta was Googling for this year are Calcutta Telephones, the list of colleges in Bengal, induna.com (an online shopping site for Indian DVDs, VCDs and audio CDs), air pollution pictures, mobile video download, INOX Calcutta, Mandarmani, Public Service Commission of West Bengal, West Bengal Tourism, and Life Insurance Corporation of India. This marks a significant shift from Calcutta, literature, Nandigram, Orkut, Durga Puja and Mithun dominating Googles city search list in 2007.        
	Localised content and utility are clearly gaining importance for Netizens here, says Vinay Goel, the product head of Google India, acknowledging the emergence of the mature Net user in Calcutta.        
	Suranjan Banerjee, a 30-year-old techie with Wipro, represents a growing breed of Netizens who log in with a purpose, to browse and buy. I always book movie tickets online. Its convenient, hassle-free and you dont have to wait in a queue, says Banerjee.        
	That the Calcutta Netizen means business is evident from the spurt in online payment of telephone bills and web searches for holiday destinations. Before going on a vacation, I research, plan and book on the Net. Travel sites have replaced travel agents, says 26-year-old Angela Gomes, a teacher in Calcutta Girls High School.        
	The cautious Calcuttan ensures that life insurance features on the fastest-finger list, while the mobile-obsessed Calcuttan explains the demand for downloads.        
	Different people find different things to do on the web, so this list is a good representation of the unique ways in which users mine the Internet, says Goel.

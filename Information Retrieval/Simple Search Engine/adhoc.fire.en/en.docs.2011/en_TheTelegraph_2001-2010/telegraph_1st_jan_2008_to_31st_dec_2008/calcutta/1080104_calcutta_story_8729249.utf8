           ...And then God created man
          For close to one-and-a-half centuries, the Prinsep Memorial has stood regally on the banks of the river Ganga  a mute witness to the changing times. It has witnessed bloodshed, birth of a nation, death, decay and destruction. The memorial itself was on the brink of destruction until INTACH took notice of this edifice and decided to restore its glory. With the help of HSBC and PWD, the project is over and now two veteran dancers, the citys own Priti Patel and B. Bhanumati from Bangalore will premiere two dance productions around a specific theme, Leisemba  Creation of Earth, Heaven and Man. Patels production in Manipuri style (picture right) is inspired from ancient Manipuri manuscripts, Pudhu and Leithak Leikhrof. The ballet tells the story of time immemorial when the universal God, Guru Atiya Sidaba, asked his eldest son Asiba to create heaven and earth...the first sound...the first light. Battling against the evil forces of darkness, Asiba succeeded in fulfilling his fathers order with the help of the goddess of lightening, Nongthangleia. Bhanumati traces mans journey of turbulence and peace in Bharata Natyam style, and her piece is inspired by renowned poet Jayshankar Prasads acclaimed Hindi epic, Kamayani. The epic is based on the vedic literature and traces the rise, fall and resurrection of man in the form of Manu, aided by his wife, Shraddha. The cultural festival will be hosted by HSBC and Anjika.

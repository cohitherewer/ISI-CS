The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU to roll out biotechnology course
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU to roll out biotechnology course
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is set to introduce a five-year undergraduate course in biotechnology, possibly from this academic year.        
	Only St Xaviers College, an autonomous institution, now offers a five-year undergraduate course in the subject in Calcutta.        
	The demand for biotechnology courses is increasing by the year. We will soon identify the colleges where an undergraduate course in the subject can be started, preferably from this year, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	CUs science faculty council will meet next week to finalise the criteria that a college needs to fulfil to start the course.        
	The colleges that have the required infrastructure can apply for approval to start the course. The university will then send inspection teams to the colleges. Based on the inspection report, we will decide whether a college can be allowed to start the course, said an official.        
	A college lacking in infrastructure cannot run a fullfledged biotechnology course, which calls for an in-depth study of physics, chemistry, mathematics and biological sciences. Hence, the stress on infrastructure, said vice-chancellor Das.        
	Biotechnology has emerged as one of the most sought-after subjects as it offers a wide range of job opportunities in India and abroad.        
	Since there was no scope for studying the subject in Calcutta, students used to flock to cities outside the state where three-year undergraduate courses in biotechnology were started in 2001.        
	To stop the braindrain, CU had decided to a introduce a five-year undergraduate course in the subject. The approval from the University Grants Commission came in 2005 and St Xaviers was the only college that introduced the course.        
	But the college has since been declared an autonomous institution and is no longer a CU affiliate.        
	CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay ruled out introducing a three-year course in biotechnology, as that would not be in conformity with the state governments policy.        
	A government panel on biotechnology education has stated that a three-year course would not do justice to the subject, which includes exhaustive study of all science disciplines.

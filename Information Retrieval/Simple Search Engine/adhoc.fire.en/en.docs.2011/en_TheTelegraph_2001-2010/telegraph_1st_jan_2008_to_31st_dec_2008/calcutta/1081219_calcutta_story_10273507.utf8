                      History of Bengali stage songs                    Founded in 1984, the primary objective of Academy Theatre is to undertake research of the history of the Bengali stage, with special reference to its music. Through this, it aims to revive interest in allied performing arts and generate awareness among people through productions, publications and preservations. To be presented this evening as part of Academy Theatres four-day festival beginning today, Babu Kolkatar Mancha Gaan is a compilation of Bengali theatre songs of the 19th and 20th centuries. True to Indian tradition, this form of music has its roots in primitive rituals and ceremonies. Since the late 18th century, the popular culture of colonial Calcutta centered around the stage with its variety of dramatic performances like geetika (ballad), jatra (opera) and geeti-natak (musical), patronised by the babus and their coterie. Performed mainly by nautch girls, who were singers, dancers and entertainers to their audience, they created a rich legacy of music and theatre. Todays programme will attempt to portray the trend of mucial compositions of that era when babu culture dominated and nautch girls vehicled a socio-cultural drive with their performances. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and Devajit Bandyopadhyay (songs) and Soumitra Chattopadhyay (narration). Direction: Devajit Bandyopadhyay.

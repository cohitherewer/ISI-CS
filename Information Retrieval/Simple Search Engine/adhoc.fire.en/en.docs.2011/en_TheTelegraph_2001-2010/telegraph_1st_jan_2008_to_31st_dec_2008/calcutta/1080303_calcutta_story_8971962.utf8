	An eight-year-old stealing a ride on his new bicycle was crushed under the wheels of a truck in Parnashree, Behala, on Sunday morning.        
	Rohan Das, who studied in Class II in a local school, was gifted the cycle by his father Akshay Das a month ago.        
	The boy was riding the bicycle on Upen Banerjee Road near his home when he was hit by the truck (WB41/C7123) around 11.30am.        
	Rohan returned home from drawing school around 10am. After munching on some snacks, he asked his mother Mita if he could go out for a bicycle ride. She scolded him and told him to remain indoors. The boy slipped out as soon as she got busy with household chores.        
	We had repeatedly asked Rohan not to cycle on the road as trucks ply along it at breakneck speed. But he did not listen to us and we could not keep an eye on him, said Rohans cousin Kakali.        
	I last saw him watching TV around 11.20am. Twenty minutes later, a neighbour rushed to our house and said that Rohan had met with an accident and had been taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, she added.        
	Rabi Singh, who witnessed the mishap, said: The truck was speeding along. Rohan saw it and moved to the side of the road, but the vehicle still hit him. His skull was crushed.         
	The truck driver tried to flee but was caught by pedestrians. He and his help were beaten up and the vehicle was damaged. The mob refused to hand over the duo to the police, unless steps were taken to curb reckless driving in the locality. The Rapid Action Force had to be called in to restore order.        
	Trucks drive dangerously on the road. Despite repeated requests, the authorities have not done anything, said Singh.        
	We have convened a meeting to discuss the setting up of speed-breakers on the road and step up vigilance, said D.P. Singh, the additional superintendent (south industrial) of South 24-Parganas.

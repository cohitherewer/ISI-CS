The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shut order on blaze shop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shut order on blaze shop

	The Haldiram outlet at the Exide crossing, which has remained closed since it caught fire last Wednesday, cannot be reopened for the next seven days, the high court has ruled.        
	Justice Indira Banerjee issued the order on Monday following a petition filed by Haldiram owner Mahesh Agrawal seeking permission to reopen the shop.        
	Agrawal had claimed that though he had a valid licence, the fire services department was not allowing him to reopen the shop. But the judge, after hearing out the lawyers representing police and the fire department, turned down Agrawals plea.        
	You have no authority to re-open the outlet for the next seven days, till the inquiry into the fire is complete and the fire brigade authorities allow resumption of business, the judge said.        
	The Wednesday morning blaze started in a room on the mezzanine floor, which the fire department said had been built illegally, and spread to the adjoining godown.        
	The room on the mezzanine floor was stacked with inflammable articles, including plywood cartons. Six tenders took more than six hours to douse the blaze.        
	The fire services department lodged an FIR with Shakespeare Sarani police station, following which the food licence of the outlet was cancelled. The owner was asked to get a no-objection certificate from the fire services department before applying for renewal of the food licence.        
	On Monday, forensic experts led by Dhurjyoti Sengupta, the director of the state forensic science laboratory, visited the shop and collected samples from the fire-scarred parts.        
	Once the samples are analysed, we will be able to say how the fire broke out, said Sengupta.         
	Police said a team from CESC would soon visit the outlet to carry out a probe. The power utility, too, will submit a report on the blaze.

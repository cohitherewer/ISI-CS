                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fatal run to sons luggage
  - 66-year-old mother from Singur among terror victims          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Meera Chatterjee                                        
	The deafening sound of a blast sent all scurrying for cover on platform 13 of Mumbais Victoria Terminus around 9.30pm on Wednesday.        
	But Meera Chatterjee could not fight back her mothers instinct and rushed towards her sons luggage that was lying abandoned. The 66-year-old from Singur was felled by a terrorists bullet before she could reach the spot.         
	As the panic subsided and the air cleared, police took her to a nearby railway hospital where she was declared dead.         
	Meera had gone to Mumbai one-and-a-half months ago to help elder son Ardhendu pack his bags and return home.         
	Meeras younger son Purnendu was inconsolable. Speaking from Mumbai on Thursday afternoon, he said his mother would still have been alive had she not decided to accompany Ardhendu back to Mumbai on October 3. The elder son then had come to Singur to perform tarpan for his father.         
	Ardhendu, 45, had decided to leave Singurs Apurbapur and try his luck in the countrys commercial capital 30 years ago. We are a poor family and we dont own any land. Thats why dada left home at a tender age and look for a job in Mumbai, Purnendu said.        
	Ardhendu was employed by a steel factory as a labourer. But the factory closed down after 15 years, forcing the youth to move to Thane, around 40 km from Mumbai, where he earned a meagre living as a priest.                           
	 quot; Dada was thinking of coming back home to Singur ever since our father, who was a farm labourer, died two years ago, quot; Purnendu recalled.               
	He asked Meera to accompany him to Mumbai to help him and wife Sabita with the packing. Purnendu, too, had gone to Mumbai on November 16.               
	 quot;We were supposed to take the Gitanjali Express today. Since the train leaves Victoria Terminus at 6am and its difficult to commute from my brothers home so early, we decided to spend the night at the station, quot; Purnendu said. The Chatterjees left Thane at five in the evening and reached the station a little after 7pm.               
	 quot;Leaving mother and sister-in-law at the station to look after our bags, I and dada left for Thane to bring the rest of our luggage, quot; Purnendu recounted.               
	It was while returning to Victoria Terminus on a local train around 10.15pm that Sabita called Ardhendu and informed the brothers about the tragedy.               
	 quot;We rushed to the railway hospital to find our mother dead, quot; Purnendu said.               
	Till late on Thursday, the Chatterjees were waiting for the body at JJ Hospital. quot;We will cremate her in Mumbai, quot; Purnendu said.               
	Back in Singur, Meeras 42-year-old daughter Rupa broke down on hearing the news. quot;Last night, my brothers did not tell me that she was dead. They only said she was injured, quot; Rupa cried, watching the horror scenes on the TV. quot;Mother had promised a family reunion once everyone returned. That will never happen. quot;

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The decision to hand over the Shibpur campus to cops for the first time in its 152-year history came on the eve of a three-day visit by a team from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).        
	As the men in uniform took over the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) and the institution shut down for an indefinite period, the sprawling campus went quiet from Thursday evening.        
	But this quiet will not help us get a higher rating. Campus unrest will cost the university dear, rued a senior official at the oldest engineering college in the state.         
	Though NBA accreditation is not mandatory, it enables reputed engineering institutions like the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, to rate their academic programmes on a national platform.        
	A team of 14 NBA officials reached the city on Thursday to conduct an inspection of the Shibpur institution and renew its rating.        
	Academic ambience and institutional morale are among the things that the NBA assesses to rate an institution. The visiting team may ask for an explanation on the students unrest and the subsequent indefinite closure of the university, sources at Besu said.        
	The NBA parameters include human resource and faculty, quality of students, financial position, research and development and industry-institute interaction.         
	The NBA had assessed Besu three years ago and awarded it more than 650 points. With some departments having upgraded since then, the authorities were eyeing a higher rating.         
	We are expecting to score more than 750 this time. The 750-plus score would give us the opportunity to be accredited for five years, said registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	According to the NBA rules, engineering institutions scoring between 650 and 750 points are accredited for three years whereas those with a 750-plus score get accreditation for five years.         
	Worried that the fresh round of violence would reduce the chance of a higher rating, the authorities initially thought of postponing the inspection.        
	But then we realised that such a measure would be embarrassing. So a decision was taken to go ahead with the inspection by ensuring adequate security on the campus. We are keeping our fingers crossed, said a source.        
	Besu has been on the boil since March this year. Both students and teachers admit that campus unrest has affected brand Besu, which is in the process of being elevated to the status of Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST).        
	Placements are suffering, the upgrade to IIEST status has taken a hit and now the NBA rating could be affected, said a Besu official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tax small cars heavily: Pachauri
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tax small cars heavily: Pachauri
                                          
	R.K. Pachauri, the director-general of Tata Energy Research Institute and the chief of Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, which won the Nobel peace prize last year, was in Calcutta recently. Jayanta Basu spoke to the climate crusader.              
	Q: The Prime Minister recently announced the climate policy of India. How do you assess it?         
	The policy has correctly given importance to greater use of renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency. It also talks of reviewing sectors like agriculture, water conservation and urbanisation in view of the changing climate. There is no doubt that the intention (of the policy) is good but the actual challenge lies in its implementation.              
	Q. The production of small cars has triggered an intense debate from the environment point of view. What is your opinion?        
	There is no doubt that small cars are not acceptable environmentally as they lead to more traffic and hence, more air pollution. My suggestion to governments is that along with promoting small cars, provide adequate and quality public transport. I feel that small cars should be taxed heavily as they cause traffic jams, delays on road and air pollution, which influence climate change.               
	Q. Vehicular pollution is a major problem in many cities, including Calcutta. Do you think governments are doing enough?         
	They are not. Vehicular pollution is still one of the most neglected areas. One has to look at the skyline in the cities to realise how grave the problem is.               
	Q. Do you think Indian politicians are really waking up to the consequences of climate change? Do we have climate educated planning?        
	Things are changing at a slow pace. I have been requested to speak to parliamentarians in Spain, Brazil and many other countries on climate change, but nobody invites me in India! Generally speaking, India does not have climate educated planning.                
	Q. What are you doing in West Bengal?         
	The state government wants Tata Energy Research Institute to do a detailed study on the immediate impact of climate change in the state.We have just started collecting data and the draft report should be ready in a year. Our study will cover several areas  from the rise in sea level in the Sunderbans to the impact of climate change on areas close to the Himalayas, from its effect on water resources to how agriculture will be affected.              
	Q: Recently there has been a controversy regarding agricultural land being used for industries. What do you feel about the changing land-use pattern?        
	Before changing the land-use pattern, the environmental impact of such a shift should be studied carefully.

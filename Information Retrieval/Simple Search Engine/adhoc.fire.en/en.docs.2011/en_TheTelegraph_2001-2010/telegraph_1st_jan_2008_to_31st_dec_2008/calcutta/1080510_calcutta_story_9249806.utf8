                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Test decision on hold
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Presidency College will decide in the next couple of weeks whether to continue with the admission test in four of the 17 departments.        
	The authorities had scrapped the test in six departments, of which sociology and statistics decided to reinstate it following protests from students and alumni.        
	The authorities on Friday asked the class representatives to submit their suggestions on the admission procedure by next Thursday. We will call a teachers council meeting after that and decide on the admission procedure in mathematics, geology, philosophy and Bengali departments, said a college official.        
	If the teachers council fails to take a stand, the issue will be forwarded to the governing body, the official added.        
	The decision to revert to the test in the sociology and statistics departments was formally announced at Fridays meeting with the class representatives. The principal announced that the two departments would continue with the earlier admission procedure this year, said Abhijit Sarkar, the general secretary of the Presidency College Students Union.        
	The class representatives demanded that all 17 departments hold the test for admitting students. Contesting the authorities argument that admitting students on the basis of their Class XII marks was more scientific, the students called for reforming the test procedure.        
	The heads of the Bengali, mathematics, philosophy and geology departments, who were scheduled to attend the meeting, stayed away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seventh link for Tallah
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seventh link for Tallah
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 24-km pipe will be laid under BT Road between Palta water works and Tallah pumping station to ease the water woes of a large number of Calcuttans and facilitate the repair of the other conduits between the two points.        
	Work will start after the Puja under the supervision of Rites, a subsidiary of the railway ministry. The civic body is taking up the Rs 307-crore project under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	There are now six pipelines between Tallah and Palta, running under BT Road. The seventh link, of 64-inch diameter, is required for two reasons  to meet the growing demand for filtered surface water and to facilitate the phased overhaul of the other links that are more than a century old and have sprung leaks in several points.        
	The Tallah pumping station receives 172 million gallon of filtered water from Palta daily through the six pipes. Once the seventh conduit is commissioned, the daily flow will rise to 230 million gallon.        
	The agreement between Rites project director B.K. Makhija and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay was signed in Delhi on Monday. The civic body will have to pay 9.5 per cent of the project cost to Rites.        
	Details of the tender process will be sorted out before the Puja, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	Civic officials said the project would continue for 35 months. We will ensure that traffic on BT Road is not disrupted during the pipe-laying work, said an official.        
	Civic chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity said the micro-tunnelling or trench-less method would be employed on the 12-km stretch of BT Road. This will ensure that the road is not dug up.        
	For the remaining 12 km, from BT Road to Palta water works, the pipe will be laid through the open-cast method. After the seventh pipe is ready, an existing conduit of 60-inch diameter will be decommissioned for repairs.

  - Nine undertrials in van take on four escorts          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Nine undertrials in a prison van made a failed attempt to escape by overpowering one of their armed escorts on Wednesday morning.        
	The incident occurred while the undertrials were being taken to Presidency jail from Bankshal court, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	When the prison van reached Babughat on its way to Alipore around 4.30pm, the four armed escorts noticed that the accused were engaged in an altercation among themselves.        
	When the situation threatened to spin out of control, constable Totan Sarkar opened the collapsible gate inside the van and entered the undertrials enclosure, said an officer of Hastings police station.        
	On seeing Sarkar, one of the undertrials, identified as Mohammad Shahid, got into a scuffle with him. He suddenly opened Sarkars holster and tried to snatch the revolver. Sensing trouble, Sarkar shouted for help, the officer added.        
	The driver immediately stopped the van and the three other escorts, all from the Reserve Force, entered the enclosure and pinned Shahid down. Sarkar later lodged a complaint with Hastings police station.        
	The police suspect the altercation was staged to draw the cops into the enclosure. They must have thought that nine of them would easily overpower the four cops and snatch their arms before fleeing, said an officer. We are interrogating the accused. The reason they cited for the altercation seems flimsy, the officer added.        
	A fresh case will be started against Shahid on the basis of Sarkars complaint, said Goyal.

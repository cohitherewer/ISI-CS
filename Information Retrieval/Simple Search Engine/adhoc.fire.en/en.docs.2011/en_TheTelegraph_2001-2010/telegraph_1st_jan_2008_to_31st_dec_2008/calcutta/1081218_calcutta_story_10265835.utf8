                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Girl loses hands in suicide attempt
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Security personnel watched the wheels of a Metro train crush a teenagers hands seconds after the girl had told them she would jump.        
	The 18-year-old college student, a resident of Kalicharan Sheikh Lane in Sinthee, was rescued from under the train at Belgachhia station on Wednesday afternoon, but her hands had to be amputated.        
	I dont know why my daughter tried to kill herself. We are unaware of any personal problem that might have driven her to this. She was returning home after a college exam, the girls father later said.        
	The teenager was seen pacing up and down the platform around 1pm when a railway police team was taking photographs of that stretch for security reasons.        
	Just as a Dum Dum-bound train was entering the station at 1.05pm, she walked up to the policemen and said: I am going to jump in front of the train now. Please go and take pictures elsewhere.        
	One of the officers said before he and his colleagues could react, the girl jumped on the tracks. The train had entered the platform and she jumped before we could even move, he recounted.        
	A spokesman for Metro Railway said the girl survived because she fell into the gap between the two rails.        
	The fact that the train had slowed down before entering the station also saved her, he added.        
	It took the Metro Railway staff almost half an hour to extricate the teenager from under the train.        
	She was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors conducted a two-hour surgery to amputate her hands.        
	Her hands were badly damaged and an emergency procedure was required, said an official at the hospital.        
	A library card that the girl was carrying helped the Metro Railway authorities identify her and contact her father. She is a first-year student in a Dum Dum college, an official said.        
	Police said they would probe the incident after the girl recovered. We will question her when she is fit enough to talk. She is still unconscious, an officer at Ultadanga police station said.        
	Metro services were disrupted for over 45 minutes because of the suicide attempt. Several trains were truncated at Girish Park.        
	There have been 165 suicide attempts in Metro Railway stations so far, 72 of them fatal.

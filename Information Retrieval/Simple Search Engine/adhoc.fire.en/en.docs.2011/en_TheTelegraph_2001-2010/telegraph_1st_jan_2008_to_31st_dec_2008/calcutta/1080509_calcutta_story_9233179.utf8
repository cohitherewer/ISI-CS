          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta polices attempt at durbar diplomacy has gone the way of previous failed initiatives to bridge the gap between the cop and the common man.        
	Four months after the police decided to organise interactive sessions with citizens at all police stations, there are few takers for the concept. The idea was to provide a platform for citizens to air their grievances about law and order before an officer of the rank of joint commissioner of police, but a source in Lalbazar said only those with scores to settle with rivals were attending these meetings.        
	We have realised that this is not serving our purpose. We might call it off, he said.        
	The joint commissioners visit police stations across the city once a week. Display boards at the police stations mention the dates and timings of the interactive sessions.        
	A senior police official admitted that the concept could have been publicised better. Our message is not reaching the people. Display boards are not enough to make people know what we have planned. Unless they need to file an FIR or make a complaint, citizens will not take the trouble of coming to a police station and going through the display board.        
	The official suggested that boards be installed at several places in a locality for people to know the date and time for any meet-the-police session.        
	One joint commissioner of police said most of the citizens he had met in the weekly sessions were businessmen with a grudge against someone.         
	I cannot remember one person who came with a genuine grievance. I do not believe that the common man has no grievance, either against the police force or local rowdies.        
	On whether he thought anybody would dare to complain to a police officer about another policeman, the joint commissioner admitted it would be unrealistic to expect people to do so. I understand that a potential complainant will think that I will not be there to protect him later.        
	Before the weekly interactive sessions, the police had attempted to keep an eye on rogue drivers by asking cops in plainclothes to randomly board city buses. The experiment was called off after only two months.        
	In another people-friendly move four years ago, officers of the rank of sub-inspector were trained for three days each to work as child welfare officers in their police stations.         
	The system was scrapped after some time.

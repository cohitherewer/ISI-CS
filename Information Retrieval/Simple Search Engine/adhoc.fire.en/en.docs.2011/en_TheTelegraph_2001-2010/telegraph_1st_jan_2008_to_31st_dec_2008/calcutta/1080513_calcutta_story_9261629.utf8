                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       70-yr-old dies in fall from flat
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sarwant Singh, 77, a resident of Sankrail, Howrah, died after he jumped off the three-storeyed apartment block in which he lived.         
	Rajaram Singh, the security guard of the building, Amrit Dham, at Nityanandanagar near Andul Road, raised an alarm when he saw Sarwant trying to climb down to the sun shade of a flat from the top of the building.         
	On hearing a shout from the third-floor flat, I looked up and saw the old man trying to get on to the sun shade of the top-floor flat. I raised an alarm. He jumped even as everyone implored him not to.        
	According to his family members, Sarwant had been suffering from depression after his transport business started doing badly almost 15 years ago.         
	Though his son and grandsons were running the business well, he was not satisfied with the progress.         
	My father lost his mental balance by constantly brooding over the future of the business. I took him to a psychiatrist. But I never thought he would commit suicide. Had the doctor told me that my father had suicidal tendencies, I would have kept an eye on him, said Jaswant Singh, Sarwants son.         
	Sarwant stayed in the apartment with his son, grandsons and daughter-in-law for a part of the year. The rest of the year he spent at his ancestral home in Ludhiana.        
	According to family members, Sarwant had started his day like every other day. He woke up early in the morning, bathed and went to the gurdwara. After returning, he climbed to the top of the building and jumped off.         
	The body has been sent for post-mortem and a case of unnatural death started.

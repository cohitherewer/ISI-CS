                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mobile link in road mishaps
  - Rule violation by pedestrians, drivers and riders is the norm                                              
	Pedestrians using cellphones and portable music players have come under the scanner after a teenager and two women were involved in mishaps while chatting on the phone or listening to music. Metro tracks similar road-rule violations that are common on the city streets              
	Impatient pedestrians         
	At several intersections, pedestrians did not wait for the signal to turn green before crossing the road. Many were too busy talking or listening to music on the cellphone to look at the traffic lights or even sideways before walking across busy thoroughfares.         
	I am embarrassed that I did something like this. I know its dangerous, said a young woman who crossed the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-SN Banerjee Road intersection while writing a text message. A car swerved to avoid hitting her.         
	At the Park Street intersection, a recorded voice repeatedly asked commuters to wait for their turn. A woman who almost ran across the road through the traffic holding her minor daughters hand, later said: I didnt hear the instruction.         
	On an average, 10 jaywalkers and 20 motorcyclists without helmets are hauled up at the crossing daily, said a sergeant.               
	Phone peril        
	Both motorcyclists and car drivers put themselves and others in peril by using cellphones on the road. Motorcyclists often use their shoulders to hold their phones to their ears, which restricts their ability to react quickly. People also use hands-free tools to talk on the phone while driving, said an officer of the traffic department.         
	Some fix their cellphones to their helmets with straps before starting to ride their motorcycles, added the officer.               
	Bicycle block        
	There were several bicycles on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Park Street and Red Road, where they are banned. According to the police, bicycles slow down traffic and increase the possibility of accidents by jumping signals.         
	Sunny, a 21-year-old employee in a Girish Park restaurant, was caught cycling down Red Road. The youth said he did not know that cycles were not allowed on the stretch. Road signs proclaiming the ban would have helped, he said.               
	Polices version         
	Joint commissioner (traffic) Ranvir Kumar said: Using cellphones and portable music players distracts commuters and drivers, increasing chances of a mishap. Pedestrians are fined between Rs 25 and Rs 50 for using cellphones on the road and jaywalking. Motorcyclists not wearing helmets is another problem.               
	Professional opinion         
	People are aware of the dangers of using a cellphone or listening to music while crossing the road or driving. They still do so because they think it is cool. But a person can attend to only one thing at a time. Losing concentration for a fraction of a second can be costly on our roads, said psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee.               
	 Rith Basu

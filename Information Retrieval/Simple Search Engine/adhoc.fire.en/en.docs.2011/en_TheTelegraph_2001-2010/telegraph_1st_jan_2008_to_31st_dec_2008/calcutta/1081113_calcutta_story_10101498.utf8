          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four members of a club in Shibpur, Howrah, have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 20-year-old local resident.         
	Lakshman Mahato said his son Shatrughan was last seen on Sunday, running along Foreshore Road, chased by members of the club.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that members of Biraj Sangha beat up Shatrughan, a porter in Burrabazar, after the motorcycle he was riding hit a 12-year-old girl on Sunday.        
	The girl suffered minor injuries. But members of the club mercilessly beat up Lakshman. We have learnt that he ran for his life along Foreshore Road with the club members on his trail, said Lakshman in his police complaint on Tuesday.         
	An officer of Shibpur police station told Metro that local residents had confirmed that Shatrughan was bleeding profusely while running towards the main gate of Botanic Garden to evade some youths.         
	We have been searching for him for the past three days. We have even called up our home in Bihar to check whether he had returned there. We dont know what the club members did to my brother. They may have even killed him, said Shatrughans brother Mohan. The brothers lived with their father at 36 Foreshore Road.        
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said Toton Maji, 23, Nakul Mani, 24, Dilip Ghosh, 30, and Sanjay Maji, 22, were arrested on the basis of Lakshmans complaint.        
	According to Mohan, members of the club had warned them of dire consequences if they filed a missing complaint.        
	When Metro visited the club on Foreshore Road on Wednesday, it was closed. The club is closed for a couple of days, said a resident.

	From star performances to quirky competitions and intellectual stimulation, this years Xavotsav, the annual fest of St Xaviers College, Calcutta, and musical extravaganza Beyond Barriers, organised by the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA) in association with The Telegraph, has something on offer for everyone.
    
	Xavotsav 2008 will be held over three days from January 22 to 24, followed by the ninth edition of Beyond Barriers, the musical extravaganza with a cause. The western dance competition, the eastern dance competition Bollywood Dhamal and the ever-popular War of the DJs are expected to be the top draws of the fest.
    
	Apart from the usual popular events, we have also registered 39 participants for Xav Idol, the new version of the eastern solo competition, said Gourab Das, the main coordinator of Xavotsav. About 17 education institutions, including Presidency and Jadavpur University, will participate.
    
	Xavotsav will also have events like Whacky Bands, where no instruments are allowed, and the new attraction 60 Seconds to Fame, in which the participant can do anything he wants to for 60 seconds. Abhijit Sen, the associate director of Munnabhai MBBS, will be the judge for the drama competition, Comic Sequence.
    
	The star attractions at Beyond Barriers on January 25 will be singers KK and Sneha Pant. The annual show, to be held on the college grounds, draws over 10,000 people. Like in the previous years, Beyond Barriers will feature the best in the industry. We expect a crowd of more than 10,000, said Dharam Singh, the convener of Beyond Barriers 2008. Beyond Barriers has seen performances by Kailash Kher, Hariharan, Lucky Ali, Strings, Kunal Ganjawala and Vasundhara Das.
    
	The event is the biggest fundraiser for the alumni association. This years proceeds have been earmarked for the new college campus on the EM Bypass. We aim to raise about Rs 20-25 lakh this year, said Singh. Last year, the alumni association donated Rs 25 lakh for the new campus.
    
	The event will also see performances by former St Xaviers students Monali Thakore, who was placed ninth in Indian Idol 2, and Ram Tasildar.

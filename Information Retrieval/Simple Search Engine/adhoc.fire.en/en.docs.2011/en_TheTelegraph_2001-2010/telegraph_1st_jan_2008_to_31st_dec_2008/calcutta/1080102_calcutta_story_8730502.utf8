 - Engineers assure Residents of repairs after project 
   A STAFF REPORTER 
        
	More than 100 houses in ward 129 of Behala have developed cracks mdash; some are even damaged at the foundation mdash; following the drainage revamp work being undertaken under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. The project authorities have said repairs will be undertaken after the loose soil settles down, which will take three-four months after the pipe-laying work is over.
 
	 ldquo;Most houses on Mohendra Banerjee Road developed cracks after work started in July last year. But our house has been damaged structurally and has tilted, rdquo; said Sumit Basu.
 
	The family had to vacate a part of the house after the floor split wide open. ldquo;The entire building may collapse, as the pillars have been damaged. The solution lies in reconstructing the house, but I am not sure whether the project authorities will agree to it, rdquo; he added.
 
	Several of Basu rsquo;s neighbours have come up with similar complaints. ldquo;After the project started, a room in my house beside the road developed cracks and then caved in. Project officials have inspected the house and assured me they would repair it after the work is over, rdquo; said Ranjit Dutta Ray.
 
	Some of the buildings have partly subsided and in some, the walls have split mdash; the fallout of structural damage at the foundation.
 
	The multistoreyed buildings, too, have not been spared. ldquo;The concrete courtyard in front of our apartment block has cracked. The building may even have been structurally damaged, rdquo; said A.S. Bagchi, the secretary of the flat-owners rsquo; association of Debapriya Apartment, on Mohendra Banerjee Road.
 
	A recent count of the damaged buildings crossed 100. Residents fear the figure will jump as the drainage revamp work proceeds towards the Polar Fan factory, about one-and-a-half km from Diamond Harbour Road, through congested neighbourhoods.
 
	Workers engaged in the project admitted that the pipe-laying work has damaged the foundation of some buildings. ldquo;We are digging around 10 ft to lay the pipes. The foundation of some of the buildings beside the roads are not that deep. After the soil is taken out, the foundation fails to bear the weight of the structures, rdquo; explained an official.
 
	Local councillor Anjan Das said he has reported the matter to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. ldquo;Our engineers have inspected the area and we are in talks with the project authorities, rdquo; Das said.
 
	Project engineer Santanu Basu said: ldquo;It takes three-four months for the loose earth to settle down after the pipes are laid. We will start repairs after that. rdquo;

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Registrar quits CU
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Registrar quits CU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The registrar of Calcutta University (CU) resigned in a huff a day before the completion of his two-year term allegedly because the authorities did not respond to his request for an extension.        
	Samir Bandyopadhyay, a professor of computer science, became registrar on lien two years ago. He has written to us, expressing his willingness to return to the computer science department, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said.         
	The managements refusal to acknowledge his extension request was not the only slight. The university syndicate on Friday constituted a four-member committee to probe a decision taken during his tenure.        
	Bandyopadhyay had allegedly allowed a girl student from an Australian university to join the second-year B.Com class at Bhawanipore Education Society last year in violation of norms. CU does not allow any affiliated college to take in students from foreign institutions midway through an undergraduate course.        
	Bandyopadhyay was unavailable for comment.

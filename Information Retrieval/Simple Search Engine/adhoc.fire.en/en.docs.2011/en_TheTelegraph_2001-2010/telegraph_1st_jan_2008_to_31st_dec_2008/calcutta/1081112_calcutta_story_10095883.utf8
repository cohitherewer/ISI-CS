          A STAFF REPORTER                          A frame from You Got It, which was screened on Tuesday                                  
	The 14th Calcutta International Film Festival saw the screening of five indigenous animation films, heralding the coming of age of the animation industry in the city.        
	Calcutta-based animation centre Metaphor Studios created the package of five, which was screened at Bangla Akademi on Tuesday as part of the short film and documentary category.        
	The films were made entirely in-house, from script to screen. All of them were made by local talent. It is definitely a boost to the growing animation industry in the city, said Ranjini Mukherjee, the COO of Metaphor Studios.        
	Laadli, a three-minute 2D animation film on pre-natal sex selection, portrays a world without women, while You Got It is the story of a naughty boy who is taught a lesson by the animals he had harassed.        
	Miinndd It revolves around the do it yourself mantra, showing an unsuccessful doctor who places stone footballs at road crossings and playgrounds, where they are bound to be kicked by boys, leading to a long queue of patients at his otherwise empty clinic.        
	Our Friends the Ogres uses cut-out animation instead of drawings to narrate a simple story on ogres. Junta Car depicts a socialist India where everyone  from beggars to children  owns a car.        
	Each film is a take on modern society and is aimed at spreading awareness about various social issues, said Mukherjee.

                                                                                                            Sisters fight molester 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 28-year-old Ph.D candidate was molested on the road by a help in Salt Lakes AE block on Tuesday night.         
	The woman and her 24-year-old sister, daughters of a Lake Town doctor, chased Kalu Yadav to the house where he worked, raised a hue and cry and waited outside till police came and detained him.        
	Swapna and Suparna (names changed) were walking back home to Lake Town after visiting a friend in Salt Lake. Around 10pm, they realised that Yadav, in his early 20s, was following them.        
	We were walking very fast but the youth kept tailing us. We could not understand his motive, said Swapna. According to the police, Yadav, who hails from Bihar, grabbed Swapna from the back and tried to molest her near the AE block community centre.        
	My sister and I were shocked but we fought back. My sister tried to pull me free from the mans clutches, recounted Swapna.        
	Faced with resistance, Yadav turned around and started running but the girls followed. To shake the sisters off, the youth picked up a stone and threw it at them. The stone hit Swapna on the head and she started bleeding, but the two still did not give up, said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station.        
	Swapna and Suparna saw Yadav enter a house about 100 ft from the community centre.         
	They knocked on the door and demanded that the youth come outside, added the officer.         
	The family that employed Yadav, however, refused to let the girls enter the house and allegedly pushed them out of the premises.         
	The duo stood outside and cried for help till a crowd gathered, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police.        
	The police were alerted. They reached the house around 11.15pm and detained Yadav. The sisters went to Bidhannagar (north) police station and lodged a written complaint after midnight.         
	Yadav was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in judicial custody.

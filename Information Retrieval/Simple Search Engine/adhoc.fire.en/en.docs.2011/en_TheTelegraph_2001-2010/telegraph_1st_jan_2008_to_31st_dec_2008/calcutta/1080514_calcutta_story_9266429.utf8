          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The 13 lakh students who took the Class X and Class XII examinations conducted by the state and central boards wont know how well or badly they have fared until after the ballot test for panchayat candidates.        
	Results of all six board examinations  Madhyamik, Higher Secondary, ICSE, ISC and CBSE X and XII  will be declared between May 20 and June 8, though none of the boards has announced the exact dates. The results of the panchayat elections will be out on May 21.        
	Sources in the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, which conducts the Madhyamik examination, said they hoped to declare the results latest by May 30.         
	Nearly 7.5 lakh students took the test this year. The Higher Secondary board has set June 8 as the target.        
	The Madhyamik board had planned to declare the results by the third week of this month. We realised later that the results would not be ready before May 28. But we will definitely not stretch it beyond May 30, a senior official said.        
	The panchayat elections delayed the evaluation process, with teachers being deployed as polling officers.        
	The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations, and the Central Board of Secondary Education will declare their results any day after May 20. About 400 schools in Calcutta and the districts are affiliated to the central boards and almost a lakh students sat for the four examinations this year.        
	The process of tabulating the results of ICSE and ISC 2008 is in full swing. We are taking all possible steps to ensure that the students get to know their results in time, Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the ICSE/ISC board said.        
	Sources in CBSE-affiliated schools in the city confirmed receiving information from the Delhi board that the results would be out after May 20.        
	An apex court ruling has made it mandatory for every board to declare the results of the Class XII exams latest by June 10 every year.

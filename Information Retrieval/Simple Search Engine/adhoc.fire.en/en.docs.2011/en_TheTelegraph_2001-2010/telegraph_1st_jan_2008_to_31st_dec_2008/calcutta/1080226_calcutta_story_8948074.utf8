The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minister bag snatched
                                                                                                               Minister bag snatched
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The handbag of Bengal minister Bilashibala Sahish was snatched while she was preparing to get off the Chakradharpur Express at Howrah station around 4am on Monday.         
	The bag contained two cellphones, four diaries and Rs 4,000.        
	The government railway police (GRP) claimed they had arrested the culprit in a slum in Bantra, Howrah, and seized Rs 2,900 from him.        
	He has named two of his accomplices. We hope to recover the rest of the money and the stolen articles after rounding up the duo, said Sankar Singha, the superintendent of railway police.        
	Sahish, the minister of state for forests, had boarded a first-class compartment of the train in Purulia at 10pm on Sunday.        
	While the train was entering platform 21 of Howrah station early on Monday, Sahish opened the window beside her seat, holding the bag in her hand.        
	Suddenly, a youth in his mid-20s appeared in front of the window, snatched the bag and fled. The minister raised an alarm but there were too few people on the platform in the early hours to chase the snatcher.        
	Sahish lodged a complaint with the GRP, Howrah, before setting off for the MLA hostel.        
	Dilip Mitra, the additional director-general of GRP, met the minister at Writers Buildings in the morning.        
	The minister narrated the circumstances leading to the snatching. GRP personnel are conducting raids in several areas and interrogating persons with criminal records. An inspector-general is monitoring the raids. I hope the money and the cellphones will be recovered soon, said Mitra.        
	The minister refused to comment.

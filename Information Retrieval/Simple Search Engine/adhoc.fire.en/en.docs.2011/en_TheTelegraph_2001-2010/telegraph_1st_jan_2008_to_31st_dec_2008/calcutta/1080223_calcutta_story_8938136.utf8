                      Visual harmony                    Natures infinite inventory of form and colour serves as the perennial source of ideas to painter Anju Chaudhuri. Her passion for nature reverberates in every inch of her multi-hued canvases. Combining her inherent skills with the fresh perspective she gained on settling in France early in life, she creates naturescapes with rare creative abandon and an innate sense of the aesthetic. Nature Symphonique, the ongoing exhibition of her recent works, showcases her ability to treat her canvas as an arena where the act of painting is like a music performance. Like the notes of a concerto, her brushstrokes give the effect of gliding over the canvas, creating compositions bristling with power and energy, appealing as much to the auditory senses as to the visual. Though abstract in expression, the perceptive viewer can trace in her works birds, trees, twigs, foliage and flowers draped in their prismatic bloom and lushness.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Anju Chaudhuri When: Till February 26 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

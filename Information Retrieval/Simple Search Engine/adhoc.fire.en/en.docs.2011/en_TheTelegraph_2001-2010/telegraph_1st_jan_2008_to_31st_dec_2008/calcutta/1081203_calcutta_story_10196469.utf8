          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) has turned down a demand raised by a section of students that supplementary tests be held for those who had failed in a paper in the BA-B.Sc Part I and II examinations.        
	The universitys undergraduate council announced on Tuesday that the students who had failed in a paper would not get a chance to clear it before next year.        
	But to ensure that they do not lose a year, the council decided that the students would be allowed to clear the paper in which they had failed and sit for the Part III exams simultaneously.        
	Part III students will get their marksheets only after they clear all papers in the earlier two parts.        
	The councils decision will be placed before the syndicate  one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university, the other being the senate  on Thursday for approval, Chatterjee said.        
	According to the universitys original rules, a Part I examinee who fails in a paper can appear for it again next year, along with the Part II exams.         
	But Part II examinees will have to clear all papers before they are allowed to sit for the Part III tests.        
	A few hundred students who had failed to clear a paper in the BA-B.Sc Part I and II exams held a demonstration at the university demanding supplementary tests.         
	Pro vice-chancellor Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said the rules had been relaxed only for those who had appeared for the undergraduate tests this year.

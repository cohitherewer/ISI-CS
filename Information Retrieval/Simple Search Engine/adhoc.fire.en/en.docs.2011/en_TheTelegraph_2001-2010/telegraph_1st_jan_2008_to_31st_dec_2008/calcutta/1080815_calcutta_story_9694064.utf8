          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An 18-year-old boy stabbed and killed his stepmother on Wednesday night at Bishnupur on the southern fringes of the city. He is absconding.        
	The investigating officer said Panchubala Patra, 32, used to rebuke Pintu often over his studies. The Class XI student hardly went to school.         
	Pintu also mixed with some youths in the locality who took drugs, police said.         
	On Wednesday night, Panchubala had rebuked Pintu for coming home late. After dinner, when she started scolding him again, Pintu brought a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her repeatedly in the chest.         
	His father, Palan, who is a trader, ran to the neighbours for help. Panchubala was rushed to MR Bangur Hospital, where she died early on Thursday.         
	We have launched a hunt for Pintu. We are also interrogating his friends and neighbours, said Ajey Ranade, the district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

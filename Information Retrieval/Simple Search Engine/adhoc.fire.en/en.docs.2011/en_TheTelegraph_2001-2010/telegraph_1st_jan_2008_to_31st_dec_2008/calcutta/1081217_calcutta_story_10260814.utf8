The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terror scan on Howrah bridge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Terror scan on Howrah bridge
  - Cameras come in handy          SANJAY MANDAL                          Howrah bridge is under round-the-clock surveillance to prevent a terrorist attack                                        
	Last months terrorist strikes in Mumbai have prompted authorities to throw a special security blanket around Howrah bridge. Calcutta Port Trust, the custodian of the iconic structure, has written to Calcutta and Howrah police requesting them to step up vigil.        
	Rabindra Setu (Howrah bridge) is one of the most prominent structures in the city and can be targeted by terrorists. So, we have asked police to intensify vigil, said a port trust official.        
	The over 60-year-old structure came under electronic surveillance weeks before the Mumbai siege with the installation of six state-of-the-art cameras. Recently, during a police inspection of the bridges security system, the officers checked whether the cameras were fool-proof.         
	They checked the resolution and quality of images and zoom and other features of the cameras and expressed satisfaction, said the official.         
	Security of the bridge has been beefed up. Policemen are manning the bridge at the Calcutta end and all vehicles are being checked, said deputy commissioner (port division) Anand Kumar.        
	According to port trust sources, the river traffic police have also been alerted and round-the-clock surveillance has started. The images captured by the cameras will be monitored round the clock. We have trained personnel to change camera angles by remote control, said an official.        
	The footage is preserved at the Calcutta Port Trust headquarters in Fairlie Place. The police team went there, too. We are satisfied with the quality of images. We have also laid down guidelines for the security personnel operating the cameras. Though installed to record hit-and-run cases and instances of vehicles damaging the bridge, the cameras are helping in improving security, said a police officer.         
	Two of the high-resolution cameras have been placed under the bridge to track the movement of barges, steamers and boats on the Hooghly. The other four are on the bottom boom chord (the first layer of beams)  one at each end and two in the middle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guidelines for township Puja
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Guidelines for township Puja
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A set of guidelines for the 170-odd Durga pujas in Salt Lake and Lake Town was issued on Tuesday. Organisers will be allowed to hold puja only if they agree to follow the guidelines.        
	The puja committees will have to state in writing that they will not allow use of plastic bags less than 40 micron in thickness in or around the pandals and will limit microphone sound at 65 decibel.        
	They will also have to arrange for sufficient drinking water and first-aid facilities in the pandals. Only licenced electricians can be hired for illuminating mandaps.        
	The organisers will have to hand over to the authorities route maps of immersion processions and restore roads that they will dig up for puja.        
	The guidelines have been drawn up keeping in mind the huge turnout at the pandals and the absence of any effective crowd-management strategy. Pujas will be allowed only if the organisers agree to follow the guidelines, said Asoke Das, the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar.        
	Representatives of CESC, West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, fire department, state pollution control board and the local municipalities took part in the meeting where the guidelines were drawn up.        
	Officials of various departments will run surprise checks. Action will be taken against committees found violating the guidelines, said Das         
	The organisers welcomed the move. The guidelines will help us organise pujas in a more systematic way, said Samrat Pal of Salt Lakes BJ Block puja committee.        
	At Lalbazar, senior officers discussed traffic plan on the festive days. The cops will also release a list of dos and donts to prevent a terror attack.

	Bengals oldest private engineering college has received positive feedback from the University Grants Commission (UGC) in its bid to become the states first private deemed university.        
	Set up in 1994 and affiliated to the West Bengal University of Technology, the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) in Salt Lake applied for deemed university status in May.        
	The UGCs response to our proposal has been very positive, the IEM director, Satyajit Chakraborty, said.        
	After UGC sanctions the upgrade, IEM will have the freedom to customise its syllabi and courses, conduct examinations on its own and award degrees.        
	We understand that the UGC will grant us that status once we meet the technical criteria mentioned in its guidelines for deemed university status to a private college. It will take some time for us to complete the necessary procedures, Chakraborty said.        
	An UGC official said from Delhi that IEM could become a deemed university the moment it fulfilled the requirements. Every institution seeking deemed university status needs to meet certain criteria. We would have no problem in granting that status to IEM once we are convinced that it has done so.         
	In Bengal, the first choice of a student who wants to be an engineer is a government-run engineering institution like the one at Jadavpur University or the Bengal Engineering and Science University. The IEM is the exception among the private institutions. Given a choice, even high performers prefer to take admission there.        
	After years of dedicated service, we have been able to achieve academic excellence by providing top-class infrastructure, engaging highly qualified faculty and providing placements to our students. We can improve further if we are allowed to enjoy full academic freedom, principal D. Chatterjee said.        
	The college has written to the West Bengal University of Technology for a no-objection certificate, which the UGC would ask for after the other requirements are met.        
	We have received a proposal from the IEM and referred it to the state government for its approval. We will be in a position to take a decision on whether we can issue the no-objection certificate or not only after we get the opinion of the government, university registrar Rafiqul Islam said.         
	Students of IEM believe they have everything to gain if the institution becomes a deemed university. We welcome the decision to seek deemed-university status. Students will benefit in a big way as placement opportunities will improve if the institution is allowed to run without any interference, a fourth-year student said.

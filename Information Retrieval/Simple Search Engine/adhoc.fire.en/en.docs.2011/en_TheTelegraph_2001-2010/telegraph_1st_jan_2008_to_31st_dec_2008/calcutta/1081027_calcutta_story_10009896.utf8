                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu entry through JEE next year
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) will admit students in the 2009-10 academic session through the state joint entrance examinations and not the All India Engineering Entrance Examination as was earlier decided.        
	The proposed switch to the national-level test was part of the Centres initiative to upgrade the university to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST).        
	But as the upgrade has not yet been finalised, the human resource development ministry has verbally informed the university to admit students through the state JEE in the 2009-10 session.        
	The ministry will send us a note soon, after which we will get in touch with the JEE board, said Besu registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	Last year, the human resource development ministry had informed the university that it would admit students through the JEE for the last time in the 2008-09 session.        
	It was decided that post-upgrade, students aspiring to a Besu berth would have to sit for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), which would ensure that candidates from across the country get a chance to study in the Shibpur institute.        
	Besu was to be upgraded through a central legislation but university sources said the Centre was still undecided on passing the proposed act.        
	Next years AIEEE and JEE are scheduled for April. Plus-II students, preparing for the national and state-level entry tests for engineering and medical colleges, are anxious to know which system Besu would follow in the next session. Realising this, we raised the issue at a meeting with ministry officials in Delhi last week. We were told that in the 2009-10 session, students would have to be admitted through the state JEE, said a Besu official.        
	The upgrade process is still on. If it doesnt get over before the 2010-11 session, the ministry will take a fresh decision on admission, the official added.

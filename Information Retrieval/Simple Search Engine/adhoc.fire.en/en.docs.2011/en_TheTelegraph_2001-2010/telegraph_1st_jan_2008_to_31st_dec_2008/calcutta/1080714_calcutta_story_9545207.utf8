  - Real estate disputes account for 35 per cent of cases awaiting disposal in state forum          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Almost 35 per cent of the 800-odd cases awaiting disposal in the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission are against property developers, highlighting the flip side of the real estate boom in the city.        
	A society of 100-odd past and present teachers of IIT Kharagpur is among the many aggrieved parties queuing up to file cases against realtors, some of them big players. The commonest complaints are delay in delivery of flats and failure to provide the amenities promised at the booking stage.         
	There has been a sudden increase in the number of cases against realtors, an official of the commission said. We are following the directive of the national commission to expedite these cases and have stopped giving adjournments.         
	For members of the IIT-Kharagpur Housing Society, the wait for their property developer to deliver on his promise has stretched beyond four years. These teachers had purchased 12 plots of land on Kailash Ghosh Road, in Behala, seven years ago and assigned a property developer to build flats there. According to the agreement between the society and the realtor, the flats were to be completed by 2004 and handed over to their respective owners after 90 per cent of the construction cost was paid.         
	 Although the members paid 90 per cent of the cost of construction in advance  in five instalments between December 2003 and January 2005  the construction was wilfully delayed, said Prabir Basu, the lawyer representing the society. Flats have not been handed over to about 50 members, some of whom have since retired.         
	The case will be filed with the state commission.        
	In May, around 15 people who had booked flats in a housing project at Kalikapur, off the EM Bypass, jointly filed a complaint with the commission, accusing their builder of breach of promise. The company had promised to sell garages to MIG flat owners, but sold them to those who had booked houses in other blocks, one of the flat owners said.        
	Not only that, the company built only one community hall for the entire complex despite having promised several.         
	Pradip Chopra, a governing body member of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India, admitted to delays in handing over flats to consumers because of a severe scarcity of skilled manpower.

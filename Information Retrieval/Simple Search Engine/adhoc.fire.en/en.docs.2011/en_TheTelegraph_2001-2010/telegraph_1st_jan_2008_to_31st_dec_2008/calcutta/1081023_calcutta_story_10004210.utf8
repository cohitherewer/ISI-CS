	Almost 1,000 people have been left homeless by Tuesday nights fire in a slum off Foreshore Road in Howrah. Six people were charred in the blaze.         
	Over 150 families living in the slum near Shalimar station could not salvage their belongings from the fire.        
	Bado Khatun, a 45-year-old resident of the slum who ekes out a living by working as a help, said she lost jewellery worth Rs 10,000  purchased over five years  in the fire. The ornaments were kept in a box in her 10ft x 10ft shanty, which has been gutted.         
	I had taken loans from relatives to buy the jewellery. I thought I would use them to marry off my daughters next year and dont know what to do now, said Khatun.         
	A few metres from the rubble of her home, 10-year-old Mohammad Shamim was frantically searching the debris for his schoolbag.        
	My parents cant afford to buy me books. A senior in school had donated his books to me. How will I study now? asked Shamim, a Class III student in a local school.         
	Nothing is left. We do not know how long it will take us to get our lives back on track. The children are crying for food, the women are worrying over where they are going to spend the night, said Mohammed Samirul, a resident of the slum for over 35 years.         
	Relief was hard to come by in the destroyed slum, but not politicians. With municipal polls scheduled for next month, leaders of every major political party turned up on Wednesday.         
	People who have lost everything have complained to me that relief hasnt come their way till now. Our party wants to know the exact cause of the fire, said Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee after spending 15 minutes at the spot.         
	The slum came up illegally on a Calcutta Port Trust plot. The residents are mostly labourers at Shalimar station.

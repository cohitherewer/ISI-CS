The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall chaos or comfort
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Mall chaos or comfort
          Todays question: Should shopping malls be allowed to come up in residential areas?                                                      
	

INDRANIL SANYAL, 
  Dhakuria        
	No. They always invite congestion, traffic snarl, noise and dust pollution. Residential areas should be calm and clean. That helps children to concentrate in their studies and sick people to recuperate.              
	

P Pramanik,
  Santoshpur        
	Shopping malls located in residential areas give relief to housewives and elderly people. But they should not cause inconvenience to others.               
	

ANUSHRI MONDAL, 
  Address not given        
	Shopping malls should be in residential areas only. The whole idea of malls is marketing convenience and comfort. It would be too time-consuming to travel long distances if malls are built far from residential locations.             
	

P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake        
	The opening of so many malls in residential areas betrays a lack of concern for residents living close by. The city is already reeling under unmanageable traffic snarls, population density, roadside slums and other hazards. Civic authorities must not allow malls to come up in residential areas. There ought to be a drive to dismantle the ones already existing.              
	

Ratan Kumar Haldar,
  Behala        
	This will definitely make life smoother. But the mall authorities should make sure that enough space is available for parking. Fire safety arrangements should be present in the building.            
	Amaresh Paul,
  Sanghati Nagar  
	Shopping malls allow people with different needs to get commodities under a single roof. Undoubtedly, they should come up in residential areas.           
	

Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia         
	Given that people face problems in travelling to far-off shopping malls to make their purchases, it makes a lot of sense if a few malls are allowed in residential areas. But the mall owners shouldnt be allowed to make the area dirty.         
	

Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park        
	Certainly not. Shopping malls cause noise and air pollution in the areas they come up in. Students are unable to concentrate due to the constant honking of vehicles. Senior citizens and infants are the worst affected.               
	

Ajit Kumar Das, 
  Ghusury, Howrah         
	Yes, if there is enough space for car parking and entry of the fire brigade. There should be arrangement for water too.              
	

Manasi Chakrabarti,
  Address not given        
	 Yes. In our city many people reside in areas where there are no shops to buy essentials from. Elderly people are unable to travel long distances to buy these things.               
	

Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum        
	The presence of malls make an area noisy which may affect the hearing and the temperament of people of in the area. If the garbage disposal system of the mall is improper then the area would be polluted as well.               
	

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
  Beleghata        
	Malls are appropriate in the West where the economic condition is far better. Here, small traders are becoming the victims of the mall-culture.

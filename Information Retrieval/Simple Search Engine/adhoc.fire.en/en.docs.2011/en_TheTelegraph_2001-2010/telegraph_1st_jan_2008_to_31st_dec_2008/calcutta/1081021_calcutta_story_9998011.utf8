                              A designed room at Kingston Hotel                            
	Jessore Road has got a novel gift this festive season  a boutique hotel.         
	Inspired by the boutique hotels of Bangkok, the city-based Downtown Group of Hotels and Restaurants has opened Kingston Hotel at 394 Jessore Road to tap the large volume of corporate travellers.         
	We have chosen Jessore Road because we wanted to target air passengers. Kingston is just 4 km from the airport, said Gursimran Singh, the groups managing director.         
	Kingstons speciality is its 17 rooms, each of which has been designed on a specific theme.         
	This is an important feature of a boutique hotel. I have used rose, water, fire and ice themes. The colour on the walls, the fragrance in the rooms, furniture and upholstery are all coordinated, said Rajashree Banerjee of Cizaka Enterprises, which has designed the hotels interiors. There are two suites, of which one has an Egyptian ambience with a painting of the Sphinx adorning a wall.         
	Kingston has three restaurants serving Indian and Chinese cuisine. The Royale Court is a family restaurant with a bar, while the Prince Court is meant only for men. The 1,500-sq ft Rock King Bar provides dining facilities along with a live band.

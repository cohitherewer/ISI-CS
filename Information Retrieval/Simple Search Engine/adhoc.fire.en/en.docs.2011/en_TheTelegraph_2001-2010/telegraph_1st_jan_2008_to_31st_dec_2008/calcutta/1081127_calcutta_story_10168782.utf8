          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have started cases against Trinamul Congress MLA Sonali Guha and others for obstructing officers of Nodakhali police station from performing their duties, intimidating them and confining them wrongfully.        
	Two cases have been started against Guha and others, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. On Tuesday, a mob led by Guha stormed the police station, abused the officers and confined them for more than five hours.        
	Guha and her party workers gheraoed the police station and locked the main gate from 5pm, demanding the arrest of those who had lynched an innocent person on November 20 and action against criminals.        
	The protesters also alleged that the police were arresting Trinamul supporters after levelling false charges against them.        
	On the night of November 20, members of a resistance group had lynched Abdullah Rafiq Mondal and injured four others suspecting them to be dacoits. The police later learnt that the five men had gone to a house to settle a marriage proposal.        
	The issue was raised in the Assembly, with CPM member Rabin Mondal alleging that Guha had tarnished the image of the House. I insulted the officers because of police atrocities on minorities in the area, Guha said in her reply.        
	Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee met Ranade and demanded that the cops play a more active role in curbing crime.

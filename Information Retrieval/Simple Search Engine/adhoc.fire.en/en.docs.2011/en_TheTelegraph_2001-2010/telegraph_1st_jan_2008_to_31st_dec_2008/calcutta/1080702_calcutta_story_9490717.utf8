          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 38-year-old woman was mistaken for a kidnapper by passengers of a local train and beaten up at Ballygunge railway station on Tuesday. She was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital with head injuries. Two passengers, including a woman, were arrested.        
	Sahera Banu was accompanying her sister-in-law, Anguri Begum, a resident of Mallickpur, in Baruipur, and her two children Muskan, 8, and Saira, 10, to their school in Park Circus. Sahera managed to board a crowded train with Muskan at Baruipur, while Anguri and Saira were left behind.        
	After the train left the station, Muskan started crying for her mother. The other passengers assumed that Sahera was kidnapping her.        
	The child failed to answer the passengers questions properly, leading to an altercation between them and Sahera. She was spared when an acquaintance identified her. Government Railway Police took her to MR Bangur Hospital.         
	Anguri, who had taken another train to Park Circus, rushed back to Ballygunge after being informed by the school.

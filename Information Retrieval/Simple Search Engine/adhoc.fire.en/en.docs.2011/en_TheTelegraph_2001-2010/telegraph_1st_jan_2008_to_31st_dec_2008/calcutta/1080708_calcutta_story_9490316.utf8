The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Push for parking space
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Push for parking space
  - Multi-level facility to be must   for commercial buildings          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                                  
	Shopping malls, business houses, private hospitals, big retail chains and high-rise residential buildings that come up in the future in Calcutta must have multi-level car parking facilities in them.        
	The civic authorities have decided to make multi-level car parking a mandatory condition for commercial complexes to begin with before extending it to high-rise residential buildings.        
	Now there are only two multi-level parking plazas in the city at the Park Street-end of Rawdon Street and under Lindsay Street. Both are owned by the municipal corporation.        
	The solution to the parking problem lies in multi-level facilities, said Dipankar De, the mayoral council member (building).        
	The building department is drawing up incentive packages for realtors, developers and owners of existing commercial buildings to make them interested in constructing parking areas.        
	By 2025, the projected peak-hour car population on the road in Calcutta has been estimated at over 500,000, which is more than double the number at present.        
	The decision has been taken in consultation with the city police. Like the CMC, the city police think that ground-level or basement parking facilities cannot cope with the emerging demand for parking. Police commissioner Goutam Mohan Chakraborty himself has taken an interest in creating parking space, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	A team has been formed with representatives from the CMC and the police that will visit Mumbai, Pune and Chennai to acquire knowledge about the effectiveness of multi-level car parking structures.         
	The objective of multi-level car parking is to increase the road space by stopping roadside parking. Calcutta has less road space than any other big city in the country.        
	Roadside parking on major thoroughfares like Brabourne Road has eaten up over 40 per cent of the road space.         
	Before introducing the mandatory provision for multi-level car parking, the civic authorities are holding discussions with Credai (the apex body of real estate developers/builders), companies that build multi-level car parking spaces and architects.        
	The first discussion  with Credai  was organised on Saturday in the presence of K. Harirajan, the additional commissioner of police (traffic), and Barun Roy, the secretary of CMDA.

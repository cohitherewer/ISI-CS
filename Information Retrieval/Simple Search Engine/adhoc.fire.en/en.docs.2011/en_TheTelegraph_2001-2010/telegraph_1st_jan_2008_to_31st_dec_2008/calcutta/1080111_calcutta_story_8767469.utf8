 Sense of kindred spirit

 - Cambridge vice-chancellor in city to strengthen partnership

             Alison Richard: Reciprocal ties
                    
	If there are academic high-flyers in Bengal with ambitions of proceeding to Cambridge for higher studies, prepare to submit your applications now. This is because Dr Alison Richard, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge, generally reckoned to be the top university in Britain (though Oxford folk would reverse the order), arrived in Calcutta on Thursday, determined to deepen an already deep relationship with India.
    
	Richard, who meets Cambridge alumni on Friday, told The Telegraph on arrival in Calcutta: One of the things that is very exciting to me is that, more and more, we are seeing Cambridge students coming to India as well as Indian students coming to Cambridge, so it is much more reciprocal. Increasingly, theres much more the feel of a real partnership about it.
    
	Richard is accompanied by her husband, Professor Bob Dewar, who has moved from America, where he is a distinguished academic in his own right, to Cambridge to support his wife. Richard joked: He has had a wonderful time in India. That is why he is out and about seeing Calcutta  meanwhile, his wife is busy working.
    
	At a more serious level, even though she is vice- chancellor, she cannot guarantee places to applicants, for entry at Cambridge is controlled by fiercely autonomous admissions tutors. I am very conscious of the fact that a vice-chancellor can only support and encourage...,she said.
    
	That said, Richard seems intent on ensuring that some of the best students who now head to the US, should put Cambridge at the top of their list. I dont think it is a question of recovering it (the Cambridge-India relationship), she said. It is much more a question of giving more visibility to the main ties there still are and then strengthening them further.
                
	In Delhi, Manmohan Singh, who acquired many of his ideas on economics when he was an undergraduate at St Johns in the 1950s, hosted a lunch for Richard. They talked business, for Cambridge has established a scholarship in his name tenable at St Johns.
    
	What an honour to be able to talk for a whole lunch with Dr Singh, said Richard, who flies to Mumbai on Friday for the final leg of her Indian visit.
    
	I was here before in 1979 but briefly and clearly India has changed a lot since then  but so have I. Arriving here last Thursday, I just feel a sense of kindred spirit, shared sense of purpose and opportunity with people that I have met over and over again.
    
	On a more personal note, she remarked: The warmth of the welcome has moved me deeply and I have had fun. Fun in the sense that I have met so many interesting and lively people and we debated and laughed and thought about the future and what we might be doing together.
    
	Richard has also been moved deeply by relationships. I have been learning a mile a minute. Its also been wonderful to see my Cambridge colleagues, to see the friendships that they have with academics here in India. We have had somewhere between 20 and 30 academics coming and going in the course of this trip. Some of them are relationships going back almost four decades. I have been moved at how deep these ties really do go, generation to generation.

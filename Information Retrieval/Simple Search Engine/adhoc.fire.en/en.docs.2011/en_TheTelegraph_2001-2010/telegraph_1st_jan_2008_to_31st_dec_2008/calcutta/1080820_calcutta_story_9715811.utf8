          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five city doctors were chargesheeted for death due to negligence under IPC Section 304A on Tuesday, almost 33 months after the father of a five-year-old lodged a police complaint alleging that his daughter died because of medical negligence.         
	Saibal Bose had lodged the complaint with the Shyampukur police in November 2005, two months after his daughter, Anushila, died from Dengue Shock Syndrome at a nursing home in Shyambazar.         
	The five accused include two senior doctors from the School of Tropical Medicine, two from the nursing home where Anushila was admitted on September 28, 2005, and another doctor who had been treating the girl since birth.         
	Before submitting the chargesheet, we sought the opinion of a medical board and forensic experts, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.         
	In his complaint, Saibal alleged that Anushila was taken to the School of Tropical Medicine but the doctors failed to gauge her condition.        
	On September 29, 2006, even after doctors realised that Anushilas platelet count had fallen drastically, they did not ask the family to shift her to a place that was better equipped to handle cases of dengue shock.        
	Anushila went into delirium and also developed acute abdominal pain. After 18 hours, she was shifted to the ICU, where she died three hours later.         
	Acting on Saibals complaint, a city court ordered a forensic probe and the body was exhumed from Muraripukur burial ground on January 9, 2006.        
	The post-mortem suggested the girl was suffering from Dengue Shock Syndrome. Forensic experts said the doctors could have handled the case better by advising the girls parents to shift her from the Shyambazar nursing home, which was not equipped to monitor dengue shock.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citizen amp; sentinel fail bag test
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citizen amp; sentinel fail bag test
  - Hustle, bustle and a blind eye                                              
	Every time there is a terror strike in any part of the country, an alert is sounded in Calcutta, vigil is stepped up and citizens are instructed to stay alert and to report anything suspicious to the nearest cop.         
	To gauge the alertness of citizens in the city  and also that of some pot-bellied policemen on guard  Metro visited a few densely-populated places armed with a blue bag full of old newspapers, batteries and some defunct electronic gadgets. We put the bag down and stepped away, hoping that someone would notice and react.        
	But even as Mumbai bled and burnt, Calcutta couldnt be bothered. This is how the citizens and its sentinels failed the blue bag test on Friday...              
	Sealdah station        
	Time: 11.05pm        
	Duration: 15 minutes        
	A solitary big blue bag lay on the platform. Some passersby even side-stepped it but no one paused or pressed the alarm. After about 10 minutes, the bag was moved to the southern section of the station near a makeshift RPF booth. The bag was barely two feet from the four cops sitting there but they did not lift a finger. Many passengers in a hurry even kicked the bag to clear their path. No one bothered to question the presence of the bag on the platform.              
	Belgachhia Metro station        
	Time: 12.30pm        
	Duration: 15 minutes        
	The big blue bag was replaced by a smaller black bag stuffed with old newspapers, just for the Metro. Two Calcutta Police personnel at the main entrance flaunting a hand-held detector did not bother to check the bag. On the platform, the bag was first placed on a steel ladder. The Down train to Tollygunge arrived just then and close to a hundred people crossed the ladder on their way out. Many passengers did notice the unclaimed bag but no one bothered to do anything about it.        
	The bag was then moved and put on one of the empty chairs on the platform. Many passengers were waiting for the next train to Tollygunge, several of them glanced at the bag. Nothing more.        
	Howrah station        
	Time: 1.45pm        
	Duration: 18 minutes        
	There seemed to be a security bustle at Howrah station with policemen marching up and down the platforms wearing bullet-proof jackets and wielding lathis. But they all turned a blind eye to the big blue bag lying unclaimed on platform No. 8 for close to 10 minutes. The passengers were too busy rushing past to care. To make the task of the security personnel easier, the bag was moved within two metres of the RPF booth where more than five personnel with guns were on vigil. But they too did not take note of the unclaimed bag right under their nose. There is talk that some top railway officials are going to visit the station. So, we are all on full alert, one of the RPF was overheard saying.              
	Howrah bridge        
	Time: 2.30pm        
	Duration: 10 minutes        
	The black bag was placed near one of the strong iron pillars of the iconic structure. Thousands of people walked past and hundreds of vehicles rolled by. The bag stayed put and the crowd surged on.        
	A lone cop on Howrah bridge stood some 200 metres from where the bag was. Was the bag at least caught on camera? The six recently-installed CCTV cameras will have the answer.              
	New Market entrance        
	Time: 3.15pm        
	Duration: 10 minutes        
	The footfall in the pedestrian zone was high. A group of students from a nearby school were having a fun photo-session while young couples sat near the fountain and families soaked in the November sun.        
	All this while, the blue bag was is full public view near one of the entrances to the underground parking lot. No one gave it a second look, no one spared a thought for what it might contain.

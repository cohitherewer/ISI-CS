	Book Fair 2008 will leave the civic body mdash; and the city rsquo;s taxpayers mdash; poorer by close to Rs 70 lakh.
 
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is spending that much money to doll up Park Circus Maidan for the fair, a commercial venture of a private organisation being supported by the civic body.
 
	In return, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, which organises the fair, is paying the civic body a paltry Rs 2.46 lakh mdash; Rs 2.21 lakh for using the ground and Rs 25,000 to the CMC heritage fund.
 
	 ldquo;Had the CMC charged according to the market rate for using the entire ground for a commercial purpose, the Guild would have had to cough up Rs 1.5 crore, rdquo; said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.
 
	Last year, a circus group had to pay Rs 14 lakh to the CMC for using a part of the ground. ldquo;To accommodate the Book Fair, the CMC had to turn down an offer of Rs 7 lakh from another circus group, rdquo; said an official of the civic body rsquo;s parks and garden wing. 
 
	In November, when the Guild first approached the CMC for permission to hold the fair in Park Circus, Khan had ruled out any concessions. 
 
	 ldquo;The Book Fair is a sales promotion event. If we can collect rent from a sick industry like the circus, why not from the Guild? rdquo; Khan had said.
 
	The mayor, however, sang a different tune. Defending the mammoth expenditure, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: ldquo;Millions will visit the ground during the fair and it is the civic body rsquo;s duty to ensure that they are not inconvenienced. rdquo;
 
	But why was the Guild allowed the concession at the cost of the taxpayers? ldquo;Book Fair 2008 is being held with support from the CMC, rdquo; the mayor said, hinting that the concession is actually a price the civic body is paying to see its name on the Book Fair banner.
 
	But what will the civic body gain from the expensive branding? ldquo;It rsquo;s stupid of the CMC to make such a sacrifice when most of the city rsquo;s parks are lying in neglect for want of funds, rdquo; said an official.
 
	Last month, the mayor had proposed to the Guild that Book Fair 2008 be held as a joint venture with the CMC. ldquo;After much deliberation, we have decided to hold the fair with support from the CMC, rdquo; said Sudhangshu Dey of the Guild.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	A fire broke out in a BSNL office on CR Avenue, barely 500 metres from Nandaram Market, on Wednesday afternoon.
    
	There was no injury or damage to property. Five tenders doused the blaze in 45 minutes.
    
	The memories of the 100-hour Nandaram blaze still fresh in their minds, those working in the building and local residents panicked on seeing the blaze.
    
	Police said the fire broke out on the ground floor of the building. The place where the flames were spotted was littered with broken furniture and rejected cables. We are yet to ascertain what had led to the fire, said a fire department official.
    
	Local residents noticed smoke billowing from the rear of the building around 12.15pm. They immediately alerted the BSNL officials, who called the fire brigade.
    
	Two tenders from the nearby fire station at Mohammad Ali Park rushed to the building. Three more soon joined them, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.
    
	BSNL officials failed to provide us with any lead. There were no electric cables where the fire broke out, the officer added.
    
	Fire alarm: A fire alarm in the newly opened South City Mall rang out around 1.40pm, spreading panic among shoppers. The authorities asked for the lights and the escalators to be switched off. Securitymen ran across the floors asking people to leave.
    
	Sanjeev Mehra, the vice-president of South City Mall, said: There is no fire. Somebody pulled the fire alarm. Seconds later, he added: Somebody from Pantaloons pulled the alarm. 
    
	A staff member of Pantaloons said: The fire panel was on for the past few days. Someone switched on the main panel. No one touched anything in the store.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	A young woman moved the high court on Thursday challenging the age limit set by the state school service commission for appointment of teachers in secondary schools.        
	Shatabdi Ghosh, who was planning to take the commissions recruitment test in December, cannot do so because she was born after January 1, 1988. But the Midnapore resident, who was born in July 1988, believes that the commissions age rule discriminates against those like her.        
	I have crossed 18 years. According to the Constitution, I am a major and I have voting rights. So, the commission cannot prevent me from getting a job, Shatabdi said in her petition.        
	She mentioned that the minimum qualification for getting the job of assistant teacher in schools under the state board was a bachelors degree with a certain percentage.        
	Though I have the required qualification, the commission is not allowing me to sit for the selection test because of my age, Shatabdi told the court.        
	Moving the petition before Justice S.K. Gupta, Shatabdis counsel Arun Maity and Kabery Maity informed the court that the commissions notification on the test was issued on August 26 this year.         
	The lawyers also said that in the notification, the panel had declared that the test for selecting candidates would be held on December 21, 2008.         
	But surprisingly, the notification stated that persons born after January 1, 1988, will not be allowed to take the test.        
	My client has all the academic qualifications specified for selection to the post of assistant teacher. Why will she not be allowed to sit in the examination? Maity asked.         
	The judge then asked Maity the age of his client.        
	She was born in July 1988. The commission issued the notification in August, by when my client had turned 20, Maity said.         
	Who will be held responsible if my client loses a year because of the panels decision, the lawyer asked.        
	Maity also submitted, Every citizen above 18 years of age has the right to employment, which is a fundamental right. Article 14 of the Constitution provides fundamental rights to each citizen. So, the commissions decision is contrary to Article 14.        
	Commission counsel Tapabrata Chakraborty will submit his reply on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cutie or hottie, hes the coolest 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cutie or hottie, hes the coolest 
  - Imran Khan breezes in with girlfriend, sells tickets and wows fans          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Imran Khan in town to promote Kidnap on Tuesday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	The last time he was in town was 20 Pujas ago as a five-year-old accompanying his mamujaan Aamir Khan to promote Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. On Tuesday, he was the star Khan accompanied by his jaan (sweetheart Avantika) to promote Kidnap.        
	Man-of-the-moment Imran Khan made sure that Puja came a week early for all those who flocked to INOX Swabhumi (formerly 89 Cinemas) on Tuesday evening. He even sold tickets for the Thursday shows of his second Bollywood release.        
	Riding the super success of Jaane Tu Yaa Jaane Na, Imran might not have created the kind of frenzy Hrithik Roshan did, when he came to Calcutta after the release of Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, but cries of hes such a cutie to hes so hot to hans de tu zara from the popular Kabhi kabhi Aditi number followed him everywhere.        
	Honestly, I dont remember anything from the QSQT trip... I was so small, laughed the 25-year-old Capricorn. And this time too, I was so tired coming from Ahmedabad I could hardly look around.        
	If he did, Imran would have surely looked for chomchom and kheer kodombo. I am not much into sweets but I cant get enough of Bengali sweets, he said, with an earnestness that belied the mishti cliche of celebrities passing through Calcutta.        
	But the Bengali beauties vying for a second glance from the now-bearded hottie were disappointed. I am not engaged but I do have a girlfriend for six years and Im doing fine, said he, flashing the now-famous Jai Singh Rathore smile from Jaane Tu.        
	Girlfriend Avantika , who drove in with Imran but avoided the spotlight and left before he was mobbed by fans, looked fetching in a blue dress while her hero held forth in a white T-shirt and blue jeans.        
	Is that the only tattoo you have? shouted a girl, referring to the tattoo on the back of his neck he flaunts in the Kidnap promos. Why do you ask? quizzed Imran. If I say yes, you will ask where all!        
	Tattoo talk turned to beard basics. Thats for Aamirs new home production Delhi Belly, he revealed.        
	A tough-looking kidnapper and then a bearded guy  what happened to the chocolate-boy hero? I would like to believe I am a better actor who has more than one image, smiled the cool dude.

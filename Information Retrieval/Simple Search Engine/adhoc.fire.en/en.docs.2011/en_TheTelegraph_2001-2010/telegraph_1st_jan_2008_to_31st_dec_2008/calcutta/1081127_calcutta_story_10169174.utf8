  - Passengers stranded in city after Bangkok airport closure          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The indefinite closure of Bangkok airport is likely to force the cancellation of all flights between Calcutta and the Thai capital on Thursday.         
	The three flights of Druk Air, Thai Airways and Jet Airways between Calcutta and Bangkok on Wednesday had to be cancelled. The two scheduled arrivals from Bangkok, too, were cancelled, said an airport official.        
	Three Bangkok-bound flights from Delhi, Mumbai and Istanbul were diverted to Calcutta, he added.        
	Air India cancelled all flights to the Thai capital on Thursday while Jet Airways will to take a final call after assessing the situation during the day.         
	Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi international airport remained paralysed for the second consecutive day on Wednesday after protesters besieged it as months of political tension escalated into a crisis.        
	Failing to land at the airport, a Jet Airways flight, which had taken off from Mumbai with 70 passengers on Wednesday morning, was diverted to Calcutta.         
	Two other aircraft  a Jet Airways flight from Delhi and a Turkish Airline flight from Istanbul  also landed in Calcutta.         
	After waiting for over five hours, the two Jet Airways flights returned to Delhi and Mumbai. A Turkish airline flight is still at the city airport, waiting for things to improve. Airline officials said if the Bangkok airport was closed on Thursday, they would divert it to Hong Kong, said the official.         
	Those bound for Bangkok from the city were also hit hard by the cancellations.        
	I had to attend an important meeting in Bangkok. I do not know when I will be able to make it to the city, said Amit Paul, a city-based doctor.        
	He was supposed to take the 1.55am Thai Airways flight to Bangkok on Wednesday.         
	Thai Bhande, a Thai national who was to return to the country with 29 other tourists from Bodh Gaya in Bihar, said: Given the situation, I dont think we will be able to return home before the weekend.         
	The siege at Suvarnabhumi airport led to scores of fliers cancelling their tickets to Bangkok.        
	I have cancelled my booking on the Jet Airways flight on Thursday. Even if the flights operate, I am not sure whether it would be safe to visit Bangkok or not, said Rajesh Gidwani, a city-based trader.        
	Many of the passengers who were to fly out on Thursday have taken refunds while others have opted for fresh tickets with open bookings, said a spokesperson for Air India.

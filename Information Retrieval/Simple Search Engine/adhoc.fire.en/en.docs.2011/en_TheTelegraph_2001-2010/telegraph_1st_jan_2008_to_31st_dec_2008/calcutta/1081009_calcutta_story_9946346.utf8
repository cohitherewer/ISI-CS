                      Figurative creations                    Art of the 21st century has been characterised by an uncertainty regarding its form and content. New generation artists employ strategies of image making like video art and other techno-based forms that were virtually unknown to earlier generations. Gen Next III, the ongoing group show of art works by 40 artists from all over the world, marks the culmination of a continued attempt to showcase innovative works by promising talents. The exhibition is remarkable for its abundance of figurative works. Ranging from realistic imagery of digital sharpness to free-form figures, figurative art definitely dominates the show. Symbolic motifs are evoked by digital manipulation and placed on a pictorial space of no specific semantic dimensions. In some works, there are references to photography, pre-modern art, miniature painting and ad visuals that offer a clue to the significance of the compositions. Participants: Ashraful Hasan (Bangladesh), Dionne Simpson (Jamaica), Gregory Chenu Vidal (France), Maciej Gador (Poland; a painting by him appears here) and other foreign and Indian artists.

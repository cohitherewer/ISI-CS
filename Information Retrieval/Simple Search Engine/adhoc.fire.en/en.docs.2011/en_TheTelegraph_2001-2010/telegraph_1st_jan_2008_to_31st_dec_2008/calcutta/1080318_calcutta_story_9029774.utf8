                      Enchanting images                    The mother-daughter pair of Meite Delteil (a painting by her appears left) and Maya Burman is a part of the minority of artists who draw inspiration from pleasant, happy and homely themes. Smile of the Hearth, the ongoing exhibition of their paintings, shows a meticulous build-up of pictorial content, with nuanced, delicate handling of forms and figures. In colours that are bold, vibrant and evocative, yet smooth and placid in treatment, their landscapes and life-scapes appear to belong to an enchanted world. While the mother provides glimpses of her private vision as well as an imaginative impression of the world outdoors, her daughters works are most remarkable for their decorative detail, in lush and lavish floral patterns, adorning clothes, draperies or neutral spaces.                  Event: Paintings by Meite Delteil and Maya Burman When: Till March 19; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

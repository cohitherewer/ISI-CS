The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cloudy festive Friday
                                                                                                               Cloudy festive Friday
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Holi is more likely to be wet than hot, with the weatherman predicting rain or thundershower on festive Friday.        
	The sky over Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal may remain cloudy on Friday morning, with a possibility of rain or thundershower in the afternoon or evening, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	Light rain was reported from the city and its surrounding areas on Thursday evening, with Norwesters hitting North-24 Parganas and Nadia districts.        
	A wind from the south has been sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal for the past few days, abetted by the development of a low-pressure trough over Gangetic Bengal.        
	As a result, big masses of convective clouds have formed over the city and the rest of south Bengal, said a Met department official.        
	The development of thunderclouds over Gangetic Bengal prompted the Met office to issue a squall warning for Thursday night.        
	Officials said if the current conditions prevail, there is a possibility of Norwesters hitting town in the next few days.        
	This is Norwester season. The phenomenon responsible for Norwesters helps keep the maximum temperature under check, explained an official.        
	The maximum temperature in Calcutta on Thursday was 35.8 degrees Celsius.

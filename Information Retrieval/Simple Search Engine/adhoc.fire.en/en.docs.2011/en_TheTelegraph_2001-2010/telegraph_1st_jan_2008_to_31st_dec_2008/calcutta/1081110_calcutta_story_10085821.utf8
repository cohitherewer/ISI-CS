          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Belle Vue Clinic is poised for an expansion with the installation of a state-of-the-art ventilator and intensive therapy unit equipment (ITU). In the pipeline are neonatal and high dependency units and intensive cardiac care equipment.        
	The clinic, which opened a new 20-bed ITU on Sunday, will spend around Rs 17 crore on the expansion. The neonatal and cardiac units will be set up in the extended part of the hospital, said H.V. Lodha, a member of the board of trustees of Belle Vue. The two units will add 60 beds to the 130-bed hospital.        
	The new ITU unit, inaugurated by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, is equipped with retrieve mode ventilators, state-of-the art defibrillators and other equipment.        
	Around Rs 3 crore was spent on the setting up of the unit, which has beds that can be adjusted according to the requirements of a critical patient.        
	The retrieve mode ventilators not only provide artificial respiratory support to patients but also help them breathe on their own partially, said an official of the clinic. This helps the patient slowly come out of ventilator support and breathe on his own.        
	The defibrillator, a device that delivers an electric shock to the heart to stop certain forms of rapid heart rhythm disturbances, is also an improved version.        
	In older versions of the device, the electrodes often damaged heart muscles and a patient suffering from cardiac arrest had to spend a long time in the hospital to get treated for the heart muscles, the official explained.        
	The new defibrillator has an advanced technology which ensures that the shock does not damage the heart muscles and at the same time restores the rhythm of the heart beat. It also has an automatic mode which can be operated by an untrained person, he pointed out.        
	The hospital had a 14-bed ITU that was not enough to accommodate all patients in need of critical care. Because of lack of beds, we had to often turn back critical care patients, said Lodha.        
	Belle Vue is also planning to come up with a nursing school. We are looking for land to build the nursing school in the vicinity of the hospital, he said. The hospital is trying to identify a plot off the EM Bypass.

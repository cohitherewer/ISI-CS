                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Citu heckles airline official
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A senior Air India official was manhandled and gheraoed by Citu supporters at Calcutta airports international cargo terminal on Monday.        
	The 200-odd men, most of whom are not employed by Air India, targeted the airport manager of the airlines international operations when he tried to resume work stalled by them.        
	Air India is responsible for the ground handling of cargo of most airlines operating out of Calcutta. It has outsourced part of the work to a private agency.        
	On Monday morning, about 40 workers of the agency, who support the NSCBI Airport Ground Workmens Union, started a non-cooperation agitation at the international cargo terminal to press for regular payment and other demands. Cargo was scheduled to be loaded on an Emirates flight from Calcutta to Dubai around that time.        
	To ensure that an international client (Emirates) did not face problems, the official went to the terminal with loaders employed by Air India around 10am to start work. He was gheraoed after an altercation with the agitators, said a spokesperson for the airline.        
	The official said he was manhandled and gheraoed by the agitators in his office for hours. About 200 men, mostly outsiders, surrounded the official and pushed and abused him, said witnesses.         
	The Central Industrial Security Force was summoned to control the situation. Senior leaders of the Citu-backed Airports Authority Employees Union also visited the spot.        
	Loading was stalled till 3pm. Emirates employees had to load the cargo on their own, said an airport official.         
	As principal employer, it is Air Indias responsibility to ensure that the staff are regularly paid by the agency, said Dipankar Ghosh, the secretary of airport union.

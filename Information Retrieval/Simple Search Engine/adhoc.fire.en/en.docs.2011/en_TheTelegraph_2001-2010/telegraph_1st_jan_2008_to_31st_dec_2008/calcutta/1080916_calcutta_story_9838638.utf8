                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Streetcar named   style
  - Makeover for Calcutta icon                                                          
	Four trams with an international look will hit the Calcutta tracks around Mahalaya. Metro takes a sneak peek into the refurbished trams, which were launched at Nonapukur depot on Monday.         
	Exterior: The classy colour combination and the transparent roofs and windows will provide visual relief to Calcuttans tired of seeing the iron junks that ply on the tracks now. The driver, too, gets a glass cabin.        
	Interior: Bucket seats with cushion take the place of their stiff wooden predecessors. The class system, too, goes, with fans in both compartments. The fans have become smaller but are better placed and more efficient, according to Calcutta Tram Company (CTC) engineers.         
	Technology: CTC chief engineer C.S. Bhattacharjee says the four trams are refurbished versions of the old ones. There are no technological improvements in the new vehicles, each of which has been developed at a cost of Rs 11,50,000 at the Nonapukur depot.         
	We could have increased the maximum speed but chose not to. Trams that we see on the roads can comfortably do 40 kmph, he said.        
	The new models will have uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which would allow fans and lights to run for 45 minutes even if there is no power supply, added Bhattacharjee.        
	Plus: The new trams will have a pair of powerful headlights. There will also be indicators to signal whether the vehicle will go left or right.         
	But: Calcuttans musnt get too excited. Of the 260 trams that CTC owns, only 130 ply in the city as many routes have been discontinued. Only four trams of the new model are being introduced, so spotting one on the road will be quite a task. There are plans to commission another 10 trams of the new model.

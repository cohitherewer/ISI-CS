                      Swinging with jazz                    In the tradition of the jazz French swing of Django Reinhardt and Stphane Grappelli, Le Petit Orchestre Swing de France (The Small Orchestra Swing of France) makes listeners relive the story of the French jazz strings by taking them back to old times. Formed in 2005 after a jam session between violinist Laurent Zeller and guitarists Alain Wilsch and Gilles Parodi, Le Petit Orchestre Swing de France features musicians of different backgrounds who make us share their passion for jazz and French songs associated with the rhythms and colours of the Manouche and American swing. On a music tour of India with the Alliances Franaises since last month, this evening Laurent Zeller (violin), Gilles Parodi (rhythm guitar) and Laurent Bajata (solo guitar; instead of Alain Wilsch who is unavailable) present a trio jazz gipsy swing concert. Breaking free from classical tradition, the ensemble music group will present a high-ranging repertoire of selected classical pieces, emphasising the sensuous and symphonic effects available to the modern orchestra. Hosted by Alliance Franaise du Bengale in collaboration with Calcutta School of Music. Coordinated by Alliance Franaise Hyderabad.                    Event: Jazz concert presented by Le Petit Orchestre Swing de France When: Today at 7 pmlWhere: Calcutta School of Music, Sandre Hall

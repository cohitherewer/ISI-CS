           Russian rendezvous
          Common elements in their natural ethos and perceptions, as well as common vulnerabilities, have strengthened and enriched the spiritual empathy, understanding and friendship between Russia and India. As part of the Friendship Year of Russia in India, Colours of Russia (Where Asia meets Europe), the ongoing exhibition, offers a fresh and original vision of contemporary Russia. The paintings and photographs on show are both formal and informal, each narrating a story of life hitherto untold. Hosted by Cultural Department of the Russian Federation Consulate General in Calcutta and Asia Centre, Calcutta.

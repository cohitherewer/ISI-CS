The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A brighter, greener puja
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A brighter, greener puja
                              An LED puja decoration in Chandernagore                            
	Use of LED is better for the pujas. The proof is right next door for Calcutta. In 2005, LED lamps were used for the first time in a pandal in Chandernagore during Jagaddhatri puja, instead of regular bulbs. The organisers were criticised for breaking with tradition. Four years on, two-thirds of the pujas have used the new-age electrical installations, and no one is complaining.        
	Though reduced electrical cost was the incentive, LED also served the green cause as less electricity was consumed, which means less coal was burnt and less carbon dioxide was produced.        
	Chandernagore is famous for its intricate puja lighting patterns and innovativeness. Sridhar Das, an electrical artist from Chandernagore who has decorated the Thames in London, was involved with at least 10 pujas that preferred LED lamps over traditional fairy lights (tooni bulb).         
	While in traditional lighting some 25 kilowatts are required to light up a 30 ft x 12 ft gate, with LED, only 425 watts are required and the quality of illumination is better, said Das.         
	He had used the same method in a Calcutta puja this year and the electricity bill was reduced from Rs 1.15 lakh last year Rs 17,000!         
	We expect about 25 tonnes carbon dioxide will be emitted less this year, said a member of the Chandernagore NGO Sabujer Avijan.                     JAYANTA BASU

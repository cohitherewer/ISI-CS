                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Summer flip of fruits 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Untimely rain and storms have put paid to hopes of a bumper mango harvest this season. But those who love apples can rejoice as supplies from the US, New Zealand and Australia will reach markets in 10 days.        
	Scarcity will push up the prices of mangoes. According to Sohrab, Himsagar will be costlier than Lyangra. The average market price of Himsagar will be over Rs 30 per kg and Lyangra will cost more than Rs 25 per kg. Last year, the prices were between Rs 20 and Rs 30.        
	Calcutta consumes over 12 lakh kg of mango daily during summer and is especially fond of Himsagar and Lyangra. Alfonso has a negligible share at the higher end of the market.         
	Rain has played havoc with mango production in Andhra Pradesh. Storms and showers over the last two months in Murshidabad, Malda and Hooghly also affected production, added Sohrab.        
	Unlike other years, the sale of mangoes has not picked up in the third week of April. The Gulab Khas variety from Andhra Pradesh is yet to arrive. Lyangra may not hit the market before the first week of June, feel the fruit merchants at Mechhua.        
	The production in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, has been good.        
	About 40 truckloads of mangoes arrive at Mechhua daily during summer. The number has come down to 22-25 this season.        
	The price of the US variety of apple will be Rs 100 per kg while the fruits from Australia and New Zealand will sell for about Rs 90, said the president of Mechhua Fruit Merchants Association, Mohammad Sohrab.        
	The supply of apples has dwindled since the season ended in January. But apples harvested in Australia and New Zealand in March can keep up the supply in Calcutta markets.

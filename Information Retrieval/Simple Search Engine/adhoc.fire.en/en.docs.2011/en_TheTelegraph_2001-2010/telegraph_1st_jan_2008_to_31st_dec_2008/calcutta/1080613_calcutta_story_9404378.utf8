                Afza Rehman Sheikh, a 56-year-old Bangladeshi cancer patient coming to Calcutta for treatment on a Jet Airways Dhaka-Calcutta flight, fell ill and started vomiting just before the aircraft was to touch down on Thursday afternoon, officials said. Doctors of the Airports Authority of India attended to her. Later, she was taken to a cancer centre at Thakurpukur.    Mohanlal Laha, 81, drowned at Ahiritola Ghat, in Jorabagan, on Thursday afternoon. Police said Laha was sitting on the Hooghly bank when he accidentally fell in. Local youths rescued him and took him to hospital, where he was declared dead.     Police recovered a black bag with Rs 1.12 lakh, along with US $200 and Singapore $200, after raiding the Manoharpukur Road home of Sonu Paswan, alias Putul, on Thursday in connection with Tuesdays burglary in a Tollygunge apartment, in which more than Rs 10 lakh in jewellery and cash were looted. Investigations revealed that burglar Rajesh Paswan, of Darbhanga, Bihar, had masterminded the robbery. Paswan would stay with his maternal aunt Sonu when he was in the city. Sonu told the police she had no idea what the bag contained. She said Rajesh had asked her to keep the bag safe until he returned for it.    Power failures led to about 10 surgeries being deferred by a couple of hours in two departments of SSKM Hospital on Thursday. I received calls from the cardiology and urology departments around noon and immediately informed the PWD. The problem was addressed promptly, said Anirban Ghoshal, the deputy superintendent of SSKM.

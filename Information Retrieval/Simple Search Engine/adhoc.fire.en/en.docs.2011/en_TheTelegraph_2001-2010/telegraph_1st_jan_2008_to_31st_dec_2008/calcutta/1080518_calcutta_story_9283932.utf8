The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ...   Bagora
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Next weekend you can be at ...   Bagora
                                                
	Scenery and serenity come together in Bagora, offering a soothing refuge from the frenetic city life. Perched on a ridge at 2,339 metres above sea level, this town in north Bengal is still unspoilt by the demands of tourism. Those who leave for the hills without advance booking will do well to try Bagora rather than Darjeeling or Kalimpong.         
	Take the serpentine Hill Cart Road (NH 55)  intertwining with the toy train tracks  from Siliguri. Buses ply regularly between Siliguri and Darjeeling via Kurseong and Ghoom. If you are driving down, you can take a right turn from Kurseong to reach Bagora via Dow Hill Road (16 km). The drive, through a road lined with conifers, is pleasant.        
	The other option is to follow Hill Cart Road up to Dilaram before taking the right turn. The road is like a long black ribbon lying in a virgin green forest of silver fir, oak, pine and birch. The forest is richer than those near Darjeeling. If you have the energy, trek the 3 kilometres from Bagora to Dilaram. It should take about an hour.                  
	There are many rewarding walks and trekking trails from Bagora, which is known as zero point. A short stroll will take you near the core area of Kurseong Air Force base, from where you can enjoy a view of the vast expanse of the Teesta.        
	Head towards the Forest Rest House to enjoy a wide variety of Himalayan flora. The well-maintained flower garden, with its terraced greenhouses, is a sight to behold. Birdwatchers would also love the variety of feathers in the region.        
	Those who put up at Diki House, situated on a hillock, will have a birds eye view of the entire settlement with the mighty Kanchenjunga for backdrop. If you have an appetite for adventure, walk down the dark jungle trail to Tiger Hill to watch the famous sunrise.        
	One can plan a 12-km trek to Mongpu, too.        
	If you are staying more than a weekend in Bagora, consider a three-day forest trek from Kurseong to Kalijhora via Bagora, Namthing Pokhri (11 km from Bagora) and Latpanchar (15 km from Bagora).        
	Bagora is famous for its medicinal and herbal plants. In October-November, the trees are laden with oranges. The colour of the fruit blends with the jade green of the trees.        
	Apart from taking long walks, theres not much to do but relax under the turquoise sky and enjoy the view of the icy mountains. Click or paint to capture natures might and magnificence.  
	Going   
	Follow Hill Cart Road (NH 55) from Siliguri to Kurseong or Dilaram (just after Kurseong). Buses and cars are easily available from Siliguri to Darjeeling via Kurseong and Ghoom. Take a right turn at Kurseong to reach Bagora via Dow Hill (16 km) if you are travelling by car. If you want to reach Bagora via Dilaram, either trek the last 3 km through the forest or hire a car from Kurseong.  
	Staying   
	Diki House is a cosy and comfortable option. The tariff is about Rs 800 per day. Food is available on request. The other option is to stay in Kurseong, where there are plenty of hotels, and undertake a day trip to Bagora.      (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER PARAG BANERJEE FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

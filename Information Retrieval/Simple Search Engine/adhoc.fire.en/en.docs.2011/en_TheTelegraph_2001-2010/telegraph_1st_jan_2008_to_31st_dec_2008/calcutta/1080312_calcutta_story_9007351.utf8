The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Body not of Riz, say kin
                                                                                                               Body not of Riz, say kin
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Rizwanur Rahmans family has claimed that the body that was passed off as the computer graphics designers was that of a 55-year-old.        
	Two cases have been mixed up deliberately to prove that Rizwanur had committed suicide and was not killed, Kalyan Banerjee, the Rahmans lawyer, said on Tuesday. The claim comes a day before the high court starts the final hearing on the CBI report, which has stated that the youth had killed himself.        
	The documents that the government had produced in the court along with its affidavit reveal that the GRP had recovered the body of a 55- year-old man from the railway tracks on September 21, the day Rizwanur was killed. This proves that the person who died in the train accident was not Rizwanur, for he was only 29 years old, said Banerjee.        
	The FIR that the superintendent of Dum Dum Junction had filed states that an unidentified male body, aged about 55 years was recovered from the tracks, the lawyer claimed. Even the GRP, which had carried the body away, admitted that victims age was 55, Banerjee added.        
	No one from Rizwanurs family had identified the body on the spot. One of his relatives had identified it in the morgue, he said. The claims of the family have been included in the affidavit it had submitted to the court on Monday.        
	The Rahmans have also alleged that the government had failed to clarify in its affidavit why police had interfered in the married life of Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi. It has only tried to shield the guilty police officers, the familys affidavit alleged.        
	With all the respondents having filed their affidavits, the stage is set for the final hearing. Justice Dipankar Dutta had scheduled the final hearing for March 12 and 19. After hearing out all sides, the court will decide whether the CBI will be asked to continue its proceedings and file charges against those found guilty of abetment to suicide, said a source.

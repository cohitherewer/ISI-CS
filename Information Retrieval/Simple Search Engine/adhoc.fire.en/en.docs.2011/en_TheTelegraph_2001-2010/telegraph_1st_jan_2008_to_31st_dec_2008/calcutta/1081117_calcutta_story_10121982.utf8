          A STAFF REPORTER                                           Sunita Ghosh    An ailing 28-year-old homemaker was found hanging in her bedroom a day after she called her mother to say that her husband had kicked her so hard in the stomach that it caused internal bleeding.        
	Police arrested Sunita Ghoshs husband Bidyut, 32, and his parents from their residence in Shib Narayan Das Lane, near College Street, on Sunday after her family filed an FIR alleging mental and physical torture for dowry. They have been remanded in jail custody for 10 days.        
	Sunita had not been keeping well of late  she had a chronic gynaecological problem  but it was the alleged torture at the hands of her husband and in-laws that drove her to death, her parents said.        
	The family said Sunita had overdosed on sleeping pills during a bout of depression earlier this year.         
	Bidyut, a dealer in aluminium utensils, was Sunitas second husband. Her first marriage to an allegedly abusive husband ended in divorce in 2006 but the ghost of physical torture refused to leave her. Earlier this year, Bidyut broke her nose in a fit of anger. When she cried for help, he attempted to throw her from the balcony, her father Samar Sen, who owns a musical instruments shop, said.        
	Samar said his daughter once confided in her mother that even her father-in-law Bhabatosh, 65, had tried to molest her on several occasions.         
	Bidyut told investigators that he returned home from a cultural programme around 2.30am on Sunday and found his bedroom locked from inside. He claimed to have peeped through the window and seen Sunita hanging by a stole from the ceiling fan and their one-and-a-half-year-old daughter Ashmita crying, an officer at Amherst Street police station said.         
	A police team on night patrol reached the house after hearing the commotion there but Bidyut had broken open the door and brought down the body by then.         
	Sunitas mother Shikha said her daughter had become used to being tortured. Bidyut used to beat and kick her almost every night after returning home drunk. We had given him more than Rs 2 lakh over the past two years but he still used to torture my daughter and had even threatened to kill her. She called me on Saturday to say that a kick in the belly had aggravated her gynaecological ailment and she was bleeding.         
	We have lodged a dowry death case and are waiting for the post-mortem report to make the next move, a police officer said.

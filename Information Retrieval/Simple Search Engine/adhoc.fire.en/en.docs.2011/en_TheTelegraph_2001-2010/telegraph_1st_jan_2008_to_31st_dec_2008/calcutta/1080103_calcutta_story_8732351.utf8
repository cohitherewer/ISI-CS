	An experimental theatre group from the city is striving to take plays beyond the stage and make them the means of social change.        
	Jana Sanskriti  Centre for the Theatre of the Oppressed specialises in forum theatre, in which spectators become actors. The groups interactive plays have dealt with domestic violence, sexual harassment, patriarchy, caste, superstition, alcoholism and communal harmony. They have been staged in both urban and rural areas.        
	Jana Sanskriti has units in Tripura, Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan. The members include professionals as well as amateurs. The group aims to reach out to 1.5 lakh people by holding 900 shows across the country this year.        
	The idea is to build up a cultural movement that equips people to fight oppression in their daily lives, said Sanjoy Ganguly, the director and founder-member of Jana Sanskriti.        
	This year, the groups focus will be on the lack of quality in education provided by the government. The plays, staged to create awareness among the people, will double as a survey of what people think about the education system. The findings and recommendations will be published as a report in 2009. It will be handed over to the central education department and education planners.        
	After performing a play, we ask people in the audience to come up and take over the roles of the protagonists. We ask them to react as they would if they were faced with the same situation. This helps us to tap into popular sentiment, explained Ganguly.        
	Interactive theatre gets spectators out of their shell and makes them come out with what they actually feel, said Ratnabali Bhattacharjee, a Mumbai-based actress who has done interactive theatre.        
	Ganguly is conducting a seven-day workshop on forum theatre in Madhyamgram with professionals and students from Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the US. Those attending the workshop will perform across the state, starting on January 6 at Pathar Pratima, in South 24-Parganas. The final show will be at Forum Theatre Festival at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre on January 9.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Autos in ban protest

	Thousands of autorickshaws went off the roads on Monday as their drivers marched to a protest rally against the ban on two-stroke autos from January 1, 2009.        
	With a shortage of autos and the protesters spoiling for a fight with auto drivers who plied their vehicles, commuters were the worst sufferers.         
	The protesters gathered on Rani Rashmoni Avenue under Auto Bachao Committee, an umbrella organisation floated by Trinamul Congress, demanding two-stroke autos be allowed to convert to cleaner fuel, for which they wanted a three-month window.        
	While the drivers voiced their demand, commuters were stranded on Rashbehari Avenue, and in Behala, Garia, Jadavpur, Gol Park, Esplanade Sovabazar and other areas.        
	I waited for 20 minutes to take an auto to Kalighat Metro station but was forced to board a packed bus, said Achintya Halder, a resident of Pathakpara, Behala.        
	Leaders of Citu-backed auto unions said their members had not joined the rally, but Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, the president of Auto Bachao Committee, claimed a number of Citu supporters have joined us for the sake of their livelihood.         
	In Ultadanga, some auto drivers heckled passengers in shuttle taxis and even slapped a bus driver who was picking up passengers near VIP Road.        
	Commuters complained that some auto drivers charged more and Citu supporters in Behala alleged that Trinamul men damaged 10 autos and beat up the drivers and passengers.

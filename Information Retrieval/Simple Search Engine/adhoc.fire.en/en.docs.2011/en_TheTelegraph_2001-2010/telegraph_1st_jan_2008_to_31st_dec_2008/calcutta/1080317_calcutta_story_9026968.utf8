	Four youths were arrested in the past two days on charges of snatching valuables from pedestrians at gunpoint.        
	It seems they are not part of any organised gang, said Rajesh Subarna, the deputy commissioner of police (south). All four reportedly told the police that they had snatched valuables, including jewellery and cellphones, from pedestrians.        
	Bapi Singh, 21, was caught in the Gol Park area by a team of plainclothesmen from Lake police station. We spotted him while he was walking in front of a sweet shop. He was moving suspiciously. We searched him and found a single-shot tucked in his waist, said an officer.        
	Rabi Das, 26, was picked up from the crossing of Satish Mukherjee Road and Manoharpukur Road. He was wanted in a number of snatching and extortion cases. An improvised firearm was found on him, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.        
	Mohammad Azharuddin, 19, was caught at the crossing of Ballygunge Circular Road and Puddapukur Road, in the Ballygunge area.        
	A team from Park Street police station arrested a youth named Bablu while he was standing on the pavement of Kyd Street. He was allegedly carrying a single-shot.

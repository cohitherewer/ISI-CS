	Underground electric cables exploded barely 10 ft from the petrol pump on the premises of the Lalbazar police headquarters on Tuesday afternoon.
    
	The underground wires between the transformer and the feeder box exploded, resulting in sparks and smoke that covered the compound, triggering panic among policemen.
    
	Three foam fire extinguishers, available at the headquarters, were used to douse the sparks. Two fire tenders were later pressed into service.
    
	There was no power supply to the central lock-up, traffic section and the building housing the wireless department and the control room after the incident.
    
	What exactly led to the blast is yet to be ascertained. Engineers from CESC are trying to find out the cause. No one was injured, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).
    
	The blast was loud enough to send officers scurrying to the spot, to find sparks and thick smoke emanating from the transformer that was installed to supply power to the police headquarters.
    
	Our underground fuel tank and a machine to pump out fuel are close to the transformer. A massive blast would have occurred had the tank caught fire, said an officer. 
    
	According to another officer, the narrow gap between the transformer and the fuel tank was a cause for concern. 
    
	The foam fire extinguishers helped us douse the sparks before the fire tenders arrived from the nearby fire station, said deputy commissioner Goyal.

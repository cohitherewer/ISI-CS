The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | East-West inches on
                                                                                                               East-West inches on
  - Delhi nod for signing loan agreement        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The proposed East-West Metro moved a step closer to fruition, with Union finance minister P. Chidambaram giving the go-ahead for signing the loan agreement.        
	The Centre and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will ink the agreement on March 10.        
	The bank will provide half the project cost of Rs 4,675 crore as soft loan, while the Centre and the state government will shoulder the rest.        
	Work on the project, which will link Howrah and Salt Lake, is scheduled to start in March-April 2008. It is likely to be complete by October 2014, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said at Writers Buildings.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had written to Chidambaram, requesting him to mention the project in his Budget speech.        
	Chowdhury will attend a Public Investment Board (PIB) meeting on March 3 to decide on the share of the Centre and the state in the project cost. A PIB nod is a must for projects worth Rs 50 crore or more.        
	Following the signing of the agreement, the government will set up a company called Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation, which will execute the project.        
	The government will have to acquire 1.08 hectares to construct the Mahakaran and Central stations of East-West Metro. The 600-odd people to be displaced will be rehabilitated near Poddar Court and on AJC Bose Road.         
	The transport department owns a 17-cottah plot off Poddar Court and a 76-cottah plot on AJC Bose Road. Shops and houses for the displaced will be built on these two plots.        
	Part of the 13.77-km East-West route, from Salt Lakes Sector V to Howrah station, will pass under the Hooghly. There will be 12 stations, including Sealdah, Bowbazar and BBD Bag. The route will cross the North-South Metro Railway at Central station.        
	There will be adequate integration between the Metro Railway and the proposed East-West corridor, said an official in the transport department.        
	nSubhas plea: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has urged railway minister Lalu Prasad to consider an integrated Metro service for the city. The minister has agreed to my proposal on principle, he added.

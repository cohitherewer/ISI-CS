          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	Urban traffic planners of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) have identified six problems that need to be redressed immediately for Calcutta to become a world-class city by 2025.        
	Two major problems the Besu has identified in its report to the civic body are determining the new alignment of roads and widening 50 thoroughfares.        
	S.K. Roy, the principal consultant of Besu, said the alignment fixed by the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) more than 50 years ago are no longer relevant.        
	Revising the alignment and widening of roads will call for removal of roadside encroachments and even demolition of some buildings. For that, the state government will have to take policy decisions, said an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The Besu experts have also suggested an enactment to classify the roads in Calcutta for their better upkeep. We dont have the system of classifying roads along with details of the treatment each requires, the official pointed out.        
	The report called for an overhaul of traffic engineering and the signalling system at major crossings for smooth flow of vehicles and to ensure that pedestrians get enough time to cross roads. The experts pointed out that the signal at some crossings remains red for 300 seconds, which is too long for smooth movement of vehicles and pedestrians.

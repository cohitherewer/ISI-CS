          A STAFF REPORTER                          Seeking accreditation                                  
	Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, will seek accreditation from two leading American and European agencies.         
	The decision to apply to the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the European Foundation for Management Development was taken at a meeting of the board of governors of the Joka institute on Wednesday.        
	The accreditation would make the institute eligible for taking part in business school surveys across the globe. It is a step towards putting the IIM in the global ranking, said Dinesh Varma, the chief administrative officer of IIM Calcutta.        
	The accreditation will also help the institute attract more foreign students and tie-up with universities abroad. We hope to set the ball rolling soon, added Varma.        
	Also on the agenda on Wednesday was the review of the institutes plans for expansion and restructuring. The expansion project is on track. A committee will chalk out a financial plan to support the project as well as hike the salary of the faculty according to the Sixth Pay Commissions recommendation.        
	The institute is also planning to recruit more faculty members. We will recruit five new faculty members every quarter, which means 20 new faculty every year, said Varma.        
	The restructuring of the fees was not discussed. The matter will be reviewed once the Bhargava committee report is submitted.

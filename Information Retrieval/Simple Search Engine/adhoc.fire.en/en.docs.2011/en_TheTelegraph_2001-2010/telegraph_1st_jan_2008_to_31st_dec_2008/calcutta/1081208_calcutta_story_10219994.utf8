  - Gang war returns to the port area after seven years          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 22-year-old member of the gang whose leader allegedly fired at his rivals in an Ekbalpore eatery on Saturday evening was arrested on Sunday.        
	Sonu was arrested in his Barrister Lane house. Raids are on to trace Shahbaz, who had fired a bullet from his revolver at his rivals, said an investigating officer of Ekbalpore police station.        
	Around 6pm on Saturday, Shahbaz and Sonu entered an eatery on Maulana Mohammad Ali Road. Seeing Akbar and Sanju, two criminals from the locality, sitting on a wooden bench, Shahbaz drew his revolver and fired at the duo.        
	Both Akbar and Sanju ducked and the bullet hit the wall behind them. The assailants fled immediately. All of them enjoy the support of political parties, added the officer.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that the shooting was the fallout of a gang rivalry. Several cases of snatching and theft had been filed against the four. They were also involved in illegal constructions in the area. They were once part of the same group but fell out last year, said another officer.         
	The motive behind the shooting was to kill but we are yet to ascertain what triggered the attempt, added the officer.        
	According to the police, gang rivalry has escalated in the port area as several criminals who had moved to Mumbai and Hong Kong have returned and are trying to establish control over the area.         
	An officer said that the gang war had become a serious problem after seven years. There was a lull after Uday Singh, a promoter, was shot dead by members of the Shankar Paike gang in 1997 after a fight over Calcutta Port Trust contracts.         
	Residents expressed resentment over frequent clashes between gangs and the police inaction. In the absence of regular patrolling, criminals do whatever they want and the police turn a blind eye. We feel unsafe, said Mohammad Wasim, a resident of the area.

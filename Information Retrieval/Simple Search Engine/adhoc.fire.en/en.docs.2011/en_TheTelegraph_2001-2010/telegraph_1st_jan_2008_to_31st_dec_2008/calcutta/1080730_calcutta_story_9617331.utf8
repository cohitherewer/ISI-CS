                      Images of revolution                    The Alipore bomb case (or Alipore bomb conspiracy) was an important court trial in the history of the Indian Independence movement. When Bengal was partitioned in 1905, it sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest. A nationalist campaign was carried out by groups of revolutionaries, led by Aurobindo Ghose, Rasbihari Bose and Bagha Jatin, and organised into groups like Jugantar. The British cracked down hard on the activists and the conflict came to a head on April 30, 1908, when Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford. However, the bomb missed its target and instead killed two British women. The local police immediately arrested Aurobindo Ghose on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and for some time he was imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial soon began: 49 people stood accused, 206 witnesses were called, around 400 documents were filed with the court and more than 5,000 exhibits were produced including bombs, revolvers and acids. The trial continued for a year and Bose was found guilty and hanged. Ghose, defended by young lawyer Chittaranjan Das, was acquitted of the charges. To mark the centenary of the Alipore bomb trial, Sri Aurobindo Bhavan is currently holding Bomb in Bengal and Sri Aurobindo: The Revolutionary Years, an exhibition of rare photographs, courtesy Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry. The show offers a well-researched documentation, giving an authentic account of historical facts and capturing the spirit of the freedom movement. Tracing the forces behind the event, it unveils the active and often covert roles played in it by many leading personalities of the time. Through a few hundred photographs of Sri Aurobindo and his band of firebrand youths, the exhibition poignantly brings alive the century-old inspirational tale of Bengals martyrs.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs marking the centenary of the Alipore bomb trial When: Till July 30; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Pradarshashala, 1st floor

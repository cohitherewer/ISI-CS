          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Passengers bound for Guwahati were stranded for several hours at Calcutta airport on Tuesday after an aircraft blocked the runway of Guwahati airport following a snag.        
	No flight could take off from Calcutta for Guwahati between 10.35am and 1.50pm. Six Calcutta-Guwahati flights were delayed by more than three hours.        
	A Delhi-Guwahati flight had to be diverted to Calcutta. It returned to Guwahati in the afternoon.        
	Air Indias Guwahati-bound flight took off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport with 90-odd passengers at 9.50am. But it was forced to return to Calcutta after the air traffic control at Guwahati airport informed the pilot of the runway block.        
	The passengers were accommodated on an evening flight for Agartala that was extended to Guwahati and Air Indias flight to Guwahati.        
	The passengers stranded in the Assam capital were brought back to the city on two flights late in the evening.         
	I came to the airport at 9.30am and checked in. But later I came to know that the flight was delayed. Nobody could tell us what happened or when the flight would operate, said Joydeep Mukherjee, a passenger.

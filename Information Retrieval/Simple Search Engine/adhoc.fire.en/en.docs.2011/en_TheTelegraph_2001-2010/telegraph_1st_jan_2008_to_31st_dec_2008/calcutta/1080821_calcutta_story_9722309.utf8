The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car yanks off finger
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Car yanks off finger
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A stockbroker riding pillion on a friends motorbike and holding the door handle of a car at a traffic signal had his little finger ripped out when the vehicle took off after the light turned green.        
	Praveen Gupta, 26, let out a scream and fainted on the pavement as the private vehicle sped away, its driver realising that something had happened but possibly not sure what. When a team from Jorasanko police station that was patrolling the near-empty streets on Wednesday traced the car, the upper portion of Praveens little finger with a ring around it was still hanging from the door handle.        
	The driver of the car had apparently panicked and deserted the vehicle near the CR Avenue-Muktaram Babu Street crossing.        
	Doctors reconstructed Praveens severed finger during a two-and-a-half-hour surgery in a private nursing home. By the time the police retrieved the severed part of the finger, it was just dead muscle. Our surgeons reconstructed the remaining part of the finger and the patient is now doing well. We will keep him in the ICU for 24 hours and decide what to do next, said S.K. Agarwal, the director of Recovery Nursing Home.        
	Vijayendra Joshi, with whom Praveen was going to a common friends house at Bagbazar around 9.30 am, said he had stopped his motorbike at the CR Avenue-New CIT Road crossing when the car (WB-02K-6078) pulled up, too. He said his friend unmindfully grasped the door handle of the car.        
	 The driver of the car had accelerated even before I could kickstart my motorbike when the green light came on. I then heard a terrible scream, he recalled.        
	Praveen was first taken to a nearby private hospital but shifted to Recovery Nursing Home for the surgery.         
	 We have launched an inquiry but no arrest has been made so far, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Praveen and his family stay in Bangur Avenue.

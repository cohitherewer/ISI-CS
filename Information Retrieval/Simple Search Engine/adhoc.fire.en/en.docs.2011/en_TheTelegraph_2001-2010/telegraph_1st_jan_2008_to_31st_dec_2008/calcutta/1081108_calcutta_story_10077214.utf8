          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Eight students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) were remanded in judicial custody on the day a team from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) arrived at Shibpur to assess a closed all-girl campus.        
	The chief judicial magistrate of Howrah sent the boys to four days remand for charges ranging from rioting to assault on police.        
	All the arrested boys were supporters of the Independent Consolidation (IC) though witnesses had told Metro that some Students Federation of India (SFI) supporters were also to blame for the three-day violence on campus.        
	At Besu, the NBA team encountered only girls on a campus where classes were suspended for an indefinite period because of student unrest.        
	The authorities had on Thursday shut down the institute, called in the cops and ordered all boys from the undergraduate courses to vacate hostels and exit the campus.        
	With an eye on the three-day inspection by the NBA, the authorities had thrown a security ring around the girls hostels on Thursday night.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of the girl students were present in their hostels and the NBA team interacted with many of them. They were satisfied with their interactions, said Besu registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	Some faculty members, however, feared that the campus closure following student violence would affect the NBA ratings. The NBA had assessed Besu three years ago and awarded it around 650 points, which meant accreditation for three years. This time the institute was hoping for a 750-plus score that would allow it to be accredited for five years.        
	The NBA has separate slots for interviewing boys and girls. We will definitely lose some points as the scheduled interactive sessions with the boys could not take place, said a Besu source.        
	With no boys from the undergraduate courses on campus, the authorities have decided to send boys from the postgraduate courses to interact with the NBA team. This has not gone down well with a section of teachers. The present NBA inspection is being held to rate the institutions undergraduate courses, pointed out a teacher.        
	The NBA team visited various departments and held meetings with senior administrative officers on Friday. They were briefed about performance as well as the problem of student violence.

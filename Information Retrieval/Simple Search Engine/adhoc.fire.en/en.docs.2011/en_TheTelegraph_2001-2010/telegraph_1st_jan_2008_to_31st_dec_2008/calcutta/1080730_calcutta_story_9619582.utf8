          OUR BUREAU                                               Securitymen check a cable box on Park Street after the scare. Picture by   Sanat Kumar Sinha    
	A Salt Lake cyber cafe owner was arrested on Tuesday evening for triggering panic in the city through an email to some media houses that warned of serial blasts from 10pm.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said Kaushik Basu, an MBA aspirant in his mid-twenties, had been booked for criminal conspiracy and anti-national activity. We traced the email with the help of the Internet service provider.         
	Kaushik, whose cyber cafe is on the ground floor of his familys residence in IA block, wrote in the email that explosions would rock Park Street, the areas around Tank No I and IV of Salt Lake and Calcutta High Court from 10pm. It even mentioned the number and the make of the explosives-laden vehicle  a Mahindra Scorpio, WB-02X 0006  that would be parked in front of the high court.        
	The vehicle turned out to be that of land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla.         
	The mail mentioned New Alipore, Park Circus, Science City, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and City Centre as the other targets. This is a hoax. My car was parked at Tiljala police station, the same place it is parked every night because there is no space in front of my house, Molla told Metro.         
	Police teams scanned all the localities mentioned in the email but did not find explosives anywhere till late in the night. This is the first time my car has been checked by policemen like this, said Siddhartha Bose, a manager at Cinnamon restaurant, as policemen scanned his Maruti Alto with searchlights and hand-held mirrors.         
	By 10pm, Park Street was almost deserted with restaurants like Cinnamon closing much earlier than normal.        
	A police team from Lalbazar, backed by a bomb disposal squad with sniffer dogs, reached Apollo Gleneagles, too. The search for explosives began around 7.30pm and it was nearly 10.30pm when the police declared the hospital and its surroundings safe, Apollo officials said.        
	There were similar scenes in Salt Lake, especially in and around City Centre and Nicco Park.        
	The threatening email capped a day of bomb scares in the city. Around 4.30pm, word had spread that a large quantity of explosives had been found in Chetla. The police cordoned off the area and found around 250gm of material used in crude bombs.         
	Another bomb hoax prompted security personnel to detain the Howrah-bound Udayan Abha Toofan Express, coming from Delhi, at Burdwan station for one-and-a-half hours.

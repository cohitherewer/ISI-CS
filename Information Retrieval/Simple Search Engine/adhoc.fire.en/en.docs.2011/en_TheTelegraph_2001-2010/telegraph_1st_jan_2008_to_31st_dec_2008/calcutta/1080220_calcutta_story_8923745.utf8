          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Supply of construction materials to project sites in New Town remained cut off, as supplier syndicates failed to reach a rapprochement on carriage rates with realtors at a meeting in Rajarhat on Tuesday.        
	Representatives of joint-sector realty firms, who attended the parley brokered by CPM local committee members, found the rates quoted by suppliers too steep and feared they might have to pass on the burden to the consumer if the impasse continued.        
	Its close to a month now that supply of building materials like sand, stone chips, ready-mixed concrete and bricks have been stalled after the suppliers demanded unreasonable hikes in carriage charges. This could lead to a 10-15 per cent jump in cost to the consumer in some projects, warned Bengal Shelter managing director Samar Nag.        
	Nandu Belani of Bengal United Credit Belani concurred theres no way the developers can absorb the entire amount if they are to pay at the rates being quoted.        
	Suppliers, hit by the government cap on overloading, are demanding a 30 per cent rise for stone chips, 40-45 per cent for sand and a 12 per cent jump for bricks.        
	We hope to find a solution to the stand-off soon, said Hidco managing director and transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. The optimism found an echo from Credai Bengal president Pradip Sureka.

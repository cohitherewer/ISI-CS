   A STAFF REPORTER
   
	Trading resumed on the first six floors of the fire-ravaged Nandaram Market on Monday, but with a few riders.
 
	The authorities allowed resumption of business at 4pm, following an inspection of the 13-storeyed building by a committee comprising representatives of the fire brigade, police, CESC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).
 
	The team was led by the additional commissioner of police (armed forces), Zulfikar Hassan, and deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Ranade.
 
	 ldquo;The structure is stable till the fifth floor. So, we have allowed trading up to that. No shop or godown beyond the fifth floor can be opened now. The Kashiram block will remain closed as it is no longer stable, rdquo; said Hassan.
 
	A meeting at Lalbazar declared Nandaram Market unsafe from the sixth floor upwards. The meeting was attended by fire services director Gopal Bhattacharyya, civic director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol and Purushottam Agarwal, the president of Nandaram Market Traders rsquo; Welfare Association, among others.
 
	The authorities have laid down a few conditions for the traders who have resumed business. They will have to use standby lights, as CESC will not resume supply immediately. ldquo;Generators and candles have been banned inside the building, rdquo; said a fire department official.
 
	 ldquo;The traders rsquo; association has been asked to give us a list of the shops that will open, rdquo; said Bibhash Guha, a representative of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services. 
 
	The fire department has asked the traders to construct another staircase and arrange for fire-fighting arrangements.
 
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: ldquo;The safety aspect and reopening of the entire building are being considered by a committee. rdquo;
 
	Vinay Duggar, who owns a sari shop on the third floor, burst into tears on hearing that trading could resume in the market that had been in flames for more than 100 hours, since 1am on January 12.
 
	 ldquo;We are so relieved. The past 10 days had been the worst in our lives. We had even feared that the building would be demolished. But finally, we have been allowed to resume business, rdquo; said Duggar.

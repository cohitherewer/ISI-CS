                 Little to salvage: A woman amid the charred remains of the slum at Uttar Panchannagram                            
	Apropos the report Tease-tag tutor gets probe clean chit, March 13, a girl sexually harassed by her teacher will not get justice under the current system. Which is a pity because very few girls falsely accuse their teacher of sexual harassment.           
	Sometime back, a student of Presidency College had accused her teacher of harassment. The matter was brushed under the carpet. The teacher, who got away scot-free, will victimise more students in future.           
	The Supreme Court has passed stringent rulings in this regard but the administration turns a deaf ear to complaints.           
	Why a criminal offence should be investigated by the college authorities whose reputation is at stake beats me. The probe should be conducted by police or, at least, an independent agency. It seems that the government, too, wants sexual harassment by teachers to be hushed up.           
	In the reported case, the accused teacher being a supporter of the ruling party, political considerations must have prevailed over justice and human values.           
	Nishith Mitra,
  Mahinagore                       
	Apropos the report Left bereft by blaze, March 12, several large fires have broken out in Calcutta and adjoining areas in the past two months. The blaze at Uttar Panchannagram seems to have been sparked intentionally by promoters and land sharks. But the moot question remains as to why the same set of problems  lack of infrastructure and rule flout by residents  is cited by the fire services department after every blaze that they fail to contain quickly.             
	Kamruddin Ahmed,
  Chandni Chowk           
	Apropos the report Misery fires will to sit for tests, March 11, Shampa Biswas and Pappu Singh must be commended for their determination to pursue their studies even at a time of personal tragedy. The board should make special arrangements for students like Shampa and Pappu.           
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                   
	Apropos the report Pay n play golf on Maidan, March 12, S.S.P. Chowrasia and Arjun Atwal have made the entire country proud by winning Indian Masters and Malaysian Open respectively. It is wonderful that numerous youngsters can now try to emulate their heroes for a nominal charge.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia           
	The project to introduce golf on the Maidan for a nominal fee is laudable. Calcutta has seen a number of caddies learning the game and making it to the national circuit. More such talents will emerge if the golf clubs in the city offer opportunities to play the game for a nominal fee.           
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore                   
	Apropos the report Only five ceremony houses legal: CMC, March 11, a three-storeyed house near my residence in Lake Market is being rented out for ceremonies for the past few years. Most of my neighbours are old and sick. Not only they, but students in the area also suffer the noise and other kinds of pollution created by those who rent the ceremony house throughout the year. Add to that the problem of not being able to park our own cars near our houses. The owner of the ceremony house used to brag that police and civic employees wont take action against him. The report finally raises hopes that law flouters would be brought to book.             
	Saumya Datta,
  HM Road             
	It was sad that three families were ruined because of an extra-marital relationship (Towel used in Howrah murders found, March 12). I wonder what would happen to the children and other dependents. It appears that those involved in the sordid saga were drawn to money more than anything else.             
	Govind Das Dujari,
  Diamond Harbour Road    
	Apropos the report Court sends body for research, March 5, Zakaria Mallik missed an opportunity to follow the examples of two well-known personalities. Noted Urdu writer Krishan Chandar, husband of another Urdu novelist Salma Siddiquee, and actor-director Sunil Dutt, husband of another actor Nargis, performed the last rites of their spouses according to their religion by birth.             
	Mohammad Hashim, 
  Zakaria Street    
	Apropos the report Marks soar after BA, B.Sc reviews, March 12, it is amazing that the marks of over 60 per cent of the examinees who applied for review at Calcutta University were increased. The high number of students who wanted their answer scripts reviewed shows that they have no faith in the evaluation process. The university owes an explanation to the students for its laxity in assessment.

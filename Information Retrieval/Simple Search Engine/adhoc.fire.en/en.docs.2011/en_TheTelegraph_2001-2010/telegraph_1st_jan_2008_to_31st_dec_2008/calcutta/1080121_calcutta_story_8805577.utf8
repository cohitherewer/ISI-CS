 - I am very thrilled to be here. Old memories come to my mind. I am very proud... so grateful
                         (From top) ldquo;This was my classroom, rdquo; said L.N. Mittal, as soon as he spied Room no. 13. The old boy sat on a bench, wife by his side; The topper of rsquo;69 meets favourite professor N. Viswanathan; ldquo;You are the leader, rdquo; Mittal tells Father P.C. Mathew ldquo;; I wish all the students the best in their life, rdquo; wrote Mittal; Watch out, I rsquo;ll be back, Mittal seems to be saying 
   
	At 3.40pm on Sunday, a blue Merc Kompressor breezed into St Xaviers College. Out stepped an old boy  topper of the commerce class of 69 and now the richest Indian in the world. Laxmi Niwas Mittal was back.
    
	Accompanying him on his 27-minute-long trip down memory lane were wife Usha, principal Father P.C. Mathew, a few alumni members, and Anumita Ghosh and Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya from The Telegraph.
    
	First stop: room No. 13. The man in a pin-striped shirt was being guided to the principals office on the first floor, when he suddenly decided to turn left, then right and head straight for my classroom. He sat on one of the benches, wife Usha by his side.
    
	Next stop: the principals office, where a surprise awaited Mittal  his English professor, N. Viswanathan. They shook hands warmly and settled down for a chat. I thank you for what you have done to me, said the celebrity student. I am indirectly indebted to you, added his wife.
    
	Mittal then put on his glasses to glance through some college memorabilia. Was (Sourav) Ganguly a past pupil? he asked with a smile, pausing at a photograph.
    
	A brisk walk took him to the Alumni Room, where he penned a message: I am very thrilled to be here. Old memories came to my mind. I am very proud to have come from this institution... This institution taught me a lot other than giving me education....
    
	Last stop: the steps overlooking the playing field. Theres a faraway look in his eyes  its a sentimental moment for the man of steel.

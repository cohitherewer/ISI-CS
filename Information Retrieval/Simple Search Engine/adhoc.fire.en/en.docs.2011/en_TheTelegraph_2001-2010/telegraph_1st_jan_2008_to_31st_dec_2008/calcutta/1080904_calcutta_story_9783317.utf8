	We often take the availability of water for granted. But a day may dawn when we will have to pay for drinking water.         
	This was one of the many points discussed at the West Bengal State Science Seminar for Students held at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) on August 30, in collaboration with the state youth services department Thirty-eight participants, shortlisted from district-level science seminars organised by BITM in August, spoke on the topic Water Crisis on Earth: Problems and Remedies. Said Jayanta Sthanapati, the director of BITM: We choose a subject that is in the news, yet not usually included in the school syllabus.         
	The seminar was open to students up to Class X. Oiendrila Sarkar, from St Josephs High School, Matigara, said: If our water resources are allowed to get polluted, our future generation will be in deep trouble.         
	The students discussed the reasons for the water crisis, including pollution and dumping of waste materials into waterbodies, the impact of agriculture and overgrazing.         
	Abhinab Roy Chowdhury from Ramakrishna Mission, Purulia, was adjudged the best speaker. He will represent West Bengal in the National Science Seminar on October 3.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic authorities confirmed on Tuesday that 18-year-old Raja Nath died of malignant malaria.        
	The Behala residents blood sample was tested in a private clinic three days before his death on September 17. The report was negative.        
	Raja was not treated for malignant malaria as the report misled doctors, chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay said in a report to civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The death could have been averted had the diagnosis been correct and medication started early, the report said.        
	The civic health department has received 50,000 rapid diagnostic kits, which help diagnose malaria quickly, from the state government. Each kit costs about Rs 700.         
	If required we will supply more kits to the civic body, said joint director (health service) Bhaskar Bhattacharya.        
	Officials in the civic body and the health department met in Swastha Bhavan on Tuesday and decided to exchange status reports on malaria and dengue every two weeks.

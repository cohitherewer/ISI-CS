          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          IPS officer Nazrul Islam. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The high court on Wednesday upheld a trial courts order asking the state government to pay a fine of Re 1 to the inspector-general of police (welfare), Nazrul Islam, for starting a state vigilance commission probe against him.        
	The court also upheld the second part of order which directed the government to identify the persons responsible for the probe and realise the fine amount from them.        
	The probe was ordered on the basis of a complaint that the IPS officer had amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S. Banerjee said: What the trial court had said was just and the government will have to carry out the entire order.        
	Justice Talukdar of the high court had in 2007 asked the government to pay the fine to Islam and realise the amount from the persons who had harassed him.        
	The government had paid the fine from its exchequer and moved an appeal before the division bench, pleading that the other part of the order be set aside.        
	According to state counsel Sandip Srimani and Pratik Dhar, the government initiates a vigilance inquiry against an officer if someone lodges a complaint against him.        
	If the second part of the order is carried out, people will be reluctant to report against corrupt officers, one of the state lawyers submitted.        
	Islams counsel Billwadal Bhattacharya opposed the governments prayer and narrated how his client was publicly maligned after the vigilance probe was ordered.        
	When Islam moved Justice Talukdars court challenging the probe order, the government submitted that the inquiry had been withdrawn.        
	Islam had also pointed out that the state vigilance commission could not conduct an inquiry against an IPS officer. Only the central vigilance commission is authorised to carry out such a probe, he said.        
	The state government withdrew the probe after the trial court ordered that Islam would be present when the commission examined witnesses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Another vector victim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another vector victim
  - Rush for blood tests as toll mounts        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A mystery fever claimed another victim on Sunday morning, pushing up the death toll from vector-borne diseases  confirmed or suspected  to 19 in the past four weeks.        
	Bapi Das, 28, a resident of Ganipur in Mahestala, died at Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala around 8.35am on Sunday. Doctors at the hospital said the symptoms were of malignant malaria.        
	Bapi used to work with a small bulb-manufacturing unit in the area but was jobless for the past three years.        
	He was running a temperature since Thursday. He was vomiting and also complained of headache and body ache, said his father Biswanath Das.         
	Bapi was initially treated by a local physician but when his condition deteriorated on Saturday he was admitted to Vidyasagar Hospital. His blood sample was sent for examination but the results are still awaited.        
	He was desperately trying to get a job so that he could get his younger sister married, said Dipa Das, Bapis mother.         
	The death triggered anger among residents who alleged that Mahestala municipality officials were doing nothing to control breeding of mosquitoes. There has been no drive to spray mosquito repellents, said Madhusudhan Hazra. A number of people are suffering from fever.        
	A municipal official claimed the anti-larvae operation had been intensified in all wards and a clean-up drive was also on.

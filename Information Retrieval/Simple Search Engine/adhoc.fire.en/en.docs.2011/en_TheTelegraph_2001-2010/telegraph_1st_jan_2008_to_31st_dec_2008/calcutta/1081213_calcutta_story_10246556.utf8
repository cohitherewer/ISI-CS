                      Memories of a metropolis                    From Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain to Jawaharlal Nehru, Gnter Grass and V.S. Naipaul, Calcutta has provoked extreme reactions from anyone who has encountered it. Despite doomsday predictions of its being a dying city, it throbs with a life and vitality all its own, drawing people from all walks of life to engage with it. An extraordinary anthology of literary works, Memorys Gold: writings on Calcutta, brings together essays, stories, poems and memoirs of people who have shared an ardent relationship with the city. This sumptuous collection, edited and meticulously put together by Amit Chaudhuri, one of Indias foremost novelists and writers, addresses almost all aspects of life in the metropolis. While Michael Madhusudan Dutts letter talks about the citys amazing literary acumen, Nirad Chaudhuris account introduces us to the natives and mansions of Calcutta. Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyays realistic portrayal of an occupation typical to Calcutta offers a striking contrast to Utpalkumar Basus surreal take on office culture in the city. Fervent, passionate and nostalgic, the chronicles of Buddhadeva Bose, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay and Jug Suraiya, among others, bring to the fore various perspectives on the city, all of which celebrate Calcutta with as much gusto as the severity with which they often despair of it. This evening, eminent author Sunil Gangopadhyay will release the book, to be followed by readings and discussions with contributors to the anthology. Hosted by Penguin Books India and Oxford Bookstore Calcutta.

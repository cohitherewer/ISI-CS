The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blog boom in B-school 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blog boom in B-school 
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                           The homepage of the Globsyn Business School blog                                  
	The B-school brigade has taken to blogs to voice their opinion and reach out to others.        
	Students and teachers in the city institutes now prefer to post their thoughts online to bringing out wall magazines. Even administrators are using the tech tool to add to the information on the official website.        
	While blogs like that of Globsyn Business School are maintained by the institutes themselves, most are unofficial platforms for students, whose links are provided on the main website.        
	Blogs are an informal and more democratic way of getting feedback from students about the institute, method of teaching and the faculty, said Sudipa Banerjee, a senior lecturer at the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), the oldest B-school in the country.         
	One can access the IISWBM blog, which is unofficial, from the official website. The posts provide the latest campus news  from the launch of an alumni website to reports on the institute in the media. The NSHM blog also provides information on the launch of courses or departments.        
	Students can be candid in their posts because they dont need to reveal their identity.        
	Blogs have become an important tool in the corporate world. Even CEOs of companies write blogs. It can be a two-way communication tool between the students and authorities, said Banerjee.        
	MBA aspirants can go through a B-schools blog to get a feel of the institute. The official website generally does not provide such information, she added.        
	Recruiters, too, go through institute blogs to decide whether to recruit from the campus or not.         
	The Globsyn Business School blog, maintained by the institute, has an ask BDG section where students can pose question to director Bikram Dasgupta.        
	The blog, with posts from experts in various fields, promotes collaborative learning. There are sections for different specialisations, where professors and experts upload posts on development in their respective fields. For example, a recent post on the finance blog by professors and the institutes knowledge team explains the US financial crisis.        
	It is not easy for us to read books about all the different functions for basic knowledge, so we log on to domain blogs for information, said Sayantani Mitra, a second-year human resource management student at the B-school.        
	She and her classmates also write on projects and industry visits.        
	The idea is to give students a holistic idea about management. Students can prepare for the days classes by going through the blogs, said Romit Dasgupta, the director of technology of Globsyn Technologies.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bid her bye with a bow
          
	The Metro guide to help you understand and enjoy Dashami better...              
	Why is the prefix maha not added to Dashami?        
	Maha, meaning great, is added to the tithi (days) during Durga Puja to differentiate Devipaksha, the divine fortnight, when the Puja takes place. So all the days, starting from Pratipad (the day after Mahalaya) can technically be prefixed with maha. So technically Dashami can be called Mahadashami, but it is not.                        
	What is visarjan?        
	Its not the immersion of the goddess, technically speaking. Visarjan is the official end of the Puja. It is over when the priest moves the ghat, to which pranpratishtha had been done (the ghat is brought to life at the beginning of the Puja). A mirror is floated in a vessel of water at the place of worship, in which one can catch the Mothers reflection as she departs, after which the mirror is upturned and the thread tied to the four sticks (tirkathi) at four corners surrounding the ghat is broken.        
	This year, all this has to happen by 9.27am.                        
	Why sindur khela?        
	After the visarjan, married women take part in the sindur khela, saluting the goddess with vermilion, betel leaf and sweets and then smearing each other with the same. It is (or used to be) a Bengali custom for married women to apply sindur on each other when one of them was leaving; the Devi is bid farewell the same way.        
	Sindur khela is a great photo op. Pretty Bengali women look prettier, with sindur-smeared faces.               
	Any parting gift?        
	From the Goddess? Yes, if you have forgotten to ask for anything during the Ashtami anjali, now is your time. Good results for the exam, a promotion, your cute neighbours attention...                           
	Should you join the dhunuchi naach like Shah Rukh Khan on Mahapanchami?        
	Yes. Of late it has been cool to join in, be you young, old, male, female, hot  or not. But caution is advised. Keep the steps simple  theres no shame in it, especially if you are a first-timer. The dhaak may pump up your blood, but the dhunuchi has embers flying and the coconut husk inside is also very unstable. Do not have more than a glass of bhang before.               
	Should you dance as part of the visarjan procession?         
	Yes, thats quite in too. Ma has to be sent off in style. But no sophisticated steps here. Only jhatkas and matkas. Dont wear a sari if you cant manage it.              
	What songs to dance to?         
	Get out all the fast, desi numbers. All the bewra numbers. Do ghoont mujhe bhi pila de sharabi, Khaike paan Banaraswala are all-time hits. This time Singh is Kinng, Mauja hi mauja, Bachna aye haseeno and Dil dance maare are surefire Dashami hits.              
	When to reach Babughat for a dekko?         
	Well in advance. The ideal time to catch immersions would be 4pm. Safety should be uppermost on your mind while making a beeline for the immersions. Clutch on to your kids. Do not venture near the water. Adhere by the rules laid down by the cops. Take photographs. Upload them on Facebook.              
	Back home?         
	Its Bijoya time. Stock up on sweets if you havent already. Nadu (jaggery and coconut balls) is a must on the platter. Throw in some diabetic sandesh too.                         
	What to wear?         
	Steer clear of low-waist denims and short tops (see t2 for more). Remember its Vijaya and that means frequent stooping to touch the feet of the elders and seeking their blessings, even if you dont want to. You dont want a wardrobe malfunction.

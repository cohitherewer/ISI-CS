          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two policemen have been suspended for the escape of two undertrials from a prison van at Bankshal Court on Monday.        
	Assistant sub-inspector Manoj Kumar Chakraborty and constable Raghunath Digar were suspended for dereliction of duty on Tuesday.        
	Chakraborty had gone to complete formalities in the court and Digar to relieve himself, leaving undertrials Raju Paswan, Rajesh Projapati and Subrata Banerjee unguarded in the prison van. The door of the van was open.        
	Paswan and Projapati fled. Banerjee was caught while trying to escape, said an investigating officer.        
	A preliminary inquiry revealed that the undertrials escaped because of the duos negligence, said a senior officer. The police have talked to acquaintances of Paswan and Projapati. Paswans mother, too, was questioned.        
	All three were lodged in Presidency jail.

	Four men were arrested on Sunday for felling and trimming trees that were blocking the view of some billboards on VIP Road, in Lake Town.        
	We arrested four men, including a labour contractor, for pruning and felling trees without permission. They will be produced in court tomorrow, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar.        
	The four reportedly told the police that they had been hired by an agency that had put up billboards in the area.        
	Residents spotted the group chopping off branches and immediately contacted Lake Town police station. Sources said four trees were felled while 20 were trimmed.        
	Forest officials visited the spot but did not lodge any complaint. We had lodged a complaint last night with Parama Island police station, where a few people had felled some trees. But in Lake Town, we decided not to do so after discussing the matter with the police, said beat officer S. Ghosh.

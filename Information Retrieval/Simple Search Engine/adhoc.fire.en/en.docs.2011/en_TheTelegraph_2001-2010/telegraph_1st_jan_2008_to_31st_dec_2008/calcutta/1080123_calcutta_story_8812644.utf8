        Discovering Ray, the artist
   Universally acknowledged as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Satyajit Ray was also an author, essayist, lyricist, music composer and artist par excellence. Ray the artist has left a large and remarkable collection of creative output; he illustrated the stories he wrote and also sketched for other authors, and created four English typefaces. Book jackets designed by him revolutionised the concept of cover designing in India. Besides, he produced posters, booklets and hoardings for his own films, and occasionally those by other directors as well. Organised by Ray Society, Art of Satyajit Ray, the ongoing exhibition, offers rare glimpses into the legendary filmmaker rsquo;s fascinating world of art. It has on show some of Ray rsquo;s works preserved at the Society archives, including illustrations, head-pieces, posters, hoardings, book jacket designs, title credits, film schedules, set designs, costume designs, advertisement artworks and typefaces.

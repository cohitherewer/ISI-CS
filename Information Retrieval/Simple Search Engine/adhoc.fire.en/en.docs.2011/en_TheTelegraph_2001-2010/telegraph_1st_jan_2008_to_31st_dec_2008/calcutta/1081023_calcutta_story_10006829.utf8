	A 19-year-old student of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) drowned in the Hooghly after falling off a jetty near the campus on Wednesday evening.        
	Subhajit Saha, a second-year computer engineering student from Chinsurah, was with four of his batchmates when he fell into the river, said police. The four have been detained for questioning.        
	Preliminary investigations suggest it was an accident, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	The jetty, known as BE Garden Ghat, was a favourite hangout of Subhajit, said his friends.        
	On Wednesday, the five reached the ghat around 6pm. Subhajit ran to the edge of the jetty and tried to leap on to a vessel that had docked at the ghat. He landed in the water through the gap between the vessel and the jetty, Kamal Kanti Roy, Subhajits classmate and one of the five, told Metro while being taken to Shibpur police station.        
	Neither Subhajit nor his friends could swim. They sought help from people aboard the vessel.        
	No one came forward to help us as it was high tide and the current was very strong, said Subhasish Das, an IT student and one of the five.         
	Officers from Shibpur police station reached the spot around 7.15pm. Two divers were pressed into service. Till late on Wednesday, two teams of River Traffic Police and a team from the disaster management group of Calcutta police had not found the teenagers body.         
	Subhajit was a very bright student. We informed his family about the accident, said Dipak Bandopadhyay, the registrar of Besu.         
	Subhajits uncle Tapas Saha, a resident of Behala, was the first member of the family to reach the campus around 8.30pm.        
	I dont know what to say to Subhajits mother, who is a heart patient, said Tapas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flyover flank runs into wall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flyover flank runs into wall
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Ramp row: The Sealdah flyover. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A proposal of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to add a flank to the Sealdah flyover has run into opposition from police, urban planners and members of the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee.        
	According to the plan, the 27-ft-wide flank will link Sealdah station to the eastern flank of the flyover. Station-bound vehicles from APC Road and MG Road will take the flank, instead of following a circuitous route involving two right turns  beside the Sealdah court and a few yards down the slope leading to Beleghata.        
	But most stakeholders feel the flank would result in a traffic disaster, shifting the chaos at the Beleghata Main Road crossing to the flyover.        
	Less than 25 per cent of the vehicles plying down the flyover are bound for or coming from Sealdah station. The rest would get stuck at the signals, said an officer of the Sealdah traffic guard.        
	The project director of the CMDAs traffic and transportation planning wing, Chandrasekhar Sen Majumdar, however said the police and the railway authorities had given their preliminary consent to the proposal.        
	Sen Majumdar said the link had been planned to provide an easier access to Sealdah-station bound vehicles from Howrah. If buses, minibuses, taxis, cars and autorickshaws approaching the station from MG Road get a direct access to their destination, the snarl at the Beleghata Main Road crossing can be avoided.        
	A Sealdah traffic guard officer, however, countered: The arm will take the mess on Beleghata Main Road to the flyover. When vehicles from MG Road take a left turn and come down to the station, north-bound vehicles on the flyover will get stuck. The snarl can extend up to Beleghata Main Road and Surya Sen Street, disrupting traffic in several pockets of central Calcutta.        
	The CMDA also plans to set up a general and a VIP car park, five bus bays, a stand for 48 taxis and another for 85 autorickshaws, all around the station. When all these facilities come up, pedestrians will have a tough time leaving or entering the station, said a civic town planner.        
	Joint commissioner of police (traffic) K. Harirajan refused to comment on the issue.

                                                                                                               Lessons in art for convicts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The department of correctional services is conducting an art workshop for convicts at Alipore Central jail.        
	The workshop, which started on February 1, will continue for three months. Paintings by the 32 participants will be exhibited at Birla Academy of Art and Culture.        
	We want the convicts to feel that they are part of society. Projects like these will allow them to sharpen their skills and express themselves, said inspector-general (correctional services) B.D. Sharma.        
	Voluntary organisation Flight to Harmony Foundation is guiding the convicts, while Birla Academy of Art and Culture is providing technical support to the workshop.         
	Chitta Deb of Flight to Harmony Foundation said: This is the first time we have undertaken a project like this. The classes are held from 9.30am to noon six days a week. Sometimes, there are special classes on Sunday. Most of the convicts have a great deal of potential.        
	The workshop participants, including lifers and those sentenced to death, were selected through a talent search test from Behrampore jail, Dum Dum Central jail and Alipore Central jail.        
	Bejay Dalan, the secretary of Birla Academy of Art and Culture, said: We accepted the proposal to be part of the workshop without a moments hesitation.

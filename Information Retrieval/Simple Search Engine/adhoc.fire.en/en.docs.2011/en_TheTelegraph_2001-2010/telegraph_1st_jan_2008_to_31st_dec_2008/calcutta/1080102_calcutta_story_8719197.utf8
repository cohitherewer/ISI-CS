 - Flyover has shifted traffic clog from Gariahat to nearby crossings 
        
	Vehicles from Gariahat took 40 seconds, on an average, to cross the Ballygunge Phari intersection before the Gariahat flyover came up. After the high-road became operational, as revealed in a study by IIT Kharagpur, the duration went up three times.
 
	While the six-point Ballygunge Phari crossing is the worst hit, following the commissioning of the flyover, other intersections mdash; like Gariahat, Gol Park and Deshapriya Park mdash; have not been spared either.
 
	Metro identifies the problem points... 
 
	Lack of planning
 
	The flyover was constructed to ensure smooth flow of traffic at the Gariahat crossing. But the planners did not take into account the possible fallout on the other intersections in the vicinity.
 
	After the high-road was thrown open to traffic, the Gariahat crossing became decongested but the clogs at the others have intensified.
 
	A traffic simulation model developed by Bhargav Maitra, an associate professor in the civil engineering department of IIT Kharagpur, points out that the Gariahat flyover has only ldquo;shifted the location of the overall traffic problem and enhanced it rdquo;.
 
	Copspeak: ldquo;One has to wait at the signal here any time in the day. We can rsquo;t help it, given the volume of traffic at the crossing, rdquo; said a senior police officer.
 
	Left turns 
 
	The Hazra autorickshaw stand is too close to the crossing and should be shifted 100 metres down the road, pointed out an urban planner. ldquo;This will keep the left turn always open. The same should be done on all other approaches if we want to reduce snarls. rdquo;
 
	Copspeak: ldquo;Vehicles moving straight block any left-bound lane in our city, rdquo; said a sergeant posted at the crossing.
 
	Narrow lanes
 
	Traffic flows in both directions on many narrow lanes and bylanes leading to Syed Amir Ali Avenue. Experts suggest one-way movement be enforced on these lanes and roadside parking be banned.
 
	Maitra has suggested that the authorities select certain corridors and ldquo;prioritise rdquo; them. To ensure smooth flow of north-south traffic at the Phari crossing, he points out, ldquo;no entry rdquo; boards should be erected at certain points during rush hours.
 
	Mayorspeak: ldquo;The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, along with police, is conducting surveys for the construction of a network of mini flyovers across Syed Amir Ali Avenue, from the Bondel Road-Broad Street side to the Ballygunge Circular Road-Hazra Road side. This will speed up the north-south flow. rdquo;

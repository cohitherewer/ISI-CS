  - Burrabazar turns into little rajasthan after victory of warnes boys          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne and his teammates pose with the IPL T20 trophy, after they beat Chennai Super Kings in the finals of the tournament in Mumbai on Sunday night. (PTI)                                        
	Any Burrabazar trader worth his Rajasthani genes will tell you that the thing he dreads most is a ghate ka sauda (a bad deal).         
	As Shane Warnes underrated Rajasthan Royals  most of them cheap buys in the player auctions  scraped past the star-studded Chennai Super Kings in the final of the first IPL edition on Sunday night, many among Calcuttas 12-lakh-strong Rajasthani community would have chuckled at the thought of prudence scoring over flamboyance on the cricket field, too.        
	This is a proud moment for the Rajasthani community of Calcutta and the rest of the country. People from Rajasthan have proved their mettle in business and industry. The victory of the Rajasthan Royals has added a new dimension to the communitys success, said businessman Narayan Sharma, in between bursting crackers to celebrate the win.         
	Once the Kolkata Knight Riders were out of contention, there was no doubt about whom the Burrabazar brigade was supporting in the IPL, a tournament that not only kept eyeballs glued to the television screen every evening but also provided impetus to betting.        
	So dominating were the Royals in the tournament that not many doubted they would win the trophy. Before the final started, the odds were 30 paise to a rupee if the Royals won and 70 paise for a Chennai victory.         
	Once Sohail Tanveer swatted the last ball towards mid-on and he and Warne completed the winning run, Burrabazar could have been mistaken for a Jaipur locality. Scores of youths hit the streets on motorcycles, distributing sweets and bursting crackers.        
	This is a classic case of the underdog winning. They were the least hyped team, but they took everybody by surprise, chartered accountant Vijay Dalmiya said from his Central Avenue residence.         
	Another trader said the victory represented the indomitable spirit of the Rajasthanis, shaken by a series of blasts in Jaipur midway through the tournament.        
	And what about cricket in Rajasthan? Would this victory pave the way for cricketers from that state to play for India?         
	There can be no doubt that this is a shot in the arm for Rajasthan cricket. The region will catch the attention of the national selectors and local players will be looked at as contenders for berths in the national team. More important, money will come in to improve cricket infrastructure there, entrepreneur Vishal Agarwal said.

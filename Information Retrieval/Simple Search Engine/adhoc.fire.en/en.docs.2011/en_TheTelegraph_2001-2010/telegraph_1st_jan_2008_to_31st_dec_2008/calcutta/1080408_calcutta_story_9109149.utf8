	The 11th annual concert of Turning Point  an organisation that imparts vocational training to the mentally challenged  was held at Swabhumi on March 30. The institute aims at providing social and economic rehabilitation to its students.         
	The highlight was the cultural programme included a mixed bag of dance, drama, recitation and singing. The coordination among the students as they danced to popular numbers like Bum Bum Bole from Taare Zameen Par and Aaja Nachle from the film of the same name, drew great applause from the audience.         
	Our motto is to help children overcome the social stigma attached to mental health. Every human being should be given a chance to lead a life of respect. Isolating psychologically disturbed people from the social sphere is not a solution, said Ishita Sanyal, founder and secretary of the school.        
	Kalyan Dasgupta, the president of the organisation highlighted the role of parents in bringing up a child and their responsibility in tackling socio-economic demands.         
	Chief guest Anup Chanda, chairman of Port Trust, stressed on the need for every person to contribute to the nations growth, irrespective of his disability.         
	Uma Mukherjee, disability commissioner, emphasised on social acceptability and proper guidance for the mentally challenged.         
	A satirical take on current events like the bird flu, bandhs and the book fair by the students was appreciated. Vivek Chakraverty, an aspiring poet and a student of the institute, read out one of his compositions on the difficulties he faces in his life.         
	Teenage was a phase of disillusionment. But as I grew older, peoples attitudes only hit me harder. But I still hope to reach out to the world through my poetry some day, said Vivek, with a smile.         
	The 11th year of the concert has seen a transition from a low-key, localised affair to a larger, well-coordinated event. The students will gain more confidence through this exposure, said Saswat Sanyal, a third-year student and a volunteer of the institute.         
	My daughter now feels the urge to go to school and has learnt a bit of singing and painting too. I now feel hopeful about her future, said Minati Das, a students mother.         
	The open-air event attracted many visitors who had come to Swabhumi, and were charmed by the performances.         
	I was moved to tears seeing the challenged kids perform. No parent should be pessimistic about a mentally-ill child  they have the capability to shine in every sphere, said Tapan Sen, a visitor.

	Calcutta Puppet Theatre organised a three-day Putul Natak Utsav from March 21, to mark World Puppet Day. Fifty groups from across the state took part in the festival. The first-days extravaganza was staged at the open air Dr Pratap Chandra Chandra Manch in Ballygunge. The shows shifted to Madhusudan Manch for the next two days (March 22 and 23).        
	From rural slapstick to the significance of Easter, the shows portrayed varied aspects of life. The Jhargram Art Academy combined ballet with puppetry, demonstrating the theme of unity through the life of birds. Sundaram Natya Gosthi presented a show in the Bunraku style of Japan. Peoples Puppet Theatres show was an attack on consumerism, but was presented with a generous dose of humour to make it appealing. Amar and Sabyasachi Sen stole the show with their expert hand shadowgraphy.         
	We have been performing for the past 36 years. Now two days of practice in a week is enough, said a beaming Sabyasachi after the show. Debasis Roy Chowdhury and Samir Ghosh presented a show of ventriloquism.         
	Other participants included Youth Puppet Theatre, Jonaki Puppet Theatre, Dhumketu Puppet Theatre, Sonarpur Kristi Sansad. Puppeteers came from across the state, including Burdwan, Midnapore, Nadia, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas.        
	A workshop was also organised on March 22 and 23 at Madhusudan Manch, aimed at breathing new life into a dying art. Materials like fibre glass and thermocol can be used instead of the cumbersome wood for making puppets. Other forms like the Kabuki form of theatre practised in Japan were also discussed at the workshop, said a member of Calcutta Puppet Theatre.         
	Puppetry is about 5,000 years old in India and it needs to be technically upgraded, felt Suresh Dutta, director, Calcutta Puppet Theatre.         
	We have been celebrating this festival since 2003. We provide a platform to the artists to showcase a powerful art. The CPT has also requested for land from the state government where it plans to build a puppet academy. It will provide training for those interested, added Dutta.

        Exodus: Hostelites leave the university campus after the clashes 
    
	The hosting of Calcutta police rsquo;s annual award ceremony at National Library underscores the callousness of its authorities (Lalbazar hijacks library, December 28). How could the library bosses allow a programme that inconvenienced so many members and readers? 
 
	The library officials were earlier involved in the theft of rare photographs and periodicals. The corrupt staff members must be sacked or transferred without delay. They pose great danger. The government should not forget that the library is a part of the city rsquo;s heritage.

	The frequent clashes between students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) after being misguided by political parties show them in poor light (Post-clashes, Besu shut sine die, December 14). The students only harm their career by doing the bidding of politicians. The situation is particularly unfortunate because the best young brains of Bengal should be concentrating on measuring up to the lofty standards of the IITs, with Besu set on the upgrade path.

	Apropos the report ldquo;Fine up for road cell use rdquo;, December 20, it is a laudable initiative by the police to increase the fine for drivers who are found to use cellphones on the road. The short-film campaign on the issue may be effective. The films should be screened at railway stations to build public awareness. Violation of the cellphone rule by drivers of commercial vehicles should be dealt with severely. The guilty should not be shown mercy.

 Mukundapur
  
	Apropos the report ldquo;PVD chief sees no evil hellip; rdquo;, December 6, after being appointed as the assistant director (registration) of public vehicles department (PVD) in 1967, I had gone to meet the magistrate of 24-Parganas, Biswanath Majumder, to pray for release from my job in the district. ldquo;Every brick of the PVD building is corrupt. So be very cautious, rdquo; he had told me. I managed to be transferred from PVD in 1972 with an unblemished record. The PVD director will only make himself a laughing stock by denying that there is corruption in the department. In fact, protecting corruption is a form of corruption.

 Unique Park
  
	Apropos the report ldquo;Gang war at cremation rdquo;, December 26, it is a pity that people have to deal with extortion, abuse and lack of infrastructure at burning ghats in their hour of loss. The administration knows that the burning ghats are ruled by criminals, but refuses to act. The nexus between police and criminals was laid bare during Satyajit Ray rsquo;s cremation. The police, state government, civic body and the high court must ensure that burning ghats are clean and free of rowdies. 
 
	B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum
  
	Apropos the report ldquo;Coalition, collision amp; khichdi rdquo;, December 31, The Telegraph debate was exciting thanks to an excellent set of speakers. I feel that coalition government are very much a part of the democratic framework. In fact, coalition governments reflect the nature of the Indian society and democracy.
 
	Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia
  
	Common sense should decide the uniform of policewomen (Sari to salwar-kameez, December 5). For handling women demonstrators, shirts and trousers is more suitable that salwar-kameez. 
 
	Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge
  
	Apropos the report ldquo;Minders for army officers in discs rdquo;, December 27, the army CPRO had told the reporter there were no comments from the army rsquo;s side on the issue of military police officers accompanying army officers on New Year rsquo;s Eve. The spokesperson had also stated categorically that the army had no such plans.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Illegal cyber cafes dot Salt Lake

	The hoax email threatening serial blasts across Calcutta on Tuesday night has woken Bidhannagar Municipality and police up to the need to rein in cyber cafes in the township. The email was sent from one of the 150-odd Salt Lake cyber cafes that the authorities do not have any information on.         
	In a knee-jerk reaction, the police extended the guidelines for cyber cafes in Calcutta to those in other parts of the state.         
	We are gathering information to create a database of cyber cafes in Salt Lake. Each one of them will have to follow the guidelines, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The guidelines will include maintaining a register of customers, checking photo identity cards before allowing anyone to use the Internet, noting down the computer each customer uses and storing the data for at least six months.        
	Cyber cafes have mushroomed across Salt Lake in the past five years and municipal authorities admit that most of them dont have trade licence.         
	We came to know about the existence of so many illegal Internet cafes only after last nights incident. But we do not have exact figures yet, said Biswajiban Majumdar, the municipality chairman.         
	I have asked councillors to conduct a survey in their wards and submit the names and addresses of illegal cyber cafes, he added.        
	On Tuesday night, some media houses received the email warning of serial blasts in several parts of Calcutta. After contacting the Internet service provider, the police traced the email  by using Internet Protocol address  to an Internet parlour on the ground floor of IA 50.         
	Kaushik Basu, the son of the owner of the cafe, was arrested within hours. During investigation, the cops learnt that the Internet cafe does not have a licence.         
	On Wednesday, Metro spotted many such cyber cafes in the township, being run out of garages, stationery shops and railway ticket booking centres.        
	A cyber cafe-cum-game parlour in BG 33 allows users to surf the Internet for just Rs 8 an hour.        
	It is primarily a game parlour but of late we have introduced Internet surfing, said Saikat Bhattacharya, the owner.        
	The cafe has neither a signboard nor a trade licence.        
	Its the same story at AG 94. A cyber cafe with six computers has been running alongside a DTP centre for the last three years.        
	My sons run this cyber cafe to earn their livelihood. We do not allow any illegal activities in our cafe and the customers are mostly from our locality, said the owner, Manoranjan Dey.        
	Setting up a cyber cafe may not be easy anymore. We will write to the urban development department to take action against illegal cyber cafes once we gather the data, said Ashoke Das, the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar.

           Guided trip: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi takes a tour of the Park Street cemetery                             
	Thanks to the boards making environmental education compulsory, students are now better aware of climate change and its effects (Varsities declare entry criteria, May 23). As a teacher, I believe this knowledge will help the next generation face the challenges of the future better.           
	However, colleges and universities are not considering the marks obtained in environmental education during admission despite it being a compulsory, 100-marks paper. It is a harsh blow to the hard work put in by students round the year. The step makes the introduction of environmental education in schools futile and discourages the students and educators.           
	While the whole world is changing its attitude and policies to protect the environment, our policy-makers come across as half-hearted and reluctant. Environmental education is still considered a subject that has to be studied out of compulsion and not because it can open up paths to a serious career. If the environmental crisis is a burning problem, can we afford to ignore it?           
	Amrita Chakraborti,
  Address not given                       
	Apropos the report Digital hunt for graves, June 1, the Lower Circular Road, Park Street and Kidderpore cemeteries are in very bad condition and are crying out for maintenance. In such a situation, it is wonderful that at least the burial records have been digitised. Foreigners whose relatives are buried in Calcuttas cemeteries can now easily identify and visit their graves.             
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                               
	Apropos the report Train smashes family in car, May 17, small cars are essentially city cars and are not meant for inter-district travel. The safety of a sedan is missing in a small car. I dont think nondescript level crossings should be manned. Doing so involves expenditure that would be passed on to railway passengers. Why should they foot the bill for the comfortable journey of a handful of people?             
	By subsidising petrol, the government is actually subsidising traffic congestion, pollution and irresponsible motoring.           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar           
	One fails to understand why we still have unmanned level crossings. Why doesnt Lalu Prasad utilise the crores that the Railways earns every year to employ guards at all level crossings? This is more important than modernisation of Metro Railway stations.           
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore                       
	Apropos the report Girl dies in house collapse, June 4, if the municipal authorities had destroyed the abandoned house in time, the 22-year-old, who also provided for her family, would not have died. There are innumerable abandoned houses in the city that may collapse any time killing others like her. But the municipal authorities cannot be bothered to act.             
	Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum                   
	The kindness shown by a rickshaw-puller to a stray dog hit by a motorcycle on VIP Road must be appreciated (Saviour for injured stray, June 4). In direct contrast, the man who hit the stray rode away as if nothing had happened.             
	We are taught Jeebe daya kare jei jon, sei jon sebichhe ishwar (One who shows kindness to living beings, serves God) but how many of us try to follow this? If we did so, there would not be so many reports of mishap victims and ill people lying on the road unattended.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                   
	Vast areas of Calcutta and its added areas were inundated for hours (Rain relief but flights in flap, June 3 ). In Parnasree, Behala, water with dirty over-flow of drains entered our houses. Our locality, ward 131 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, is not low-lying. Poor desiltation of the open drains and delayed or inadequate use of pumps during rain are the causes of this agony. The problem is compounded by huge concrete pipes parked over open drains.             
	Suman S. Dasgupta,
  Parnasree Palli                   
	Apropos the report Judges say no to death, June 3, it is reassuring to know that most judges of Calcutta High Court want the death sentence to be abolished. It has no place in a civilised society.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia           
	The judges have made a wise choice by saying no to the death penalty during a survey by the National Law Commission. Death by hanging is should be abolished. Those guilty of serious crimes should be imprisoned for life.           
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur                   
	The report Crores gone at memorial, June 5, was shocking. A fraud of crores could not have been perpetrated by a clerk alone; more employees must have been involved. The authorities need to explain why they could not detect the irregularities earlier.

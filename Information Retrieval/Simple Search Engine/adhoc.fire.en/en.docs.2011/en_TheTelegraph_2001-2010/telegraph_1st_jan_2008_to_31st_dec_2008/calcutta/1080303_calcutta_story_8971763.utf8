                                                                                                               Show of rare books 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	From a five-volume 1737 publication on the history of metal currency to a 1900 publication on the trial of Galileo, a collection of the oldest and rarest documents in the city is going to be on show for the first time at St Xaviers College on Monday.         
	The one-day exhibition, featuring 40 rare documents, will be open from 10am to 5pm in the colleges main parlour.        
	The collection includes books on eminent thinkers of the 18th Century, philosophy of sciences, history and scriptures. They were donated to the library by provincial governments and European missionaries. The oldest book dates back to 1632 and is in Latin.        
	Our library is 150 years old and has a vast collection of valuable books. The documents are being restored and digitised in collaboration with Unesco, said Father P.C. Mathew, the principal of the college. He will inaugurate the exhibition.        
	The college approached Unesco, New Delhi, in 2006 for funds to preserve the documents. It received $5,000 from them recently. Another grant of $1,230 is in the pipeline. The funds will be spent on digitising and preserving the books.        
	We had to fumigate and tissue laminate some books in brittle condition, said Vidyarthi Dutta, the college librarian.         
	Around 65 books have been restored. Of them, 55 have been digitised as well. A DVD of the digitised versions will be available in the library.         
	The college plans to set up a rare book section in the library once it has been centralised, which is being done.        
	According to the librarian, this is the first time in Bengal that a college has taken the initiative to restore and exhibit such rare documents.        
	This not the colleges area of expertise but the effort was necessary, said Dutta.

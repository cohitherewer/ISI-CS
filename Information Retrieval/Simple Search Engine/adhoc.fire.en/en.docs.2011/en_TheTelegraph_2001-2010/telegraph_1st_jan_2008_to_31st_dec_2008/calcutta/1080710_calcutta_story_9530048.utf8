                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           School of rock

	For the budding musicians of St James School, picking up trophies at prestigious rock competitions in the city is a fairly routine affair. With the guitar, drums, keyboard and the vocalist synchronising in a perfect crescendo, they are a hard team to beat in the fest circuit.         
	Potential rockers vie for entry into the school band during musical contests like East meets West. We have been conducting the contest for the last 25 years and the school band dates back to almost the same period, says Terence Ireland, principal, St James School. The band members are chosen through auditions and from musical contests in school.         
	Talent is not the only criterion, though. The boy should be well-behaved, as he represents the school, says Neville Holt, senior school coordinator and teacher-in-charge of fests. Most of the band members are senior boys from classes IX to XII. We do not dismantle the group each year, but only fill up places. The old members in the group help to maintain continuity, says Holt.        
	The school has two seven-member bands in the eastern and western categories. Each has a vocalist, a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist, a violinist and a keyboard player. The eastern band also includes a percussionist and two harmonium and sitar players, when needed.         
	There are 14 members, including the eastern and western categories. Their repertoire ranges from Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Indipop to purely classical numbers. You would recognise the western band by their renditions of U2s One, Pink Floyd classics Another brick in the wall and Coming back to life and Coldplays Yellow. The eastern band has won accolades playing Maa from Taare Zameen Par, Kailash Khers Teri Deewani and Pakistani band Junoons Saionee.         
	This year St James participated in the La Martiniere for Girls fest Creation and La Martiniere for Boys fest Nexus in May and Annual Interact Meet, organised by the Interact Clubs of city schools. As in the past several years, the school stood first in western music at all the three fests and also bagged the best vocalist award at Creation and Nexus. The eastern band also won at Nexus.         
	The best thing about the band was that it chose songs well and played them to perfection. The vocalist did a wonderful job with One, says Taj of city band Span who judged them at Nexus. The easy camaraderie among the band members contributes to their performance.         
	It is not that we dont have tiffs, but we get over them soon enough as our goal is the same. As the leader, I also have to be strict with the group though, smiles Kartik Prasad, vocalist for the western band.         
	Jamming regularly is not important. Practising a week before the day of finals is enough, they say. We use the time to develop co-ordination. We decide on the songs beforehand, he says. All of us are good friends. We talk about music in class and outside, it is our passion that keeps us together, says vocalist Rik Ghosh of the eastern band.

	Learning science the mad way                  A child spins a colour wheel at a Mad Science workshop. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	A scientific principle can be taught as scores of black letters and a couple of diagrams. Or it could take the form of a discovery, leaping out of books through exciting experiments.         
	Instead of reading about a rocket, one could also build one that not only launches at count down but also separates in air like a real rocket. Little surprise that most children prefer the second option.         
	The West Bengal franchise of Canadian organisation Mad Science has started regular After School Programs (ASP) at their office in Survey Park. Very few schools have welcomed our projects so far. We pin our hopes on parents who have been very enthusiastic whenever we given demonstrations in shopping malls, bookstores, at British Council and other public spaces, said Anirban Chanda, the head of Mad Science, Calcutta.         
	An NRI settled in Calcutta, Chanda has had to undergo training to join the initiative. His team of instructors is also trained and every workshop comes scripted to the smallest detail from their headquarters in Canada.         
	They come in boxes. Each box is a complete workshop and we have some 500 hours of content which, when multiplied by seven or eight activities, gives a vast range of shows. said Anirban. There are shows tailored for birthday parties as lots of people abroad are tired of inviting the usual magician or clown. Birthday party shows come in separate boxes too, he adds. Apart from the appliances for experiments and raw material like chemicals, films and magnets, Mad Science headquarters also supplies special science kits. But only those who can afford the programme fees of Rs 3000 for eight hours can get a kit.         
	Another programme offered by them on eight Thursdays or eight Saturday mornings is on everyday science. It introduces five to 12-year-olds to the concepts of light, electricity, water, air and pollution. But on day one (July 5) only 10 students had signed up.         
	Birla Industrial and Technological Museum has been running programmes combining learning with fun for many decades. But the response is never great as homework and exams leave children with little time for fun, said Jayant Sthanapati, director, BITM.

	SHOUT OUT LOUD  
	Whats on your mind this week  Breaking hearts  
	This is with reference to the article Eight minute brush with guv, dated July 1. It was important for the Governor to attend the funeral on the same day as the Bharat Scouts and Guides award ceremony, but he should have given priority to students who had come from far off places like Kalimpong. They stayed overnight at the Ganganagar camp and practised religiously so that they could receive their certificates from the Governor. To get the Rajya Puraskar is a dream for all cadets. It inspires them to serve the nation.         
	The Governor should have taken time out for them, as the Prime Minister does at the annual Vishwabharati convocation in Shantiniketan. Could he have done the same if the person concerned was a politician, and not young students? This attitude from a learned person like Gopal Krishna Gandhi is unexpected.

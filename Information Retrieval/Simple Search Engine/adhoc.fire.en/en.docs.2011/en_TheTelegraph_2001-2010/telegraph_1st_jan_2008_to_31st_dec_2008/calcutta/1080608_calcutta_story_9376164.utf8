                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pachyderms and panjandrums
										      Eyewitness                        A painting at the exhibition on lost palaces of Delhi				                           
	After waiting for years, the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, the flagship of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in Calcutta, has opened at its Ho Chi Minh Sarani address amidst much fanfare and power cuts on May 31. When this correspondent visited the premises last Tuesday, the ceremonial flowers in the giant vases, dry as hay by then, still had not been removed. This box of a building  initially designed by Charles Correa, who had given up in despair  sticks out next to the gracious old bungalows and apartment blocks of this street, which used to be quiet till the police took over and began to treat every passerby like a potential terrorist.        
	Strangely enough, the centre does not seem to have a well-lit flight of stairs after the second floor. When this correspondent sought directions to the third floor from the securityman he was shown a dark staircase, not once but twice.         
	Exhibitions are on on three of the four floors of the Centre. Calcutta does not have a single museum or gallery where a visitor can get a good idea of Bengal art and its evolution. Unfortunately, the ICCR centre does not answer our prayers. The Bengal Gallery on the first floor is meant for exhibitions on loan from the state government, and this time it is on Bengal masters. It has a measly Rabindranath, an insignificant Abanindranath, lots of Jamini Roy and an embarrassing number of Chintamoni Kars. All the paintings are resplendent in frames that are falling to pieces with labels stuck practically on the glass itself.         
	The greats of Bengal sculpture are there but only in name in the Ramkinkar Baij sculpture court on the second floor. There is not a single Meera Mukherjee in sight. As in its painting counterpart, the rest of the space is stuffed with works of practising sculptors who are willing to sacrifice an arm and a leg to be shown anywhere, anyhow. The same goes with the exhibition entitled The Art of Bengal. Here too quality has been sacrificed for quantity. The bureaucrats who run the show are innocent of the virtues of curation  hence this exercise in amateurishness.                  Rabindranath Tagore Centre        
	Reba Som, director of the centre, writes in the Bengal masters handout: The latters student Haren Das (1921-1993) is represented in his exquisite painting Summer Bath with fine water lines exploding in a crescendo. Anybody with even an iota of artistic pretension should be aware that Haren Das was a fine printmaker, and this work depicting buffaloes cooling off is perhaps his finest. Again, in the catalogue for the Art of Bengal Som writes: Artists like Chitravanu Mazumdar (b. 1956), and Jayashree Chakravarty (b. 1956) progressed towards abstraction with allegorical nuances. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the works of these two artists would never have made the mistake of labelling them thus. And these two are just samplers.        
	The Lost Palaces of Delhi and Ajanta photographs of Benoy K. Behl taken in available light held much promise but they turned out to be colour photocopies of the originals. That is a huge disappointment.              
	The Bengal Painters, a group of six, are holding an exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts. Although they are showing their works together they have nothing in common with each other. Abhijit Bhattacharya paints lanky women with a limited number of colours. B.V. Sikder paints fairies and other magical women. Dhiren Kumar Sahas drawing on canvas of a man stretching his limbs is executed with competence. The same can be said of his landscape.         
	Prabir Das has done a series on owls and horses with acrylic. Sandip Bajpeyis so-called digital paintings show much skin and leave little to the imagination. Swapan Paul is actually a sculptor and his forms have nothing airy about them. Of all the six, this artist has something approaching an identity.       SOUMITRA DAS

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Four more police stations and two additional traffic guards will be set up in the city for better crime control and traffic management.
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently approved Calcutta polices proposal to set up the additional thanas and the traffic guards.
    
	There are now 48 police stations across the city.
    
	Of the new police stations, two will be in the south division and one each in the north and the eastern suburban divisions, said Sudhir Mishra, the joint commissioner of police (organisation).
    
	Initially, the police stations will be housed in rented buildings. We are looking for plots to set up our own buildings, Mishra added.
    
	As part of its expansion plan, Calcutta police will also redemarcate the boundaries of its various zones. One more zone will be added to the existing five  central, north, south, eastern suburban and port.
    
	The expansion aims to cut down on the response time. Once the four police stations are set up, we will be able to reach the spot of crime faster. That will also boost the police-public relations, said a senior officer.
    
	Mumbai police has set a deadline of six to eight minutes for its men to reach the spot of a crime. That should be introduced here, too, he added.
    
	The additional traffic guards will usher in better traffic management. We are also planning a tighter vigil on rash and drink-driving, said an officer of the traffic department at Lalbazar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Net cast wide for Todis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Net cast wide for Todis
  - CBI eyes Interpol option as accused plan court appeal          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      
	The CBI has launched a nation-wide hunt  and could even cast the net abroad  for Ashok Todi, brother Pradip Todi and relative Anil Saraogi.        
	A metropolitan magistrate court hearing the Rizwanur Rahman death case had issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the trio on Monday for not appearing in person, though the summons served on them had said they could be represented by their lawyers. The warrant is to be executed by November 3.        
	The three accused, said their lawyers, are waiting for the high court to reopen to seek a stay on the execution of the warrants.         
	The sleuths search for the Todis at their residential addresses in Salt Lake and their office in Burrabazar proved futile. Saraogi, too, could not be found in his Alipore house.        
	When the CBI head office in Delhi learnt that the trio could not be traced, it sought copies of the arrest warrants from Calcutta. We have forwarded the copies to Delhi. Efforts are on to spot and arrest the missing men, said CBI counsel Partha Tapaswi.        
	Preliminary investigations by the CBI suggests that Ashok Todi is in the UK with daughter Priyanka. Pradip Todi and Anil Saraogi are probably still in India.        
	When the summons was sent to Ashok, he was not present. It was handed over to one of his family members, said an official. CBI sources said if Ashok Todi continued to elude them till November 3, they would activate the Interpol.        
	But before taking the search abroad, the CBI bosses want the investigating team in Calcutta to sniff out all contacts and leads to the Todis and Saraogi.        
	If they do not turn up by November 3, we will plead with the court to attach their properties. The next step is to declare them proclaimed absconders, a CBI officer said.        
	The sleuths are gunning for the arrest of the trio before the high court reopens from the Puja recess on October 31.        
	Lawyers for the Todis and Saraogi told Metro that the trio got in touch with them after the warrants were issued and discussed options to evade arrest. We told them that the order could only be challenged in the high court on October 31, said one of the lawyers representing the Todis.        
	We think the high court will consider our appeal. The summons had allowed our clients to be represented in court by their lawyers. So they were not at fault when they chose not to appear on Monday, the lawyer pointed out.

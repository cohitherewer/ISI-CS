The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Talks fail to break   dock deadlock
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Talks fail to break   dock deadlock
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The deadlock at the Diamond Harbour dock could not be broken by the emergency meeting on Friday as the rival unions refused to blink.        
	Unloading of cargo ships at the dock has come to a halt for the past three weeks with a Trinamul Congress-backed union challenging the monopoly of a Citu-backed group that supplies labourers.        
	No ship arrived at the Diamond Harbour dock on Friday. Clearing agents said it proved that word of the deadlock had flowed far up the Hooghly.        
	Friday saw a trickle of cargo from MV Konkar Theo  which had docked on Thursday  to a few mechanised boats, making the clearing agents fret and fume.        
	The unloading is so slow and uncertain that we will end up paying enormous demurrage  Rs 25 lakh for each days delay  to the shipping company, Sharad Varma, the managing director of B. Ghosh and Company.        
	At Fridays meeting in Diamond Harbour sub-divisional officer Siddhartha Shankar Chakrabortys office, the Citu-backed Diamond Harbour Sub-Division Shipping Loading Unloading Workers Union insisted that labourers for the unloading would be supplied by them.        
	The Trinamul Congress-backed Calcutta-Diamond Harbour Port Workers Union demanded that half of the labourers be supplied by them.        
	Both the unions stuck to their positions and no solution emerged, said Chakraborty.        
	Sanghamitra Ghosh, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas, said she would get the report from the sub-divisional officer and then take steps to end the impasse at the Diamond Harbour dock.

	The architecture department of Jadavpur University hosted ZoNASA (Zonal National Association of Students of Architecture) 2008 on campus from October 17 to 19. The three-day fest saw students from IIT Kharagpur, BIT Mesra, CET Bhubaneswar, Besu, Guwahati College of Architecture, ABIT PMCA Cuttack and NIT Raipur putting their creative feats forward. For the first time, students from a college in Bangladesh were also invited to present their work.         
	Rejuvenation was the theme this year. We want to feel rejuvenated and come up with good architectural thinking and practice, explained Deyali Mukherjee, a student coordinator. At the inauguration, the department magazine Trend (Tribune of Environmental Design) was also launched. The events were divided into three categories: formal, informal and casual. The events bore interesting names like Kesh Case (hairstyling) and Escape from Planet Earth (a spaceship designing contest).         
	Its a good exposure for students like us, said Geetika Verma, a third-year student of NIT Raipur. While most senior students took part in formal events like Product Design, Main Design and Interior Design, the juniors had a blast taking part in events such as Sudoku, Tech Khel (a computer gaming session) and Indradhanus (rangoli contest).         
	From strumming the guitar and singing Knocking on Heavens Door to creating clay models on the nuclear deal, the participants had a field day.         
	An indradhanus by IIT Kharagpur student Krush Dattani, depicting a phoenix rising from the flames, bringing good by destroying evil and turning anger into love, drew a huge crowd. The Main Design event saw students trying to design a memorial museum, while at Vanishing Point, participants used their architectural skills to set right a problem.         
	Reubens was yet another spectacular display of the designs by students of different colleges. Panel discussions were held on two days, involving eminent architects and real estate developers.         
	The Role of Architects in Real Estate was an interesting discussion, in which real estate honchos Pradip Sureka, Sumit Dabriwal and Abhijit Sen discussed the coordinated role of architects in the nation. The importance of designing energy-friendly buildings was noted. With the recent economic meltdown, the panelists also stressed on the importance of being adaptable in ones career.

	The thirst for fame is not limited to adults, popular cartoon channel Nickelodeon would have one believe. It is even stronger among children than the wish to travel abroad, own hi-fi gadgets or look good, according to a survey carried out by the channel among 2,300 kids in over 15 cities.         
	Youngsters, growing up on a diet of reality TV  that includes shows directed at children  are no aliens to the world of fame and glamour.         
	It would be nice to own an iPod, but it would be much more exciting to be recognised on the streets, claims Class VII student Arjun Basu. He would love to have a shot at it, even if it meant staying away from family and friends. I would get to make new friends, he insists.         
	Based on the results of the survey, the channel will select three hosts or toon jockeys, between four and 14 years, who will be the faces of the channel for a month. They will decide the programmes that will be telecast, and at which hour, said Nickelodeon India marketing manager, Kashmira Gandhi.         
	The selection will be based on a lucky draw, though there will be some initial screening, said Gandhi.         
	We will stay away from the reality show bandwagon that stresses out kids. The selection will be on the basis of simple questions asked on the channel from 4pm to 8pm, she said.         
	But not all are content to provide entertainment on the idiot box. Those like Ashvika Dalmia and Sarvika Mehra of Calcutta International School might have grown up watching reality shows, but an iPhone or the opportunity to travel abroad would win hands down over being famous on TV.         
	Says Ashvika: It is hardly worth giving up the comforts of home, family and friends for the sake of fame.         
	Agrees Sarvika: It is more enriching to travel to new places and see unknown cultures from up close.

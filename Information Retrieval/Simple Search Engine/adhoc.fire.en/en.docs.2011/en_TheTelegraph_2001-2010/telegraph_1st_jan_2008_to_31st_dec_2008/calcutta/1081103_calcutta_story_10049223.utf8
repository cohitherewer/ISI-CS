	Mercedes-Benz is bringing the most premium lines from its Stuttgart stable to India. This was stated by Sanjiv Sahajwala, the director (sales and marketing) of Mercedes-Benz, India, at the brand show of the Mercedes portfolio at ITC Sonar on Saturday.         
	On display was the AMG line, with high-performance engines fitted to the models. The price tag starts at Rs 78 lakh and goes up to Rs 2.4 crore, but both the company officials and Interkrafts, the sole dealer of Mercedes in Calcutta, are upbeat about a market that is battered by stock market crash and an economic meltdown.        
	We sold 3,141 units between January and October this year compared with 2,141 cars in the corresponding period last year, said Sahajwala. We have already sold 641 more cars than last year, he added, refusing to project figures for November and December.        
	Of these 3,141 units, 74 have been sold in Calcutta against 72 units in 2007, said Interkrafts CEO Hiteshwar Singh. We hope to sell 100 units by the end of this year.        
	The entry-level C-Class is the most popular with 42 units sold this year, followed by 21 units of the E-Class, seven units of the premium saloon S-Class, three of the CLS and one SUV, the M-Class.         
	The company also unveiled the C220 CDI Avant Garde model. Four units of this Rs 34,87,047 car (ex-showroom, Calcutta) have been allotted to the Calcutta market, to be sold in the remaining two months of the year. Interkrafts salesmen are confident of meeting the target.        
	The confidence stems from the sales history of the C-Class variants through this year. The company has sold 25 units of the C200 Kompressor, the four-cylinder in-line petrol engine model in Classic and Elegance lines, 14 units of the C220 CDI, the four-cylinder in-line diesel engine model in Classic and Elegance, and three units of the C230 Avant Garde model with V6 petrol engine in the city this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide at Metro station
                                                                                                               Suicide at Metro station
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A 52-year-old insurance agent committed suicide by jumping in front of a Metro Railway train at Central station on Tuesday morning.        
	Pratap Mondal, an employee of Life Insurance Corporation of India, was run over by the Dum Dum-bound train around 8.30am and died instantly, said an officer of Bowbazar police station.        
	Mondals wife Shikha and their 15-year-old son, a student of National Model School, stay in a rented house in Sodepur. A few months ago, he had moved to a boarding house on Beleghata Main Road after quarrels with his wife.        
	We have found out that Mondal and his wife would often quarrel over family matters and this had prompted him to move out of his rented house a few months ago. The separation from his family might have worsened Mondals depression, said another officer.        
	Police found a suicide note written in English in Mondals pocket. It stated that no one was responsible for his death. He also urged his son to concentrate on his studies.        
	An identity card, a PAN card, a multiple-ride Metro ticket, a telephone index and a diary are among the other items found on Mondal.        
	My brother commuted by Metro to his office on CR Avenue. He was depressed, but we had no idea that he was contemplating suicide. Shikha and the rest of the family members are in a state of shock, said Goutam Mondal.        
	It took Metro officials and policemen over half an hour to collect the mangled remains of Mondal from the tracks and the undercarriage of the train.        
	Train services returned to normal after 9.40am, said a Metro Railway spokesperson said. Thirteen trains were cancelled. Trains were run between Tollygunge and Maidan and Dum Dum and Girish Park.

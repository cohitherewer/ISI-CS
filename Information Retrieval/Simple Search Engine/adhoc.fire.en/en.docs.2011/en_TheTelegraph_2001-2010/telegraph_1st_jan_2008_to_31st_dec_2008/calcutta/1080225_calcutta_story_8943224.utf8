	A Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) drive on Sunday to remove encroachments on both sides of EM Bypass was stopped after protests by the oustees and Trinamul Congress supporters.        
	The drive  to improve traffic flow along the Bypass  targeted structures within 125 ft from the middle of the carriageway, between Kalikapur and Ambedkar bridge.         
	The demolition squad, led by the executive engineer (transport), began work around 8.30am. It was accompanied by a police contingent under deputy superintendent (town) Mehboob Akhtar and Tiljala inspector-in-charge Swapan Pal.        
	The two payloaders razed over 100 encroachments, including fish and vegetable stalls in VIP Bazaar, garages, marble godowns, eateries, tea shops, telephone booths and settlements, before the demonstrations started around 10.30am.        
	The Trinamul supporters alleged that the CMDA had demolished a party office near Ambedkar bridge in ward 66 but spared a CPM office near Miloni Club, in ward 108, which is closer to the road.        
	The other protesters comprised mainly traders, who claimed that their godowns had been demolished despite being more than 125 ft away from the middle of the road.         
	We are not against the removal of encroachments within 125 ft of the Bypass. It is needed to improve traffic flow. We are against police highhandedness and partisanship. If the CPM office is not demolished, we will reconstruct our party office, said Trinamul legislator and councillor Javed Khan.         
	He claimed that on his insistence, the CMDA officials had re-measured the distances of some demolished structures from the road and found them to be over 125 ft.        
	The CMDA officials advised the protesters to lodge complaints with the police so that those unduly affected could be compensated.

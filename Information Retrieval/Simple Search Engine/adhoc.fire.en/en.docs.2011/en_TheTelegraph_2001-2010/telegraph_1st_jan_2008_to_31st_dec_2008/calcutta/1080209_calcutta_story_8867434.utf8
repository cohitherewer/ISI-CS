The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers quit book fair panel
                                                                                                            Writers quit book fair panel
          A STAFF REPORTER                          ALLS FAIR: Writers Sunil Gangopadhyay and Nabanita Dev Sen flank chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the token inauguration of Book Fair 2008 at Town Hall on January 29. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Two of the five writers selected as advisers for Book Fair 2008 have refused to be part of the panel. And excessive government interference could be the reason.        
	I believe the state government should not intervene to the extent its doing now. I will not be part of any advisory committee for the fair, though I will definitely visit it, said novelist Sunil Gangopadhyay, a member of the panel constituted by minister Subhas Chakraborty.        
	I think I would prefer not to be part of the advisory committee. I have no advice to offer and I dont think there are too many people who are willing to listen to me, said Sahitya Akademi award-winning writer Nabanita Dev Sen, another name on Chakrabortys list.        
	The transport minister, the chairman of the book fairs steering committee, is being assisted by five ministers and nine bureaucrats. The chief minister is the chief patron of the fair.        
	There are issues that have not been clarified. For example, if the fair runs up a loss, who will shoulder the burden? Or, if there is a profit, wholl share it? There seems to be no transparency, said a member of a publishers body.        
	Writer Samaresh Majumder, also on the panel, said: If the fair makes a profit, we would suggest that the money be used for the development of libraries across the state. However, too many cooks might spoil the broth. There is nothing wrong with the state government playing a key role in holding the fair, but that does not mean that we will accept whatever decision is thrust on us.        
	Author Buddhadeb Guha is not willing to read too much in the states role in Book Fair 2008. We should be grateful to the state government for organising the fair. I will surely participate in the event; it is a positive initiative, said the member of the advisory committee.

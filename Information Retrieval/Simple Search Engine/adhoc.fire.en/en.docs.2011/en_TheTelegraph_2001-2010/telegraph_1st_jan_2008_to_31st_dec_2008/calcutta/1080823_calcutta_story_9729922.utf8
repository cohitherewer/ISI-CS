                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HC slaps fine on civic body
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday fined the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) Rs 40,000 for not shifting the dumping ground in Belgachhia, Howrah.        
	The division bench of Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Dipankar Dutta also directed the HMC to remove encroachments on the 140-bigha plot within three weeks.        
	In 2003, the high court had ordered the civic body to move the dumping ground, which is in the middle of a residential zone.         
	It seems that either the HMC is not interested enough in carrying out the courts order or it is not doing the needful willingly. So, the court is imposing a fine of Rs 40,000 on the civic authorities and asking it to pay the amount to the registrar-general of Calcutta High Court, stated the division bench on Friday.        
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta moved the court in 2002 saying that dumping of garbage on the plot was posing health risks for residents.        
	When the matter first came up for hearing in November 2003, Dutta showed the judges photographs of the dumping ground and alleged: Forty per cent of the 140-bigha plot has been encroached illegally by shanty-dwellers. During monsoon, garbage chokes the drains causing waterlogging in surrounding residential areas.        
	The lawyer who appeared on behalf of the civic body admitted the dumping ground was creating health hazards. He said the HMC would take action shortly.        
	The division bench had ordered the civic body to shift the dumping ground and remove the encroachers within three months.        
	The matter again came up for hearing in October 2006. The civic bodys lawyer prayed for more time.        
	On Friday, Dutta told the bench: For five years, the HMC has not found time to carry out the courts directive. The problems of the citizens have increased during this period.

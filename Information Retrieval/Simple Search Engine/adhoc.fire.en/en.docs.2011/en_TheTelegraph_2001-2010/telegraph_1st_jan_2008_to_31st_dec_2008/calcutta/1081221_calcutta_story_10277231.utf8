                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seven types of Calcutta

	A visitor to the city in his childhood, Amit Chaudhuri has grown up in Mumbai and studied in England. At present he lives in Calcutta but divides his time between the two continents, juggling his career as a novelist, critic, poet and musician based in Calcutta with his job as a professor of contemporary literature at the University of East Anglia.         
	Not an ideal candidate, so to say, for editing an anthology on the city, but publishers Penguin had full faith in one of his generations best writers as endorsed by Guardian.         
	The result is Memorys Gold, Writings on Calcutta, the 10th in the series of city anthologies published by Penguin. It is a definitive volume of writings on the city that have been selected and given a careful interpretation by its editor.         
	Chaudhuri wasnt interested in arranging his selected pieces chronologically, and while sifting through a growing mass of material, had no categories in his head to classify his pieces.         
	In that sense Memorys Gold is not a chronological anthology or even a canonical one. Rather, it is a volume of writings that are in relationship with each other.         
	Chaudhuri interprets the relationship with short, interspersed text. An anthology should not just be a representation of literature but carry with it a personal imprint of its editor, said Chaudhuri, who has also put together the Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature.         
	Divided into seven sections, the anthology begins with 19th century writings that are the beginnings of the arrivals in Calcutta. A recording of the Anglo-Bengali contact, Arrivals kicks off with Henry Meredith Parker, an early 19th century Anglo-Indian poet, whose satirical fluidity sets the tone of the volume.         
	Tagores The Dark Girl heralds the arrival of Kadambari Debi into Jorasanko as do Michael Madhusudan Dutts Letter of a certain literate audience. No anthology on the city would be complete without the 19th century satirical commentary Hootum Pyanchar Naksha by Kaliprasanna Singha.         
	Following Arrivals is the Exile or Domicile, a bunch of writings by authors who lived in the city but experienced an inner exile.         
	Different forms of exile are represented, most of them intellectual with a natural sense of rootedness. They are not natural exiles but are enacting exile, explains Chaudhuri, who was drawn by the brilliance of Sunil Gangopadhyays Neera, a list of delirious sentences and observations that follow a logic of its own.         
	Calcutta is also the city of loiterer, the vagrant and the pieces in Flanerie, particularly Buddhadeva Boses Tithidore, exemplify how, as Walter Benjamin, the Flanerie theorist, said, getting lost in a city is an art in itself. Boses Adda too shows the usage of urban space, explains Chaudhuri.         
	Quirky but essential in this volume is the section on manifestoes that has among other pieces Kabir Sumans hit number Tomake Chai. This is an ironical view of the city, a declamatory form, comments the editor.         
	Visitors to the city like Gunter Grass, Amit says, are important not so much to Calcuttas self-conception as to others conception of it. The Visitors section includes Allen Ginsbergs The Chinese Opium Den as his own piece Beyond Translation.         
	But more importantly, for the Calcuttan, employment, more than money or even property, is a fundamental end in itself, says Chaudhuri. Forms of Employment, another of Chaudhuris take on the city, includes a portion of Sarnath Banerjees graphic novel The Barn Owls Wondrous Capers. The anthology winds up with Memory, which has, among other pieces, Sasthi Bratas My God Died Young.         
	Editing an anthology is a thankless job, it involves a lot of shifting and moving about material like a tactile artist, says Chaudhuri. But he agreed to do it because he was tempted by the promise of doing something about Calcutta. Memorys Gold holds out a lot of promise to the bibliophile and those who love Calcutta, despite everything.                          ANASUYA BASU

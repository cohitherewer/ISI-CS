                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Techie denies assault on sergeant
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Debanjan Bhattacharya was arrested on Wednesday morning for allegedly assaulting traffic sergeant Santosh Roy at the Parama rotary. The police had slapped three charges on him  violation of traffic rules, preventing an officer from performing his duty and assaulting him. The 28-year-old narrates his version to Metro              
	A number of charges were slapped on me, all because I protested when an ambulance was stopped to let a VIP car pass.        
	I was going to office in Sector V from my house in the Abhishikta complex, near Ruby Hospital, on my motorcycle. An ambulance carrying a patient was going the same way. We stopped at a signal at the Parama rotary. Though the ambulance kept blaring its siren, it was not allowed to pass.        
	There were only seven or eight cars at the signal. The other lanes were empty except for a VIP car that was travelling towards Park Circus from Salt Lake.        
	I felt bad that an ambulance was kept waiting. So when the light turned green, I went over to the traffic sergeant on duty and asked him why the ambulance was made to wait.         
	A heated exchange ensued, and the sergeant suddenly lost his temper and took the keys from my motorcycle, threatening to seize it to teach me a lesson. I told him that I had not broken any rules and tried to wrest my keys from him. He called some traffic constables and took me to the Parama Investigation Centre, slapping and cuffing me.         
	The sergeant filed a case against me but when I wanted to lodge a complaint, the cops refused, saying that I was under arrest. The sergeant asked all his juniors to turn witnesses and they agreed. He also told me that he would undergo a medical check-up for his finger and use it as evidence.        
	They also asked me to hand over my cellphone. When I protested, the cops used force on me, tore my belt and put me in the lock-up.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade, too, deviated from the sergeants version on Thursday, saying that the altercation started when Debanjan complained about north-bound cars not being allowed to go. He, however, maintained that Debanjan had assaulted Roy.        
	There was no question of assaulting or harassing Debanjan, said Ranade.

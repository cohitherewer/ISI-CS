     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Two Bangladeshis, in their late 40s, suspected to be ISI agents and activists of Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami were arrested at Shalimar, in Howrah, on Tuesday night.
    
	A dozen gelatin sticks, maps of army installations in the Northeast and two CDs of speeches exhorting youths to join the jehadis were found on the duo, identified as Mohammad Shamim Akhtar and Alam Abdul Malik, alias Alamgir.
    
	The two told the CID during interrogation that they were recruiting retired personnel of the army and the paramilitary forces as jehadis and collecting information about army installations on behalf of the ISI. 
    
	The people recruited in and around the city were taken to Dhaka. After a session at a building there, they used to be sent to Pakistan for training in handling explosives, said Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector-general (operations) of the CID.
    
	After completion of training, the duo used to bring the jehadis back to Calcutta and give them various assignments, added Kumar. 
    
	An official of the CIDs Special Operation Group said: Arabinda Biswas, a retired CRPF jawan, contacted us on Tuesday and told us that Shamim had met him last month and asked him questions related to the army. Biswas was supposed to meet Shamim for the second time on Tuesday night. We laid a trap and caught Shamim and Alamgir. 
    
	The two were produced in Howrah court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till January 30.

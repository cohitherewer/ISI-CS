                      Contemporary vision                    In the 21st century, art in India is as varied as it has never been before. Constantly experimenting with new forms, styles, themes and ideas, artists of the new generation refuse to be categorised as belonging to any particular school. Larger Perspective, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings by 20 artists, is an attempt to showcase the diverse characteristics of young Indian painters, who yet retain their distinct Indianness. Their medium of expression vary and the artists revel in dextrous use of colour, making their compositions all the more poignant and meaningful. The show also highlights the slow but steady trend among emerging young artists to shift from abstract expression to portrayal of more concrete human forms. Concern for nature and the environment, social equality, religious harmony and universal peace and brotherhood, are some of the favourite subjects handled by the artists, besides representation of personal feelings, emotions and experiences. Participating artists include Aloke Paul, Anup Giri (a painting by him appears here), Dewashish Das, Kanchanmala Ghosh, Parag Adhikary, Sachin Jaltare, Shubendu Porel and Swapan Palley.

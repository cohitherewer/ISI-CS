      Political divide on green guard                                Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom signs autographs at the launch of his book Paradise Drowning on the sidelines of the Business for Environment (B4E) summit in Singapore on April 22. In an impassioned plea to a UN-backed environment conference, Gayoom called for a cut in global greenhouse gas emissions before rising sea levels submerge his paradise island chain and other low-lying territory.

	Are our politicians naive or do they purposely look the other way when it comes to environmental issues like climate change? Take our transport and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty. The Sunderbans and Calcutta are among the places most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but Chakraborty feels that there is no need to attach much importance to environmental problems.           
	At a seminar organised by a contractors association of the CMDA, the minister dwelled on climate change. He declared that a few environmentalists may raise a hue and cry but there is nothing much to worry because changes in climate do happen and they will be automatically adjusted.          
	The minister went on to state that felling of a few trees and filling up of some waterbodies will not make much of a difference.          
	Though few will put their foot in their mouth like Chakraborty, many politicians across the country in private voice similar views. No wonder the environmental laws remain on paper and natural resources are violated at will in India.          
	The situation is not the same in rest of the world. A number of world leaders, cutting across political divide, are showing real concern about environmental matters. Even leaders in developing countries are taking notice.          
	For countries like the Maldives, global warming could very well become a matter of life and death, wrote the Maldives President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, in his foreword to the book Global Warning by British environmental writer Paul Brown.          
	The President added that the book has been a clarion call to all those who ignore years of extensive research and proof that global warming is real and an impending major threat to the whole world, and gifted the book to many heads of state to raise awareness about climate change and related issues.          
	He should have sent a copy to Subhas Chakraborty.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Three more arrests for suppliers murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Three persons were arrested in the past 24 hours in connection with the abduction and murder of a construction material supplier in Uttarpara last month. Six persons have been booked for the murder of Sailendra Kumar Sharma, who was in his mid-40s.        
	Police said the trio were on the run since Sharmas body was recovered from a septic tank in Dankuni last month.         
	Sharma went missing on April 11 after he left home on business. His decomposed body was recovered a month later from the tank, 10 km from his house, after local people complained of a stench.        
	Gopal Hati, the owner of the house where the tank was located, was arrested shortly after the body was found. But his two sons escaped.        
	Hati said during interrogation that his next-door neighbour Niranjan Bag and his wife Sandhya were Sharmas business rivals.        
	Niranjan, who also supplied building materials, had a rivalry with Sharma. He and son Tapan had hatched a plan to murder Sharma and the other accused helped them carry it out, said a CID official.        
	We arrested the couple but their son Tapan managed to give us the slip, the official added.        
	The sleuths came to know that Tapan would come to Uttarpara on Sunday. We laid a trap and arrested him. His interrogation helped us track down Gopals two sons, Somenath and Swapan, said the official.        
	According to P. Nirajnayan, the special inspector-general of police (CID), the Bag and Hati families are close to each other.         
	Niranjan knew that if he could wipe out Sharma, his business network would spread in the area. He had even threatened Sharma several times, asking him to shift his business away from the Uttarpara-Dankuni belt, said another official. All the accused have been tracked down, said Nirajnayan.

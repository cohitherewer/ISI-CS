          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is planning to set up a 20-bed hospital for its students and employees. The hospital will also house a centre for research in bio-medical science.        
	Officials said the hospital and the research centre, which will offer services at subsidised rates, will come up following an upgrade of the medical service-cum-diagnostic centre that the university runs on Muktaram Babu Street.         
	A private group has recently offered help for the upgrade.        
	The proposal was placed before the syndicate on Tuesday. The authorities decided to set up a committee which will examine the ways to upgrade the centre.        
	The matter is in a preliminary stage, said registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.        
	The syndicate also approved in principle a proposal to set up a centre for research in astronomical instrumentation in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.

	Undergraduate examinees of Calcutta University will be able to apply for a review of their answer scripts through their colleges. The decision was taken by the universitys syndicate on Tuesday. Earlier, the examinees had to collect the forms from the university and submit them there. Now, the forms will be available from the colleges, which will also receive the filled-up forms.

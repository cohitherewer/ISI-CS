     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
             While the high court hears out the parties about holding Book Fair 2008 on Park Circus Maidan, work on erecting the stalls has already begun. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 
                 
	A petition before the high court challenging the choice of venue for Book Fair 2008 will be disposed of on January 24.
    
	This was announced on Monday by a division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh, which has been hearing a plea to shift the fair from Park Circus Maidan.
    
	The fair is scheduled to start on January 29 and continue till February 10.
    
	The bench asked the Publishers and Booksellers Guild (organisers of the fair), state government and the state pollution control board to file affidavits by January 23.
    
	The government and the board will have to state in their affidavits whether they had issued the clearances for the Guild to organise the fair on Park Circus Maidan. The Guild has been asked to produce these documents.
    
	The petition, filed by a few residents of Darga Road, off Park Circus Maidan, pleads for an order to maintain status quo till the case is disposed of. But the bench declined to pass the order.
    
	Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Asoke De argued that if Book Fair could be banned on the Maidan (off Park Street) for environmental reasons, it could not be held on Park Circus Maidan either. The roads around Park Circus Maidan are congested and snarls are a regular feature. The traffic system will collapse if the fair is held there, De submitted. 
    
	Chief Justice Nijjar asked De why the ground is called Park Circus Maidan. Its so named because circuses used to be held there, the lawyer replied. Then whats wrong with holding the Book Fair? the chief justice asked.
    
	Sources said two other petitions with similar pleas are in queue and would join the case as added parties during the next hearing.
    
	Advocate-general Balai Ray appeared for the state, while Shaktinath Mukherjee argued for the Guild. Kallol Basu appeared for the pollution control board.

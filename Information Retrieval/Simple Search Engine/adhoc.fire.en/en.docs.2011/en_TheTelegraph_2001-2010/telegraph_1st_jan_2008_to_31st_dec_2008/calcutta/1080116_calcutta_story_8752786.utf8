	The words that Burrabazar was waiting to hear from early on Saturday were finally spoken 93 hours after the first flames leapt out of the Nandaram Market complex.
    
	The fire is under control, said Pankaj Mohan Chowdhury, the deputy director of fire services. It was 10.01pm on Tuesday and smoke was still billowing out of a few pockets of the beleaguered building.
    
	According to a source in the fire services department, 7.30pm was when the term fire under control was first used in the internal communication among officials.
    
	Surrounded by anxious traders and residents of the area, Chowdhury clarified: There are pocket fires in some portions that are causing the fumes. The fire-fighters are trying to douse the embers, but these pocket fires may take two days to put out completely.
    
	Even as Chowdhury addressed a group of Nandaram shopkeepers and Burrabazar residents, firemen battled their way to the rooftop of the market complex.
    
	There is no question of downscaling operations on Tuesday night or pulling out of the area till the last pocket fire is put out, said Chowdhury.
    
	The announcement was greeted with resignation rather than rejoicing. There is nothing to celebrate. The fire should have been brought under control on the first day itself. There is nothing left to save, said a weary trader, who has a shop and a godown in Nandaram.
    
	The flames played hide-and-seek with firemen throughout Day IV of the blaze, which had begun on a note of hope.
    
	At 4am on Tuesday, for the first time since Saturday morning, the blaze beast seemed to have been tamed.
    
	The 42-metre skylift summoned from Haldia Petrochemicals was the hero. We focussed our water-jet on one side of the market while the state fire and emergency services skylift sprayed the other side. By 4am, we had put out the fire till the 12th floor, said Sanjeev Das, a Haldia Petrochemical skylift operator. 
    
	There was no flame in sight  till 11.45am. The flames flickered again, this time on the 13th floor, scorching the growing hope among traders that they would be allowed to enter the building and salvage some goods.
    
	Throughout the day, the fire-fighters battled the flames and fumes, from floors 11 to 13.
    
	Later in the day, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said two inter-departmental committees would be set up to probe the legal aspects of the buildings and also to ascertain the cause of the fire that has destroyed goods worth crores.

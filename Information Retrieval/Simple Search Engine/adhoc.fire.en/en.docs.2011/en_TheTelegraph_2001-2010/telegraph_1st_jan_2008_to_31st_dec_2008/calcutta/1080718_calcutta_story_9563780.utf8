The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal shift to LPG
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Illegal shift to LPG
  - Autos divert domestic fuel          JAYANTA BASU                          Adulterated fuel being sold in a Howrah shop                                         
	The government has failed to enforce the deadline for autorickshaws to shift to liquefied petroleum gas in Calcutta but in Bongaon and neighbouring areas nearly a thousand have done so on their own  illegally.        
	The LPG they use is diverted from cylinders for subsidised domestic supply. Such autos are creeping into city areas as well.        
	Chapal Banerjee, who is in charge of the Regional Transport Authority, Barasat, said: Many domestic cylinders are ending up with the autos. There is a nexus between auto owners and gas cylinder dealers in the region.        
	Banerjee admitted that even though his department did catch a few, the practice continued to flourish.        
	This raises the tantalising possibility that auto owners could one day achieve illegally what they would not do legally, if the government can ensure clandestine supply of subsidised cooking gas cylinders for all such vehicles.        
	The reason is economic. While the cost per kilometre of petrol is Rs 2.50, for subsidised domestic LPG it is about Re 1.        
	For the same reason, all over North 24-Parganas autos are using diesel -- again illegally-- that costs Rs 1.80 per km. These vehicles, bigger in size than petrol autos, can now be found even in Behala, Tollygunge and Metiabruz.         
	It is not possible to register diesel autos anywhere in the entire Calcutta metropolitan area because they do not meet the specified pollution norms but its a fact that many are illegally plying in the area, Banerjee said.         
	He added that such diesel-run autos are often caught and penalised.        
	Asish Chowdhury, who owns a diesel auto, said the administration had not heeded their appeal to allow the vehicles to be registered.        
	Nearly 15,000 diesel autorickshaws, all unregistered, are running in North 24 Parganas, he said.        
	Local sources said each diesel auto owner paid a minimum of Rs 30 daily to the union in return for the protection they received. In Barasat alone, over 100 such autos would deliver around Rs 1 lakh a month to the union.        
	For autorickshaws, in Calcutta and elsewhere, all roads lead to the union.        
	It will be wrong to think that though domestic LPG is being used illegally, there will at least be a green dividend. Experts say the use of domestic gas as transport fuel is polluting because the composition is vastly different. Being used for a purpose not meant to, its also fraught with risks of accident.

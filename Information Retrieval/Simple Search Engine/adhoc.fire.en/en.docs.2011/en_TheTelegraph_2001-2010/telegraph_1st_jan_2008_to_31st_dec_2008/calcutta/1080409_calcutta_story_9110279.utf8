  - Campus meet to draw up measures          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jadavpur University (JU) is set to firm up its anti-ragging measures on Wednesday, about two months before the 2008 academic session of undergraduate courses begins.        
	Officials said JUs executive council on Wednesday will take up the report of a four-member panel that was appointed recently to suggest ways to stop ragging on campus.        
	Both the Centre and the state government had banned ragging following a Supreme Court order in 1996, but harassment of freshers by seniors has not stopped on the JU campus.        
	Sources said the committee, comprising teachers and officials of the university, has suggested that first-year students be kept in a separate hostel. The universitys main hostel complex is outside the campus. But there are two hostels, where postgraduate and senior undergraduate students are put up, on the campus.        
	The panel has recommended that only first-year students be allotted the two campus hostels, which together have 150 seats. According to the proposal, no senior students will be allowed to enter the hostels after 10pm.        
	Ragging in any form is prohibited in our institution, said JU registrar Rajat Banerjee. We want to intensify our vigil further. But we will be able to spell out our anti-ragging measures only after discussing the report at Wednesdays meeting.        
	A second-year student of engineering was forced to drink kerosene by his seniors days after he moved into a hostel last year. Following a complaint, the university formed an inquiry committee that found the allegation to be true.        
	The probe held two students guilty  one was suspended from the university and the other from the hostel for a year.

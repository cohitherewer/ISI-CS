	Sucharita Dutta is nursing 57 stitches on her face and spending every waking moment fearing how her face will look like once the bandages are removed. 
    
	The 17-year-old is going through the trauma for no fault of hers  she fell victim to the reckless ways of a driver behind the wheel of a poorly-maintained pool car.
    
	The Class XI student of Assembly of God Church School 
    
	recounted her horror story to Metro from her hospital bed on Thursday morning...
        
	I go back home (off BK Pal Avenue) from school by bus. This pool car only drops me to school in the morning. On Wednesday, I decided to get into the pool car  and not wait for a bus  because it was raining heavily when school gave over.
    
	I was to get down at Sealdah, from where I would walk down to my aunts house in Bowbazar. I got into the front seat of the Ambassador with Madhumonti (Das, a student of Class VIII) who would also get down at Sealdah. Two boys were going further north and so they sat in the back seat.
    
	Suresh was, as usual, driving recklessly. The driver of the pool car changed every two weeks because the owner apparently did not pay them properly. Suresh had been driving us for three weeks. He did not know the roads and was always rash. We had several near-misses earlier.
    
	On Wednesday, he turned towards Mullickbazar and started speeding towards Moulali. It was raining heavily and the wipers of the car were not working.
    
	Suresh was using one hand to wipe the windscreen and the other to steer the car. He was also turning back and telling the boys to wipe the glass screen at the back. All this while, he did not take his foot off the accelerator!
    
	Then, I received a call from my aunt on my cellphone. I was talking to her when I saw Suresh turning his head back as if to talk to the boys.... The next thing I remember is hearing a loud crash.
    
	Suresh had lost control of the car and banged it against the pavement. The left side of the windscreen shattered and the pieces of glass flew at me. My face started to bleed.
    
	Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Suresh opening the door and fleeing.
    
	I was crying in pain. I could also hear Madhumonti crying. A mechanic who was standing nearby rushed to the car. He took us to his shop and gave us some first-aid. But I did not stop bleeding. He then rushed us to hospital (Assembly of God Church) in a taxi.
    
	The doctors took around four hours to stitch up my face. I was later told there were 57 stitches on my face!
    
	My face now feels numb. I am having trouble speaking. I am suffering so much for no fault of mine.
    
	(Sucharita returned home on Thursday evening. Madhumonti had been discharged on Wednesday evening with 22 stitches on her face.)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fund woes for academy art show
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fund woes for academy art show
          A STAFF REPORTER                          art attack: An exhibition of paintings at the Academy of Fine Arts. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The 73rd annual all-India fine arts exhibition of the Academy of Fine Arts is likely to be cancelled this year, breaking a long tradition that has launched some of the biggest names in art.        
	Members of the executive committee of the academy say that despite repeated reminders, the board of trustees  which controls the budget  has not allotted any funds for the exhibition. Last years budget was around Rs 4 lakh.         
	The galleries have just been renovated and we had hoped to make this years display of paintings, sculptures and graphics a grand affair. But the lack of cooperation from the board has spoiled our plans, said Bulbul Roy, the joint secretary of the academy.        
	Although they have not made an official announcement, it is evident that an event of this scale cant be arranged in such a short time. The exhibition usually takes place in the third week of December and we start preparing months before that, Roy added.        
	The board of trustees cited a shortage of funds for not sanctioning the money.        
	The academy is managed by two committees  a seven-member board of trustees, headed by a chairman, and a 21-member executive committee, headed by a president.         
	The board is in charge of the academys property and finances. The amount of money at the disposal of the executive committee has remained static at Rs 2,500 since 1946, when the salary of the academy gardener was around Rs 5 and an office employee would earn something around Rs 20. All expenses above Rs 2,500 have to be sanctioned by the trustees.        
	The board of trustees, headed by interim chairman A.K. Mukherjee, had recently suggested that sponsorships be sought for the annual event.         
	The board said efforts must be made to earn at least Rs 10 lakh after covering the cost of the show, as there has been little profit in previous years.         
	Roy disputed this claim. In 2006, the income was over Rs 7 lakh while the expenditure was around Rs 3 lakh. Even last year, when the parking ban near the academy became a deterrent for visitors, the expenditure was Rs 4 lakh and income around Rs 5.5 lakh, Roy pointed out.         
	She felt it would be meaningless to seek sponsors if the trustees continued to choke all funds of the academy, including donations for prize money and renovation.         
	Roy alleged that the attitude of the trustees had nearly stalled the gallerys renovation. A donation of Rs 25 lakh could be used only after the PWD got involved, she said. Even now the Rs 2 lakh received from a patron on April 30, 2007, for renovation of the toilets is lying unutilised, she added.         
	The executive committee members also felt that hiking the 25 per cent sales commission during the exhibition, as suggested by the trustees, would go against the objective of the academy, which began in 1933 as a charitable trust for the promotion of the arts.         
	The executive committee has organised a convention at the academy on December 2 at 5pm to discuss the funds issue. Academy members, artists, art lovers and theatre persons are expected to attend.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CAT posers spring surprise
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CAT posers spring surprise

	Ashwini Agrawal was taken aback when he opened his test booklet for the Common Admission Test (CAT) on Sunday morning.        
	The two-and-a-half-hour test, the gateway to the seven IIMs and other premier B-schools, had more questions than the 2.6-lakh examinees were expecting.        
	Instead of 75 questions that were set in the past two years, the CAT paper this time had 90.        
	It was a shock as the time management we were used to had to be changed, said Agrawal, a fourth-year student of the West Bengal University of Technology. The number of questions in CAT was reduced from 150 in 2003 to 90 in 2005 and 75 the year after.        
	The verbal ability section had 40 questions and mathematics and data interpretation, as was the practice, 25 each.        
	Usually, English is just one-third of the overall weightage if data interpretation and mathematics are taken together as the quantitative section. We decided to increase the number of questions in the verbal ability section to make the papers more balanced, especially because soft skills have now become important, said Subrata Mitra, the chairman (admissions) of IIM Calcutta.        
	Overcoming the initial shock, most candidates, however, were happy with the test.        
	The mathematics and data interpretation papers had no surprises and the verbal ability section was less ambiguous than last year, said Ayesha Chatterjee, an engineering student of Techno India.        
	Group discussion and personal interview are still ahead but I hope to get a call from one of the institutes, she said.        
	CAT coaching centres, however, were quick to add a word of caution. The papers might be easy but also deceptive. Students had to answer more questions than last year, increasing the chances of giving wrong answers, said Kaushik Kapoor of Erudite.        
	An easier test and a better performance will also mean tougher competition, the coaching centres feel. If everyone performs well, the cut-off marks will go up, said Rahul Reddy of TIME.        
	The aspirants, though happy, are far from relaxed. With so many candidates fighting for around 1,800 seats, the chances of getting through are slim. I have to work hard for the other exams, too, said Chatterjee.

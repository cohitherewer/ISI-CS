          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A teenager who pretended to drive a share cab and three youths who would pose as his passengers have been arrested on charges of robbing pedestrians at night.        
	Rizwan Ali, 24, Mohammad Jamshed, 28, Abdul Gaffar, 24, and the 14-year-old whose name police refused to reveal were netted from Beniapukur on Tuesday following a tip-off from a local gang.        
	The boy used to drive a Tata Indica at night, while the other three would sit in the rear posing as passengers. They would pick up men waiting for a taxi and rob them, said an investigating officer.        
	The gang allegedly robbed two passengers in an hour on May 24 night. Both lodged complaints with the detective department the next day, the officer added.        
	The four picked up Karunamoyee-bound Saurav Haldar from the AJC Bose Road-Circus Avenue crossing around 9.20pm. On reaching Tangra, the trio in the rear brought out revolvers and asked Haldar to hand over his wallet.        
	A shocked Haldar complied but there was only Rs 100 and a debit card in the wallet. The gang then snatched Haldars cellphone and drove to a Beniapukur ATM, where they forced Haldar to withdraw Rs 9,000 and give them the money, the officer said.        
	The gangs next victim was Diptiyan Dyashi, who was waiting for a share cab in front of Gorky Sadan. On Park Circus No. 4 bridge, the armed trio forced Dyashi to hand over his gold chain, ring, cellphone and Rs 200.        
	The boy who drove the car worked in a Beniapukur garage. The trio lured him to take out the vehicle at night. We are trying to ascertain their antecedents, the officer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleuths pursue Bilkanda link
                                                                                                               Sleuths pursue Bilkanda link
          A STAFF REPORTER                                               The front gate of Rakesh Gupta rsquo;s apartment block, VIP Enclave. A Telegraph picture    
	Company secretary Rakesh Gupta had spent the last few hours before being murdered late on Sunday with someone he knew, police suspect.        
	"The person is likely to be a resident of Ghola, on the northern fringes of the city," said an investigating officer.        
	Ghola, in Sodepur, is less than a kilometre from Bilkanda, where Gupta's body was found in a blood-soaked gunny bag on Monday morning.        
	"It is vital to find out why Bilkanda was chosen as the dumping ground. The killers could have taken the body in a car and thrown it off anywhere along Sodepur Road," the officer added. "Once the Bilkanda connection is established, we will find answers to several other questions."        
	The sleuths are still clueless about the shop from where the assailants had bought sedatives. The police suspect Gupta was forced to consume sedatives before he was strangled.        
	The sleuths who visited Bilkanda on Wednesday think the killers had brought the body on a cycle-van. There is a country liquor shop close to the spot where the body was dumped. The officers also spoke to Swarup Ghosh, a Class V student of Sashibhushan High School, who spotted the body.        
	"Bilkanda has some criminal links," pointed out an officer. The motorcycle which the killers of former South Dum Dum Municipality chairman Sailen Das rode on the day of murder was recovered from there. Gobindo Biswas, the key accused in the murder of an engineer and his driver on Durgapur Expressway, near Singur, last year was arrested in Bilkanda.        
	The police have spoken to some of Gupta's relatives, but most said they were unaware of any financial mess that he could have been in.        
	"We need to speak to Gupta's wife. But it is difficult to question her, since she is in an advanced stage of pregnancy," an officer said.

	A flyover, a railway overbridge and a service road are part of a Rs 400-crore plan to decongest the EM Bypass.         
	The project cost will be shared by the Centre-backed Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and the state government.        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will build a flyover from the Beleghata intersection to Captains Bheri on the EM Bypass, over the Rajarhat flyover at the Chingrihata intersection. The 16-metre flyover, to cost about Rs 70 crore, will be built on a single pier.        
	The proposed flyover will have a double-lane carriageway. It will put an end to the regular traffic snarls at the Chingrihata intersection. The stretch is narrower than the road on both sides and is thus a bottleneck, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the director-general of the CMDAs traffic and transportation department.         
	Officers at Beleghata Traffic Guard explained to the Lalbazar traffic brass how vehicles are forced to slow down at the intersection. A recent survey on the points of traffic congestion on the Bypass confirmed the observations. It was decided that the Chingrihata stretch of the Bypass had to be either widened or a flyover built over it.         
	The CMDA will also build a second railway overbridge along the existing Bagha Jatin overbridge to cater to the demand for road space at this junction.         
	There has been a real estate boom in the area and more flat-owners are opting for cars. Hence it is necessary to offer space on the Bagha Jatin overbridge. The 325-metre long overbridge, parallel to the existing one, will be built for around Rs 200 crore, said a CMDA engineer.        
	A service road from Hiland Park to Patuli along the western edge of the Bypass will be built. The aim is to ensure that vehicles leaving and entering highrise buildings and shopping malls on the Bypass do not use the main thoroughfare.         
	The urban planners should have realised the importance of service roads along the EM Bypass. After two decades of the Bypasss existence, only a few stretches have proper service roads, said a senior architect of the urban development department.

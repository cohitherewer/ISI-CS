The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Store launch on a festival day 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Store launch on a festival day

	In a town that celebrates Jagaddhatri puja with fervour through the night into the day, a bookstore opening on a day prior to the puja should have been a non-event. Yet people came in, in a steady trickle at the just-opened Ananda bookstore strategically placed at the crossing of Station Road and Bagbazar of Chandernagore.        
	Bookstores, particularly stores that sell story books, are hard to come by here, said resident Prabhat Kumar Das. Most of the stores here are stocked with textbooks.         
	Popular Bengali novelist Sankar, who inaugurated the 125 sq ft well-appointed store, spoke about Chandernagores literary heritage. Aurobindo started his literary career here. Besides, this town has a club called English Lovers Society. We have learnt English to keep our jobs. But this club encourages people to learn the language out of love.        
	The town once had a number of libraries too, reminisced the author, whose Nibedita Research Laboratory flew off the shelf even as we spoke. The Ananda store is just a few yards from a stately building that proclaims itself as Nritya Gopal Smriti Mandir Pathagar, but which during Jagaddhatri puja is doubling as a Mughlai restaurant.         
	This is the typical fate of libraries now. None is maintained. They dont receive any funds either, said Sankar. He is upbeat that Ananda is starting its outlets all over the state.        
	This is Anandas sixth outlet, informs Subir Mitra of Ananda. We have opened stores in Siliguri, Santiniketan and three in Calcutta. quot; Though small in comparison with its College Street or Rashbehari outlet, the one at Chandernagore displays all 2,400 titles of Ananda.         
	Young publisher        
	British Council India and Oxford Bookstore have launched the Young Publishing Entrepreneur Award, 2009. A panel of experts will interview short-listed candidates from among applicants who should be between 25 and 35.         
	On January 30, 2009, the panel will interview candidates from all over the country in Calcutta and will announce the winner at an awards ceremony the same evening.         
	This is the sixth year of the award. The winner goes on a 10-day tour of the UK publishing industry in April at the time of the London Book Fair and competes for the International Young Publishing Entrepreneur Award of the Year 2009.         
	Last year, the Indian winner, S. Anand, proprietor of a small Chennai publishing house Navayana, went on to win the international award.         
	But in past years, a majority of the applicants have been employees of multinational publishing houses. May be its not easy to be a free-standing entrepreneur in publishing by 35! But if you are, hurry and apply by December 10.         
	The magic returns        
	J.K. Rowlings first book since the final Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is set for a global launch on December 4. Pre-booking has started at Calcutta stores. Published by Bloomsbury, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, priced at Rs 595, is a richly magical collection of tales from J.K. Rowling that will satisfy fans and new readers alike.         
	The Tales of Beedle the Bard played a crucial role in helping Harry, Ron and Hermione defeat Lord Voldemort.

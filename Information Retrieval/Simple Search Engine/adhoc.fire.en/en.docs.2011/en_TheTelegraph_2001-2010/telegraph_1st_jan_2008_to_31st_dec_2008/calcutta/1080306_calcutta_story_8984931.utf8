The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Funds challenge for special champs
                                                                                                               Funds challenge for special champs
  - Siblings from Rajarhat Selected for Asia pacific games in kuwait          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Siblings Reazur Rahman and Sanam Parvin practise their javelin throw. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Reazur Rahman was selected for Deaflympics thrice but could not take part due to a lack of funds.        
	Sanam Parvin made it to the Deaflympics in Australia in 2005 but could not compete in her favourite event because of late arrival of funds.        
	The siblings are about to lose another chance of achieving glory for the country. Their participation in the seventh Asia Pacific Games of the Deaf, to be held in Kuwait in April, is under a cloud once again due to funds crunch.        
	Rahman, 34, and Parvin, 28, are two of the four children of Abdul Momen, a shopkeeper in Rajarhat who struggles to make ends meet. His daughter Sabana Yeasmin is also a sports champion in multiple disciplines and hearing impaired like Rahman and Parvin.        
	The pride the family takes in their achievement is evident from a wooden board put up in their Rajarhat home, displaying the gold medals won by the trio. The trophies and other prizes are stored in two cupboards in the same room.        
	The three started showing interest in sports while studying at Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School. Being a sportsman, I have always encouraged them, said a proud Momen.        
	His eldest son Rakibur, who is not hearing impaired, followed Momens footsteps and became a local football champion, before a torn knee cartilage cut his career short. He is now busy coaching Rahman and Parvin. Yeasmin, who is married, is not participating in sports at the moment.        
	After an outstanding performance at the National Championship of the Deaf, Parvin and Rahman were selected to be a part of the 70-member Indian contingent at the Asia Pacific Games of the Deaf.        
	Rahman has been chosen for javelin throw and football, while Parvins events are javelin throw and short put. The family, however, has no way of arranging for the Rs 73,000 required for each of them to participate in the competition.        
	We dont even have enough money to eat properly. Where will we get the money to participate in the competition? asked Parvin. She and Rahman have appeared in examinations for railway jobs. They hope to continue playing if they get jobs.        
	Momen has approached Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Gopalpur municipality, for help. March 15 is the last date for submission of fees.

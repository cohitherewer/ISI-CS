 - Airline orders inquiry into breach of airport security
     A STAFF REPORTER
                         
	Three passengers of an international flight entered the country through Calcutta airport without going through the immigration and customs checks, posing a threat to the countrys security.
    
	The passengers, who had taken Air Indias Yangon-Calcutta flight last Friday, were not at fault, though  the airlines bus had mistakenly dropped them at the domestic terminal.
    
	This is a rare incident and the airline is to be blamed, said a senior airport official. The immigration department has sought an explanation from Air India, which has ordered an inquiry and showcaused the bus driver.
    
	Once the inquiry is over, we will take action against those responsible for the lapse, said an Air India spokesperson.
    
	Banwari Jalan, a resident of Salt Lake, and Khin Win Ye and Yin Yin Sani, two women from Myanmar, arrived at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on IC 728. The flight landed at 7.20pm and stopped in bay No. 41.
    
	According to the rule, all the passengers were to be ferried in buses to the international terminal, where they would have to clear the immigration and customs checks before dispersing.
    
	But the bus in which the trio and around 30 others had boarded was taken to the domestic terminal. The driver soon realised his mistake, but the three got off before he could start for the other terminal.
    
	The bus had stopped for a few minutes in front of the domestic terminal when the three got down, said an immigration official.
    
	Jalan, who had gone to Yangon on January 14, was carrying only a handbag. So was one of the two Myanmarese women. Jalan walked out of the domestic terminal, while the other two took Air Indias evening flight to Delhi, the official said.
    
	Khin Win Ye and Yin Yin Sani were in a hurry to catch the Delhi flight. They knew the registered luggage would be automatically checked in at the domestic terminal, as they were travelling by the same airline, he added.
    
	I was called back to the airport from home around 10pm to complete the formalities, Jalan said. The two women were flown back to Calcutta on an Air India flight on Saturday morning for the formalities and then sent to Delhi again.
    
	The lapse was a major security breach. It also led to the harassment of the passengers, said a senior airport official. A terrorist or a smuggler could have sneaked in, taking advantage of the situation.
    
	Immigration officials said the airline had submitted a list of 131 passengers. But during the clearance, we found only 128 passengers. The airline initially denied any passenger was missing, but later admitted its mistake, said an official.

	A strip of land along the Presidency correctional home boundary wall is being developed to boost security on the premises. An auditorium is also set to come up in the jail.        
	The land, about 20 feet wide and half a kilometre long, lies between the boundary wall and Belvedere Road. It is occupied by bushes, trees and two Calcutta Municipal Corporation garbage vats near a watchtower in the jail compound.        
	Guards have complained that the stench from the vats makes it difficult for them to keep vigil on the watchtower.         
	A knee-high wall has been erected to segregate the land, where the staff quarters of the jail once stood, from the road.        
	We plan to build a garden and a patrol road on the land, which belongs to us, said inspector general (correctional services) B.D. Sharma.        
	The government is looking for a private partner to execute the project.        
	The watchtower is vital and must be manned round-the-clock. If the personnel posted there cannot perform their duties properly, the security of the correctional home will be compromised. So I have requested Firhad Hakim, the chairman of borough IX, to remove the vats and he has agreed, added Sharma.        
	Hakim said the vats would be shifted after consultation with the local councillor (ward 74). We will take the final decision after a joint inspection with the jail authorities.        
	The auditorium will cost about Rs 5 lakh and will seat 500 people, according to Sharma.        
	It will be designed in such a way that inmates can stage any type of cultural programme. Such events increase the mental strength of the inmates and help them to overcome their sense of isolation from the society, said the inspector-general.

          RITH BASU                                    
	Susmita Goswami, who travelled the globe as a child but could not find her way home to Santiniketan from Calcutta due to schizophrenia, was reunited with her family on Thursday.         
	The woman in her late-30s had loitered off a relatives house in Kalyani during a power cut on June 4 evening. NGO Iswar Sankalpa rescued her from Jadavpur 8B bus stand on July 7. A wound on her left foot was infested with maggots and she could not speak coherently.        
	We took her to a nursing home but were refused treatment. She was later admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, said Sarbani Das Roy, the NGO secretary.        
	Susmitas 72-year-old father Pradip Kumar Roychowdhury had meanwhile lodged a missing diary with Kalyani police station after searching for her in several places, including hospitals and morgues.        
	After treatment and counselling at psychiatric clinic Antara, Susmita was able to say that her home was near Lal Pahari lodge in Santiniketan.        
	With this information and Susmitas pictures, we emailed Shirajul Islam, a philosophy professor in the area. He knew Susmitas father and contacted him, said Das Roy.         
	On Thursday, Roychowdhury picked her up from the NGOs office. He said: Susmita was a good student. She also used to write ghazals. She was forced by her in-laws to give up studies in 1990, while she was in the final year of mathematics honours. She started showing symptoms of schizophrenia in 1998 after her marriage failed.        
	Roychowdhury, a civil engineer and architect, worked in the US, the UK, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Like her brother and sister, Susmita studied abroad before taking admission in the mathematics course at Kalyani University.        
	The family is now struggling to make ends meet with Susmitas mother Nilima, 66, suffering from kidney ailment. I earned Rs 2.5 lakh a month once but I am broke now after spending everything on my children. Today I have to work for a local promoter for a monthly salary of Rs 1,800, said Roychowdhury.

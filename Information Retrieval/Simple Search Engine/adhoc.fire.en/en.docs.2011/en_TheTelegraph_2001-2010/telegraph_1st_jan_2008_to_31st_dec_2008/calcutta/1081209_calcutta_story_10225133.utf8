The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Howrah gets lady mayor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Howrah gets lady mayor

	Three women broke the glass ceiling of civic governance on Monday, being named for three top posts in the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) by the Left Front.         
	Mamta Jaiswal became the first woman mayor of Howrah, Kaberi Mitra the deputy mayor, and Swapna Bhattacharya the chairperson.         
	This is a historic moment. Twenty-one women candidates of the Left Front have been elected to the 50-member civic body this time. We think they will run the body efficiently and skilfully, said a senior district secretariat member.         
	Poor road conditions, frequent waterlogging, scarcity of drinking water, inefficient garbage disposal and mushrooming of illegal buildings are some of the problems plaguing the over 10 lakh residents of Calcuttas twin city.         
	Civic problems are localised in nature and require personal attention and care. With women in the top seats, I hope the HMC will be able to solve most of our problems, said a homemaker in Mandirtala.         
	Jaiswal, however, skirted questions on woman power in her team. We will try to live up to the expectations, she promised.

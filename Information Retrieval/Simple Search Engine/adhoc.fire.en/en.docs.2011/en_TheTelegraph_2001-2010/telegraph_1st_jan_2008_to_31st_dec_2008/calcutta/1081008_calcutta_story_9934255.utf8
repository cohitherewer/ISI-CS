                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hom is where the heart is
                            
	The Metro guide to understanding and enjoying Navami 2008 better...              
	What is Mahanavami?         
	The significant ritual on Mahanavami is hom (havan). It is said that the fire of the hom is the mouth of the god being worshipped, reaching Him or Her directly. It is mandatory to make the offering at the centre of the flames. Hom, or fire oblation, is one of the important rituals that makes Durga puja a Mahapuja.        
	So those who could not afford to perform hom on Saptami and Ashtami, do so on Navami. Keep bel leaves ready (a minimum of 28 to a maximum of 108 for the goddess, and eight each for the rest). The almanac allows you till 9.27am to finish the entire puja, including havan.              
	What if you are already exhausted by the Mahapuja?         
	Take the day off. Have a luchi alur dom breakfast and a mangsho bhaat community lunch and sleep in the afternoon. Thats taking the day off during Puja.        
	Crawl out of the woodwork late at night. Move north. When out, keep in mind restaurants, food courts and friends or relatives houses you can drop in at.              
	Todays Metro timings?        
	Trains will run between 2pm and 4am at 8 to 20 minutes interval.              
	What should you carry while pandal-hopping?        
	Do not carry bags or lunch boxes. But do carry water, potato crisps and cola, if you are out in a car. No matter how small your bling bag is, it should have just about enough room for antacid tablets and a pack of band-aids. Slip cotton swabs into your peep-toes. Carry a deo-spray.              
	What else should you carry while pandal-hopping?        
	Your own arm candy! This ones especially for those brought up on a generous dose of love-at-first-sight-in-the-time-of-Puja lore. Beware! It may be a real problem finding eye candy. Boys, particularly, are limited-edition during the pujas. So, do it yourself: carry your own arm candy!              
	Whats recommended for a late-night sip and bite?        
	Flurys on Park Street is open 24 hours.              
	What can you stay away from?        
	You may exempt yourself from watching neighbourhood kids performing Daakghar, Chandalika and Chitrangada. Leave Tagore alone this Puja. Leave Bhupen Hazarika and Bistirno dupare alone too.              
	What can you not stay away from?        
	Fun events being held by The Telegraph Hand in Hand in 105 apartment buildings.              
	Fashion tip of the day?        
	Kurtas, Patiala salwars, sherwanis...

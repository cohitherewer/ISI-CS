The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Turtle meat sale defies ban
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Turtle meat sale defies ban
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          SOFT TARGET: Turtle meat on sale at Bansdroni bazaar. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Turtle meat is being sold across the city and its adjacent areas, in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The act bans slaughter, sale and consumption of the turtle, a protected species.        
	Forest department officials said there were reports of turtle meat being sold in Garia, Kidderpore, Kestopur, Lake Gardens and other places.         
	We conduct raids and arrest the sellers, said Atanu Raha, the state principal chief conservator of forests.        
	Metro came across a vendor selling soft-shelled turtles at Bansdroni bazaar. The price is Rs 160 a kg. He has been selling turtle meat for the past month and a half, said Bhaskar Thakur, a local resident.         
	The vendor, who refused to divulge his name, not only sells the meat but also slaughters the reptiles in the open. And he does brisk business, with only a handful of people opposing the law violation.        
	I know trading in turtle meat is illegal but its not often that we get to taste it, Garia resident Anirban Halder said after buying 2 kg of the meat.        
	Residents alleged that police had not taken any action against the vendor despite repeated complaints. The vendor, too, said: Policer saathe amaar setting achhey ( I have a deal with the police).        
	The police, however, denied the charge. No one has complained against him, said A.C. Sirkar, the officer-in-charge of Jadavpur police station.        
	The residents said even the forest department is reluctant to register a complaint. When I dialled the departments hotline number, the official who answered the call was more interested in taking down my details, said Sudipto Roy, a Tollygunge resident.        
	There must have been a communication gap. I will inquire into the matter, said Raha.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A youth was arrested on Thursday on charges of selling spiked coconut water to a truck driver and trying to rob him.        
	Asraf Ali Molla, of Budge Budge, sold a green coconut (daab)to Imran Khan, 25, who was waiting with his vehicle on Transport Depot Road, in Taratala, around 10.30am. A driver saw Khan slump after drinking the water in the coconut and raised an alarm. Residents caught Molla and handed him over to police.        
	After Khan lost consciousness, Molla allegedly stole his leather bag containing Rs 50 and cellphone. The coconuts Molla was carrying have been sent for a forensic test, said a police officer.        
	In June, he had sold spiked coconuts to people at the Santoshpur railway crossing. We want to find out if an organised racket is at work, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.

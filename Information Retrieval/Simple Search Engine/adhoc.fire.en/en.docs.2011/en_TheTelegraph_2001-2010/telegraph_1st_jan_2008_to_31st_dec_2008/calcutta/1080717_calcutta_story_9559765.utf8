                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mayor grilled on upgrade
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya spoke in detail on undergoing development work  from drainage revamp to hawker rehabilitation  to explain how the civic body was working to improve the quality of life in Calcutta.        
	But the listeners members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)  did not seem to be fully convinced by the promises the mayor rolled out.        
	As soon as his presentation was over, questions and suggestions flew thick and fast.         
	Will in-depth planning precede work on these projects? A lot of the development work seems haphazard and lack in coordination between the executing agencies, said an executive from Webel Mediatronics while kicking off the interactive session.        
	Of course, there is planning. Every detail is looked into, said the mayor, forcing a smile. Is there something like Vision 2050? pat came the next question, which hinted at the absence of a long-term approach to civic planning.         
	Taking a cue from economist John Maynard Keyness immortal line  In the long run were all dead  the mayor talked about a plan thats not far away.        
	There is a Vision 2025 A plan to make Calcutta a much better city by then, the mayor said amidst a round of applause from the audience.        
	With the promise of a better future, some possible probing questions, including a few on roads and waterlogging, did not feature in the Q amp;A session. But the suggestion to make civic employees more people-friendly was enough to put the mayor on the backfoot.        
	Then, the CII members rolled out their wishlist for a more picturesque Calcutta after Bhattacharyya briefed them about the CMCs plans to beautify 500 parks. A CII member reminded him that electricity, cable TV and telephone wires should not hang from lamp posts.        
	They are in front of my house and probably in front of your house too, Mr Mayor, said the elderly man. The mayor admitted that the dangling wires were an eyesore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer cuts survive
                                                                                                               Killer cuts survive
          A STAFF REPORTER                 
	In September 2007, members of the Bengal Bus Syndicate  one of the prominent lobbies of bus operators  had met the transport authorities, pressing for, among other things, a change in the commission system of payment for bus drivers and conductors.         
	Six months on, the government is yet to decide on an alternative to the system that prompts drivers to press the accelerator in a desperate rush to pick up extra passengers.        
	You cant expect to change a system overnight. There have been demands for abolishing the system but there is no point in rushing. We are studying models of other states and the flip sides of these models. We want to do our homework before inviting bus operators to the talks table, said Ranjit Maity, the special secretary to the transport department.        
	For every trip, insiders say, the commission varies between 11-12 per cent of the total sales proceeds of the day for drivers, 5-6 per cent for conductors and 1-2 per cent for helpers.        
	Since its the driver who bags the biggest share of the commissions, he is always in a tearing hurry to be back to get his turn for yet another trip.         
	This is the logic forwarded by most unions. But the drivers know that if they speed or violate a traffic rule, the owner is made to pay. Also if you drive fast, how do you collect more passengers? The problem is with a lack of coordination among the Regional Transport Authority, which issues permits. So, you have more buses vying for space on the same route, says Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate.        
	Police are not convinced. They, too, want the commission system abolished. We have sent our proposal to the traffic department. It is for the state government to take a call, said a senior officer of the city traffic police.

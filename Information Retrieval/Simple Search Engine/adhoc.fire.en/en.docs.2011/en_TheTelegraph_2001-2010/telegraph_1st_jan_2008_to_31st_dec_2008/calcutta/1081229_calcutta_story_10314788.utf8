                Ornaments worth Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 7,000 in cash were stolen from a jewellery shop on Roy Bahadur Road in Behala on Saturday night. The theft was detected around 9.45am on Sunday, when a friend of Nikunja Bihari Karmakar, the owner, tried to open the shop and found the locks malfunctioning. Police said the thieves first tried to damage the lock by pouring acid on it and later cut the shutter. It seems the thieves knew their way inside the shop. The silver items were not touched, said an officer.

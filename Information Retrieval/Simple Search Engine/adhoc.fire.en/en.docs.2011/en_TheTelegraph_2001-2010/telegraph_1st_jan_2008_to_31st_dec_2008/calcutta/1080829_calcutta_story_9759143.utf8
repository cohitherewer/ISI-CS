The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Torture cell for strays
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Torture cell for strays
          RITH BASU                                            
	Man has turned against his proverbial best friend with barbaric ferocity in a pocket of south Calcutta where residents of a slum are hunting down stray dogs with a vengeance.        
	At least 15 strays roaming the lanes of Ramesh Mitra Road, in Bhowanipore, have been tormented and tortured ever since one of them sank its teeth into some residents a month ago.        
	Tethered to a garbage vat with a rope tied around its hind leg, one of the assaulted dogs lay whimpering last Saturday until someone took pity and called in volunteers from the animal shelter Ashari.         
	The critically injured dog, said to be three-four years old, died early on Monday.        
	The dogs jaw was partially paralysed. It was evident that the animal had been mercilessly beaten. It was running a temperature, which is what happens when an animal is in trauma. We did our best but could not save it, said Shankar Kar of the Dhapa dog pound, where Ashari had sent the stray.        
	Contrary to what the perpetrators of the crime alleged, the dog had no symptoms of rabies.        
	The Banerjees of Ramesh Mitra Road witness the torture of strays every other day. The dogs are beaten up mostly when there is a power cut in the area. A dog is caught and dragged to the vat, and the assault continues till the animal stops moving, Arunima Banerjee told Metro, wincing at the thought.        
	We call Bhowanipore police station to report these incidents, but no action is taken, she added.        
	Debasis Chakrabarti, the managing trustee of People for Animals, said the police should have booked the culprits under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act that has been incorporated into the Calcutta Police Act (see box).         
	The deputy commissioner of police (south), Rajesh Subarna, said appropriate action would be taken if a written complaint was filed. I request residents to file a written complaint. We will take lawful action.        
	A mechanic in one of the automobile repair shops dotting the locality said dying strays were being regularly dumped in the garbage vat. When we open our garage in the morning, we find dogs in the vat or lying near it. But we have never seen the people responsible for it, said Arpan Das of Mondal Motors.         
	Kalipada Rang, a slum dweller, claimed he didnt know any neighbour who had tortured a stray. But we have seen some injured dogs in the area since one of them bit some people a month ago.

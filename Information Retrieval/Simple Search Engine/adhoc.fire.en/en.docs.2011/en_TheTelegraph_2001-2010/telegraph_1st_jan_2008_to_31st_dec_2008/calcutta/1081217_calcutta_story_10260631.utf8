                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Letters
           Graffiti growl: A wall defaced in the run-up to elections in the city. A Telegraph picture                             
	The death of 26-year-old Supratim Das under the wheels of a goods carrier (Life lost in lorry lane, Oct. 16) is a grim reminder of civic rights being blatantly robbed by goons in connivance with political leaders and the government machinery.           
	During the Left Fronts 31-year rule, civic rights have been brutally curbed, rendering them almost non-existent today.           
	City roads have been leased out by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to hawkers who owe allegiance to the ruling party. Potholed roads, now reduced to lanes, can hardly accommodate pedestrians, leading to fatal accidents.           
	Illegal parking on roads is not a new phenomenon. Numerous illegal parking lots are run by CPM cadres. The illegal parking of over 250 lorries on Transport Depot Road is not unknown either to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty or the Lalbazar police headquarters.           
	Supratim Das is a victim of the callousness of the transport department and the civic authorities. Mere compensation or nabbing the killer vehicle will not put a stop to such tragedies.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,
  Burdwan                       
	Apropos the report Walls get shield from poll graffiti, Oct. 23, it is heartening to learn that the Election Commission (EC) has banned poll graffiti on private and government property. Though the 1976 act banning defacement had been imposed during the last state elections, only a few walls have been cleaned in the past several years.             
	Political parties came out strongly against the graffiti ban, but surprisingly none of the leaders uttered a single word about their responsibility of removing the poll writings after elections.           
	We are waiting to see how the EC keeps vigil to implement the ban. Only harsh punishment, irrespective of political affiliation, can stop the nuisance.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	Apropos the report 30 months to makeover, Oct. 29, I have the following suggestions. The airport should have an official website with details on departures and arrivals of flights and contact information on carriers. There should be a Metro/train station in the terminal building itself, offering 24x7 connectivity with Howrah and Sealdah stations.             
	 Shubhojit, 
  San Diego, US                               
	Apropos the report Patchwork and promise washed away by rain, Oct. 31, the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass is a vital road connecting south Calcutta with the airport. Even though the civic authorities repaired the potholed road before the pujas, they failed to provide an adequate bitumen layer. As a result, just two days of rains before Diwali washed away the top layer, causing huge craters, potholes and an uneven surface. Vehicles plying on this road face hazards routinely.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park             
	It is really surprising that the Bengal Engineering and Science             
	University (Besu) is demanding more land to expand its campus (Besu wants width, Centre gives height, Oct. 29). The university has said the lack of land is thwarting its upgrade plans. I have lived in Shibpur for many years and used to go for my morning walk to the Besu campus. I question whether the Besu authorities are doing justice to the land already in their possession. Besu (then BE College) was established in 1856, when there was hardly any human habitation in the area.           
	After Independence, and especially after the commissioning of Vidyasagar Setu, the area underwent a vertical growth. It is now quite unthinkable to acquire land there.           
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar             
	Apropos the report Stranded? Hail a convoy, Oct. 28, the kind act of the governor, who offered a lift to an elderly man and his daughter to the airport to help them catch their flight, should be an eye-opener for our ministers and bureaucrats, who only inconvenience Calcuttans with their cars flashing red lights and convoys that follow no traffic rules.             
	A.S.Mehta,
  New Alipore           
	It was wonderful to learn that the governor helped two residents reach the airport on time by offering them a lift in his convoy. A few years ago, he had called a rickshaw-puller to Raj Bhavan, who was slapped by a police officer for flouting a traffic rule in front the governor. However, Gandhis image suffered when his much-talked-about endeavours to settle the Singur imbroglio ended in a fiasco and such noble gestures seem intended to revive his dented image.           
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	Apropos the report Civic service centre for each borough, Oct. 31, it is good news for residents that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is going to introduce 13 service centres in its 15 boroughs.             
	It is heartening to know that Calcuttans dont have to go all the way to the CMC headquarters to pay bills and can pay them at service outlets located in their area. It will be a boon for everybody, especially women and the aged.

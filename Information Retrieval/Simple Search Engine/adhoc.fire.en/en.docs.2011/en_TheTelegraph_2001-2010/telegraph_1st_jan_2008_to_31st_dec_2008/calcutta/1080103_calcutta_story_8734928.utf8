                                                                                                            Trio held before robbery 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three suspected robbers were detained outside Hindu Burial Ground in Karaya by local residents on Tuesday night. Two revolvers were found on them.         
	Police said the trio  Maqbur, Ibrahim and Mubarak  had assembled with the intention of committing a robbery.         
	The trio live in Avinash Chowdhury Lane in Topsia and are wanted in snatching and extortion cases, said the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Jawed Shamim.        
	We became suspicious after we saw the youths loitering around in front of the burial ground, said Jalan Sheikh, a local resident. We asked them why they were in the area. They replied that they were looking for a house, but the address they provided does not exist. The residents detained the three and alerted the police.        
	The three were trying to identify a house to attempt a robbery, according to an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad. The trio wanted to take advantage of the festive mood on New Years Day. They knew most of the people were out celebrating.        
	The officer added: We are yet to find out how they collected the firearms.

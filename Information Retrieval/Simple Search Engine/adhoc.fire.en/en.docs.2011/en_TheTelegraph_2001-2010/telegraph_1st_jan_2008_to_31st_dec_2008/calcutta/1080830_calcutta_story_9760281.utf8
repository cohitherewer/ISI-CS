The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trap tag on eatery
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trap tag on eatery
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The fire department is building a case against the Haldirams outlet at Exide crossing after its owners arrest for allegedly disregarding basic safety norms, leading to a second blaze in a year.        
	Mahesh Agarwal was arrested late on Thursday, based on an FIR filed at Shakespeare Sarani police station after the second-floor storeroom went up in flames in the morning. The restaurant on the ground floor of the building was packed to capacity when the fire started.         
	Although there was no loss of life or injury, officials said a disaster was waiting to happen.        
	I was shocked when officials informed me about the state of the Haldirams building. I have been told it was full of LPG cylinders and flammable items like ghee. But it does not have adequate fire-fighting arrangements. We are going to pursue the case, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said.        
	When Metro visited the shut outlet on Friday, there was little to suggest that fire-fighting arrangements had improved since one of the generators there caught fire in 2007.        
	The building is a potential fire trap with large rooms but narrow stairs and corridors. More than 80 per cent of the available space is used for cooking and storage. Gas ovens burn on all three floors, including a section of the restaurant.         
	The 150-seater restaurant opens around 7 in the morning and does not close before 10pm. The ovens are kept on round-the-clock to cater to the 5,000-odd customers who walk in for a bite every day, said an employee of the outlet.         
	Fire-fighters found only one water hydrant and a few extinguishers while entering the building on Thursday to douse the flames. The narrow corridors and stairs were crammed with tins of ghee and other ingredients, making it difficult for them to reach the storeroom on the second floor.        
	The wiring is in need of overhaul. Loose wires hang from broken switchboards at many places. The building also does not have an emergency water reservoir.        
	In 2005, the fire services department had shut down the establishment for more than a month after finding it unsafe.        
	Ideally, there should be a gas bank for a cluster of hotels in a particular area. How many filled cylinders are coming in and empty ones are being taken out needs to be monitored regularly. In any case, an entire building cannot be turned into a kitchen. Cooking must be restricted to a part of the building, Chatterjee said.         
	Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director-general of fire services, said inflammable materials stored carelessly were responsible for Thursdays fire spreading quickly.

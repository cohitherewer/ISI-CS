The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Licence relief for fast food outlets 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Licence relief for fast food outlets 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fast food and confectionery outlets that do not cook on the premises will not have to produce a fire-clearance certificate while applying for a trade licence.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) announced a change in its licence policy after realising that the earlier one, which had made submission of a fire-clearance certificate mandatory for getting a trace licence, was affecting revenue earning.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay issued a circular on Thursday notifying the change in the policy.        
	The circular  which will benefit around three lakh traders in the city  states that fast food and confectionery outlets, where cooking is not done, can apply for a trade licence without producing a certificate from the fire services department.        
	We are reviewing the licence policy. If necessary, similar relaxations will be extended to some other trades in phases, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	The 100-hour fire at the Nandaram market in January prompted the civic authorities to make it mandatory for traders to submit the fire-clearance certificate while applying for a trade licence.        
	After the blaze, the civic body was accused of granting trade licences to buildings that did not have any fire-safety measures.        
	Civic sources said that of the five lakh-odd traders in the city, around four lakh did not turn up for the renewal of the trade licence following the introduction of the fire-safety clause in the licence policy.        
	The CMC used to earn Rs 30 crore a year as trade licence fees. This year the collection may go down to Rs 14 crore, said an official.        
	Trade bodies have been pleading with the civic authorities to review the blanket fire-safety clause which they claim is not rooted to reality.        
	Such measures do not serve their propose. It requires an investment of over Rs 10 lakh to implement the measures prescribed by the fire services department. Can the owner of a small fast food outlet, whose annual turnover is less than Rs 3 lakh, shell out the sum? asked Taraknath Trivedi, of the Federation of Traders Organisation.

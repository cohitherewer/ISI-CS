The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Idol stolen from Jain temple
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Idol stolen from Jain temple

	An idol of Lord Parsavanath, made of precious metals, has gone missing from Shree Digambar Jain Parsavanath Mandir in Alipore.         
	Some devotees who visited the temple early on Wednesday to offer prayers noticed that the seven-inch idol was not where it had been for the last 35 years.        
	When I could not find the idol I alerted other members of the community, who rushed to the temple with police, said 70-year-old Shantilal Jain, one of the devotees.         
	A complaint was lodged with us. We have questioned the caretaker of the temple, said an officer of Alipore police station.         
	There are 25 Jain temples in the city. More than 300 community members visit the 9 Alipore Park Place temple daily, most of them in the morning.         
	Some regular visitors feel there is more to the theft than meets the eye. The thief or thieves did not touch other valuables like silver utensils used to offer puja. They could have fetched them more money than the idol, said Mahendra Jain, a member of the temple committee.        
	There is pressure on the committee to shift the 75-year-old temple so that promoters could develop the plot, said a regular visitor.        
	This is a valuable piece of real estate and a lot of people are eyeing it. We have a hunch that one of them might be behind the disappearance of the idol, added Jain.

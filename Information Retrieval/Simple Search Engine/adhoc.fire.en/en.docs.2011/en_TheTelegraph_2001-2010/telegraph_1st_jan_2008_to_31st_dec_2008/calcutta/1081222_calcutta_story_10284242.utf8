The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Museum siphoned off upkeep funds: sleuths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Museum siphoned off upkeep funds: sleuths
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	The CBI will send a report to the Union culture ministry highlighting how some officials of Indian Museum have siphoned off funds and amassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income.        
	Sleuths claimed to have unearthed details of malpractice while investigating utilisation of the Rs 40 lakh that the Centre had allocated for the renovation of the 195-year-old institution. A source said four to six employees were involved in the misappropriation of the funds.        
	We have interrogated some officials from whom several incriminating documents have been seized. Their bank accounts revealed that they have amassed wealth in excess of their known sources of income, said an officer of the CBIs anti-corruption wing.        
	This is just the tip of the iceberg. While investigating the utilisation of Rs 40 lakh, we have learnt that a huge amount of government money had been siphoned off over the past few years, he added.        
	The CBI had recently lodged two cases against some museum officials. On Friday night, sleuths conducted raids at 17 places, including the houses of some officials and a few firms that had bagged contract for the renovation work. Most of the firms exist on paper.        
	The probe revealed that the authorities had produced fake bills for the construction of a gallery. They had shown expenditure for building a gallery that is yet to come up. We suspect that a section of officials, in collusion with some firms, had siphoned off the money, the official pointed out.        
	The probe also revealed that the authorities had pilfered funds in the name of buying security gadgets and upgrading a library.        
	Several employees had made money by producing fake bills. Its strange that no senior official objected to this, the sleuth said.        
	The investigating agency learnt that the authorities had bought 25 computers in the past two years without floating any tender and the payment was made in dollars.        
	The computers were bought from a private company in India. Some employees manipulated the bills and showed payment in dollar. The money was deposited in their bank accounts, another CBI official said.

                                                                                                               Cough Calcutta: foul fumes maim amp; claim
                            
	Vehicular pollution is to blame for most health problems that plague the Calcuttan. The authorities have done nothing to tackle the crisis. Metro charges the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government with culpable homicide (sometimes amounting to murder)...        
	EYES        
	What: Exhaust fumes and suspended particulate matter (SPM) cause eyes to sting and burn, go watery or dry and damage vision. The cornea and conjunctiva are the most vulnerable parts of the eye. Constant exposure to exhaust fumes can lead to chronic and allergic conjunctivitis, premature dry eyes and even blindness, said ophthalmologist Abhijit Sen.        
	Dry eyes in adults is commonly blamed on the computer screen, but exhaust fume affecting the secretion of tear glands is the prime culprit.        
	Safety measure: Wash eyes with clean water (drinking water if possible) after exposure to vehicular pollution. Wear sunglasses. Use artificial teardrops for dry eyes.        
	NOSE amp; THROAT        
	What: Constant exposure to smoke and dust pollution causes chronic throat and nasal allergies. Chronic allergies can cause severe infections in throat and nose, and even loss of voice, warned Arunabha Sengupta, an ENT surgeon at SSKM Hospital.        
	Pharyngitis, laryngitis and tonsillitis ail the throat. Rhinitis, sinusitis and nasal polyp are nasal infections.        
	Safety measure: Wearing a mask provides some protection. Gurgle with lukewarm water every morning.        
	LUNGS        
	What: Chronic irritation and inflammation of the airways are caused by sustained exposure to pollution. Over the years this may cause bronchial narrowing leading to chronic cough, infections and eventual shortness of breath, said pulmonologist Ashok Sengupta.        
	Safety measure: Wearing a mask and undergoing periodic health check-ups can help in the city of cough.        
	CANCER        
	What: The steady rise in cases of cancer of lung and throat over the past five years is linked to the rising air pollution count.        
	Carbon monoxide and toxic hydrocarbon are the main factors causing lung and throat cancers, said oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay.         
	Constant inhalation of toxic gases causes changes in the inner linings of throat and lung which in turn lead to malignancy, explained.        
	Safety measure: Shift to a city where the government values human health and life.                    SANJAY MANDAL (WHO DO YOU BLAME FOR THE AIR POLLUTION IN TOWN?

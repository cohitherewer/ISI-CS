                      Hi-tech imaging                    Five years ago, when Centro de la Imagen proposed to organise a retrospective of the vast body of Mexican photographer Pedro Meyers works, Meyer himself responded by undertaking a project in which all his photographic work, made throughout five decades, would be online and was to be exhibited using electronic media. Thus was born the idea for Heresies, a retrospective of Pedro Meyer. More than 300,000 images, both analog and digital, and nearly 2,500 documents on Meyers professional career were uploaded and cross-referenced in 20 different themes so researchers and photographers could use them to curate and produce digital galleries. These curatorships later became the basis for the selection of images made available to the 60 participating museums worldwide that are simultaneously exhibiting the ongoing photography show. Heresies challenges the limits of current exhibition trends by mixing large format prints with new technological elements like digital galleries that integrate audio, text and images; the use of iPhones and iPods for downloading videos and audio, and the interaction among participating museums, as well as between a museum and its visitors. Finally, the usage of Meyers database will prompt further discussion and a deep reflection about the use of technology and to analyse photography from the perspective of its constant technological development and social impact. Hosted in the city by Tasveer and The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.

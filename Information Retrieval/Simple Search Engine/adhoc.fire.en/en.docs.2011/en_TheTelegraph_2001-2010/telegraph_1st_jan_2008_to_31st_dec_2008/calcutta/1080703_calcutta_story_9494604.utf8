The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Part-time jobs are campus choice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Part-time jobs are campus choice

	 Rohit Dasgupta, in his final year of graduation in comparative literature at Jadavpur University, works part-time for more than 25 hours a week. He does not see his responsibilities at work as a distraction from studies, but as an opportunity to gain an edge over others.        
	 Pujarini Sen was in school when she took up her first part-time job. Work keeps the second-year English honours student busy after classes at Jadavpur University.         
	Offering tuition for pocket money is pass; college students now want to develop skills and try out careers as they work for extra cash.        
	Part-time jobs at media houses, NGOs and advertising agencies have emerged as the most popular options among youngsters.         
	Very few of my classmates are offering tuition. It is more important to do something that we can mention in our resums, says Pujarini.        
	She, like many other students of her age, started working by taking up short-term assignments for the British Council Library, overseeing exhibitions for the Seagull Foundation for the Arts and working for event management companies.        
	More pocket money was the primary motivation, but it isnt so any longer.         
	I like to keep myself busy. I thought if I have to earn money, I might as well do something more meaningful, says Pujarini, who wants to work for NGOs.        
	Rohit, who is interning with an NGO, is using the part-time jobs to zero in on a career. He worked for a media house earlier. It is primarily experience that he is looking for. The Rs 3,500 he earns is a bonus.        
	The importance attached to extra-curricular activities and work experience by universities abroad has prompted many students to opt for part-time jobs.        
	When I graduate from college, there are going to be 50 other people with the same degree and same marks. I want something to make me stand out. Work experience will do me good when I apply to foreign universities, says Rohit.        
	Some of the students working part-time are taking a year off from studies.        
	Most of the students who apply to us for internship look for jobs where they have to put in a certain number of hours every week. Gap year students looking for jobs are comparatively few, said Bishan Samaddar, the project manager of Choice. The organisation aims to provide young people the opportunity to explore careers in the non-corporate sector.

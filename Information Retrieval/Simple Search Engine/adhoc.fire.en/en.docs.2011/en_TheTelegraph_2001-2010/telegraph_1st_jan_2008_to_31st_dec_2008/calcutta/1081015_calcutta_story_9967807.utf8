          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 35-year-old trader allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint in Topsia on Sunday evening was released on Monday night.        
	In his complaint, Atique Ahmed told police that he was held hostage by four youths in a Rajarhat house.        
	The kidnappers took Rs 56,000 that Ahmed was carrying. On Monday night, they put him in a Maruti van and drove to EM Bypass. They pushed out the trader near Science City, said an officer of Topsia police station.         
	Ahmed, who lives in Entally and owns a plastic godown in Tiljala, said he was on his way to meet a client on Sunday evening when two youths  one of them carrying a revolver  dragged him into a red Maruti van near the route No. 24 bus stand. He spent the night in the Rajarhat house without food.        
	On Monday afternoon, the youths allegedly asked him to pay a ransom of Rs 1 lakh. Ahmed requested them to release him as he could not pay them.        
	After an hour of argument the abductors pushed Ahmed into a Maruti van, drove to Science City and dumped him.         
	Our officers spotted Ahmed loitering in the dark. After he narrated the entire incident, they brought him to the police station. A kidnapping case was registered on the basis of his complaint, said the officer.        
	The investigators suspect that the abduction was the fallout of a business rivalry.        
	We are questioning Ahmed to ascertain the motive behind his abduction. He could not identify the youths who had held him hostage, said another officer.

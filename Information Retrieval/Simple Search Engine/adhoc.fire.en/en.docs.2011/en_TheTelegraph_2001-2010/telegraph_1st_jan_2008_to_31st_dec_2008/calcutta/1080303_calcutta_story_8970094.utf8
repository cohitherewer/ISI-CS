The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Revamp starts in a month
                                                                                                               Revamp starts in a month
  - Kumartuli makeover takes off years behind schedule          SHALMOLI KUNDU                          Artisans busy preparing Saraswati idols in the narrow lanes of Kumartuli. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Work on the revamp of the idol-making hub in Kumartuli is set to start in a month, eight years after the plan was mooted.        
	Idol-makers will shift in April and construction will start in June, said Barun Kumar Ray, the secretary of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the nodal agency of the project.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had first talked about upgrading Kumartuli  calling it his dream project  at a rally in the artisans hub in 2000.        
	The artisans will be temporarily relocated in a public health engineering department godown in Bagbazar, a km from Kumartuli. The department has voluntarily agreed to let the godown be used for relocation, said an official.        
	CMDA had to scrap the original makeover plan following protests from the artisans and has drawn up a new one. The previous plan had called for relocation of all the artisans simultaneously, which would have hampered their business.        
	We were not satisfied with the plan and had requested the authorities to make a few changes. The revised plan has accommodated our needs and we have accepted it, said Mintu Pal, the joint secretary of the Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity (an idol-makers union).        
	The Rs 30-crore makeover will now be executed in three phases.        
	The revamped Kumartuli, on 3.72 acres, will have four-storeyed residential buildings with single bedroom flats for 525 families, shops, a health centre with ambulance facilities, a community hall, a museum and a 100-bed dormitory.        
	There will also be cafeterias and parking facilities in the north Calcutta pocket, access to which will be eased with widening of roads.        
	Being developed under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission, half the project cost will be borne by the Centre. The state will chip in with 30 per cent of the cost and the rest will shared by the beneficiaries.

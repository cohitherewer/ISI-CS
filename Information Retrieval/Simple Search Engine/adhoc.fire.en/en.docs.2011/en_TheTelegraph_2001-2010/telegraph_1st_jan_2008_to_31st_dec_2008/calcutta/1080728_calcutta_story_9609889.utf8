          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A lorry ran over and killed 14-year-old Raqibul Islam before ramming into a tea stall and injuring a woman in Barasat on Sunday afternoon.        
	In the tea stall, a bamboo pole broke through the windshield and injured driver Sumanta Sen in the chest. Sen has been arrested.        
	Police said Raqibul and brother Tarikul were riding a bicycle when the mishap occurred. The duo, to avoid a pothole, came in the way of the lorry. Sen was trying to avert another crater and moved towards the duo, knocking them down. Raqibul was crushed under the rear wheels, said an officer.        
	Sen tried to flee and rammed into the tea stall.

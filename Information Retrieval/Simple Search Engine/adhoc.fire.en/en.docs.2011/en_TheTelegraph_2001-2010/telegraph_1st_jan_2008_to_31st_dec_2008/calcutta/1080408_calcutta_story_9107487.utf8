The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film school talks flop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Film school talks flop
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Talks to break the deadlock at SRFTI failed on Monday, and the film school will remain shut. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The weeklong deadlock over labour trouble at Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute could not be broken on Monday, despite talks.        
	After a meeting with CPM parliamentarian Sujan Chakraborty, the institute authorities reiterated their stand to keep the campus shut until the new security agency is allowed in. Some students attended the meeting, too.         
	The problem hasnt been resolved and so we remain closed till the new security agency is allowed to work. If the new team is not allowed in, the Central Industrial Security Force has to take over. The students have also agreed to this decision, said institute chairman and film-maker Buddhadeb Dasgupta.        
	Work on the campus was stopped by the Citu-steered Contractor Employees Workers Union on April 3. It objected to the institute authorities decision to replace Star Security amp; Detective Agency with GD Security Company.         
	This is a small problem for SRFTI, which has been an institute of repute for over 12 years. I hope there will be a solution in the next few days. We need some more time. The teachers, students and staff members want the new security agency to take over. The ministry of information and broadcasting will hold a meeting in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the matter, said Chakraborty.        
	The students, though hit hard by the campus crisis, have also demanded that the old security guards be ousted before classes resume.        
	We support the institutes decision to not reopen till the new agency joins work because the workers affiliated to Citu have been agitating over the past three months, disturbing peace, said ex-student Raka Dutta, who is working on the campus on documentaries.

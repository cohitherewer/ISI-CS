          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Eight students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), who had been remanded in jail custody for four days, were granted bail on Tuesday against two securities of Rs 750 each for each student.         
	The students were directed to keep off the university campus for three days and present themselves before the investigation officer of Shibpur police station whenever summoned.        
	A large number of Besu students owing allegiance to Independent Consolidation (IC) were present on the court premises on Tuesday. Supporters of CPI(ML) shouted slogans in support of the eight.         
	IC spokesperson Rajarshee Dutta blamed the Besu authorities for the situation spinning out of control. The university authorities are solely responsible for the present stalemate. They allowed police to harass students and are doing nothing to help them. The university administration has vitiated the atmosphere on campus.         
	The eight students were arrested from the campus on November 6. They have been booked under various IPC sections, including 147 (rioting), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 186, 353, 506, 323, 324, 325 and 341. Sections 333 and 353 are non-bailable.         
	The guardian of one of the eight, who did not want to be named, said: My son is shattered after spending four days in jail. I am taking him home. He alleged that neither the Besu authorities nor the police co-operated with the students.         
	Congress student wing Chhatra Parishad has recently formed a unit at Besu and reportedly decided to support IC against the CPM-backed SFI in the upcoming student union elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja blocks blood supply
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Puja blocks blood supply

	Four-year-old Tirtha Das, admitted to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children last Friday with a chronic liver infection, requires two units of A-positive blood. Father Joydeb, a worker from Hasnabad, goes from one blood bank to another on Monday but finds only one unit. Tirthas wait for the second unit of blood continues.        
	Blood banks across the city have almost dried up because fewer donation camps are being organised during the festive season.         
	According to doctors, the shortage could snowball into a crisis if blood donations dont resume. Demand is increasing with the spread of malignant malaria and dengue across the city.        
	We dont know of any blood donation camp being organised in the run-up to Puja and in its wake. B and O-positive blood are the only ones that are available, said A. K. Mondal, the director of the Central Blood Bank in Maniktala.         
	We are giving only one unit of blood against each request to ensure that we dont end up without any stock, he said.        
	Private blood banks are facing a shortage, too.         
	The Puja period was the most critical one. Supply has improved but we will give blood to only those who have donated to this bank and hold a card, said Kingshuk Mishra, the director of Varuka Blood Bank.         
	Varuka normally receives 800 to 1,000 units of blood from donation camps in a month. It expects to collect 600 units this month, provided camps are organised. Usually 16 to 20 camps are organised on an average every month but the number could be less than 10 this month, Mishra said.        
	The shortage is forcing postponement of surgeries. Two to three units of blood are required for major surgery. But patients relatives are unable to arrange for even one unit, said Gautam Mukhopadhyay, a city-based surgical oncologist.

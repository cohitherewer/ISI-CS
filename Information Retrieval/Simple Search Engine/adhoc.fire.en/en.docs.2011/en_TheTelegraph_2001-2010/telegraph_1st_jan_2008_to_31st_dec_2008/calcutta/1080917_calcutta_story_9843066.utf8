          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	More than 4,500 teachers and non-teaching employees of 60-odd Anglo-Indian schools in the city have been getting just half their pay for the past six months after the government stopped releasing their dearness allowance (DA).        
	On Tuesday, a delegation of the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools met school education minister Partha Dey and requested that their DA be released.        
	The institutions whose staff are facing this problem include St Xaviers, St Lawrence, the Loreto schools, the Don Bosco schools, Assembly of God Church, Calcutta Boys and Calcutta Girls.         
	We have no idea why our DA was stopped, said Richard Gomes, the general secretary of association.        
	Schools pay the basic salary, rent and medical allowance, while the government pays the DA, which is 79 per cent of the basic salary.         
	The minister said he would try to release the DA as early as possible. But sources in the school education department told Metro that the DA was stopped after some discrepancies were detected in the salary structure of teaching and non-teaching staff.         
	The government spends around Rs 35 crore every year on their DASince we are investigating the discrepancies, we have stopped releasing the funds, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hounded by hot metal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hounded by hot metal
										      ONTHESPOT - MOTI MARKET                                  (From top) Workers hammer iron beams at 98 Maniktala Main Road; scrap iron being burnt next to LPG cylinders; smoke billowing out of a factory unit. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                 
	Poisonous fumes and constant hammering on metal have made life difficult for the residents of Bhangamahalla in Maniktala, thanks to Moti Market. Better known as AK Steel, the 98 Maniktala Main Road address, spread over 40 bighas, houses 300 small units dealing in scrap iron and plastic products. Of these, 15 are smelters.        
	From dawn to dusk, trucks trundle in and out of the slushy narrow lanes crisscrossing the market. The units, lining both sides of the lanes, are stocked with broken iron sheets, pipes and beams. A few LPG cylinders, oxygen cylinders and cooking stoves are also dumped on piles of raw materials.         
	The residents of Bhangamahalla, where houses adjoining Moti Market are located, live in fear of severe health hazards. Scrap materials are burnt inside the factory, emitting a thick, black smoke. The smoke is so suffocating that I have developed breathing trouble and now I have to use an inhaler. We can never open the windows facing the factory, complained 60-year-old Biman Ghosh.         
	The smoke makes our eyes burn and water, said Nilima Ghosh, a 48-year-old homemaker. During winter, a yellow smog envelops the neighbourhood from just a few feet above the ground, complained another resident.         
	The units make a deafening racket  the noise of trucks unloading goods and the constant hammering of iron products. Often the sound is loud enough to wake us up in the middle of the night, added Nilima.         
	The residents have staged sit-ins in the past to protest the entry of trucks inside the factory, but the factory authorities deny all allegations.         
	All the units inside the factory have trade licences and clearance certificates from the Pollution Control Board (PCB). We dont allow any of the units to light a fire at any time of the day, claimed Kalachand Sengupta, the joint secretary of Moti Market Byabasayi Samity.         
	A peek inside Moti Market in the afternoon of September 4, however, proved Sengupta wrong.         
	Metro found black fumes billowing out of a unit, inside which workers were burning scrap iron. The narrow drains were clogged with effluents. Drain water spilling on to the main road during monsoon is yet another hazard for the local people.        
	The market authorities pass the buck to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).         
	Every year the 300 units pay around Rs 5 lakh as tax to the CMC but they dont provide us with any facility. The CMC sewer ends at the factorys entry point. The two drains inside the factory are not big enough to carry the entire factory water. As a result water spills on to the main road after a shower, said a Samity member.

	We received complaints against the factory for the first time in 1997. Another complaint was lodged in 2000. We had issued an order to shut down seven manufacturing units in Moti Market. It was decided that the councillor along with the local police station will ensure that the order is implemented. They are yet to get back to us, said Biswajeet Mukherjee, the chief law officer at PCB.

	The local police had visited the factory after I requested them and shut down the seven units mentioned by the PCB. The units were allowed to reopen after they promised to take necessary measures. But the situation was soon back to square one. No concrete steps have been taken to shut them permanently, said Rupa Bagchi, the councillor of ward 32, who has decided to put pressure on the factory units to check the pollution.         
	Since the units have requested us to link their drains with the main sewage line, we have decided to do so only if they install chimneys to let out the smoke. The chimneys should rise above the rooftops of all neighbouring houses. They will also have to restrict their hammering work to fixed hours. And they must ensure that the scrap from the market doesnt clog the main sewage line, added the CPM councillor.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The gynaecology department of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital was ransacked and a section of the staff was allegedly heckled by the relatives of a pregnant patient who died on Friday morning.
    
	The relatives alleged that Rina Kundu, 27, who was in the 34th week of pregnancy, died due to the negligence of the doctors.
    
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who visited the hospital in the evening, said: The hospital has been asked to submit a detailed report.
    
	Rina, whose husband Deepak is a trader in Agarpara, was admitted to the gynaecology ward early on Friday after she complained of uneasiness.
    
	In the morning, a hospital employee told me that my wife had given birth to a child. Half an hour later, he said the child was stillborn, said Deepak. I entered the ward after bribing a guard and found the delivery had not yet taken place. Rina was still on her bed.
    
	Around 9.30am, the hospital authorities told Deepak that his wife had died. I asked the doctors what led to the death, but there was no reply, Deepak said, accusing the authorities of neglect.
    
	A 200-strong crowd, comprising Deepaks relatives and neighbours, ransacked the gynaecology ward and allegedly manhandled some employees. A doctors car parked in the compound was damaged.
    
	The unrest continued for more than six hours, till a police team, led by deputy commissioner (north) P.K. Ghosh, brought the situation under control around 4pm.
    
	Officials said Rina was suffering from hypertension, respiratory distress and oedema, that could have led to the death. The exact cause will be known after a post-mortem, said principal Utpal Dutta.

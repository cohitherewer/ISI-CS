	KIIT, Bhubaneswar won the regional finals of the Tata Crucible Campus Quiz held at Taj Bengal on February 25.

A new round, Nano Words, was also introduced where the students were given a couple of words as clues to arrive at the final answer.         
	Sixteen teams including IIM, Calcutta, Calcutta Institute of Engineering and Management, NIMS, IIFT, Asutosh College, St Xaviers College, IEM and Praxes Business School were selected from the prelims, of which six made it to the final round.         
	Two teams from IIM, Calcutta made it to the finals through a wild card entry. They were joined by winners KIIT-Bhubaneswar, IISWBM, BIT Mesra, and yet another team from IIM, Calcutta. IISWBM emerged the runners up after a tie breaker with IIM.

	What rsquo;s on your mind this week  
	Drug dilemma  
	More and more teenagers are becoming prone to drug and alcohol abuse. This has prompted parents to press the panic button. The average age for experimenting with drugs is now hovering around 14 years. Many try out at an even earlier stage. So who is to be held responsible for this? Parents blame outside forces, overlooking their own indulgences. They hold lack of supervision in school, bad role models, films and drug peddlers on the loose, responsible. While these are definite contributors, parents should be held equally accountable.

	Gothic culture        
	Modern gothic is not only about body art and piercings. It is a philosophy first. Of course appearance is important and a Gothic musician is known by his/her black flowing robe and coloured nails onstage, but taste in music is a prime trait. Pioneered in the 70s by bands like British Bauhaus, with their intense, gloomy numbers, gothic rock was popularised by bands like Black Sabbath, and in the 90s, by bands like Dutch The Gathering. Modern gothic is a subculture based on horror, existentialism and nihilism. Modern gothic music, characterised by fuse orchestral background, extremely fast drumming and neo classical guitaring, has influences of the singing style of Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) and Freddy Mercury (Queen) and also of power metal. Gothic music has come a long way since. Stage antics and gaudy accessories are acceptable, as a gothic music groups performance combines music, emotion, entertainment and theatrics.

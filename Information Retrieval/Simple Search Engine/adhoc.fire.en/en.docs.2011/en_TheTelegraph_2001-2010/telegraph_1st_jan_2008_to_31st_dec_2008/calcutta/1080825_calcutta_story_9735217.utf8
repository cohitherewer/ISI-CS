                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Little soldiers of courage amp; conviction
  - Achievement shines through adversity in the first leg of The Telegraph School Awards          MALINI BANERJEE                          Masang Mandi at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence                                      
	Masang Mandi is from a village called Dheruapara near Kalna, Burdwan. His parents, both daily labourers, are illiterate. As is the rest of his village. Yet he managed a 72 per cent in Madhyamik, 71 per cent in Higher Secondary and 28th rank in the SC/ST quota of the Joint Entrance Examination. The village pooled money together for his admission to Jadavpur University.        
	Uma Bera is visually impaired. She lives in a hut in Deshkapasar, Belda, in Midnapore. Her father earns Rs 500 per month as a landless labourer. He often goes for days without work. Yet Uma scored 85 per cent in Madhyamik and dreams of continuing her education.        
	These are just two of the remarkable tales of courage and conviction emerging from the first leg of The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence, held on Saturday at Vidya Mandir. Masang won the Chittajit De Memorial Scholarship and Uma the Methodist School Dankuni Scholarship.        
	In its 12th edition, the final ceremony of the annual awards instituted by The Telegraph Education Foundation will be held at the Science City auditorium on August 30.        
	Among the awards announced on August 23 were the certificates of honour in the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage category. Several bravehearts were awarded, like the bright-eyed Monica Gupta, a Class XI student of Dreamland School, Matla, a polio survivor who limps from the station to school every day.        
	Or Aamir Chandna of Frank Anthony Public School who juggles studies with running a shop ever since his mother died. I always pray to god to not give so many difficulties to any child, he wrote in a letter to the Foundation.        
	Or Nazmeen Anwari of Our Lady School of the Missions School, Salt Lake, who secured 78 per cent in ISC despite a medical condition that caused her to be hospitalised and miss school frequently. Im very thankful to my school and the Foundation but I really dont want people to stress too much about this, said the cheerful girl who wants to be a journalist.

	There were other tales of triumph for schools. Certificates of merit and honour were awarded in 13 other categories -- Ambuja Realty Award for the Best Maintained School, The Patton Award for a School That Cares, TTEF Award for the Best Academic Performance by a School (ISC), TTEF Award for the Best Academic Performance by a School (WB), the GD Selarpuria Foundation Award for the Best Academic Performance by a School (CBSE), TTEF Award for Best Performance in Competitive Exams, TTEF Award for Academic Excellence by a Student, Anand Paul Memorial Award for Social Service, Best Sportsperson of the Year, The Shaw Education Foundation Award for the Best All-Round Student, The Abhirup Bhadra Memorial Thank You Baba Ma Award, The Shining Star Employee, and Award for the Best Extra Curricular Performance by a School.        
	It was a day full of heart-warming stories that talked about hope amidst heartbreak and courage under adversity. Like Poulomi Nandi of Bidhannagar Govt who won the Methodist School Dankuni Scholarship. Her mother earns a meagre living as a domestic help. But poverty will not stop Poulomi, who secured an 87 per cent in her Madhyamik exams, from reaching for the stars  she wants to study astrophysics.

  - City far from prepared for Mumbai-like situation        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	As TV channels beamed images of securitymen battling terrorists in Mumbai to every home, Calcuttans were prompted to ask whether their city could combat a similar strike.        
	Metro analyses the combat preparedness of three agencies  the police commando unit, the Special Action Force and the Special Task Force.                 
	Commandos         
	Manpower: Two hundred personnel, some trained at the headquarters of the National Security Guards. Set up in the late 90s, this was the first special wing of the city police.        
	Weaponry: Semi-automatic weapons, including AK series rifles, and carbines and 9mm pistols.        
	Objective: To be combat-ready within five minutes and counter any threat.        
	Daily role: Standing in makeshift bunkers and guarding vital installations and offices, especially foreign embassies and consulates.              
	Special Action Force        
	Manpower: Nearly 160 personnel were recruited in 2005 for this special wing.        
	Weaponry: AK-47, AK-56 and Insas rifles.        
	Objective: To combat terrorists and rescue hostages.        
	Daily role: Guarding Writers and some vital installations. The team underwent a mock drill in resolving a hostage crisis during the first training stint.              
	Special Task Force         
	Manpower: This special force isnt combat-ready yet. Only 44 personnel were inducted into the force in the first phase.        
	Weaponry: Rifles and 9mm pistols.        
	Objective: Personnel have been divided into three sections. One team has been assigned the task of gathering intelligence about subversive activity in and around the city. The second group is supposed to use this information to identify the people behind such activity. The job of the third group is to go after them.         
	Daily role: Attending briefings with senior officials.               
	Official version: Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti admitted that the city lacked a crack anti-terrorist squad. We will send a proposal to the state government to set up a battalion with more than 600 personnel trained to handle a situation like that in Mumbai.

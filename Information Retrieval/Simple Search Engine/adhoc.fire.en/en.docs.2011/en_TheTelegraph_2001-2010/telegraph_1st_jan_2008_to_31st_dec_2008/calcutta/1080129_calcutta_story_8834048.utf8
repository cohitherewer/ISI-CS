  - Scheme for old buildings          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                           Nandaram market in flames. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya will meet senior officials of the fire brigade, civic body and police at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to figure out ways to improve fire-fighting arrangements in markets.         
	Worried by the lack of options before the administration in fighting flames like the one at Nandaram market this month, the minister has sought suggestions from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the fire brigade.        
	The meeting will also review firefighting arrangements in large commercial buildings and highrise flats.        
	The CMC will call for the constitution of a permanent monitoring committee of the fire brigade which will check the firefighting norms in markets and estates at regular intervals, said an engineer of the building department.        
	While seeking clearance from the fire brigade  a must for getting a construction proposal passed by the CMC  the landlord claims elaborate fire prevention measures. But after getting the approval from the CMC, he violates the fire safety norms with impunity, said mayoral council member (building) Dipankar Dey.        
	In another development, the mayor has directed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to prepare a scheme for the redevelopment of old buildings that have been declared unsafe by the CMC. There are over 1,500 such buildings, of which 549 are in Burrabazar.        
	We are planning to relax the building rules for the owners of old, unsafe buildings so that reconstruction remains a viable option even after rehabilitating the tenants. The modalities are yet to be worked out, said Bandyopadhyay.         
	The state government is thinking along the same lines, said a joint secretary in the municipal affairs department. The traders of most markets violate fire prevention rules. When a fire breaks out, they blame the administration for failing to protect their property, he said.        
	If a fire razes a building occupied by tenants, the landlord can reconstruct the building without going into the trouble of vacating it, stated Dey.

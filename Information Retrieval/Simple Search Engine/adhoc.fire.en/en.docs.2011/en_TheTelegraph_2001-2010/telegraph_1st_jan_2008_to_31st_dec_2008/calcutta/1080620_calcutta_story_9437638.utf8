          Todays question: What can the people of Calcutta do to defy bandhs? More answers will be published next week                                                      
	Sukla Mukherjee, Dum Dum
  Politicians do not give much priority to peoples problems. So, the best way is to ignore them and get on with daily chores.									                Owais Khateeb, Address not mentioned								       
	Some steps can be taken to defy bandhs. First, people should not listen to the threats given by goons parading as political party workers. Second, bandhs, in all their varieties, should be banned. Third, people must force political parties to include a promise not to call any bandhs in their election manifesto. People from all strata, especially transport operators, shop owners and educational institutions, must not surrender to a bandh no matter which party calls it.          Amrita Mallik, Salt Lake								       
	To defy bandhs, Calcuttans need to unanimously decide whether they want employment and stable rates of goods or unnecessary and sudden disruptions in daily life. Protests can be made in Gandhigiri style as popularised by Lage Raho Munnabhai. If people are willing to uproot bandhs they must come forward to make their stand clear instead of grumbling at home.                K.B. Goswami,Central Park								       
	To defy bandhs people should offer to work on the weekly holiday. This will be a slap in the face of bandh organisers. It will also separate those who are genuinely interested in the states welfare from those who are not.                Kumardip Sen, Baguiati								       
	We should defy bandhs, but support the cause. Supporting a cause does not mean we have to postpone all our activities. Postponing work would mean creating more trouble to solve the one we are protesting against.                 Tapan Pal, Batanagar       
	Why should people want to give up on bandh-backed holidays? Have they been bitten by rabid dogs? Everyone loves paid holidays. If the political parties want to remain in the good books of Calcuttans, they should publish a bandh roster for the year well in advance, so people can plan their holidays. The Biman-Mamata twin bandhs gave us a four-day weekend, reminding us of Durga puja. Only if they could announce it a bit earlier, we could have gone on vacation to say, Chandipur.                P.B. Saha,Houston, Texas								       
	People now enjoy a bandh as an extra day of respite from the week-long drudgery of work. The best way to say no to a bandh call is to put up stiff resistance by mobilising public opinion. People have to muster the courage to stand up to the bullying tactics adopted by the bandh sponsors. It is sure to flop if people resist. Shopowners should not down their shutters out of fear. They should display their merchandise on sale so that customers can also walk in.                   Tuhin Purkayastha, Parnashree Palli								       
	A bandh cannot have any effect on society other than disturbing peoples schedules. Our politicians who are pretty old should think and act like mature people.                 Pratika Gupta, Phoolbagan								       
	 Defying bandhs is not easy because people like bandhs for giving them an extra day of rest. People need to be motivated against bandhs and sent to work. When a common man is not spared for the smallest crime, why should politicians be forgiven for damaging our economy? The court should order the politicians to pay for the revenue losses for a particular bandh day out of their own pockets.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	After malls and multiplexes, the star hotels and cyber cafs in city have come under the safety scanner.         
	Senior police officers on Wednesday met representatives of several three-star and five-star hotels and asked them to instal security gadgets and keep a tab on their guests.         
	The hour-long meeting was chaired by additional police commissioner Subrata Narayan Sarkar.         
	As part of our effort to expand the security net, weve asked hotel officials to instal certain surveillance gadgets. They have also been asked to note down details of the guests while they check in and ask for documents in support of their claims, Sarkar said.         
	The gadgets that the hotels have been asked to instal are door-frame and hand-held metal detectors and closed-circuit cameras.         
	Senior officers also met the owners of cyber cafs in and around the central business district and briefed them about the laws applicable to their units.         
	We told the owners to instal a software that would register the IP call-log of the users and capture details of his biometrics, including thumb impressions. The system has been introduced on an experimental basis in a few states, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.         
	Once details of a user are captured, he need not have to prove his identity if he visits the caf again. We, too, can access the information through our central server, he added.         
	The police have learnt that the Salt Lake cyber caf from where Tuesdays hoax mail was allegedly sent did not keep records of the users.         
	To further boost security, senior officers on Thursday will meet the army top brass to discuss possibilities of intelligence sharing. Home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti is likely to attend the meeting.        
	Bomb scares continued on Thursday with a hoax call at a school on Golam Mohammed Shah Road, in south Calcutta. The school was immediately evacuated but no explosives were found.         
	CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka had to shift a press conference after the companys 30th annual general meeting from City Centre to a hotel. City Centre officials didnt allow the meet following a police directive.

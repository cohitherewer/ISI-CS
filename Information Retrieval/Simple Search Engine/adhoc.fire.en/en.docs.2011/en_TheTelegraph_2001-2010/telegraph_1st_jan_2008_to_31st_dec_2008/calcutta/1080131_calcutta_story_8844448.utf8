 - Members want alternative book bazaar on Salt Lake stadium grounds

	The Publishers and Booksellers Guild, for all its high-pitched demand to reinstate the Book Fair on the Maidan, is a divided house.
    
	The day the guild held a symbolic Book Fair on a patch of green from where it was banished by the high court a year ago, a section of members demanded that an alternative fair be held in the Salt Lake stadium compound.
    
	The Book Fair has to be held, especially for those publishers who had staked everything, including their wives ornaments, for the event, said Sabitendranath Roy of Mitra Ghosh publishing house, questioning the guilds stand not to hold the fair at all in 2008.
    
	Let there be a steering committee to look after the details of organising the fair. If required, an event management company could also be hired, suggested Roy, a past president of the guild.
    
	The guild brass is functioning like Hitler. Almost all decisions are taken unilaterally, said Anil Acharya, of Anushtup, who is also a past secretary of the organisation. I had repeatedly urged them not to pitch for Park Circus Maidan as the venue for Book Fair 2008. But they turned down my plea. The alternative fair, if held, will come as a relief for the majority of the publishers.
    
	The guild brass pleaded ignorance about the demand for an alternative fair. Anyone can organise a book fair at any place. But an international book fair cannot be held on a small ground, by chopping off a large number of participants, said Sudhangshu Dey, a member of the guilds executive committee.
    
	Insiders in the publishing business on College Street said the clamour for an alternative fair was growing. A concerted attempt to hold the alternative fair in the Salt Lake stadium has been on since Tuesday night, when a section of publishers called up sports minister Subhas Chakrabortys wife Romola to seek an appointment with her husband, said a source.
    
	On Wednesday, Chakraborty said his department would allow the fair in the stadium, if the chief minister so wished.

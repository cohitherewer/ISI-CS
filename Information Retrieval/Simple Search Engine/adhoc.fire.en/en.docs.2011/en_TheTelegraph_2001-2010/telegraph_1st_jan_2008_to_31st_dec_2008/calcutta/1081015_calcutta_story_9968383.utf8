  - Symptoms different from chikungunya and dengue          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	Over 300 people in Budge Budge and Bishnupur, on the citys southern fringes, are suffering from a mystery fever that has reportedly claimed two lives since Sunday.         
	South 24-Parganas health authorities have confirmed chikungunya and dengue cases in the area but the symptoms of some of the ailing residents are atypical of both diseases.         
	Residents of six blocks, including Mograhat, Falta and Joynagar, have tested positive for chikungunya. We have been receiving complaints of fever from before Puja. Four patients out of 39 in Bishnupur and Budge Budge Block II were found to have chikungunya, said Sachchidananda Sarkar, the chief medical officer (health) of the district.         
	According to his department, Budge Budge-resident Himadri Adhikari died at the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences after suffering dengue shock on Sunday. His family members, however, said several blood tests had not revealed the presence of dengue virus in his blood.        
	Nobody could tell us what Himadri was suffering from. He had high fever and was throwing up since October 2, said Himadris brother Supriyo.        
	Gautam Das, who lives 100 m from the Adhikaris house, was admitted to NRS Hospital on Tuesday morning with the same symptoms. We will receive his blood test report on Wednesday, said his brother.         
	The death of 12-year-old Palash Sardar, a resident of Umedhpur in Nowdakhali, on the way to National Medical College and Hospital on Monday night has added to the mystery fever scare.        
	The boy didnt show symptoms of chikungunya. He died before the blood test report arrived, said a doctor in the medical unit treating patients in the affected zones.         
	District medical officials claimed Palash complained of breathlessness and suffered fits on Sunday. He was shifted on Monday from a local hospital to Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala, where doctors referred him to National Medical College.        
	Dengue death: Sandip Chandra, a city engineering student, died of dengue in a nursing home on Tuesday, said his relatives. Government and civic authorities are yet to confirm that he had suffered from dengue.

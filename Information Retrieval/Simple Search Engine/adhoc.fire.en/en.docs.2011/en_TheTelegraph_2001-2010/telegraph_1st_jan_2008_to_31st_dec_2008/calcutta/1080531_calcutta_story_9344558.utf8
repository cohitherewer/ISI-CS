                The railways have started an inquiry into the accident in which a city-based doctor, his wife and their teenaged daughter were killed at Katwas Natungram rail crossing last Monday. The three-member probe team is expected to submit its report in a week, said A.K. Maitra, Eastern Railways divisional railway manager (Howrah).    A man was arrested on Friday in connection with a car theft from the parking lot of the airport earlier this month. E. Hussain, who runs a travel agency, was picked up from Bowbazar. Interrogation revealed that the stolen Tata Sumo was taken to Bihar by Hussains brother Sajjad.    Three minor girls from Agra were rescued from a flat on Avinash Kabiraj Street, in Burtola, late on Thursday. Sunayna Singh, the landlady of the premises, has been arrested.    Tinku Sen, a 28-year-old homemaker, committed suicide by hanging herself at her Nayanchand Dutta Street residence, in Burtola, on Friday. Husband Jayanta Sen found her hanging around 8.30am. No suicide note was found.    Around 100 residents blocked the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Amherst Street crossing from 7.45pm to 8.10pm and the Amherst Street-Surya Sen Street crossing from 7pm to 8.15pm on Friday, protesting prolonged power cuts.

 - Post-Nano, Mamata opens flower show, each painting matching car price 
   A STAFF REPORTER
        Danseuse Amala Shankar and artist Shuvaprasanna admire a work by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee. Picture by Aranya Sen 
   
	The Nano costs Rs 1 lakh. So does a Mamata Banerjee painting.
 
	On Monday evening, three days after Ratan Tata launched the world rsquo;s cheapest car, the Trinamul Congress chief unveiled an exhibition of 45 paintings mdash; each of which costs Rs 1 lakh.
 
	And Mamata rsquo;s canvases don rsquo;t have the add-on costs that Tata rsquo;s cars do.
 
	Perhaps it rsquo;s all a coincidence. But the lady is saying it with flowers. If the world knows of her fondness for petals already mdash; her party symbol is a flower designed by her and one of her slogans is ldquo;Chup chaap phool-e chhaap rdquo; mdash; it will be dazzled by the wild efflorescence put on display at Asutosh Hall of the Indian Museum till January 20.
 
	Titled lsquo;25 hours in a day, Chapter Two rsquo;, her second art exhibition, it is described as a ldquo;public figure rsquo;s shy, private space rdquo;.
 
	It is hardly shy. She may wear dull shades on her person, but her inner world must be extremely colourful and vibrant. The flowers mdash; and a few palm trees and paddy fields mdash; done in the brightest of reds, pinks, yellows, pearl and gold, are like child paintings, in bold and impulsive strokes.
 
	But it is a bright, soft, feminine world. It doesn rsquo;t scream. 
 
	Almost like the Trinamul flower filled out. 
 
	And the application of oil and acrylic paint, in daubs, or spirals for the flowers that look like Catherine Wheels, shows a confident hand. Banerjee must have noticed foliage and trees very closely, obvious from the pattern of the leaves and branches.
 
	The flowers are punctuated by sudden images of the Goddess Kali, done again in bright pata colours, striking, but again, not scary. 
 
	The paintings, in fact, have a lot more form than her rhetoric. But the lady would ascribe to her paintings the same lack of design, even thoughtlessness, which is attributed to her politics. 
 
	 ldquo;I cannot paint. I can only doodle, rdquo; she stresses. She says she puts her brush to the canvas ndash; she is a prolific painter, finishing one or two paintings in a night ndash; even while talking on the phone or speaking to someone. She doesn rsquo;t pause to think of what she is doing. ldquo;I don rsquo;t know why I draw flowers. Everyone is stressed out, but flowers smile, trees smile hellip; rdquo; She doesn rsquo;t even know which one of her paintings is good. ldquo;I don rsquo;t understand anything, rdquo; repeats Banerjee, who picked up the brush a few years ago and did not put it down again. ldquo;I am no artist. Just a vagabond with colours rdquo;, states a board at the hall, carrying many of her other sayings. 
 
	But this is an exhibition with a cause, unlike her earlier exhibition. The proceeds of the show will go to Nandigram victims. One Nandigram family of four was also on display at the inauguration. 
 
	Banerjee named artist Shuvaprasanna as the man who put together the show. ldquo;Her paintings are above petty politics, rdquo; Shuvaprasanna said. Also present were danseuses Amala Shankar and Priti Patel.

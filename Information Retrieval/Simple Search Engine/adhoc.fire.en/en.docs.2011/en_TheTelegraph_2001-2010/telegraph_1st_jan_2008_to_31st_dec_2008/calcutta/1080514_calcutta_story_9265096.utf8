           Lawless wheels: A private bus being overtaken by another on Sarat Bose Road                             
	It is unfortunate that a poor patient with serious spinal cord injury had to shuffle from one hospital to another for admission before finally returning home. What is unpardonable is that this was repeated the next day (Patient sent back again, April 2).           
	The hospitals that refused Dinabandhu Patra admission, barring one, are run by the government. None of them told the patient what he should do and tried to pass the buck to the next hospital. The journey from hospital to hospital no doubt worsened Patras condition.           
	Such incidents are common in Calcutta. It is time a system is put in place to prevent such behaviour by hospital authorities. The government hospitals should be networked. The hos-pital where a patient is first taken has to either admit him or arrange his admission to a hospital with required infrastructure. Till the patient is admitted, the first hospital should look after his well-being. A similar network could also be set up among private hospitals.           
	Ashok Kumar Ghosh,
  CIT Road                       
	Bus rides have become a nightmare for passengers because of rule flout by drivers and conductors (Blood on VIP Road, April 11). My family members and I took a bus plying on route 234 (WB 23 A-0763) at 6.20pm on April 12 at the Sukeas Street (APC Road) stop to go to South City mall. The bus was moving so slowly that we were forced to get off on Rashbehari Avenue around 7.45pm. The driver was deliberately slowing down at crossings so that the signal turned red. The rear door conductor got off the bus twice for more than five minutes between Nonapukur and Mullickbazar and at Kalamandir. A traffic sergeant fined the driver at Hazra crossing but that was hardly a deterrent.             
	I suggest intense vigil by traffic sergeants, stiffer penalty for rule violation and a dedicated phone number for pedestrians and passengers to report offences to the traffic control. This number should be prominently displayed inside and outside buses, taxis and autorickshaws.           
	Prasenjit Bhakat,
  Jhargram           
	Running public transport is a public service and only the best people should be entrusted with the responsibility. Unfortunately, the responsibility is in the wrong hands in West Bengal. Neither the minister nor the police are serious about keeping the roads safe. There is a hue and cry after every big accident but everything settles down soon after.           
	Shiv Shanker Almal, 
  Lower Rawdon Street                   
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE)s decision to allow affiliated schools to fix the pass marks in internal tests (Marks liberty for schools, April 11) is welcome.             
	However, some schools may misuse this liberty by raising the pass marks so steeply that students who would have easily passed in other schools would struggle to be promoted. The Central Board of Secondary Education was forced to fix 33 per cent as the pass mark in board examinations as well as internal examinations of affiliated schools after receiving complaints from guardians. Students should not be made to suffer because of the whims of school authorities.

  Salt Lake                               
	Apropos the report Cop chief axes rogue, April 2, Jesus asked us to forgive our brothers, seventy times seven. And our police bosses are true Christians. They allowed Dibyendu Shekhar Rez to continue his money-making errands even after the fiascos at Rabindra Saro-bar and South City college.             
	Does our police minister know how such cops are treated in China, his ideological fatherland? They face the firing squad.           
	Chameli Pal, 
  Batanagar                       
	Apropos the report Dressing up... or down, March 30, I am confused on the issue of dress codes in fun zones. Government offices are fun zones. The employees have lots of fun all day  chatting, napping, doing crosswords or sudoku or leaving office at noon. And they do not have dress codes.             
	Army camps are fun zones, too. The armymen get subsidised booze and enjoy themselves, sometimes ending up at Park Street police station. But they have strict dress codes.           
	C. Pal,
  Batanagar                   
	Apropos Cadres take over library, school, April 15, it is a shameful event in a democratic country.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	I was aggrieved to see the article Landlord saves help on April 25. The story has its roots in a sub judice battle with the landlord and was fabricated and planted by him. He has managed to evict most of the old tenants and I am the only one offering resistance. The truth is the tortured boy could be rescued by his father only with my help. The boy, who was being taken care of by my wife for only two weeks, was tempted by the landlord.

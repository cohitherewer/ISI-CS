                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tech town gets blogging
  - Employees discuss and share views on internal networks          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                    
	Tinsel town stars may be using blogs to settle scores but for Sector V, such tech tools offer a platform to communicate and collaborate.        
	Companies like IBM, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Cognizant Technology Services (CTS) encourage employees across the globe to use blogs and internal social networks to boost communication within the organisation.        
	We believe that communication, collaboration and collective ideation are the cornerstone of successful leadership. Blogging helps us reach our goals, said a CTS spokesperson.        
	Internal blogs, which can be accessed only within a companys network, are a wonderful way of collecting feedback from employees, expanding networks and sharing knowledge, feel the tech town bosses.        
	The informal nature of the platform encourages participation, free discussion and communication across layers of the organisation. A sense of community also develops in the process.         
	Blogs are an open channel for two-way communication, said Ananth Krishnan, the vice-president and the chief technical officer of TCS.        
	The company introduced the internal blogs in 2006. It became a company-wide platform the following year.         
	Over 50,000 employees have visited the website and more than 2,000 of them have uploaded posts.        
	CTS introduced blogs around the same time. There are about 3,000 active bloggers in the organisation and page view per month has crossed the million mark.        
	IBMs BlogCentral hosts more than 4,000 active blogs. But like CTS, it has developed an internal networking website on the lines of Facebook. It allows employees to create profiles, post photographs, list interests, comment on company events and chat.        
	A colleague in Chennai used to upload pictures and anecdotes during a trip to China, allowing many of us to know a place that we will perhaps never visit, said a CTS employee.        
	TCS has a platform called Just Ask that allows employees to post questions that others can answer.        
	If someone often answers questions on a particular domain, the relevant specialist group can draft that person into the domain. Just Ask gives visibility to talent within the company, said Krishnan.        
	Senior executives who often maintain active blogs sometimes identify future leaders in this manner.        
	The companies have their own policies on blogging. While IBM has a set of guidelines, at TCS, there are no restrictions on content as long as it is not offensive.        
	Employees at CTS cannot post anything derogatory or defamatory in their blogs. They are also expected to be authentic.

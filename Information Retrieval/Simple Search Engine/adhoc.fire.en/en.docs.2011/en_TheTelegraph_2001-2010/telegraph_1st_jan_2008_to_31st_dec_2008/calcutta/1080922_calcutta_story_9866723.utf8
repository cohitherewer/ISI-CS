                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Off to Gurgaon, with bag amp; landladys baggage 
  - American IT professional claims outstanding amount prompted her to take away furniture from flat          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	American IT professional Jeanne Heydecker writes in her blog that she found Calcutta not very infrastructure friendly. She may well have added a sentence or two about unfriendly landladies allegedly not returning money borrowed from tenants and how to teach them a lesson.        
	Jeanne relocated to Gurgaon recently, taking along with her a truckload of furniture from the furnished apartment she had rented at Sulekha More, in Jadavpur. On Friday, a team from Calcutta police knocked on the door of her Gurgaon apartment to arrest her for theft. Jeanne told us that she left Calcutta with some of her landladys belongings because she had refused to repay a loan, said a senior police officer.        
	According to the complaint lodged with Jadavpur police station by Sushmita Jha, the 48-year-old American moved into her furnished apartment at Ekta Heights in July last year. She moved out two months ago, allegedly without informing Sushmita that she had left her job as a group leader (marketing) at Intrasoft Technologies Ltd. I entered my apartment and found the television, the dining table, chairs and a bed missing. Every piece of furniture was an antique made out of Burma teak. They are worth around Rs 2.5 lakh, she said in her complaint.        
	Police wouldnt say how much money Jeanne, who was produced in court and granted bail on Sunday, had loaned to Sushmita. We can do that only after finding out whether she had actually paid her landlady any money apart from the rent, the investigating officer said.        
	Sushmita was unavailable for comment.        
	Apart from lodging a police complaint, Sushmita had filed a petition against Jeanne in Alipore Court. Police first visited Jeannes former office on Lake Temple Road and came to know that she had quit her job for the post of vice-president in another IT company. A team then went to Gurgaon and brought Jeanne to Calcutta after obtaining a transit remand from a court there. From her Gurgaon apartment we recovered the furniture she had allegedly stolen from the Jadavpur flat, an officer said.        
	Although she has got bail, the American cant leave the city.         
	Jeanne, who moved from Chicago to India along with her 13-year-old son William, a Siamese cat and a Greyhound, studied at Sir JJ College of Architecture in Mumbai in 1976-77.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 31-year-old Citu leader was hacked and shot dead at the union office in Jessore Road, in Shyamnagar, on Tuesday evening.        
	Rana Bhakto, who was secretary of the local autorickshaw union, was taken to hospital, where he was declared dead. We are looking for Rajesh Nayek, who led the gang of six assassins, said an officer.        
	A local gang was trying to roll out more autos on the Shyamnagar-Baguiati route. But Ranas group was opposed to it. Though we arent sure about the motive, the dispute might have played a role in the murder, the officer added.

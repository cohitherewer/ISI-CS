                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Airline official found hanging at airport 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 48-year-old Air India official was found hanging on the Calcutta airport premises on Monday afternoon.        
	The body of Barun Kumar Biswas, a resident of Barasat and an aircraft equipment operator, was found hanging from a ceiling hook in an abandoned transformer room near the cargo terminal of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International (NSCBI) Airport.        
	A case of unnatural death has been registered and the body sent for post-mortem, an official of NSCBI Airport police station said.        
	The autopsy report will establish the exact cause and time of death, he added.        
	Biswass family members are in a state of shock and police will question them after the funeral is over.        
	Biswas was part of a technical team of Air India, which offers maintenance services to all carriers at Calcutta airport. He had reported for work on Sunday night and had breakfast and tea with his colleagues the next morning. No one had noticed anything unusual in his behaviour.         
	On Monday morning, his checked an Emirates aircraft that came from Dubai and handed over charge after his shift got over around 10am. That was the last time he was seen alive, a colleague said.        
	Around 12.15pm, a grass- cutter working near the transformer room, which has only one wall and a ceiling and is open on three sides, saw Biswas hanging from a ceiling hook. It is a deserted area where only a few airport staffers go. So nobody had noticed Biswas entering the room, said a police officer.        
	His colleagues told the police that Biswas, usually a jolly person, had been silent and depressed for the past five or six months.         
	Biswas was suffering from depression for the last three months, said his brother-in-law, Shantanu Bose.         
	He thought he was becoming physically weak and since he was a technical expert, he would lose his job. If he lost his job, he felt there would be no reason to live, Bose said.        
	Biswas had also suffered a neurological problem about a month back after returning from a night shift and had to be admitted in hospital, the brother-in-law said. He skipped work for a few days and rejoined a couple of days back after much persuasion from his colleagues and family members, Bose said.        
	Last night, he had asked his wife not to prepare his lunch today as he would eat at the airport canteen after finishing work, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Language skills give job-seekers the edge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Language skills give job-seekers the edge
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	The demand for foreign language skills has increased in Calcutta with multinational companies looking for recruits who can speak their clients tongue.        
	Companies with overseas clients, mainly in the IT sector, are lapping up those fluent in foreign languages. Career prospects for such people were earlier limited to jobs of interpreters or translators and some posts in embassies.        
	With the job market growing and students keen to add foreign language skills to their CVs, Calcutta University has introduced courses in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Italian and German.         
	The demand for courses in foreign languages has gone up, and students no longer perceive it as an extra-curricular activity. They have realised that knowing a foreign language will give them the edge in terms of employability, a university official said.        
	Most students are choosing to learn Chinese and Japanese because growing trade relations between India and these countries have opened up job opportunities. Another popular language is German. Siemens Information Systems Ltd, Calcutta, has employed around 125 German-speaking Indians to provide customer support.         
	The Siemens Enterprise Networks project, which the company operates from Calcutta, provides support to over 10,000 customers and about 45 companies across the globe. Fluency in reading, comprehending and writing German with advanced-level certification from the Goethe Institute are prerequisites for the job along with the relevant technical qualifications and experience.         
	Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), too, has been recruiting people with foreign language skills. The companys dedicated Japan offshore delivery centre in Calcutta employs 100 people.         
	Other Indian companies with a global presence are similarly keen to recruit people who know languages like German, Japanese, Italian, French and Spanish because their businesses are growing in Europe and Southeast Asia.        
	Companies that have set up shop in Europe and Southeast Asia are realising that language is a barrier to servicing clients there. If we dont pick up language skills, we will lose out on business from these places, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.

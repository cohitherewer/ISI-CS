	Hundreds of people turned up at Alipore zoo on Sunday for a glimpse of the Royal Bengal Tiger caught at Tridibnagar and brought to the city for treatment.        
	The big cat was, however, away at the zoo hospital across the street. The other tigers were the top draws in his absence, but the conversation around the enclosure centred on what caused the injuries to the 15-year-old animal.        
	Is this the one from the Sunderbans? 11-year-old Sayantan asked his father, pointing to a tiger. A zoo attendant passing by told the boy that the tiger he was looking for is in hospital. How can we put him in public view? He is very sick, he said.        
	Some came to the zoo knowing that they were unlikely to see the captured tiger. I knew that the animal has lost a foot and is being treated. But still, I came, said Sujoy Banerjee, a college student.        
	The zoo officials did not allow the public to enter the hospital. According to the officials, the tiger is still weak but responding to treatment.        
	He has been put on drip as he is dehydrated. He ate a kg of pork and six kg of beef and can stand up on three legs now, though not steadily, said a veterinarian treating the tiger.

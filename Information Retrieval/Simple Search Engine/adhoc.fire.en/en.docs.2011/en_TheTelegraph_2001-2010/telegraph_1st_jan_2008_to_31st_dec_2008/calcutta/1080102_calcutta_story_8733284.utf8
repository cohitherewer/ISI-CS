	Menaka Gupta steered clear of all party places and spent a quiet New Years Eve night with the family. She was, after all, saving every ounce of energy for the first day of the new year  at the races.
    
	This has been a family tradition for the past 30 years, smiled the lady, who works with an NGO and doesnt mind trading 31st night at a Tollygunge Club for the 1st afternoon at Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC).
    
	But many others among the 17,000-odd enthusiasts thronging the Turf Club grounds on Tuesday afternoon did this and that  party all night, before landing up at the races.
    
	My eyes were bloodshot and I was totally hung over after getting home at 5am, but I wore my shades and made it to what Ive heard is an important social event in the citys calendar, smiled 25-year-old Jayant Jain.
    
	The 25-to-40 brigade had turned up after partying all night, to attend a party of a different kind marked by bets, bites and beats. A bar, live music and a food court serving an assortment of Indian, Chinese and continental fare made it quite a carnival.
    
	The January 1 crowd continues to be very cosmopolitan. The numbers have not diminished over the years. It is a normal racing crowd that comes to meet, eat, drink and have a good time, said Cyrus Madan, the chairman of RCTC.
    
	Not everyone seemed to agree that this was the normal racing crowd on the first day of a new year. The crowd has really deteriorated, said a regular, recoiling at the sight of a gutkha-spitting member of the audience.
    
	But most of the men were in their race-day best  jackets, scarves and even hats  as they ambled around clutching on to the tiny bidding booklets, while the ladies sat pretty in the members enclosure.
    
	For most, turning up at the races is all about meeting old friends and wishing them Happy New Year. I always spend this day in Calcutta and come to the races with my nephew and niece. I dont spend more than Rs 1,000 but its the best place to meet old friends, smiled Leycester Webb, a Calcuttan now living in London.
    
	There was a fair representation of GenX as well. Sisters Rati, 22, and Parinita, 18, in their fashionable minis, were there to look for a horse with an interesting name or a good-looking jockey and bet on them. We come to socialise and start off the year in a fun way hoping that well have fun all year long, they giggled.
    
	To attract more youngsters, the club authorities have relaxed dress-code rules and are planning more GenX-oriented activities at the races.

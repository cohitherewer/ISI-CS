      Agonising tribute                        Calcutta Cycle performs at Studio 21. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya              
	November 3 was Ritwik Ghataks birth anniversary. West Bengal Democratic Writers Artists Association, Eisenstein Cine Club and Russian Centre of Science and Culture in Calcutta celebrated the filmmakers 83rd birthday by screening Jantranar Dalil: Ritwik (A Documenting of Agony), a short film by Debjani Haldar at Gorky Sadan.     
	The film explored how the Partition and life as a refugee made a lasting impact on Ghatak. Unemployment, disintegration of social values and suppression of individual talent  all a fallout of the influx of refugees  were themes his films revolved around. There were interviews with finance minister Asim Dasgupta, filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, FTII director Kumar Sahani and Surama Ghatak, Ritwik Ghataks wife.     
	With endless quotes and film clips that continued stating the blatantly obvious, the long documentary wasnt perhaps the best way to pay tribute to the master filmmaker.     
	Mystic music    
	If all one knew of qawwali was Nusrat Fateh Ali Khans Allah Hoo, Fakiri Gaan at Studio 21 on Tuesday evening would have been a revelation.     
	Sitting before a motley gathering of students, tourists, musicians and art lovers, a group called Calcutta Cycle sang traditional qawwali and fakiri songs in Bengali. The songs, mystic in nature, spoke about love for music, knowledge and god, as if they were one and the same.     
	Tradition has it that the last song of a performance should be based on milan or union. Keeping with the tradition, Calcutta Cycle signed off with a wistful rendition of Milan hobe kobe.

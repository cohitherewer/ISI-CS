                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Man who led Maradona 
										      calcuttan of the week                                    
	Name: Abhignan Mukherjee (picture left by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)        
	Age: 36        
	Claim to fame: A sergeant with Calcutta police, Mukherjee was the pilot of the convoy carrying Diego Maradona during his visit to the city earlier this month.        
	Leading a convoy of eight vehicles, Mukherjee was in charge of the football legends travel in the city. He accompanied Maradona for three days non-stop, liaising with several wings of the city and state police to ensure Maradonas security and comfort on road.         
	As I was piloting such a huge star, my main concern was to see that no vehicle breached the convoy to get close to Maradona, said Mukherjee.         
	Dream come true: Maradona was my childhood favourite. When I was selected to pilot Maradonas convoy, it was a dream come true. I had always wanted to meet him, but I could never imagine I would be in such close proximity with my hero for three whole days, said Mukherjee, who is a sportsman himself and a part of the city polices rugby team.         
	Selection criteria: Given the huge media coverage Maradonas visit was sure to receive, I guess the bosses were looking for smart, handsome officers, he smiled.        
	Memorable moments: While leaving, Maradona met each officer assigned to his duty and thanked him. It was the high point of my career, said Mukherjee.        
	Other star convoys: Escorting celebrities and VVIPs is all in a days work for Mukherjee. Apart from the usual smattering of netas and dignitaries, he has piloted Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Mithun Chakraborty.        
	What next? Id love to pilot Amitabh Bachchan, he said, his eyes lighting up.       SAMHITA L. CHAKRABORTY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parisians hapless spring sojourn
                                                                                                               Parisians hapless spring sojourn
  - Passport and valuables stolen on train, baggage misplaced by airline          A STAFF REPORTER                          HOLIDAY BLUES: Leila Ziadi and fiance Cyrille Esteve. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	Leila Ziadi and her fiance Cyrille Esteve had planned a memorable two weeks in India. Now, the French couple will remember their spring sojourn for all the wrong reasons.        
	If the Indian railways dont get you, the airlines surely will, is how the Parisians ended up feeling. First, Leilas passport and valuables were stolen on a train. Then, her baggage was misplaced by an airline while they were on their way to Calcutta from Delhi.        
	Their return to Paris in jeopardy, it finally took the intervention of immigration officials in Calcutta to help retrieve their baggage and obtain clearance to leave for home.        
	Leila, who organises art exhibitions, and Cyrille, a software graphics designer, had planned their two-week holiday in India. He arrived in New Delhi in mid-February and she joined him on February 22.        
	From Delhi, we went on an extensive tour of Rajasthan and on February 29, took a train from Jaipur to Varanasi, recounted Leila. They were travelling by sleeper class on the Marudhar Express and Leila was on a middle berth. I used the bag containing my travel documents, cash and other valuables as a pillow, she said.        
	When they woke up in the morning, her passport, cash, ATM cards, cellphone and other valuables were missing from the bag.        
	They immediately alerted the travelling ticket examiner of the compartment, and after getting down at Varanasi, lodged a complaint with the GRP.        
	On March 4, they went to the French embassy in Delhi and Leila was given a temporary travel document. As they had their return ticket to Paris from Calcutta, they took a Kingfisher flight the same night. They landed at Calcutta airport, but Leilas baggage did not. It was lost in transit.        
	The avalanche of events left us devastated and we were literally crying at the immigration office, said Cyrille. The chief immigration officer, eastern India, Basab Talukdar then spoke to the airline, which traced the bag to Bangalore and delivered it to Leila on Thursday. The Parisians leave for home on Friday.

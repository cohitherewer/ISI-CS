          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four people were killed in three accidents across the city on Monday.        
	A minibus on the BBD Bag-Thakurpukur route mowed down Binapani Mondal, 47, on Diamond Harbour Road, in Behala, after the driver lost control while racing a private bus on route 235.        
	Mondal, who died on the spot, was standing beside the road when the mishap occurred around 4pm.        
	As residents chased the bus, it hit an autorickshaw which in turn rammed into the route 235 bus. Auto driver Govinda Naskar, 27, died at Vidyasagar Hospital. A passenger in the three-wheeler was injured, the police said.         
	Witnesses, however, claimed that the auto was carrying three passengers, all of whom were injured.        
	The crowd set the minibus on fire. Both vehicles were impounded but the drivers fled.        
	Two people died and one was injured. We are trying to find the cause of the accident, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas.        
	The pavements have been taken over by hawkers and vehicles are parked illegally on both sides of the road. There are no cops to regulate vehicles. The accident was waiting to happen, said Diptosh Chatterjee, who runs a garments shop near the accident spot.        
	In another mishap, Tridib Roy, 45, died after being run over by the rear wheels of a state bus (on route 33) he had just got off in Entally. The Hatibagan resident died on the spot. The bus has been impounded.        
	A man in his 50s was crushed under the wheels of a private bus on route 1B on Taratala Road. The driver and the conductor fled.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Passport to prison
  - Girls dream passage ends at airport          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Only the immigration counter stood between Dimple Rasikbhai Patel and her American dream when she entered Calcutta airport late on Wednesday night, or so she thought.         
	A day later, the Ahmedabad resident was cooling her heels at the airport police station.        
	Dimple, 23, was caught trying to travel on a fake passport procured from a Mumbai agent after she failed to get an American work permit with her legitimate documents.         
	The fake passport was in the name of Reena Tahir Bhatiya and the number matched that of Prashant Kumar Iswar Bhai Patel, who, immigration records revealed, had returned to India from the US through Mumbai airport on April 22. The American residential permit attached to the passport was in the name of one Asif Ali Bhatiya.        
	It seems that the passports jacket was replaced along with the pages inside, Basab Talukdar, the deputy commissioner (security control) and foreigners regional registration officer in Calcutta, said.        
	The passport and the false identity that Dimple thought would take her to the country of her dreams had cost a bomb. She paid the agent Rs 1 lakh and promised another Rs 6 lakh if he helped her get a job in the US.         
	Dimple has a diploma in electrical engineering.        
	An agent had got in touch with us and said he could provide a passport, her cloth merchant father, Rasik Bhai Patel, told Metro from Ahmedabad.         
	On May 10, Dimple went to Mumbai with an uncle, Vinod Bhai, to get the passport. The same uncle accompanied Dimple to Calcutta on Tuesday and escorted her to the airport, where she was to board a Lufthansa flight. Vinod Bhai could not be traced after his niece was caught.         
	Dimple, who will be produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Barrackpore on Friday, could get a maximum sentence of two years in jail along with a fine of Rs 5,000.        
	A Chennai-based couple was arrested at Calcutta airport only last month because the wife, Mumtaz Firoz, was found travelling on a fake passport.

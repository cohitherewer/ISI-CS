The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Security rules for hotels revised
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Security rules for hotels revised
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Hotels in town have two weeks to pull up their security socks and put into place fresh safety measures.        
	At a high-level meeting in Lalbazar on Friday evening, the police laid down the rules revised in the wake of the war on Mumbai.        
	Around 150 representatives from hotels were told that apart from installing CCTVs and doorframe metal detectors, baggage scanners must be in place for luggage checks. Sniffer dogs would have to be drafted in. The CCTV footage must be kept as back-up.        
	All guests would have to provide some sort of identity proof. If a guest refused to abide by these rules, the hotel management should be inclined to deny entry.        
	We have warned the hotels that there would be a stock-taking after two weeks and then periodic checks would be carried out to ensure that the security measures are implemented. The registration books must be maintained meticulously, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	Police offered to provide manpower support to certain hotels but only after assessing the threat perception of a particular address.        
	Fridays session was divided into two, the first dealing with the top-rung hotels and the next with the middle and low-rung hotels and lodges.        
	The message emerging from the terror attacks in Mumbai is that foreigners in hotels are soft targets. We must be extra careful, said an officer.        
	The star hotels have been urged to provide their detailed layout plan, employ detectives to dig out information about guests and staff members, and maintain a guest profile to sniff out suspicious elements.        
	The smaller hotels have been asked to ensure frisking of visitors and their luggage and to work out an access control mechanism restricting movement through the entry-exit gates.

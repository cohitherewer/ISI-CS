The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Noddy to visit India
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Noddy to visit India
                              Noddy to entertain Calcuttans this September                                  
	Our little friends from Toy Land are set to descend here. The Noddy Show has a date with Calcutta on September 14.         
	Popular British author Enid Blyton created Noddy, whose tales were originally published between 1949 and 1963. Noddy has been in India for 30 years ever since Blytons books became available here. Even now, you see Noddy on TV (Pogo channel). A survey revealed that the little boy with puffy red cheeks, beaming blue eyes and smiley mouth has the highest recall among kids. So after the success of the Barney Show in Delhi, it was natural that we would next bring Noddy to India, says Kavita Bedi, managing director of Just Because Its Children, that, in partnership with Millennium Entertainment International, has acquired the live events licence of the popular character from brand owners Chorion.        
	Blytons boy will sing, dance and make merry with six other characters from Toy Land in the 60-minute musical. Expect an equivalent of Broadway standards, assures Kavita, of the Rs 3-crore production.         
	The storyline is a carry forward from what appears in the books, under strict supervision of the licencee. The show, called Noddy And The Treasure Map, has been scripted in Australia.         
	The cast of 30 people including Big Ears, a friendly gnome who lives in a mushroom-shaped house, the naughty goblins Sly and Gobbo, Tessy the Bear who lives in a pink house with Bumpy Dog, the town policeman Mr Plod as well as Noddys red car will board the plane from UK.         
	The first stop will be Mumbai on August 14, followed by Delhi and Bangalore after which the show rolls into Calcutta. Tickets for the Noddy rendezvous at Science City will be priced between Rs 500 and Rs 1000.

                      Exploring extremism                    Beginning as a militant peasant uprising in Bengal in 1967, the Naxalite revolution has transposed into a sophisticated extreme-Left movement all over India that feeds off the misery and anger of the dispossessed. Sudeep Chakravartis Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country offers a brilliant, though disturbing, examination of the war, being fought in jungles and impoverished villages across the country. Combining political history, interviews and case histories, he travels to the heart of Naxalite zones to reveal a sobering picture of a deeply divided society and to uncover the perils that lie ahead for its people. This evening, Samaresh Majumdar will release the book, to be followed by a discussion based on it by Rajat K. Majumdar, Nabarun Bhattacharya and the author. Hosted by Penguin Books India and Crossword.            lEvent: Book launch and discussion lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Crossword Bookstore, 8 Elgin Road

	The death of a 10-year-old Nakib Hossain Laskar in a road mishap set a mob on the rampage in Rabindra Nagar, off Taratola, on Thursday morning.        
	The mob destroyed the killer truck and a number of other vehicles and ransacked the house of a local CPM leader.         
	Police lathicharged the protesters and fired 37 rounds of tear gas shells to restore order. Residents alleged that the cops also fired in the air but officers denied the charge. More than a dozen people, including a few police officers, were injured.        
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Praveen Kumar, said 18 men have been arrested. A police team has been deployed in the area.        
	The mishap occurred around 10.25am, when Nur Alam Laskar was taking son Nakib and nephew Safiul Mollah to school on his cycle. Nakib was sitting behind.         
	Suddenly, a truck plying down the wrong side of Kankhuli Road rammed into the cycle. All three of us were thrown off into a ditch dug up by men working for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. I dont remember what happened after that, said Nur Alam, who was injured in his legs and chest.        
	Residents took the trio to a local nursing home, where Nakib was declared dead on arrival. Nur and Safiul were released after treatment.        
	Some of the residents stopped the killer truck and handed over the driver to the police. As news of the accident spread, a large number of people from various areas, including Mahestala and Metiabruz, gathered on the spot and damaged the truck and a number of other vehicles passing by.        
	A team from Rabindra Nagar police station rushed to the site, but the cops were outnumbered by the mob. The protesters started pelting stones at the policemen, injuring second officer H.K. Dan and local Congress councillor Abu Taleb Mollah, who had come to pacify the mob.        
	Soon, a larger contingent led by additional superintendent (industrial) D.P. Singh reached the spot and brought the situation under control.        
	A group of protesters organised a roadblock for three hours. They blamed the absence of traffic cops and the ongoing drainage revamp work for the rising number of mishaps in the area.        
	When the peace had almost been restored, a group attacked the house of Asim Neogi, a local CPM leader, on suspicion that he was behind the arrest of the 18 men. The mob damaged his house and scooter.        
	I was on the second floor with my grandson Bulai. Suddenly, I saw a few men throwing stones targeting the windows of our house.         
	Soon, the floor of one of the rooms was covered with glass shards. Had I not run away with Bulai, we would have been killed, said Asims wife Malati.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The recent serial blasts in Jaipur have prompted the state government to bolster security on the high court premises. Security arrangements in the other Calcutta courts will also be strengthened.        
	The measure is the first step towards boosting security in state installations.        
	Police removed hawkers around the high court on Monday, when it opened after the 15-day summer vacation.         
	Only cars of advocates and judges are being allowed to park near the court. We are keeping a close watch on motorcycles. We have requested advocates to put stickers on their vehicles. Bicycles will not be allowed near the court, said a police officer.        
	Metal detectors have been installed at four gates. Some of the entrances have been sealed.        
	A senior court official said closed-circuit cameras would be installed in the corridors and litigants would have to collect authorisation letters from their advocates to enter the premises.        
	During the vacation, the police commissioner had informed Justice Pinaki Ghosh about the plan to strengthen security measures in view of the Jaipur blasts, added the official.        
	About 135 policemen maintain vigil in the court. High court police has requested for at least 100 more policemen to be deployed.        
	We are thinking of issuing identity cards to court employees. A round of talks has been held with the authorities, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyel.

	A little big girl of eight saved her kid sister from being kidnapped by a chocolate-wielding woman on a central Calcutta pavement on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Two-year-old Khushboo succumbed to the chocolate temptation and was ready to go with the sari-clad stranger but elder sister Sajida Khatun was not to be fooled.         
	As the woman lifted Khushboo off the pavement at Wellesley Second Lane and started walking, Sajida had the presence of mind to follow her. When the woman walked briskly, the eight-year-old did, too. By the time they reached the other end of the lane, off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Sajida was sprinting to keep pace with the kidnapper. Then she began screaming for help.        
	Meri behen ko lekar ja rahi hai (My sister is being taken away), Sajida cried.        
	Some residents who heard her immediately stopped the 40-something woman, handed Khushboo to her relieved sister and alerted Park Street police station.        
	A police team arrived soon after and found the womans hands tied with a towel. They arrested her but couldnt get her to talk.                           
	 We havent been able to find out who she is or what her motive was. She did not reply to our questions at first. When she did speak, much of it was incoherent. We will seek expert opinion on whether the woman is mentally unstable or putting up an act, said an officer at the police station.        
	At Sajida and Khushboos home, it was as if Id was being celebrated for the second time in as many weeks. Khushboo is safe only because of Sajida. I am proud of my elder daughter. Had she not raised alarm, Khushboo would surely have been kidnapped. Where would I have then searched for my younger daughter? asked father Hasmel Khan, an auto mechanic.        
	Sajida, untouched by the praise being showered on her, was back to playing with her sister in the familys 10ftx10ft home at Wellesley Second Lane. Asked what had prompted her to follow the woman, the little girl said it was because she was a stranger.        
	I was trying to make Khushboo smile when the woman arrived and offered her chocolates. My sister willingly went into her lap but I was suspicious of the womans intentions because she was a stranger. So, I started following her.        
	Sheikh Raju, one of the residents who accosted the woman, said she tried to flee but gave up on seeing herself surrounded.

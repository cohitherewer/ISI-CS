	Stakeholders of homoeopathy have come together against the state governments callous attitude towards the discipline.        
	Doctors, students and drug manufacturers have alleged that despite repeated pleas, the government has failed to formulate a comprehensive policy to upgrade homoeopathy education and treatment.        
	Surveys have revealed an an increasing demand for homoeopathy treatment, but there is an acute shortage of teachers. Lack of infrastructure is prompting many students to drop out, said Ram Krishna Ghosh Mondal, a member of the Central Council of Homoeopathy, a national-level regulatory body.        
	The Centre, under the 10th Plan, has allotted huge funds for upgrading homoeopathy education. But the state has been sitting on the grant, said Mahendra Singh, the secretary-general of the Indian Homoeopathy Teachers Association.        
	The government, in violation of norms, is engaging health officers to teach homoeopathy students, said an association member. The health officers are not qualified to become teachers.        
	The association will meet on April 10 to decide on its course of action.

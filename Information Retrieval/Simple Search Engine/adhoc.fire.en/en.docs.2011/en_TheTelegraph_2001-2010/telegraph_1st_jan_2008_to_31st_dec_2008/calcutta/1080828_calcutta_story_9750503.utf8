                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chicken chain spreads wings
  - KFC plans 10 more outlets in city          SUBHRO SAHA                          A KFC outlet in City Centre, Salt Lake                                        
	At least 10 KFC outlets will open in the city over the next three years.        
	Calcuttans have shattered the myth that western-style fast food doesnt do well here. In fact, the city contributes more than one-third of our national revenue. Hence the bullish rollout roster with over Rs 150 crore riding on it, says a spokesperson for Devyani International, the franchisee for KFC.        
	Devyani, also franchisee for Pizza Hut and UK-based coffee shop chain Costa Coffee in the east, has an aggressive city roadmap for these two brands as well. The group is trying to bring Disney Stores, another brand under its fold, to the city.        
	KFC, the worlds largest quick-service chicken restaurant chain with over 12,300 outlets in more than 80 countries, has three outlets in the city  in City Centre, Park Street and New Empire cinema.        
	The next two KFCs are expected to be ready early next year, at the City Centre II and Terminus malls in New Town. These shop-stops will also house new Pizza Hut restaurants, from the same Yum! Brands Inc. To complement the big 100-seater places, the group is planning a string of KFC Express outlets, smaller formats to achieve better penetration across the city.        
	While the City Centre outlet, the first KFC in Calcutta that opened in June 2005, remains a top-performing store with weekend footfall consistently touching 3,000, the 140-seater Park Street restaurant, the city flagship of the chain, has registered a 20 per cent growth over last year, according to the spokesperson.        
	The third city outlet of KFC, which opened in New Empire cinema this January, is operated by a predominantly hearing-impaired staff. This is only the third KFC store globally to be manned thus, after Karachi and Malaysia.        
	For Pizza Hut, the focus will be on the delivery format. The first Pizza Hut Delivery outlet is coming up in Sector V, to be followed by Gariahat and VIP Road. Costa Coffee, has opened its first Calcutta outlet in Mani Square, and deals are being finalised for the next stops in the coffee shop chain. Suitable mall and high-street space is also being scouted for Disney Stores.

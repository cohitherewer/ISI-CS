The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Learning in twilight years
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Learning in twilight years

	NGOs in the city have come together to promote the concept of The University of the Third Age (U3A) to encourage learning by the elderly.        
	U3As are self-help, self-managed lifelong learning cooperatives for retired people. Members share learning experiences.        
	The concept of U3A is very popular in the West. It aims to make senior citizens strive for better quality of life through learning, said Indrani Chakraborty, the director of the Calcutta Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (CMIG).        
	The U3A in Calcutta is part of a nation-wide network striving to improve quality of life for senior citizens.        
	Over 10 NGOs are part of the U3A in Calcutta, including CMIG, Thikana, Federation of Elders Forum, Abakash, Phirey Dekha, Purbachal Bibek Charitable Society and Forum for Retired Officers.        
	Some of the NGOs, like CMIG, specialise in caring for the elderly, while others like Nabaanande Jago, the elders wing of Salt Lake-based NGO Thikana, mainly organises cultural activities. Each NGO brings to the table expertise in a particular area, said Chakraborty.        
	The NGOs are working together to draw up an annual calendar of training, recreational and healthcare activities that the members want to take part in. The network will also set up day-care centres for the elderly.        
	Our members have shown an interest in teaching and working for the underprivileged, said Chakraborty.        
	The NGOs are also trying to popularise the concept of a second career among senior citizens.

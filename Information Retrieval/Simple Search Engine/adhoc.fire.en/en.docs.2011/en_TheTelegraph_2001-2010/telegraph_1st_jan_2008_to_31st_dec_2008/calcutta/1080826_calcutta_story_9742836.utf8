          A STAFF REPORTER                          Serajul Haque, who was shot at on Sunday                                  
	The safest place to run an extortion racket in town seems to be from behind bars.        
	It was just another day in office  also known as Presidency jail  for Bachcha Mahtab, the alleged mastermind behind Sundays attack on a shopowner near New Market for refusing to meet his extortion demands.        
	The hunt is on for the shooter, but Mahtab is not feeling the heat yet. After all, he has the perfect alibi  hes been in behind bars for the past three months.        
	For goons like Mahtab, a prison is now their safehouse. They run the show from behind bars with the collusion of some jail employees. We have gathered specific information and raids are on, said an officer of the anti-rowdy section of the detective department.        
	Serajul Haque is not convinced about police action to bust extortion rackets. The victim had providence and presence of mind  not police cover, despite pleas for protection against extortionists  to thank for his narrow escape.        
	On Sunday morning, a goon allegedly from Mahtabs gang entered his shop on Marquis Street and fired two shots. The first bullet missed him and shattered a glasspane while the 45-year-old managed to duck the second.        
	My wife and children are so scared. Two constables are posted near my shop now but as long as the shooter is at large and Mahtab is calling the shots from jail, the threat will remain, said the shopowner who refused to bow to the extortionists demand for Rs 30,000.        
	Samir Gupta, officer-in-charge of New Market police station, said on Monday that raids were on to arrest the associate of Mahtab.        
	Last week, the prison link in crime syndicates had come into sharp focus when a cellphone was found on extortionist Mohammed Shahjada even as he was entering Alipore jail after being produced in court. A probe revealed that Shahjada had been orchestrating operations from jail.        
	Several criminals are operating from inside jails with the help of their aides. And that includes the G-trinity of the crime world  Gopal Tiwari, Gabbar and Gudda, said an official in Lalbazar, adding that the fear of losing their turf to rivals prompts these kingpins to plot every move from prison.        
	Access to mobile phones and other avenues of communication are provided by a section of corrupt jail officials.        
	Biswanath Chowdhury, the jail minister, told Metro late on Monday that stern actionwould be taken against prison officials found to be hand-in-glove with criminals.        
	I will take up the matter with jail officials at once, said Chowdhury.

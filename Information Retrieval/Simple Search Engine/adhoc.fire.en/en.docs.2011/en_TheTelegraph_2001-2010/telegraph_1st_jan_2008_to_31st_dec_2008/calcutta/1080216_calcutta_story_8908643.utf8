  - Driver of taxi with aged patient alleges assault, cash grab          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A cabbie carrying an aged patient and driving slowly was beaten up by three policemen in plainclothes in front of the emergency ward of SSKM Hospital on Friday afternoon. The officers allegedly took away Rs 4,000 from the taxi driver.        
	Before leaving the spot, the policemen handed over Ramprasad Roy to a traffic sergeant, who charged him with obstructing traffic flow by driving slow. The 45-year-old driver went to Bhowanipore police station to lodge an FIR, but police recorded the incident as a general diary (GD).        
	Roy was taking an aged woman to SSKM around 2pm.She was ill and I was asked to drive slowly to avoid the bumps on the road. A few metres from the hospital, I saw a white Sumo of the traffic police approaching in my rear-view mirror, said Roy.        
	As soon as the taxi stopped in front of the emergency department, Roy said, a policeman opened the door and dragged him out by the collar. The other policeman slapped me and punched me on my chest and hands. They then opened the glove compartment, claiming they wanted to take a look at my cars papers and took out Rs 4,000. I had saved the money to send home to Bihar.        
	According to witnesses, the policemen detained Roy in the hospital while one of them made a call from his cellphone. A traffic sergeant reached the hospital on his motorcycle and booked Roy for driving slowly.        
	Roy took down the number of the Sumo (WB02K 9645) before the policemen left the premises. We asked the officers of Bhowanipore police station to register an FIR and start a case against those who had attacked Roy. But they did not pay heed to our request. They recorded the incident in their GD book, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of Bengal Taxi Association.        
	He approached additional commissioner (III) K. Harirajan, who asked him to send a letter of complaint and promised to look into the matter.        
	No senior officer was available for comment on the incident.

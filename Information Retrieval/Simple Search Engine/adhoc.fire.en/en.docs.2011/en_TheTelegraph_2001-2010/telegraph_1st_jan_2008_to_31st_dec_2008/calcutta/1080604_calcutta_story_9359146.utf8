           Another day on city streets: Two buses caught in a race against time and traffic rules                           
	The death of a patient after a fall from the first floor balcony of Medical College and Hospital raises doubts about the security of patients in state-run hospitals (Murder cry in patient fall, May 8).           
	We often read reports of patients disappearing from government hospitals or committing suicide on the premises. If they were kept under watch, would they have been able to do so? After a patients admission to a hospital, the authorities are responsible not only for his treatment but also his security.           
	Deployment of security guards in hospitals alone is not enough. The authorities must ensure that they do their job. The entrances, to the hospital and the wards, must be manned round-the-clock. Iron grilles should be installed on the balconies and in the windows. The doors to the roof should be locked at all times.           
	The wards must have attached toilets. Patients should be under observation even when they go for walks. Those suffering from mental ailments need special attention.

	Apropos the report Killer driver loses right to advance bail, May 7, I am a casual worker in a small trading agency. I was going to office by bus (route 208, registration No. WBS 5158) on February 12. While I was getting off near Raj Bhavan, a conductor pushed me so that the bus could cross the Old Court House Street-Prinsep Street intersection before the light turned red. As I fell on the road, the bus sped away. A traffic sergeant noted down the number of the bus and sent me to hospital. I am still bedridden with a knee injury and will probably lose my job but the bus is still on the road and no action has been taken against the conductor.

	lThe high court has done the right thing by refusing anticipatory bail to a truck driver involved in a mishap. Drivers involved in accidents must be punished according to the extent of their mistake. The punishment for traffic rule violation should have been made stringent long ago. Lax implementation of rules is behind the sharp rise in number of lives lost on the road.

  Salt Lake                       
	Apropos the report Civic eye on illegal water ferrules, May 13, it is good that the Corporation has finally woken up to revenue leak through illegal water connections. I live in a housing estate near Mukundapur colony and see gallons of filtered water being wasted through tap-less ferrules. Many taxpayers in the area, on the other hand, do not get regular supply. They have appealed to the civic body several times but to no avail. The mayor should install water meters across the city and introduce water tax.             
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur                               
	Apropos the report 70-yr-old dies in fall from flat, May 13, it is unfortunate that a 77-year-old businessman committed suicide despite his psychiatrist warning his son that he might try such a step. Considering that the family is affluent, the son should have employed a 24-hour attendant to look after his father.             
	Rathin Chatterjee,

	Apropos Partial rollback on test, May 8, the attempt at Presidency College to scrap admission tests in some subjects is intriguing. Good dishes cannot be prepared with bad ingredients. Admission tests are partly responsible for the wonderful record of college. Even the National Assessment and Accreditation Council encourages colleges to hold admission tests for undergraduate courses.

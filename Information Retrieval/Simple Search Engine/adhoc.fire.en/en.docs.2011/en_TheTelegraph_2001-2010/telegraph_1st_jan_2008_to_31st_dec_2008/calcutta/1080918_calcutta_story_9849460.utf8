          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mohammad Azharuddin                                  
	An undertrial in his mid-20s died in Presidency jail on Tuesday night, hours after a warder allegedly hit him on the head with a baton during a clash between two groups of inmates.        
	Mohammad Azharuddin, facing attempt to murder and dacoity charges, was administered two stitches on the forehead, but his condition worsened and he died in the jail hospital around 10.30pm.        
	The Ekbalpore resident was arrested in September 2006 for firing in front of a central Calcutta bar.        
	His father Mohammad Fakruddin, who came to know about his sons death on Wednesday morning, lodged complaints with Hastings police station and the state human rights commission.        
	He also met inspector-general (prisons) B.D. Sharma and demanded stringent action against the warders responsible for the barbaric act.        
	Trouble broke out on Thursday afternoon when Gudda, a gangster lodged in the jail, learnt that he and some of his accomplices, including Azharuddin, would be shifted to Dum Dum Central jail.         
	The decision was taken following a clash between Guddas men and those of Ramua, another gangster, on the jail premises.        
	Sources said Gudda was scared of going to the Dum Dum jail, as he had once been bashed up there by some henchmen of haathkata Dilip and Sheikh Binod.        
	A prison van came to Presidency jail around 3pm, when the inmates are allowed a walkabout, to take Gudda and his gang to Dum Dum.        
	But Gudda refused to budge. The situation worsened when some accomplices of Gabbar, now lodged in Alipore Central jail, demanded that Gudda and his men be immediately shifted to the Dum Dum jail.        
	The two groups clashed, armed with bricks and iron rods they collected from a construction site on the jail premises. The authorities rang the emergency alarm and more than 200 warders launched a baton-charge to disperse the warring inmates. Azharuddin suffered a blow to his head, said a jail official.        
	The clash left 55 people, including 32 jail officials, injured.        
	Inspector-general (prison) Sharma said Azharuddin complained of a headache around 10pm. He was taken to the jail hospital, where doctors suggested that he be shifted to another hospital. But he died around 10.45pm, before the jail staff could move him out.        
	Jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury said: We are yet to ascertain whether Azharuddin was injured when the warders tried to restore order or during the clash among the inmates. The inspector-general (prison) will conduct a probe.

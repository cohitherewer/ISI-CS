The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ...   Gopalpur-on-Sea
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Next weekend you can be at ...   Gopalpur-on-Sea
                                                                    
	Gopalpur-on-Sea offers the triple treat of sun, surf and sand minus the madding crowd of popular sea resorts like Puri and Digha. The town, spread around lagoons, is about 15 km from Berhampore, the headquarters of Ganjam district. It was once a part of the ancient kingdom of Kalinga that emperor Asoka had conquered.        
	The district changed hands several times since then. The rulers included the Andhra kings of Vengi and Rajendra Chola. A series of smaller dynasties followed the Cholas. In the 16th Century, the Qutb Shahis of Golkonda conquered Ganjam and when their kingdom fell to the army of Aurangzeb, the region became a part of the rapidly disintegrating Mughal empire.        
	The Coromandal coast soon emerged as the arena where the British and the French fought to extend their dominance in the country. Ganjam was incorporated in the Madras Presidency.        
	The empires and dynasties have hardly left an imprint on Gopalpur. There are no grand monuments, battlefields or even an edict to proclaim the passage of eminent personage. The historical remains are rather modest. An abandoned, roofless house with mock classical columns, ghostly arches, gaping windows and an abundance of weeds and creepers remind one of intrepid European traders who arrived in the town in diligent pursuit of profit.         
	The sea is relatively smooth in Gopalpur, which led to its development as a port under the British. Steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company and ships used to dock in Gopalpur round the year, though it offered virtually no shelter. Grains, pulses, hides, timber, hemp, coir, oil seeds and dried fish were sent to other coastal towns in India and to Sri Lanka, London and Antwerp.        
	By the early 20th Century, the development of the railway network led to a decline in the importance of the port. It withered away leaving behind a fishing hamlet and the houses of a handful of coastguard officials.        
	At one end of the beach, sheltered behind fronds of coconut and palm trees, is a single-storey colonial building with balconies on three sides. The fourth side dips gently into the sea. The garden in the courtyard is dotted with palm trees, their dark leaves forming intricate patterns against the blue sky.        
	A rough promenade lies above the beach. At its highest point, where the road bifurcates, are tea stalls and small shops selling curios. Deeper inland, buildings lie in a haphazard manner. Further down, amid modest fields and palm trees, theres a small village where the Telugu-speaking fisher folk (the district belonged to Andhra Pradesh before Independence) live.         
	Gopalpur derives its name from the local deity, Venugopal. The charming temple is close to the palm tree-lined backwaters. Thanks to regular repairs, the whitewashed structure does not betray its age.        
	Life for the fisher folk is hard. The tourists may enjoy fishing during daytime and take snaps for the album, but these small men with pointed caps, resembling gnomes, venture to the seas at night on primitive boats. They come back at daybreak with their meagre haul, which their patient wives sort and place in cane baskets that are then sent to Berhampore.        
	Tourists staying more than a weekend can undertake a short trip to Taptapani, which is about 65 km from Gopalpur. The place is famous for a hot spring with a high sulphur content. The Orissa Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC) has a comfortable rest house on a hillock. There is an infrequent bus service from Berhampore but cars are easily available on hire.   
	Going   
	Gopalpur-on-Sea is just 15 km from Berhampore, an important station on the Calcutta-Chennai railway route of South Eastern Railway. Situated on NH No. 5, Berhampore is also connected with important spots in the district and the state.   
	Buses are available from Berhampore to Gopalpur. Autorickshaws and taxis are available more easily. The nearest airport is Bhubaneswar, about 200 km away. Small chartered planes can land on an air strip at Rangailunda, only 6 km from Gopalpur   
	Staying   
	Hotel rooms are available at reasonable rates throughout the year. There is also a circuit house, an inspection bungalow and a youth hostel. Book in advance to put up at the government-run lodging facilities. Holiday homes are also available .      (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER PARAG BANERJEE FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

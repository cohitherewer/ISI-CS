The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tee-off tigers
                                                                                                                   Tee-off tigers
                              
	Picture perfect : A child in traditional Rajasthani attire for a fancy dress contest in school. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                
	Sachin and Sourav have competition. Not from Dhoni and Yuvi, but from Tiger Woods and Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, for some students are giving the national obsession a miss and ditching the cricket bat in favour of the golf club.        
	Many children in the city have taken to golf with unexpected fervour. And with city golf courses opening doors to non-members for use of the greens, the game is accessible to far more students now than ever.        
	Take eight-year-old Siddhi Kapoor. She and her elder sister Esha practise about five days a week at Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC). These students of Pratt Memorial School dont find it difficult to balance studies with practice and the occasional city hopping for tournaments. It helps that their father is also an avid golfer. Initially I felt I would not be able to play as the clubs are too heavy. Now I am used to it, grins Esha.        
	He wants both our daughters to take up the game professionally, chips in their mother Bhavna. At eight, Siddhi is one of the youngest golfers in the junior circuit.         
	Then there is 10-year-old Viraj Madappa, who plays at the sub-junior level in the national circuit. The Class IV student of Don Bosco, Park Circus who started playing when he was eight, finished 2007 ranked sixth. Another golf enthusiast is 10-year-old Aman Singhal. Unlike Esha and Siddhi, both Viraj and Aman come from families that have little knowledge of the game. During a horse-riding lesson, he noticed people playing golf and asked what the game was, recalls Amans mother. Aman was so insistent that he be allowed a swing on the course that his parents enrolled him for a once-a-week class.        
	What his parents dismissed initially as passing fancy developed into far more. Aman would come home complaining that with 10 people sharing his slot, there was little time for him to learn. That was when his parents realised that it was more than a whim, and enrolled Aman in another course where practice was more intense. Now Aman does not hesitate to correct his mother when she calls a golf club a stick.        
	I love seeing how far the ball goes and the height to which it rises after a shot, says Aman. His favourite shots are the drive and the putt, but it is Tiger Woodss chip shot that he loves the most.         
	Viraj was even more strident in his demands. Watching people play after finishing his swimming lessons at Tollygunge Club, he decided that he wanted to play too. He doesnt mind waking up at 5.30am to study, just so he can play.        
	Ashit Luthra, vice president, Indian Golf Union (IGU), said the organisation plans to concentrate on promoting golf amongst youngsters for the next three years. Kids can represent their country in tournaments like the Asia-Pacific Juniors, British Juniors and the Junior World Championships at San Diego. Many join in the Under-11 category. Although Calcutta is believed to be the cheapest place for the sport, there are constraints of space and access, with only two golf courses here as opposed to 16 in Delhi.         
	Golf isnt much of a spectator sport either, which can be a drawback in terms of popularity, feels golfer Indrajit Bhalotia, who heads the Eastern Zone Indian Golf Union Junior Programme and the Tollygunge Club Junior Programme. Bhalotia coaches over 200 kids at RCGC and Tollygunge Club as part of the Protouch Golf Academy, which he heads. The academy also runs sponsored programmes for promising golfers from underprivileged backgrounds.         
	Samaresh Sardar, 20, has spent four years as a caddy at RCGC. It was after he won the clubs caddy tournament two years ago that he got sponsorship from the IGU. This has helped Sardar  who dropped out of school after the Madhyamik  to pursue his dreams of turning a professional in the next few years. His favourite golfer is Chowrasia, who also started out at RCGC as a caddy. For Sardar, who lives in Madartala near Golf Garden, golf is also his window to the world. Thanks to the game, I have seen many places in India. It would not have been possible otherwise, he smiles.

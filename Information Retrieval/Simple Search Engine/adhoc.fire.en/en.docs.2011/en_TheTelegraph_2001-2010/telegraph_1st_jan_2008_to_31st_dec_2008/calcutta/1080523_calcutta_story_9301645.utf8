The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bare at the top after two Norwesters 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bare at the top after two Norwesters 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND ZEESHAN JAWED                           Norwesters on two successive days last week felled or damaged more than 1,500 trees in the 187-sq-km municipal area, reducing the citys scanty green cover. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Calcuttas thin canopy of green just got thinner.        
	Norwesters on successive days last weekend uprooted or damaged more than 1,500 trees within the 187-sq-km municipal area, leaving an already green-deficient city shorn of the sparse foliage that existed in parts.        
	The green canopy is estimated to be a mere nine per cent of the municipal area, which is far below the national standard of 15 per cent or more. It was 5.7 per cent in 1963, but the city was then much smaller. What it means is that the green cover has increased by only 3.3 per cent in over four decades, as opposed to the manifold growth in population.        
	We have lost more trees in two Norwesters this month than at any time in previous years. We need to plant more trees in collaboration with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and NGOs, a senior forest department official said.         
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the CMC would convene a meeting with officials of the forest and environment departments to draw up a plan to fell Norwester-weakened trees that were a threat to life and property before embarking on a regeneration plan.        
	Experts attribute the decline in green cover to faulty selection of tree species. Most of the trees planted in recent years are those with surface-spread roots. When there are metalled roads on one side and concrete buildings on the other, a narrow strip of soil under the pavement is the only space available for a roadside tree to spread its roots. Once it goes, the tree can neither bear its weight nor bear the brunt of a storm.         
	The chief manager of information and public relations in the CMC, Amalendu Bhattacharya, admitted that trees had been planted along roads without ascertaining whether they were suitable for a particular area. Most of these green campaigns are just for publicity. They are also responsible for the concentration high-risk roadside trees.        
	Another reason for the declining green cover is felling by unscrupulous builders and advertising agencies. Many outdoor advertising agencies have been found to be poisoning trees by sprinkling copper sulphate at the roots. The entire stretch of Maniktala Main Road was lined with flowery trees a few years ago. All the trees disappeared over time, making way for huge billboards, Debabrata Sen, a resident of Kankurgachhi, said.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay said the new regeneration campaign would be a simultaneous process of felling a weakened tree that poses a risk to people and planting those that are suitable for the city.         
	The CMCs deputy chief engineer (civil), Soumitra Bhattacharya, said no organisation had yet counted the number of roadside trees in the city.

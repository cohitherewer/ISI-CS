                                                                                                            Clear sky signals cold spell 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The western disturbance that caused rain on Friday and Saturday has moved away from the city. With the sky clearing on Sunday, the next couple of days are likely to be colder.         
	We expect the minimum temperature to go down from Monday. The chill is expected to continue for the next 48 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section of Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The sun breaking through the clouds will push up the maximum temperature, added Debnath.         
	On Sunday, the maximum temperature was 21.9 degrees Celsius. It was six degrees below normal, but around four degrees higher than the maximum temperatures on Friday and Saturday.        
	The minimum temperature on Sunday was 15.3 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.         
	The temperature will dip on Monday as the north wind is blowing in unhindered. Besides, a cold-wave condition is prevailing in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Saurashtra, said a Met department official.        
	The western disturbance, laden with moisture, had caused the rain. The cloudy sky brought down the maximum temperature. The maximum temperature on Friday and Saturday was around 17 degrees Celsius, which was 10 degrees below normal and hardly two degrees more than the minimum temperature.        
	The small difference between the maximum and the minimum temperatures was making us feel cold, said the Met official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Simple, startling images
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Simple, startling images
										      eyewitness                        A painting by Sekhar Baran Karmakar				                           
	Male nudes are the protagonists of Sekhar Baran Karmakars exhibition of watercolours on paper that ended at Gandhara Art Gallery on Saturday. Its title and the text in the catalogue with their references to theory are preposterous and pretentious. If only these artists realised how inane they sound. But the actual works are straightforward enough.        
	The man with elongated limbs, dressed in psychedelic prints tries to touch a great ball of fire, plays with his innards lying face upwards. Sometimes he wears his innards like hair in Gorgonic profusion.        
	Like the powerful male nudes in Blakes paintings, the men are well muscled. In a painting, one man tears apart anothers torso.        
	Violence comes to the fore in another large painting. In a take on the Chhinnamasta icon, a man holds his head in hand. His tongue sticks out obscenely, while blood, gushing out from a jungle of green inside his chest, spurts out of his throat.        
	Colour is applied sparingly, each stroke well thought out, and the tones are also well chosen, almost like illustrations. However, much action is noticeable in these works. The male protagonists hurtle through space, head over heels, in the manner of the rebellious angel being discarded from heaven. They also appear as trapeze artistes along with their female counterparts.        
	Some of the compositions with their restrained use of colour are beautiful. The studies of heads with brains exposed are quite powerful. There is an eye-catching image of a naked woman in two halves trying to shove her hand into her heart through the dividing line.        
	Karmakar is a creator of images that can startle although he deploys the simplest of devices.              
	A group of 14 young artists got together to hold an exhibition that ended on Sunday at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture. Their effort notwithstanding, it is difficult to write a single nice thing about most of them for they are cliched and represent the death of imagination.        
	Without naming any one of them in particular, one of the participants tries to appropriate a style that is popular among artists who want to make it big overnight. One can feel ones temper rise as one views the infant with a mouse dangling from its arms.        
	Another set of drawings is bound to recall the images of a sensitive artist and teacher who died relatively young. Even the watercolours of Calcutta tourist spots are not really up to the mark.        
	Akashdip Kundus deities who are puppets are marginally better in terms of composition and application of colour. It is a pity that so much energy was wasted on an exhibition that has little to recommend it.       SOUMITRA DAS

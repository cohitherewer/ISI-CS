                      Ode to a vibrant city                    A city that forever mixes cultures, cuisines, religions and languages, Hyderabad is the perfect destination for the modern cosmopolitan who also values the heritage of the past. A dazzling collection that captures the essence of the city, The Untold Charminar: Writings on Hyderabad, edited by Syeda Imam, offers glimpses of the various strands that go into its making  fact and legend, hi-tech lifestyle and old world charm, eccentricity and intrigue, sophisticated calm and the fury of rebellion. In it, readers can discover a city they want to explore, as Sarojini Naidu, Sir Mark Tully and William Dalrymple rub shoulders with Ian Austin, Meenakshi Mukherjee and Anees Jung, regaling them with their feast of hard facts and hearsay. Filmmakers Shyam Benegal and Nagesh Kukunoor paint their vivid memories of home; also, poets, statesmen, academics and aficionados hold forth on the completely different Hyderabad each experienced. To celebrate the publication of the book, Penguin Books India and Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta host a programme that promises to stimulate the intellect. Pandit Vijay Kichlu will read from the work of Hyderabadi poets. Dhritiman Chaterji and Syeda Imam will participate in a discussion on City as Stimulus, moderated by Anjum Katyal. Also, Zafar Hais documentary, Hyderabad  A Place in the Heart, will be screened.

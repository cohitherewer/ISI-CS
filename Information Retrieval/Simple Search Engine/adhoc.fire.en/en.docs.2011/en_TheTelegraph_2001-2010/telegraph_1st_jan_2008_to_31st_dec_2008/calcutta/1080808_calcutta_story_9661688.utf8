          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Junior doctors on Thursday threatened to resume the ceasework if the health department did not specify details of the stipend hike.        
	If we are not informed of the stipend structure within four days, we will be forced to think about resuming our agitation, said a junior doctor, who was among the 18 who met finance minister Asim Dasgupta at the Writers Buildings and submitted a memorandum on Thursday.        
	Medical education director S.N. Banerjee said it was impossible to meet the doctors demand. We will need at least seven to 10 days to spell out the exact stipend structure. A review panel has recommended over 50 per cent hike in the stipend for junior doctors.        
	SSKM trouble: The All India Democratic Students Organisation demanded reopening of the hostel that was shut down on July 25 after a clash among students. Before we open the hostel, the students will have to give an undertaking that they would not take part in violence again, said Pradip Kumar Mitra, the director of IPGMER (SSKM).

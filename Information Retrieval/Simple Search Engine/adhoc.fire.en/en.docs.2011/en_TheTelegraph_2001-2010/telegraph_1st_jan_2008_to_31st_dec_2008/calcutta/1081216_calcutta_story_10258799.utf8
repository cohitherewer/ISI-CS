The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citys unguarded gateways
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citys unguarded gateways
                                          
	The Mumbai siege has prompted extra surveillance at railway stations, airports and major bus terminuses but the launch ghats along the Hooghly are as neglected as ever. Metro runs a check              
	Chandpal/Babughat        
	Ferry ghats: Two        
	Daily footfall: 80,000        
	What we saw: Two ticket checkers and two helps were all the authorities could think of to keep the citys vital entry point safe. With no policeman or private guard around, passengers can just walk in with their bags, unscanned.        
	There were several wooden structures on the adjoining banks, large stretches of which were covered with bushes. In the absence of any surveillance, these could be the ideal spots to hide explosives. One just needs to buy a ticket of Rs 4 and can spend as much time on the jetty as one wants to.        
	Voices: The government is stepping up security at airports and railway stations but no one cares for people like us who take the ferry, said Somenath Chakraborty, a resident of Salkia. Often we find bags lying unattended or abandoned on the jetty for the whole day.              
	Fairley ghat        
	Ferry ghats: Two        
	Daily footfall: 25,000        
	What we saw: The ghat frequented by tourists and a large number of Calcuttans for a cruise down the Hooghly doesnt even have an apology of security. Millennium Park and Floatel, which draw huge footfall, are close by, increasing the security risk of the ghat.        
	Voices: We do not have any arrangement to check the bags of the passengers or keep an eye on them. Police have asked us to install closed-circuit television cameras on the banks. The higher authorities will have to take a call, said Krishnendu Dutta, an employee of the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC), which maintains the Hooghly ghats.              
	Bagbazar ghat        
	Ferry ghat: One        
	Daily footfall: 12,000        
	What we saw: A mattress and a stuffed gunny bag were lying unattended on the jetty for hours. State surface transport corporation employees posted at the ghat had no clue whose belongings they were. After much asking, a local resident said fishermen might have left them on the jetty. No cop or guard could be spotted around the ghat, used by a large number of north Calcuttans.        
	Voices: Two policemen were posted at the ghat immediately after the Mumbai terror attacks. After that, it was back to square one, said Achintya Chowdhury, who runs a stationery shop near the bank.              
	Howrah Launchghat        
	Ferry ghats: Three        
	Footfall: 120,000        
	What we saw: Two armed cops were manning the jetty but they couldnt care less about the three gunny bags lying unattended close by and a stuffed nylon bag under a surface transport corporation booth.        
	Voices: Cops have been deployed since the Mumbai siege but they are not carrying basic security gadgets like hand-held metal detectors. All they do is frisk passengers randomly, said Kaustav Mallik, a second-year student of Calcutta University, who lives in the vicinity.              
	Officialspeak                
	We have started random frisking with help from officers of North Port and South Port police stations. The Hooghly Jalapath Paribahan Nigam, which runs the ferry service, has been asked to take necessary security measures, said a senior officer of River Traffic Police.        
	Nigam chairman Lagandeo Singh said: At a board meeting a few days ago, we had decided to strengthen security by installing closed-circuit television cameras and door-frame metal detectors on the ghats. Our employees will be provided with hand-held metal detectors. The new measures will be implemented this month.

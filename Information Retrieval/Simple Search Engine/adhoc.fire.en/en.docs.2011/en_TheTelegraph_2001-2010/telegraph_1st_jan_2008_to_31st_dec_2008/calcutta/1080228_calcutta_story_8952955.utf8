                      Inspired impressions                    An artist who is forever re-inventing himself with a splurge of fresh ideas, Dhiraj Chowdhurys creations are true reflections of his eternal youthful spirit. In A New Fulfilment, the ongoing exhibition of his works, his drawings on paper are a compelling blend of the past and present. On the one hand, his craftsmanship appears to grow out of a storehouse of memories, taking on forms where lines are the dominating force. On the other, his forms are adapted to newer themes with consummate ease and fluency, sustaining a speed that is integral to the magic of his lines. The show is an endorsement of the veteran artists most treasured convictions. Yet, it also offers inspiring new insights into a mind that is restlessly engaged in discovering and experiencing a new kind of achievement.            Event: Drawings and paintings by Dhiraj Chowdhury When: Till March 2; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clean fuel pipe dream for autos
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We Ask You Answer      Clean fuel pipe dream for autos
          Todays question: Are you willing to pay a bit more for autorickshaws running on clean fuel? More responses next week

	Calcuttas autorickshaws ply on fixed fares and are cheaper than the ones in Delhi which run on meter. Compared to other means of transport they provide open and airy, swift and less noisy travel experience. But they are more polluting at the same time. They cover long distances so increasing the fare by a few paise should not be a problem.               
	P.B. SAHA,
  Salt Lake        
	Autorickshaws have been singled out as the prime culprit for spreading pollution in the city. The ones with two-stroke engines should be stopped completely by December 2008. In view of the health hazards posed by poisonous emissions from the three-wheelers, I would surely opt for the ones running on clean oil even if it would cost a bit more. After all, every health-conscious commuter would like to stay away from pollution-related diseases.                Priyanka Dutta, 
  Nagerbazar         
	Yes, I am willing to pay a little more for autorickshaws running on clean fuel. Health always comes first and if my health deteriorates for my saving a few rupees then that is not worth it. Ultimately the amount that I will be saving by paying less fare will have to be invested in treating myself for any respiratory problems that I may develop.               
	Diptimoy De, 
  Barisha        
	It is not that easy to reform autorickshaw drivers. In the past, the pollution control board and the state transport department have tried to discipline them without success. So an enhanced fare will not make them change the quality of fuel they are using. It will only push up their profits.               
	Paramananda Pal , 
  Karaya Road         
	Even if passengers are willing to shell out a bit more, the autorickshaws will not desist from using the spurious and cheap oil. In spite of the rapid spread of pollution-related diseases, the police and the government are not bothered. The media campaigns have no effect. Let the citizens fall prey to some dreadful disease and die.               
	Shiv Shanker Almal, 
  Lower Rawdon Street         
	To pay a little more for using clean fuel in autorickshaws is acceptable if such a thing happens. I think that the police allow them to ply to provide employment to the ruling party cadres.        
	A.S. MEHTA, 
  New Alipore         
	Certainly. But it would be difficult to judge whether clean fuel is being used or not unless the pollution under control certificate is displayed prominently by the auto drivers. Such a step would also help eliminate junked autos from plying on the city streets.              
	Suparna Kundu, 
  Dum Dum         
	The autorickshaw drivers are using illegal fuel to reduce costs. We know the negative effects of using katatel. So we are ready to pay a bit more for them to use clean fuel. We want to preserve ourselves and the environment, dont we?

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Varicose veins                                  
	Retired Hooghly schoolteacher Shobha Dey (name changed) endured pain and itching in her ankles for four years before being diagnosed with a disease that causes enlargement of the veins.         
	An uncomplicated, non-invasive procedure called endovenous laser ablation that is now routinely performed in hospitals in the city spared Dey the trouble of undergoing surgery and remaining in bed for a few weeks.         
	This is the best possible treatment for varicose veins. Laser waves pass through the skin and are absorbed by the targeted blood vessel. The inflated vein gradually disappears, leaving the skin intact, interventional radiologist Sibsankar Dalai said.        
	Varicose vein syndrome is a common affliction, though many make the mistake of treating it as a cosmetic disorder. The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, but varicose veins occur elsewhere, too. Apart from pain and discomfort, there is the danger of a vein bursting and leading to internal bleeding.        
	The causes range from standing for long periods without a break, pregnancy and prolonged consumption of birth-control pills to genetic flaws.        
	Endovenous laser ablation not only seals abnormal veins permanently, but also enables a patient to get back to a normal routine in quick time.        
	There are no surgical cuts and the recovery period is short. A patient can return to active life within a week, Dalai said. The possibility of varicose veins recurring after laser treatment is much less compared to conventional surgery.        
	Bhabotosh Biswas, the head of cardio-thoracic and vascular surgery at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, echoed him. Surgery is successful in selective cases, but non-surgical methods are more effective.        
	Before the advent of laser ablation, an invasive procedure called vein stripping was widely used as a cure for the disease. But it carried risks like the recurrence of varicose veins and scarring.

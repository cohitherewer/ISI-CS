          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The father of an undertrial who died in jail after allegedly being hit by a warder has accused policemen of demanding Rs 1 lakh to release his son.        
	Mohammad Fakruddin lodged a complaint with deputy commissioner II (detective department) D.K. Adak early this month. He was accompanied by Sujata Bhadra, of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights.        
	Two policemen from the dacoity section of the detective department visited my house after my sons arrest in September (2006). They asked me to pay Rs 1 lakh to secure the release of my son. They threatened to implicate my son if the amount was not paid, Fakruddin wrote in his letter to the officer.        
	In September 2008, 24-year-old Mohammad Azharuddin died after a warder allegedly hit him on the head with a baton during a clash between two groups of inmates at Presidency jail.         
	The Ekbalpore resident was arrested for firing in front of a central Calcutta bar.        
	I expressed my inability to pay such a huge amount and requested the policemen not to implicate my son. But they said if the amount was not paid, my son would have to bear the consequences, Fakruddin said in his complaint.        
	Adak said: I have ordered an inquiry into the matter. The allegations have not been substantiated.        
	After his sons death, Fakruddin had lodged a complaint with Hastings police station and the state human rights commission accusing the jail warders of killing him.

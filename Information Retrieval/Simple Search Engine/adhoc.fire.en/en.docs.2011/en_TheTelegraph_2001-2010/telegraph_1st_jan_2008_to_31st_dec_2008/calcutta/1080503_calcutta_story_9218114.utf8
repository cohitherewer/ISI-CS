                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Derailment to disrupt trains
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Some long-distance trains from Howrah will be cancelled and some trains are likely to arrive late on Saturday because of the derailment of a goods train in South Eastern Railway (SER)s Chakradharpur division on Friday afternoon.        
	The Howrah-Sambalpur Ispat Express and Howrah-Barbil Jan Shatabdi Express, due to leave on Saturday, have already been cancelled.        
	Nine wagons of the goods train derailed between Rajkharswan and Mahalimarup stations around 1.40pm, disrupting train services on the Howrah-Mumbai route, according to SER officials.        
	Two tracks are blocked by the derailed train. Efforts are on to clear at least one of the tracks. Trains to and from Howrah are either being diverted or short-terminated, said an SER spokesperson.        
	Geetanjali Express, Mumbai-Howrah Mail and other long-distance trains on the Mumbai-Howrah route could be delayed by a few hours, said an SER official. Local train services in the Howrah-Kharagpur and other sections of SER from Howrah will not be affected.        
	On Friday afternoon, Howrah-Mumbai Mail and Mumbai-bound Geetanjali Express were diverted from Tatanagar to the Chandil-Muri-Hatia-Rourkela route. The Shalimar-Lokmanya Tilak Terminal Mumbai Express was also diverted to the same route.        
	Sambalpur-Howrah Ispat Express was short-terminated at Chakradharpur station. Barbil-Howrah Jan Shatabdi Express and Howrah-Adra-Chakradharpur passenger were cancelled on Friday.        
	Cranes are being used to clear the tracks. But it might take long before trains can be run through that section, added the official.

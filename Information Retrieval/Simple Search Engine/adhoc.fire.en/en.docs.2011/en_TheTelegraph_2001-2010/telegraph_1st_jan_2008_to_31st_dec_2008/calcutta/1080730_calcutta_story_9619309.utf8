	The undergraduate students at SSKM Hospital who were ordered out of the campus on July 25 following a clash will have to stay away from their hostels at least till the second week of August.        
	The college council of the hospital decided on Tuesday that the 330-odd students would be kept under observation for a week after the classes resume on August 6.        
	If their conduct is found to be satisfactory, they would be allowed to return to their hostels after submitting an undertaking that they would not indulge in violence, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM Hospital.        
	Two rival unions  Students Federation of India (SFI) and All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO)  fought with rods and batons over enrolment of members on July 24. Classes were suspended indefinitely and the students were ordered out.        
	Rathin Biswas, the unit secretary of the SFIs SSKM unit, said the union was yet to receive any intimation from the college authorities. We have to discuss the matter before issuing a statement.        
	AIDSOs Gourango Pramanik alleged that the college council had taken a one-sided view of the campus unrest. We protest the decision to reopen the college without punishing the SFI supporters who broke the laptops of three of our supporters.        
	The union, planning to appeal to the authorities to revise the decision, will ask its members to join classes on August 6. We have missed enough classes, said Pramanik.

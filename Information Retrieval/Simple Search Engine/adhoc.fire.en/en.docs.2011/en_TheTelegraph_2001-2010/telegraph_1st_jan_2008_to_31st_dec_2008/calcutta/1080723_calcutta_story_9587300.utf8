The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb hoax in girls school
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bomb hoax in girls school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Panic gripped a girls school on Tuesday morning after an anonymous caller claimed a bomb would explode inside the building within an hour. It turned out to be a hoax.        
	According to authorities of National High School for Girls on Sarat Bose Road, office-in-charge Gauri Ramnath received the call around 10.30am. A male caller said a bomb planted inside the school would soon explode, blowing the building to bits.        
	Students from Lower KG to Class XII study in the school, which is affiliated to the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. Around 1,500 girls were present in school at that time, the authorities said.         
	After receiving the call, Ramnath immediately alerted the school authorities. Lake police station was informed and the cops, in turn, contacted the bomb disposal squad at Lalbazar.         
	By the time the bomb squad and cops arrived, the school had started evacuating the premises.         
	In the midst of mounting panic, we called up parents of the junior students and asked them to take the kids home, a teacher said.         
	Senior students were asked to take care of the younger girls whose parents could not be contacted. Teachers were sent to all classrooms to ensure that no one had been left behind. It all happened quite smoothly, considering how scary the situation was, she added.        
	Even after searching the premises with detectors and sniffer dogs, the bomb squad failed to locate any explosives. So, classes resumed after being suspended for two-and-a-half hours.        
	Not willing to take a chance, the bomb squad also ran a thorough check on the National High School for Boys, located on Hazra Road. No bomb was found there either.        
	The police have not been able to identify the caller yet. We are trying to trace the caller, said an officer.

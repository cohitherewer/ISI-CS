	The citys second Automobile Fair will be held from March 16 to 23 at the helipad ground of Salt Lake stadium. The first was held in 2004.        
	A host of car makers and dealers will set up stalls in the fair, being organised by The Pavilion, in collaboration with West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (WBTIDC), at an expense of Rs 10 lakh.        
	Visitors will be eager to catch a glimpse of Tata Nano  it has been displayed only once till date, at Delhi Auto Expo 2008  but there is no word from the makers yet that they will bring the car to the city.        
	Tata Motors is surely participating in the fair, but I am not sure whether they will bring their Nano. We hope they do, said Dhiman Mukherjee, the managing director of WBTIDC, on Tuesday.        
	Among the other participants are Maruti Suzuki (co-sponsors of the fair), Hyundai Motors, Hindustan Motors, General Motors, Imperial Honda, Auto Bajaj, Ashok Leyland, Tata International, Lancer, Toyota, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.        
	Four and two-wheelers apart, a number of stalls will showcase heavy and medium vehicles, battery-powered motorcycles, cars and buses, sports cars, modified cars and vintage cars. In all, there will be 22 to 30 stalls.        
	There will be a separate arena for old or used cars, plus financing options, said Swapan Kumar Mitra, the CEO of The Pavilion and secretary of Automobile Fair, 2008.        
	The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers will also be present at the fair, holding talks and seminars on road safety, said Mukherjee. The fair will see participation from auto accessory and spare parts manufacturers. Stalls for tyre tubes, electrical items, music systems, car fittings and dcor items will be accommodated in the AC hangar.

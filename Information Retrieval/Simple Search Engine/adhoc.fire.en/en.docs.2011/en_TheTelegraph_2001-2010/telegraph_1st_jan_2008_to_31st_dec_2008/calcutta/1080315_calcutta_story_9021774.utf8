                                                                                                               The City Diary
                A traffic constable of the Headquarters traffic guard caught a cellphone thief after chasing him down Mangoe Lane, only to lose his own cellphone from his shirt pocket. Constable Indrajit Dutta, after grappling with the thief, saw his wallet lying on the road. His cellphone was missing. Some passerby may have walked away with it, police said. Dutta, however, recovered a phone from the thiefs pocket and returned it to its owner.    A hoax call triggered a bomb scare on the Mumbai-bound Geetanjali Express at Howrah station on Friday afternoon. A man, who identified himself as Samir Saha, called the commercial control of South Eastern Railway at Kharagpur at 1.55pm, saying there was a bomb planted on the train. The train, scheduled to leave Howrah at 2.10pm, was waiting at platform No. 21. A search was launched immediately by the bomb disposal squad with sniffer dogs.

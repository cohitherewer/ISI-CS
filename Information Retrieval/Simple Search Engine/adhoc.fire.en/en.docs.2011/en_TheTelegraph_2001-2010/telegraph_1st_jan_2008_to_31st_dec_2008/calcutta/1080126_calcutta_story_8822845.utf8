	Emaar-MGF Land Pvt Ltd, which is bringing JW Marriott and Holiday Inn on the 6.24-acre Bypass plot it picked up for a record Rs 213 crore, is looking to further consolidate its hospitality presence in Calcutta and the East.
    
	A joint venture between Emaar Properties PJSC of Dubai and New Delhi-based MGF Development Limited of India, the company is planning to introduce the Formule I brand and Premier Travel Inn hotels in the east. This is part of the groups pan-India plans of rolling out 30,000 new hotel rooms by 2015.
    
	Emaar-MGF has formed a 50:50 JV with Accor for the Formule 1 brand to build 100 hotels by 2015, and also tied up with PTI, part of Whitbread, the UKs largest hospitality brand, to bring in 80 more hotels within the same timeframe. The market buzz is that the company has signed an agreement with Royal Calcutta Turf Club to set up and run five-star rooms on the RCTCs Russell Street premises on a profit-sharing basis.
    
	Emaar-MGF, planning to raise Rs 7,075 crore through an IPO, is also looking at a retail address in Calcutta by replicating its Mall of the City retail concept already rolled out in Punjab, Hyderabad, Lucknow and west Delhi. The Mall of Kolkata will have large multiple anchors and multiplex screens, besides a host of F amp;B options. 
    
	According to sources, Emaar-MGF is also looking at two hotel properties in Shillong, and will expand to markets like Siliguri and Bhubaneswar, marking the groups entry into the value segment in the region.
    
	While Emaar-MGF is primarily in the business of development of properties in the residential, commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, it has identified healthcare, education and infrastructure as business lines for future growth, and Bengal features prominently in the roadmap.

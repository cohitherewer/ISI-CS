										      onthespot - Madan Mohan   Burman street                                          88A MM Burman Street, declared unsafe by the CMC. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha		    
	Madan Mohan Burman Street, which ambles past a garbage dump close to MG Road Metro station, is scarred by a cluster of shabby, rundown buildings. The serpentine road  reduced to a lane by hawkers squatting on the pavements, and autorickshaws and cyclerickshaws parked haphazardly  is home to about 50 buildings declared unsafe by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).         
	The 50 unsafe buildings are beyond repair. This apart, there are about 150 houses that are 80-90 years old. These have not been identified as unsafe yet, but they are in dire straits too, said local MLA Mohammad Sohrab.                 
	Peeve point        
	Though MM Burman Street is a vital part of the citys business hub, theres no mad scramble among landsharks to pull down the dilapidated houses and build highrises. Because no one wants to get involved in the complex landlord-tenant equation. Each of the four or five-storeyed buildings houses about 20 to 80 tenants. As the rent has remained at Rs 100-Rs 400 over the decades, few landlords have thought it wise to spend on the buildings upkeep.         
	With such low rent in the Burrabazar area, traders are queuing up to take over the inner chambers by paying a salaami, adds RJDs Sohrab.        
	The tenants, on their part, are only too happy to strike a good deal and move out of the zone that has over the years morphed from a residential area into a business zone.         
	The takers, mostly traders in cloth and fruit, are not bothered by the threat of crumbling roofs, unlike the tenants.         
	Earlier, there were about 80 tenants in our building. But most of them have passed on their portions to the traders instead of risking their lives. A portion of the building had collapsed a few years ago but the landlord refused to repair it, said Rajesh Grover, a tenant of 88A MM Burman Street, which has been declared unsafe by the CMC.         
	Civicspeak        
	We had requested the landlords to renovate their houses on several occasions but to no avail. The tenants are a problem too. Many are unwilling to shift because of the extremely low house rent, said Sudeb Das, the councillor of ward no. 39.         
	There is no Act which allows the CMC to evict tenants forcibly. There are around 1,000 unsafe buildings in the Burrabazar area. In order to encourage landlords to raze the unsafe buildings, we have started a rehabilitation scheme, said mayor-in-council, buildings, Dipankar De.         
	As part of the scheme, the owner of an unsafe house will be allowed to build a larger floor area (called the floor area ratio, or FAR) than is usually permitted. Rules on height and open space have also been relaxed.         
	Though quite a few houseowners of the adjoining areas have signed up, those of MM Burman Street are yet to wake up to the need for change.

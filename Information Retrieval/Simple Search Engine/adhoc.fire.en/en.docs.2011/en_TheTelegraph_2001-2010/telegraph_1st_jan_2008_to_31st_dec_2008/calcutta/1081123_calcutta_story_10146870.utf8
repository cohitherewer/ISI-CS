The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New town, old toxins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New town, old toxins
                              Construction at Rajarhat-New Town. A Telegraph picture                            
	Rajarhat-New Town  billed as an upmarket residential and IT hub  has turned a blind eye to environmental concerns, particularly climate change, say experts. The new township on the eastern fringes of Calcutta has degraded the natural environment from its inception.         
	With a number of open acquifers, Rajarhat was one of the largest ground water recharging zones for a wide area, including Calcutta. Much of it has been lost, said environment expert Tapas Ghatak of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.         
	Ghatak also said that the land in Rajarhat was raised by 1.5m with soil dug from wetlands contaminated by toxic effluents from tanneries. Thus the new city may not be conducive for large-scale plantations any more.        
	In 2000, there were around 50 water bodies and a few thousand trees of some 100 species in Rajarhat. All that was sacrificed in the name of development, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.         
	He had filed a PIL on the environmental plunder and the high court ordered an environment impact assessment study of the area. Dutta, however, said the study carried out subsequently was an eyewash and Rajarhats real green concerns were never addressed.         
	Experts feel this apathy towards the environmental and lack of green planning will make it a climate-insensitive city. The present construction boom, involving rampant digging, has increased the amount of particulate matter in the area. Add to this the use of heat-retaining materials like cement and steel and you have a problem on your hands, said a climate expert.        
	With minimal green cover and water bodies, there is little chance of the heat generated by these materials being absorbed. This will affect the citys microclimate he added.         
	When the rest of world is promoting eco cities with minimum stress on the environment, we are moving in the opposite direction. Who will believe that Calcutta and its surrounding areas are billed as one of the most vulnerable hot spots of climate changes? asked an environmentalist.

	The window of a fashion designers car was broken open and two boxes containing Swarovski crystals worth Rs 2 lakh were stolen on Sunday evening.        
	Other items in Abhishek Duttas car, parked in front of his Dover Terrace house, were not touched.        
	The theft was discovered when Dutta returned home around 6pm.        
	I drove the car from the garage in the morning and parked it in front of my house before leaving for my studio in another car, said Dutta, who is set to present his creations in the Lakme Fashion Week Show in Mumbai later this month.        
	The goons smashed the windowpane of the right front door. They probably unlocked the rear door and took out the boxes. My family members last saw the windowpane intact around 5pm, added Dutta, who lodged a complaint with Gariahat police station.        
	The crystals were not meant to be displayed with any of his creations. He collected them for some bridal collections and was supposed to take the boxes to his studio on Monday.        
	The crystals were kept in two beautiful boxes. Anyone would have thought that the boxes contained jewellery. After grabbing the boxes, the criminals might have been under the impression that they had laid their hands on priceless ornaments and did not bother to touch the other items, including the music system in the car, said Dutta.        
	Police went to Duttas house in the evening and examined the car. We suspect the involvement of local criminals, said an officer of Gariahat police station. A number of youths loiter around the area and lift valuables from cars and houses. We hope to recover the stolen items and arrest the culprits soon.

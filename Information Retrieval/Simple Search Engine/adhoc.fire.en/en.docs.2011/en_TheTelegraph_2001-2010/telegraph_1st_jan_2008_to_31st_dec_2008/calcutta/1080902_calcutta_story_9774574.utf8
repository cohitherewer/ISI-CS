  - Shot at after threats           A STAFF REPORTER                          Serajul Haq in his shop. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Four extortionists were arrested in their central Calcutta hideouts on Sunday night in connection with the attempt on the life of a trader in his Marquis Street shop on August 24. A firearm and three rounds of ammunition were found on the four, identified as Ezaz Ahmed, alias Guddu, Shahnawaz Hussain, Sabbir Alam and Rajib Peyada.        
	Ezaz, the 25-year-old gang leader, raided the cellphone shop of Serajul Haque and fired three rounds. The other three were waiting in a car parked a few metres away, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).        
	The first bullet had missed Serajuls head and smashed a glass pane. The second, fired from close quarters, missed the mark as the trader dived for cover. A third bullet was fired to scare the people who had gathered.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Serajul refused to pay Rs 30,000 to local extortionists.        
	Ezaz used to stay on Marquis Street. He moved three years ago and had been living in hideouts across the city and in South 24-Parganas. He used to threaten traders over the phone and demand protection money. His accomplices used to collect the money, said Sen.        
	Ezaz allegedly said during interrogation that he had visited Serajuls shop himself since the trader was ignoring his threat calls.        
	According to Sen, Ezaz used to work for Mahtab, suspected of running an extortion racket from jail. He recently started to operate on his own. He used to extort money from traders in Park Street, Taltala and New Market areas, she said.

  - Songs, charity to mark occasion          A STAFF REPORTER                          Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose receives a guard of honour at Garcha Singh Sangat                                        
	One of the oldest gurdwaras in Calcutta celebrated its centenary on Sunday with kirtan, sermons and charity.         
	About 4,000 members of the Sikh community started gathering at 4 Garcha Second Lane, commonly known as Garcha Singh Sangat, from dawn. The celebrations started with religious songs. Speeches by gurus from the city and outside followed. Food and clothes were later distributed among the underprivileged.         
	Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, one of the organisers, said the celebrations would continue for the next few days.The gurdwara was established by Bhai Hiru Lal Singh and Narayan Singh. On November 22, 1909, Guru Granth Sahib was ceremoniously placed on the premises of the gurdwara.         
	The speakers highlighted the gurdwaras links with the freedom fighters.         
	Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose visited the gurdwara in 1938 and received a guard of honour. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had also visited the gurdwara.This gurdwara is special for many reasons. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose held several meetings with Sikh leaders in this temple, said Ahluwalia.         
	Avtaar Singh Makker, the president of the Shirumani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, flew down to the city to attend the celebrations.        
	For the Sikh community a gurdwara is not just a place of worship. It serves as a seat of learning and charity too, said Makker.

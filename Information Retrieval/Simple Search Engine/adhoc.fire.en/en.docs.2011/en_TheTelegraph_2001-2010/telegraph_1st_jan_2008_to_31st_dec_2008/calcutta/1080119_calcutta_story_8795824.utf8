           Saying it with colours
          Over the ages, artists have associated themselves with peoples movements. The sensitive, thinking person is compelled to express when his or her soul feels outraged. Mamata Banerjees is one such soul. Titled 25 Hours in a Day, Chapter Two, her second art exhibition is described as a public figures shy, private space. She developed the habit of drawing sketches casually to help her concentrate during meetings. Perhaps unspoken words from her heart found form on canvas, capturing for posterity her moments of pain and joy. Her paintings are distinguished by a startling innocence and simplicity, reflecting the turmoil of soul seeking refuge from storm. The proceeds from the exhibition shall go for the benefit of the victims of Nandigram violence. One of her paintings from the ongoing exhibition appears here. The exhibition has been curated by eminent artist Shuvaprasanna.
         lEvent: An exhibition-cum-sale of paintings by Mamata Banerjee lWhen: Till January 20; 12 noon - 8 pm lWhere: Indian Museum, Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall

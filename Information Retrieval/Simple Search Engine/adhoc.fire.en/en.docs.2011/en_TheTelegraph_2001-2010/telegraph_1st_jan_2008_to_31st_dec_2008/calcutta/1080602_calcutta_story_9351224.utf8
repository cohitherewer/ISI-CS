                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jewellery shop burgled
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A gang broke into a jewellery shop on GT Road, in Bally, and fled with gold bars and ornaments worth Rs 2.5 lakh on Saturday night.        
	The theft came to light when Abhijit Karmakar, the owner of Gobinda Jewellers, came to open the shop around 9.45am on Sunday.         
	He was shocked to find that the shutters of the shop had been raised about six feet from the ground. Inside, the locks on the collapsible gate and two iron safes containing jewellery had been broken.        
	Nothing seems to be missing from the safe containing silver jewellery, but the other was cleaned out, said a police officer.        
	The thieves had broken nine locks to lay their hands on the gold, said Gobinda Karmakar, Abhijits father. There were four locks on the shutters, one on the collapsible gate and two each on the safes.        
	Abhijit last checked the items around 11am on Saturday. All jewellery shops in the Bally-Ghoshpara-Uttarpara area remained closed on Saturday to mourn the death of a member of the local goldsmiths association. But Abhijit had gone to his shop in the morning to perform puja. All the items were in place then. He also remembers having locked up the shop before leaving, the officer said.        
	The theft has stumped the police as the GT Road stretch on which the shop is located is patrolled at regular intervals. At night, guards hired by local traders do the rounds.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Four Jadavpur University students were suspended from their hostel on Wednesday for their misbehaviour with New Years Eve revellers in a drunken state.
    
	The students, whom the university authorities refused to identify, reportedly broke open the hostel gate late on December 31 and misbehaved with residents and passersby, including some women.
    
	The decision to temporarily suspend the four students  two each from the engineering and arts faculty  was taken at a meeting of the executive council of the university on Wednesday.
    
	An official of Jadavpur University, asked to keep a vigil on the activities of the hostel inmates that night, witnessed the ugly incident. The students have been suspended on the basis of his report.
    
	A probe has been ordered to find out more about the New Years Eve incident. We will take a final decision by next week after going through the probe report, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.
    
	We will not tolerate any indecent behaviour by our students. The decision to temporarily suspend the four is part of our drive to enforce discipline on campus, Ghosh added.
    
	A member of the executive council said the hostel inmates had been asked not to step out on New Years Eve. But the four violated the order, broke open the hostel gate and misbehaved with others in a drunken state. This is an act of gross indiscipline, the member added.
    
	The guardians of the four have been asked to meet the authorities next week.

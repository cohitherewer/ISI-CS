          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The betting racket busted on Monday was spread across the country and earned Rs 25-30 lakh from wagers placed on each cricket match, claimed police on Tuesday.         
	The five men arrested were produced in a city court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till April 26.        
	They were picked up from a Phoolbagan flat before the start of an ICL T20 match between Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings. A television set and recording gear, a laptop, mobile phones, score sheets, balance sheets and a telephone-conversation recording apparatus were impounded.        
	The profit margin of the racket was very high and the members had contacts in most cities across the country. We raided some other hideouts on Monday night but without any result. We would also like to find out the information stored in the laptop, said a senior investigator.        
	It appears that the racket was very active during the ICL matches and the amount being betted was huge. The gang had contacts in New Delhi, Mumbai and Rajasthan, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	The detectives said they would scan the entries in the settlement sheets to find out the modus operandi of the gang. Computer experts would be used to retrieve information stored in the laptop.         
	A preliminary investigation has revealed that of the five  Adarsh Mohta, Mayank Damani, Dilip Sharma, Vishnu Mundra and Baldeo Damani  Mundra had close links with Kunal Daga, who liaised for the racket. Mohta had been arrested on the same charge in February and was out on bail.        
	We would like to find out more about Daga to dig deep into the racket. It appears that he had visited the city a few times, added the detective.         
	The policemen have not been able to determine how long the racket was active. The members may have been trying to expand their network to London.

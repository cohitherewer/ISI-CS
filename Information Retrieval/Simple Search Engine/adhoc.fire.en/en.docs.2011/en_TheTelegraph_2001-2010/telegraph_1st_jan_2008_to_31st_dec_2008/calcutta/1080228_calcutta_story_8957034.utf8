The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops on clue hunt
                                                                                                               Cops on clue hunt
  - THREE DETAINED FOR DACOITY-MURDER          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Three youths have been detained in connection with the dacoity in Kanchrapara on Thursday night, that led to the death of homemaker Chandana Das.        
	The three have been picked up following the interrogation of five criminals arrested on Tuesday. We have got some important clues about the members of the gang and hope to crack the case soon, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).        
	Some of the dacoits in the 15-member gang, led by Surya Golder, had allegedly pushed Chandana off the third-floor balcony while she was trying to alert neighbours. She bled to death on the street below.        
	The dacoits decamped with jewellery and cash worth Rs 20 lakh.        
	The sleuths on Wednesday decided to question the family members  especially Chandanas 11-year-old son Barun and 17-year-old daughter Barsha  to ascertain the sequence of events leading to the womans death.        
	Its not clear whether Chandana fell off the balcony while trying to ward off the dacoits or the goons pushed her off. The statements of the family members and the criminals are not matching. We need to know what happened in the house in the last 15 minutes of the raid, said an investigating officer.        
	The police are also facing problems in recovering the looted items. A probe has revealed that some of the items have been sold. The ornaments, if recovered, would help us nail the culprits, an officer added.        
	The forensic report is likely to arrive by Friday.

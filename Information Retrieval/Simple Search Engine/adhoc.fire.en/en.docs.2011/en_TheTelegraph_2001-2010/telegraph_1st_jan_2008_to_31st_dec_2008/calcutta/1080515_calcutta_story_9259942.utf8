  - COP ALERT ON CREDIT CARD FRAUD          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Want instant cash? Come with your credit card and get money at 4 per cent commission.        
	This is an offer that at least some hard-up credit card-holders cant refuse. But if they are defrauded, as they often are, even the police wont help, because the loan-seekers are as much at fault as the conmen.        
	Unscrupulous traders are publishing the ads. When a credit card-holder turns up at the shop, he is asked how much money he wants to borrow. His card is then swiped for the amount, plus a four per cent commission. The transaction is shown as payment against purchase of goods.        
	The goods, however, are never handed over to the credit card-holder, who leaves the shop with the loan amount in cash. The trader later produces the transaction slip in the bank concerned and recovers the loaned amount, as well as the commission.        
	But the story often doesnt end there. Several who have availed themselves of loans in this manner found that the traders overcharged them or used the card details for future purchases. In the past month and a half, Calcutta police received 16 such complaints.         
	We cant help people who have been defrauded in this manner. A person can use his credit card to buy goods from a shop but cant take money from the shop-owner, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	If steps are taken, the complainants will have to be prosecuted along with the traders, said an officer of the detective departments fraud section. The victims often are left with no option.        
	He cited the case of a complainant who took Rs 70,000 from a shopkeeper after being told that his card had been swiped for Rs 72,800 (Rs 70,000, plus commission of Rs 2,800). But a month later, the card statement revealed that the shopkeeper had actually withdrawn Rs 1 lakh. When the complainant went back to the shop, he was shooed away.        
	Another victim, Rana Banerjee of Rashbehari Avenue, recounted: I gave my card to the owner of an electronic goods shop on April 14. He was supposed to give me Rs 95,000, but he paid me Rs 70,000 and asked me to come back later for the rest of the amount. When I went back to the shop, he flatly refused to give me the rest of the money.        
	According to the police, the only way to prevent such a fraud is by taking a loan against a credit card from the bank instead of approaching traders.

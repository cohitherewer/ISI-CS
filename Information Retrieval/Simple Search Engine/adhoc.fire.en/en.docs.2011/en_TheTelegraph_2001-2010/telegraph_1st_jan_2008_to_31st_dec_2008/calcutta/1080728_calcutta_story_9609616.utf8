          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Eastern Indias first specialised day-care centre for patients suffering from dementia was inaugurated on Sunday at Ankur, the social service wing of Nehru Childrens Museum.        
	The centre, near Jadavpur, would look after the patients five days a week for free. Armed with tools and the technique needed to make the patients feel wanted, the organisation will also try to help their family members, said Nilanjana Moulik, the secretary of Alzheimers and Related Disorders Society of India, which will run the organisation.        
	We will assess the patients individual needs through interaction, encourage them to participate in group activity and simple but stimulating games. We have a library full of books printed in large font, she added.        
	Alzheimers is the commonest form of dementia, which causes memory loss, confusion and disorientation. It has no cure and nearly 46,000 of the 230,000 Calcuttans over the age of 65, suffer from it.         
	Brigadier S.P. Bhattacharya, whose wife has been suffering from Alzheimers for the past 14 years, lamented that such a service was not available when his wife was diagnosed with the ailment. For the first few years when she used to forget things, I used to correct her. Hardly did I know that being corrected constantly would make her withdraw into a shell.        
	The organisation has submitted a proposal to the Union social justice and empowerment ministry for opening more such centres.

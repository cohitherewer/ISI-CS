                      Conquest of space                    Sculpture is a conquest of space, a space that is delineated by forms  Henry Laurens.        Asis Ghosh is a reclusive artist who has bartered the hum-drum of city life for the peace and tranquillity of Santiniketan. Living amid natures bounty, Ghoshs work is a metaphor for an ecological harmony between man and nature. His sculptures depict his deep-rooted involvement with mythical and allegorical subjects. A sense of frontality is evident in many of his works and they appear to be iconic, terse and harmonious. Ghosh uses wood, bronze coloured with pastel and other colours, terracotta, steel, etc., as media. The subjects that recur in his works like leit motifs are those of elongated female figures, saints, Bauls (singing minstrels), monkeys in various postures and trees and tree trunks. A seamless flow of imagery seems to overlap and pass from one work to the other. Ghosh takes a keen interest in the use of diverse material and experiments with the texture, often indulging in the surface treatment of the raw material. A sense of dense volume defines his works. For Ghosh, simplicity may not be his goal, but he arrives at simplicity in spite of himself, as he approaches the real meaning of things.

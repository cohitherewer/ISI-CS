          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A one-and-a-half-year-old child suffering from respiratory distress was wrongly treated for asthma in a private nursing home and a state-run hospital for six days before doctors at SSKM found and removed a peanut embedded in his left lung.        
	Rony Roy, a resident of Salkia in Howrah, is said to be in a critical condition and on oxygen support after the emergency surgery on Tuesday.        
	Nothing showed up in the CT scan and X-ray; so we did bronchoscopy and the peanut was found in the bronchus of the left lung A peanut is radio translucent and so its presence in the lung was not revealed during an X-ray and CT scan, said Arunabha Sengupta, an associate professor of ENT at SSKM Hospital.        
	It took the surgery team an hour to extract the peanut from Ronys lung.        
	The boys father, Subhas, said Rony started coughing continuously and experienced breathing difficulty last Wednesday.         
	He had had respiratory problems on two occasions earlier, but recovered after treatment. This time, a local physician said he had asthma and needed oxygen support, Subhas, who works in a private company, said.         
	Rony was taken to a private nursing home where doctors began treating him for asthma. He was administered drip and given oxygen support, but his condition only deteriorated.        
	The family then took him to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, where he was administered similar treatment. They were prescribing antibiotics and my sons condition was deteriorating, said Subhas. His cough did not recede and his breathing trouble got worse. Rony was referred to SSKMs paediatric department and then to the ENT department on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bandh-eve boom at multiplexes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bandh-eve boom at multiplexes
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A still from Bachna Ae Haseeno                                  
	Bachna Ae Haseeno was the flavour of the pre-bandh night as the fun-and-film crowd of Calcutta flocked to malls and multiplexes.        
	Tuesday night wore the look of a Saturday night as families and friends made a dash to celebrate the last few hours of freedom, before staying home through a 24-hour shutdown on Wednesday.        
	There was a definite surge in occupancy at all three INOX properties for the Tuesday evening and night shows. All shows of Bachna Ae Haseeno post-8pm went houseful. The occupancy of other films like Singh is Kinng was 80 to 90 per cent, said Virendra Marya, the regional director (east) at INOX.        
	We had got used to 12-hour bandhs and made it a point to go for a movie once the plexes opened in the evening. This time we just had to catch the night show on bandh-eve, said 28-year-old Anamika Agarwal.        
	Anamika and gang went for Bachna Ae Haseeno at Forum, where it was party time with the food court full and the halls filling fast. Footfalls increased by 15 per cent and retail sales went up by 10 to 15 per cent. The movie and food sections saw the highest increase as no one was going to work the next day, said Ujjal, the general manager at Forum.        
	It was no different at the Hiland Park and South City addresses of Fame on Tuesday night. There was an almost 40 per cent leap in occupancy over Monday night, with the big films going full, said marketing head Abhishek Raina.        
	Food was the other big draw at the malls. Mainland China recorded a 10-12 per cent rise in footfall.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state will have to pay compensation of over Rs 18 crore to the owners of a 39-acre plot in Rajarhat that was illegally declared vested in 1968 and acquired in 1981.        
	The high court had asked the government to pay Rs 1,63,80,000 to the owner in 1981. The state challenged the verdict, which was recently upheld in the Supreme Court.        
	The owners of the plot can claim interest on the compensation, the apex court ruled. That would take the figure over Rs 18 crore.        
	The plot, known as Samitir Bheri, belonged to Krishnapada Pramanik. On November 16, 1968, the state government had declared the land vested. When Krishnapada prayed for compensation, the state denied that he was the owner and refused to pay him the money.        
	Krishnapada filed a case before an Alipore court. The second sub-judge of the court declared him the owner of the plot, ruled Rasamoy Mondal, counsel for the petitioner.        
	In 1981, the government acquired the plot under Land Acquisition Act and offered Rs 34,650 as compensation at the rate of Rs 350 per cottah.        
	The owner moved the court again demanding more compensation. Krishnapada died as the case was in progress but his wife, Bhagyabati, and other family members did not give up.        
	 On November 27, 1997, the Alipore court directed the government to pay them Rs 1,63,80,000 at the rate of Rs 7,000 per cottah.         
	The state government then moved an appeal before Calcutta High Court in 1998. On April 15 this year, the division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice R. Banerjee dismissed the plea.        
	The state government moved a special leave petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on the high courts judgment.        
	The division bench of Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice Dalveer Bhandari on September 8 dismissed the petition.        
	My clients, all of whom are farmers, can claim interest on the compensation amount from the government, said Mondal.        
	A lawyer who represented the state said it would soon comply with the order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gadget glitch in sky scare
                                                                                                            Gadget glitch in sky scare

	A technical snag on Tuesday afternoon crippled a vital communication gadget at Calcutta airport, endangering the skies between Calcutta and Chennai for a while.        
	A high-frequency communication system of the Calcutta air traffic control (ATC) area south  controlling the skies over Bay of Bengal, till Myanmar  went on the blink, causing a breakdown in communication between control staff at the airport and the aircraft.        
	As a result, a Kingfisher flight from Visakhapatnam to Chennai, climbed to a height of 18,000 feet instead of 14,000 feet. The error was rectified only after the aircraft contacted Chennai ATC after cruising at the wrong altitude for around 20 minutes.        
	If any other aircraft had been flying at that altitude during those 20 minutes, there could have been a mid-air crisis, admitted the official.        
	The flight in question was at 18,000 feet when it had been given clearance by the Calcutta ATC to fly at 14,000 feet, he explained.        
	There are several frequency transmitters in the Calcutta ATCs area south covering the Bay of Bengal. The one that communicates with aircraft till Visakhapatnam was out of order on Tuesday afternoon.        
	A Kingfisher flight from Visakhapatnam took off for Chennai around 2.10pm. Till 5,000 feet, an aircraft is controlled by the Visakhapatnam ATC, beyond which the Calcutta ATC takes over. But following the communication breakdown on Tuesday, the city airport was forced to keep in touch with the flight crew through the Visakhapatnam ATC or other aircraft flying the route.        
	Word was somehow reached, through Vizag ATC, for the craft to fly at 14,000 feet. But this caused a serious miscommunication as the pilot thought he had been cleared to fly at 18,000 feet, said an official at Calcutta airport.        
	Officials in the radar control room of Calcutta airport watched in horror as the craft climbed to 18,000 feet and stayed there. Finally, the Chennai ATC saved the day by instructing the aircraft to climb down to 14,000 feet.        
	We heaved a sigh of relief; if any other aircraft had been cleared to fly at 18,000 feet a mid-air collision could have taken place, said an official.        
	The communication system improved around 5pm but by then commercial operations at Visakhapatnam airport were drawing to a close.        
	The communication and navigational equipment at Calcutta airport malfunction quite regularly. The system will be overhauled as part of the Rs 2,000-crore revamp plan okayed by the Centre. The revamp is expected to start this year, said an Airports Authority of India official, adding that some navigational equipment have arrived.

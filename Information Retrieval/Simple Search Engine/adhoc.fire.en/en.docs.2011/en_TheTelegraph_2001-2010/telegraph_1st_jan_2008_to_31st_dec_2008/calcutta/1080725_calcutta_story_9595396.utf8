          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang stealing cellphones in the city and its suburbs has been busted with the arrest of four men, including its kingpin. Twenty-one handsets, worth Rs 1.5 lakh, were seized from the gang.        
	Police set off on the gangs trail following a burglary in a cellphone showroom on Tiljala Road a week ago.         
	The additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas, D.P. Singh said that on the night of July 16, the gang  led by Mohammed Rajesh  robbed the shop owned by Kamala Naskar.        
	Naskar lodged a complaint with Tiljala police station the next day, stating that thieves had broken into her shop after removing a part of the asbestos roof and taken away 14 handsets.        
	The robbers left behind leads, following which we launched a search. Acting on a tip-off, we raided Rajeshs house in Mathpukur, Tiljala, on Wednesday night and arrested him, Singh said.        
	During interrogation, Rajesh spilled the names of his associates, who were identified as Mohammed Shamim, Mohammed Mumtaz Ali and Mohammed Salauddin Sana. The trio, residents of Barasat, were held on Thursday.        
	All aged between 25 and 30 years, the gang also stole cellphones from several people in different parts in the city. We suspect there are more members in the gang and hope to nab them soon, the investigating officer said.

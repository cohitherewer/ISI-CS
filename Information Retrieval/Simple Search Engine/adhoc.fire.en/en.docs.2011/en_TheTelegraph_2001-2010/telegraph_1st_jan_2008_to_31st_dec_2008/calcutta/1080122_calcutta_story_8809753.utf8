     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Two friends of Mrityunjay Kumar, who were with him on the night he went missing, are being questioned over his death.
    
	The 22-year-old hotel management student had attended a party with Johnson Ekka and Sanjib Jha aboard a cargo ship anchored in the Calcutta Port Trust area on January 17. 
    
	Kumars body was found floating in the Hooghly on Monday morning. Police have started a murder case following a complaint by his relatives.
    
	The final-year student at a Gol Park institute, originally from Jamalpur, in Bihars Munger district, had been staying as a paying guest in a flat at Parnasree, Behala, for three years.
    
	We are questioning Ekka and Jha for leads. We have not ruled out foul play, said deputy commissioner (port) Anand Kumar.
    
	Jha, an engine manager of Tiger Cargo, invited Kumar and his neighbour Ekka to the party aboard the ship. The two got there around 9.30pm and drank a lot, said an officer. 
    
	According to the police, Kumar wanted to go home around 2am and borrowed Rs 200 from Ekka for taxi fare. Kumar was even escorted off the ship by the other two.
    
	Ekka told the investigators that he wanted to drink more and had returned to the ship with Jha after seeing off Kumar.
    
	The student might have been pushed into the river. The family has been informed about the death, added the officer.
    
	Mrityunjays uncle Balmiki Paswan, who stays with his family in Salt Lake, had lodged a missing diary with South Port police station on Sunday morning.

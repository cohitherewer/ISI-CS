The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rate route to royal ditch
                                                                                                               Rate route to royal ditch
  - Blue-blood romance sparks revenue-share war with plexes          PRIYANKA ROY                          Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan on a Jodhaa Akbar poster                                         
	Swords are crossed over the big Valentines week release, with the epic love story of Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan caught in a screening war.        
	Jodhaa Akbar, Ashutosh Gowarikers Rs 40-crore magnum opus, faces a crisis more grim than the swordplay  or is it foreplay?  between the lovers being beamed in the run-up to the February 15 release.        
	Calcutta screens, as always, are most reluctant to cough up the amount being demanded by producer-distributor UTV, and taking the to-show-or-not-to-show drama down to the wire.        
	According to sources, UTV is demanding a higher percentage of revenue share from Week 2. The norm till now has roughly been 50 per cent in the first week, 40 in the second and 30 in the third. For Jodhaa Akbar, the demand from the plexes is 50-45-35 (approx).        
	Till Wednesday afternoon, it seemed that the film about blue-blood romance would give Bengal the royal ditch. The terms demanded by UTV for Jodhaa Akbar are unprecedented and not acceptable to most cinema owners, said Arijit Dutta, whose Piyali Films, along with UTV, is distributing the film in Bengal.        
	By evening, single screens in the city had bitten the Jodhaa Akbar bait, following another round of give-and-take. But there was no progress in the parleys with multiplexes.        
	INOX, along with some other multiplex chains in the country, has sent its proposal to UTV. We believe it is fair to both sides. We are now waiting for UTV to revert, said Alok Tandon, COO of INOX Leisure Ltd, without spelling out the terms, as negotiations were on. PVR is the only national multiplex chain to have signed on Jodhaa Akbar, but Calcutta has no PVR plex.        
	The industry buzz about Jodhaa Akbar has been mixed, with some of the Cupid-couple lure  Ash will not be allowed to act opposite Hrithik again by the Bachchans, whispers Bollywood  being diluted by the length of the film.        
	At three-and-a-half-hours, the film is just too long, making it tough for UTV and its sub-distributors to sell the film on their terms, said a trade analyst.        
	The one thing working for the film is its timing. Chances of the plexes blinking first are bright  even if that means late at night on V-Day  with last Friday releases Mithya and Superstar doing average business and no major Bolly release in sight for the next few weeks.

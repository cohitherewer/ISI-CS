                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cobbler held for theft
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	When Bikas Gupta left his leather office bag with cobbler Babulal Das for repairs on Sunday afternoon, he forgot that between the flaps he had tucked in Rs 1.6 lakh.        
	The realisation dawned on him when he returned home with the bag two hours later but the money was gone.        
	A six-hour search by cops from Shyampukur police station led to the recovery of the cash and the arrest of the cobbler and his nephew.        
	When I didnt find the money in my bag, I rushed to the cobbler who sits near Sovabazar Metro station. He refused having taken the money. I even offered him a share if he returned the amount but he stuck to his stand. I then informed the police, recalled Gupta, a scrap iron trader who lives on Raja Nabakrishna Street.        
	The cops first interrogated Das, who repeated that he had not seen any money in the bag.        
	But he gave in after a round of intense grilling, admitting that part of the money was with his nephew, Dinesh, said an officer. A team left with Das to a place on Aurobinda Sarani, where the cobbler kept his bag and the repairing material. Inside the bag, the cops found Rs 50,000.        
	The team then left in search of the nephew. The remaining cash was in Dineshs house on Keshab Sen Street when the cops reached there.

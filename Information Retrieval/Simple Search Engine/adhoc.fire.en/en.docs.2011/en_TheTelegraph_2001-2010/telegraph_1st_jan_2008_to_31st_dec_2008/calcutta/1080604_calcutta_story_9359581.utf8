          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 32-year-old man who had allegedly cheated several people of lakhs was arrested at his wedding reception on Tuesday night.        
	Relatives, friends and in-laws of Abhijit Chakraborty pleaded with police to let him go, but the men in uniform whisked him away from the ceremony house near the Liluah railway quarters.        
	Chakraborty, who lives with his parents on adjacent J Road, was held on the basis of a complaint by Pritam Bhattacharya of Andul Purbapara.        
	She said Chakraborty took Rs 1.22 lakh from her two-and- a-half-years ago, promising to get a liquor licence sanctioned in her name with the help of his contacts in the excise department. He had claimed that he was a journalist in a Bengali television channel. Bhattacharyas husband was in the dark about the deal.        
	According to the police, Chakraborty had cheated several other people by promising them jobs and other services.        
	We arrested him by tracking his cellphone calls, said Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh.        
	Even the Elliot Road address Chakraborty had used while taking the cellphone connection was of a person he had cheated, said an investigator.        
	Chakraborty was produced before the Howrah chief judicial magistrates court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for three days.

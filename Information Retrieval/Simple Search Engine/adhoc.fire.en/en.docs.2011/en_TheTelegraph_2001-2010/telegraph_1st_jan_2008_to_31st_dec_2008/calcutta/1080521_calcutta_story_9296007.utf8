                      Murders journey towards zero                    Guests are assembled at the Cornwall home of Lady Tressilian. She dies a most brutal death. One of her guests is responsible for her death. The guest list includes Nevile Strange and his former wife Audrey Strange. Lady Tressilians devoted companion, Mary Aldin, Thomas Royde and the family solicitor, Matthew Treves, round up the guest list. Murder, Treves feels, is never the beginning of a story; it is the culmination of a sequence of events, the final point of a countdown towards zero. Everyone seems to have a foreboding of something about to happen, and they are not disappointed. Inspector Battle solves the mystery as his niece, Inspector Leach, the gum-chewing bubbly detective, provides the comic relief. This Agatha Christie thriller, produced by Theatrecian, is directed by Tathagata Chowdhury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pollution rap on   Chitpur rail yard
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pollution rap on   Chitpur rail yard
          JAYANTA BASU                          Hundreds of labourers use the Chitpur railway yard as an open-air toilet. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The state pollution control board (PCB) has pulled up Eastern Railway for failing to control pollution at Chitpur railway yard  off Calcutta railway station  and accused it of violating a two-year-old directive issued by the green agency.        
	The accusation was made during the recent hearing of a petition by residents before the pollution control appellate authority  a three-member bench. The petition complained that loading and unloading of goods at the yard was contributing to pollution by generating dust, smoke, noise and filth.        
	In its order, the authority said the chief law officer of the PCB had submitted that in the past two years, the railway had not taken any steps to implement the recommendations of Arunabha Majumdar (who was nominated by the board to sort out the matter) despite a directive to comply with the suggestions.        
	The recommendations include proper solid waste management, arrangements for water sprinkling, maintenance of storm water drainage, minimising noise during unloading, suspension of work at night and setting up of proper toilets for labourers.        
	Eastern Railway officers argued that they had taken some measures and asked for some more time for total compliance of the recommendations.        
	The residents, who have been complaining against the menace since Calcutta station started operating in 2005, alleged that the railway authorities are not serious about implementing the order.         
	The ordeal starts around 4 in the morning and continues till midnight. While noise is the main problem, with opening and closing of wagon doors and hundreds of labourers shouting, there are other disturbances like dust and smoke as well, complained Pratap Sarkar, a resident.         
	Hundreds of labourers, lorry drivers and others use the area as an open-air toilet, alleged Parimal Ghosh, who lives near the yard.        
	We are trying to comply with the boards recommendations. The divisional railway manager has also promised his help in this regard, said R. K. Mondal, the area officer of Chitpur yard.

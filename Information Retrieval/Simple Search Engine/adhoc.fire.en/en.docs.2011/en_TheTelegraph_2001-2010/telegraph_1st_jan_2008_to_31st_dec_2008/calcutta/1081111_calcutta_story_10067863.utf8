                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NRI job tips for city kids
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	Sanjoy Das, an alumnus of Jadavpur University and St Xaviers College now looking after IBMs BPO sales and business development in London, always wanted to give something back to the city he grew up in.        
	His wish was granted last week when he did a free presentation on outsourcing before 120 students of a central Calcutta business school. Like Das, UK-based Sayonton Roy of Accenture and Paula Chattaraj of Air India will soon get a chance to share their experiences with young Calcuttans.        
	In a novel initiative, city-based realty firm PS Group is targeting NRI Bengalis in the UK and US, asking them to share their overseas success stories with students. The effort has received very encouraging response.        
	We printed an insert in various advertisement souvenirs for Puja in the UK and US, urging successful NRIs to make time during their next homecoming and tell Calcutta students how they dared and how it paid off, said Pradip Chopra of PS Group.        
	At the Harrods Puja in London alone, 412 NRIs registered for such an interaction during their next visit to Calcutta, which for many would be this winter. Email requests to be part of the knowledge-sharing forum are also pouring in.        
	I have been working in the UK for the past 12 years and am with IBM UK Ltd at present, mainly in business case, business process modelling, requirements capture and workshop facilitation. It would be a pleasure to share UK work culture with students back home, wrote Abhijit Shome.        
	Similarly, Chattaraj, who handles PR and sales for Air Indias London office, will bring to the table her experience as business development manager, Asian Business Publications Ltd, communications head for DTDC London, Cardiac Imaging, Wellington Hospital and Harrow Council for Racial Equality.        
	These presenters could provide invaluable insight into the overseas job market for students and answer questions through real-life experiences and domain knowledge, said R.P. Banerjee, the director of the Eastern Institute of Integrated Learning and Management, where the first lecture-workshop was held last week.        
	We have already tied up with JD Birla Institute, St Xaviers College, Besu, Future Institute of Management and Heritage Institute for the NRI presentations. We are asking interested speakers to send us their backgrounds so that the right audience can be picked, said Chopra.        
	The narratives will be video-taped and uploaded on a website being prepared by the PS Group.

  - They control crowds with a firm hand and a soft touch          POULOMI BANERJEE                           Shambhu Ram in action at the Mohammad Ali Park puja. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	When school dropout Shambhu Ram, 30, stands outside the Mohammad Ali Park puja in the Civic Police uniform and asks visitors to walk single file, it gives him the sense of purpose he has always craved.        
	Although this is a temporary assignment, I am glad it came my way. It doesnt matter that I am working even on a holiday. I can go out with my family and friends after my shift ends, says Shambhu, who is paid Rs 89 for working from 6am to 4pm.        
	Like other Civic Police personnel, Shambhu graduated from being a club-level volunteer to becoming part of the squad helping the police maintain order on Calcuttas chaotic streets since last month. I was a volunteer at my para puja last year. But being a member of the Civic Police squad is different, says Shambhu, who studied till Class VIII and has a passion for photography.        
	After doing duty at Mohammad Ali Park for two days, Shambhu is sure he wants to continue being the man in uniform, if given the opportunity. The crowds have been co-operative. Some pandal-hoppers are curious enough to even ask us how much we earn, he laughs.        
	Dipendra Narayan Biswas, 28, went against his familys wishes and gave up a job with a courier company to join the Civic Police because he wanted to do something for society. There is respect in this job. And you feel you are doing something good. But my family wasnt very happy.        
	Dipendra, who studied till Madhyamik, is hoping the police department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will persist with the force beyond the festive season.        
	My job now is to scan visitors to the pandal with a metal detector. I have also been helping senior citizens and children find their way through the crowd. Over the past month-and-a-half, the squad has also rounded up drug addicts and alcoholics, he asserts.        
	Does that mean the 500-odd Civic Police volunteers are looking for more responsibilities than just pandal policing? Most members say they do not have any qualms about being back on crowd-management duty next Puja, or during any major festival. We will do this as long as we can, as long as we are asked to. We just want a future, says Nilu Ray, 23, who became a graduate this year.         
	Dipendra seconds him: We were told this initiative was for six months, that our term might be extended or made permanent, or that we might get a job with the police. My family, too, wants me to take up something in which I have a future.        
	For now, what keeps Dipendra and his colleagues going is the look of admiration from people when they control pandal crowds with a firm hand or lend a gentle helping hand.

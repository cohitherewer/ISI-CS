          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of 16-year-old Snehangshu Dasgupta, alias Vicky, who has been missing since Wednesday night, was dug out from a spot near Tollys Nullah in Regent Park on Friday morning.         
	Three of Vickys friends  Somnath Das, Amit Roy and Pinku Debnath  have been arrested on charges of abducting and murdering Vicky. The trio, picked up on Thursday following a complaint by Vickys father Sitangshu, had allegedly plotted to kidnap the teenager for money.         
	They reportedly told the sleuths that they had planned to demand Rs 5 lakh as ransom. We have taken the three in custody for five days, said D.P. Singh, the additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.         
	An officer said Vicky left his Thakurpukur house on Wednesday evening after the trio invited him to watch a movie with them in an empty flat in Purba Putiary.         
	Once in the flat, the three revealed their plan to Vicky and forced him to call his mother from a phone booth and tell her that he would be late. But the friends panicked after Vicky threatened to spill the beans once he was free.         
	They then dragged Vicky to a pond and held his head under water till he died. The body was buried near the pond.        
	On Thursday morning, some residents became suspicious on seeing a few strands of hair sprouting from the soil. They informed the police who dug out the body.         
	Vickys neighbours ransacked Somnaths house after the body was found. A team comprising police and RAF was deployed peace in the area.

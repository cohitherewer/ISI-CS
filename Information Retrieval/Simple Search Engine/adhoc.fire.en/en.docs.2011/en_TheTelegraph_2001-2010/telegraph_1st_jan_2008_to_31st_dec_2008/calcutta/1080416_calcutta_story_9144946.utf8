Till now, the tax could only be deposited in the treasury office in the area where the house is located.  unicipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said e-connectivity between the offices has made the tax payment possible at any location.

The bail petition of Sutapa Bag, arrested in April last year for allegedly killing her nine-year-old daughter Tiyasha, was rejected on Tuesday by a high court division bench, headed by Justice A.K.

Post-mortem was carried out on a body that MR Bangur Hospital authorities said was of Subrata Bhattacharya, 45. The trader hanged himself at his Netaji Nagar home on Saturday night. He was brought to the hospital on Sunday where he was declared dead. His relatives refused to accept the body that was handed over to them, saying it was not Subratas. The relatives also did not accept the post-mortem report. The body will be sent for a DNA test, said Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).    The Calcutta Municipal Corporations appeal against a trial courts order asking it to renew licences of hand-pulled rickshaws was admitted on Tuesday by the division bench headed by Justice P.K. Roy. The trial courts order had restrained the state government from implementing its decision to ban hand-pulled rickshaws.    Illegally constructed parts of a building at 24 Bagmari Road were demolished by officials of the civic building department on Tuesday.

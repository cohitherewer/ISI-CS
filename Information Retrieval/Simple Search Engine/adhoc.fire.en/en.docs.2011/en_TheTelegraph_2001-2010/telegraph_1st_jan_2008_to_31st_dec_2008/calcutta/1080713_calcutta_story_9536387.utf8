	Move over cricket betting, its time to place a wager on the North Pole becoming ice-free in the next couple of months. And scientists have put their money on the ice melting.           
	According to researchers at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, US, the water of the Arctic Ocean around the North Pole may be ice-free soon.          
	Mark Serreze, a senior scientist at the centre, said the thin sea ice will melt at the geographic North Pole by September this year. We kind of have an informal betting pool going around in our centre on the North Pole melting out this summer, he told CNN.          
	The warning was first sounded three years ago. The catastrophe is now imminent. No wonder, climate change dominated the recent G8 summit in Japan.          
	A Nasa satellite documented changes in the ice cover on the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2005. The extent of perennial ice (thick ice that remains all year round) declined by 14 per cent  an area equivalent to the size of Pakistan or Turkey.          
	According to scientists at the centre, the trend over the past few decades has been less and less of ice in the summers and, thus, less and less ice reformation in the winters, leading to overall thinning. And the cycle goes on.          
	Now with less ice forming last winter, the summer of 2008 may finally see an ice-less, completely navigable North Pole.          
	The world leaders must start doing what they have promised to in the Japan summit and reduce emissions by half by 2050. Otherwise, doomsday films like Day After Tomorrow that rapid climate change has inspired will become mere trailers of what actually happens.

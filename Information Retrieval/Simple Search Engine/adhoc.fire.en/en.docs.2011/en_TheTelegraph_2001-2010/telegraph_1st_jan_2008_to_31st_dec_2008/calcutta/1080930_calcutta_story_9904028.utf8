                      The dilemmas of life                    In the modern world, the experience of daily life is, to say the least, complex, confusing and full of contradictions. The Persistence of Form, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings and sculptures, offers a frank, personal and realistic exploration of the trials of contemporary life. The show includes beautifully-crafted imagery, with the artists injecting wit, fantasy and sensitivity into their vision of humanity. Raw and physical in representation, the works are a mirror to society, exposing its joys and sorrows, pleasure and pain, virtues and vices. The works also dare to examine the inner life of men in an attempt to probe the root causes of the problems that the world is beset with today. Poignant images of life delicately express the love, depth and spirituality of human experience as visualised through the eyes of the artists. Participants include Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar, Shyamal Mukherjee, Gourango Beshai, Swapan Das, Subroto Gangopadhay, Sibsaday Chaudhuri (a painting by him appears here) and Atin Basak.

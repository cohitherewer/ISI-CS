										      For many immigrants in the US life is a constant struggle       made in manhattan                                          
	I have always been fascinated by stories. When I was new in the US, I used to love talking to strangers, fellow south Asians, just to find out their stories. Why did they come to this country, how long have they been here, how difficult was it to stay connected, do they manage to visit home, my questions were endless. I still like hearing stories, but I am no longer new and I no longer engage in conversation with Indian strangers. And thats because it is not easy to walk away and forget their tales.         
	Its a familiar sight in New York. Indian men and women working double shifts at the middle-range cafe chain Dunkin Donuts, as nannies in rich houses, as waiters in fancy restaurants, selling petrol at gas stations, working counters at small stores. By virtue of my skin colour its easy to make a connection with them in a foreign land. As a newly arrived immigrant they are often not what one would expect.         
	I still remember an exchange with a spectacled balding magazine seller at New Yorks Penn Station a few years back. I used to be a lecturer in Punjab before coming to this country, he said. After hearing where I worked, he promptly asked, Can you find me a better job? Why do they want to do such basic work, I would think. Why work at a gas station, pumping petrol in freezing winter, without visiting ones family for decades to prevent getting caught by immigration authorities? Why should a handsome, English-speaking Indian man take my order in the restaurant and tell me he used to work for HMT in Hyderabad and hasnt seen his child for four years? Why is the divorced mother of two struggling to survive in New York, running from one NGO to another to find rental assistance instead of going back to her parents in Jamshedpur? Where is their sense of pride, wont they be so much better back home?         
	We dont hear of these people often. Its easier to talk about the Silicon Valley millionaires, the Wall Street CEOs. But for many of the over two million south Asians living in the US, the majority of them Indians, their lives tell another tale. They work long hours, away from family and friends, in continuous fear of being deported and are not even conversant in the language of the land.        
	But none of that matters. The reality is whether they are working at gas stations or driving all night as NY cabbies, they have a job, and they make steady wages. Their living conditions and family prestige matter little. What matters is that they can send money home so that their sisters can get married, so that they can support their ageing parents and even buy some sought-after land or property. For those lucky enough to have their wife and kids with them, they can provide them a certain standard of living, ensure a good school education for their children and save for a rainy day. And these basic necessities they would not have managed back home.        
	We like to talk about accomplishments of Indians, and why not, when four Indians are among the 10 richest in the world? But what about the millions of others who continue to leave India because of poverty, unemployment and inability to make a living? I think of all these nameless Indians that I see struggling and surviving in America  no matter how hard they have to work or at what menial jobs  as successes. They may not be the Indians we want to spotlight when showcasing our countrys growing prowess, but they have achieved much in their lifetimes purely on their own steam and courage. While they may not have billions to show for it, they are steadily changing the stories their children will tell.

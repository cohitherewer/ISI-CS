          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Wednesday issued a contempt rule against actress Swastika Mukherjee and asked her to appear on December 3 to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against her for not paying a fine of Rs 8,500 to her former husband.         
	Swastika had lodged a criminal case against her ex-husband Pritam Sen, which was dismissed by the court. Sen later claimed damages of Rs 7.7 crore from Swastika for lodging a false case against him.        
	On September 25, Justice Maharaja Sinha of the high court had asked Swastika to pay the fine by November 11.

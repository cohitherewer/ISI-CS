The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Prod for lost scripts
                                                                                                               Prod for lost scripts
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	There must not be any delay in announcing the results of the 41 Madhyamik students whose physical science papers were reportedly snatched from the examiner, the government said on Monday.         
	The secondary education board will have to decide how to assess the 41 students in physical science, school education minister Partha Dey said in the Assembly, in reply to a call-attention notice of Congress member Ajoy Dey.        
	We have told the board that if the scripts cannot be traced within a certain period, it will have to take proper steps to mark the students in the paper... The board will ensure that the affected examinees get justice. But there must not be any delay in the publication of the results of the 41 students, he said.        
	Krishnalal Talukdar, a retired school teacher from Bankra, Howrah, had collected the scripts from head examiner Kaji Safi Ahmed on March 5.         
	On his way back home, near Sealdah station, an unidentified youth reportedly snatched the packets containing the scripts.         
	Talukdar immediately lodged a complaint with Muchipara police station. The police are trying to trace the scripts, said the minister.        
	Some members asked why a retired teacher was appointed an examiner. The board can hardly take any action against Talukdar since he is no longer in service, they felt.        
	Some Opposition members also demanded that the minister spell out what action would be taken against the examiner. But Speaker H.A. Halim did not allow further discussion on the matter.

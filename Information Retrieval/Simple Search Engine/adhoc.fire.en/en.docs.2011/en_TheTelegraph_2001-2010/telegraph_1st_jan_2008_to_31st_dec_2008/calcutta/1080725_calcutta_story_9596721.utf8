The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Custody contempt notice to NRI
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Custody contempt notice to NRI
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The high court on Thursday stamped its authority on a custody battle being fought across continents by a couple who got married in the city, moved to the US and became parents there.        
	Justice Indira Banerjee on Thursday held that since the marriage took place in Calcutta, the court had jurisdiction in the case.        
	Justice Banerjee also issued a notice to the NRI husband, asking him to state why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against him for flouting the order of an Indian court.        
	Thursdays order is yet another example of the ongoing tussle between Indian and American courts over custody cases involving NRI families.        
	Adrija Biswas, a resident of Salt Lake, got married to Debasish Mukherjee of Santoshpur on January 15, 2001. Debasish, a computer engineer, got a job in Pennsylvania, and in 2002, both left for the US where they later received green cards.        
	On January 9, 2006, Adrija gave birth to a boy. But within a year, relations between the couple soured. Debasish used to torture our client regularly. Unable to bear it, she returned to India with her son, said Adrijas lawyers, Biswajit Basu and Sushenjit Banik.        
	In 2007, Adrija filed two cases in Alipore court  one under IPC Section 498A (cruelty on housewives by their husbands) and another demanding permanent custody of her son. But the Alipore court dismissed her petition and we moved the high court against the order, the lawyers said.        
	Debasish also moved a petition demanding custody of his son in Pennsylvania County court, which asked Adrija to be present before it along with the child to attend the case.         
	On July 9 last year, Justice Banerjee had passed an injunction restraining Debasish from taking away the child.        
	On Thursday, Adrijas lawyers asked the high court: What law empowers the American court to hear the case? Why should our client carry out its order?         
	Justice Banerjee held that the US court had no right to hear the case and slapped the contempt notice on Debasish.

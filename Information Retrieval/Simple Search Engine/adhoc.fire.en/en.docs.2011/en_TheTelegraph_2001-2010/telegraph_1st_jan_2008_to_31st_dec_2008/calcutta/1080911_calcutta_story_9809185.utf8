          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY                          An artists impression of the DD block building                                  
	Calcuttas first green building with a manoeuvrable, shell-like exterior designed to let in sunshine in winter and deflect heat in summer will come up in Salt Lakes DD block by 2010.        
	The building will have vertical and horizontal steel fins that can be controlled from a computerised control room, depending on whether the structure needs to be cooled or heated.         
	What it means is that air-conditioning wont be required at most times. Its a unique project and we hope to finish it in 18 months. Work will start in December this year, said S.P. Gon Chowdhury, the managing director of the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Ltd.         
	The corporation is partnering Bengal DCL Housing Development Company in the Rs 9-crore project. The building will house various wings of the state science and technology department.         
	Green buildings are now the norm rather than the exception in many countries, especially the US and the United Arab Emirates. In Calcutta, Technopolis  the Salt Lake structure from where several IT companies operate  was the first green building.         
	Gon Chowdhury said the entire roof of the Salt Lake structure would be used as a water reservoir, the idea being to not only increase storage space but also keep the building cool. Measures such as these will reduce our dependence on air-conditioning, which means less emission of carbon dioxide. We believe the building will be a magnificent piece of work.         
	Like in most green structures, the architects and engineers intend to use solar power to light up the corridors and passages of the building.         
	We have already tested the soil and finalised the design. All that remains to be done is get the project going. We hope to start work within the scheduled period, Gon Chowdhury said.         
	The common green-building practices include taking advantage of renewable energy sources such as sunlight through passive solar, active solar and photovoltaic techniques. Green roofs and rain gardens are popular, too.         
	The building materials that are globally considered eco-friendly include bamboo and straw, lumber from forests certified to be managed in a sustainable manner, recycled stone, recycled metal and non-toxic, reusable products like linoleum, panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, clay, vermiculite and wood fibre.

	Jadavpur University (JU) has once again topped among 11 private and state engineering institutions of Bengal in implementing projects under the World Bank-sponsored Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (Tequip). JUs engineering and technology faculty, following an appraisal of the performance of the 11 institutes, has scored 916 out of 950.        
	Phase I of Tequip ends in March. For the second phase, JU is likely to get the highest funding, thanks to the assessment report, said an official in the state higher education department.        
	Calcutta University, lagging far behind with a score of 777 out of 950, may get less funds in the second phase compared to the first, the official added.        
	The second rank has been bagged by Netaji Subhas Engineering College, a private college in Garia, with a score of 897, followed by Haldia Institute of Technology (876). Bengal Engineering and Science University, which has recently been upgraded to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, has come fourth (843).        
	Salt Lake-based Institute of Engineering and Management (788) has come fifth, preceding Calcutta University.        
	The assessment was carried out by a state-level unit set up by the Centre to facilitate implementation of Tequip projects.Experts from the ministry of human resource development and consultants of the World Bank have reviewed the performance of the university last month. They have praised the performance of our university, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher of JU and a member of its executive council.        
	Jadavpur had stood first in an earlier assessment, too, carried out a year ago.        
	The appraisal took into account around a dozen factors, including implementation of institutional reforms, administrative and managerial efficiency, quality of education, training and services.        
	Some of the institutions under Tequip have not been able to perform well. But the overall performance of the state is encouraging. The average score of the state is 828 out of 950, said an official in the higher education department.        
	A sum of Rs 153 crore had been earmarked for the 11 institutes under Tequip, which started in 2004. JU and Besu had been given Rs 24 crore each, while Rs 30 crore had been allotted to Calcutta University. The rest got between Rs 8 crore and Rs 10 crore.

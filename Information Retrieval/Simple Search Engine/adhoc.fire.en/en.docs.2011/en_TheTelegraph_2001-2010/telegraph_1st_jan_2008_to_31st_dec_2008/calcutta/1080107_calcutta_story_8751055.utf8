     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Three employees of a private radio channel were arrested in connection with a brawl in an Alipore restaurant on Saturday night in which three men were injured. 
    
	The arrested trio had organised a party for the radio channel at the restaurant. Guests had beaten up the eatery employees after being told that the stock of liquor had dried up. The invitation card for the party stated that complimentary drinks would be served to guests.
    
	The restaurant employees were hit with bottles after they declared around 11.30pm that they were out of liquor. Two of them sustained serious injuries on the head and were taken to CMRI Hospital. The condition of one of them is critical. He needed 57 stitches, said Sambhu Nath Majumder, additional officer-in-charge, Alipore police station.

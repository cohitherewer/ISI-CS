          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two persons were arrested early on Wednesday in connection with the collapse of a gate under construction at Jadavpur University (JU) that killed two workers and severely injured another.         
	Arindam Malakar, 40, the contractor in charge of the construction, and Pratik Manna, 35, the consultant, were arrested from their Ruby Park homes. They were produced in court in the afternoon and granted bail.         
	We have charged the duo with causing death by negligence, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas.        
	Doctors at KPC Medical College and Hospital said the condition of Madhusudan Jana, who is in ICU, is improving.         
	Even 24 hours after the mishap, JU authorities have not initiated an inquiry. We will send letters to the members of the inquiry committee on Thursday, said Siddhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor.

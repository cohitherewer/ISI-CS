	Two labourers were killed and four injured  two of them critically  when a wall came crashing down on group of 11 cleaning a surface drain next to a building under construction in Behala on Monday evening.        
	There is no trace of the other five labourers. Till late on Monday, residents searched the accident site on Dwarik Mukherjee Road for the missing men. When the wall caved in, some of them may have fled. But we are looking through the rubble to see if anyone is buried, said a resident.        
	The deceased are Lakhsman Munda, 38, and Khokon Ali, 27. All six labourers were taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where the two were declared dead. Two of the injured  Sanath Mondal, 40, and Biswanath Chowdhury, 39,  were shifted to National Medical College and Hospital after their condition deteriorated.         
	Director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol said the three-storeyed building was coming up illegally.        
	The promoter, Kalyan Banerjee, had fled, said an officer of Behala police station. The labourers were working at the construction site. Banerjee asked them to clear an adjacent kutcha drain that was clogged with bricks and stone chips, the officer said.         
	The leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee, and local Trinamul Congress councillor Srila Banerjee visited the spot. The councillor said she was not aware that a building was coming up illegally in the area. Chatterjee said: I will raise the issue (of illegal constructions) in the Assembly on Tuesday.         
	Residents blamed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the police for the spurt in illegal construction. They alleged that the authorities were hand-in-glove with promoters. Local youths have turned promoters with the blessings of political parties, said Arindam Das, a resident.

	At one time, way back in the 1960s, an art fair used to be held in what is known as the Chaplin Square today, opposite the Calcutta Municipal Corporation building. At the fair, which has passed into legend, works by Ganesh Pyne and Bikash Bhattacharjee were available for a song.        
	After several decades, a two-day art fair will be held from April 25 (3 pm to 8 pm) on the first floor of Avani Signature at 91A/1 Park Street in which 24 bodies, including art galleries, major artists groups, institutions like the Indian Art College, Burdwan Art College and the Government College Art of Craft, will participate.        
	Meant to create awareness among new collectors, galleries will sell art work at minimal prices. No question of picking up art by contemporary Indian masters for next to nothing at this fair, but one gallerist says he will sell drawings by newcomers beginning at Rs 1,000.         
	The Society of Contemporary Artists, Calcutta Painters, Calcutta Sculptors, Open Window and Painters 80 are among the participating groups. Aakriti Art Gallery, Rasa Art Gallery and Chitrakoot of Calcutta, Art Konsult of Delhi, Gallery 7 and Gallery Space of Mumbai, Lalit Kala Akademi and Starmark and Seagull bookstores will participate.         
	About 300 artists will also participate. For the first time, video art will be on display. Author Sunil Gangopadhyay will inaugurate the fair at 6pm on April 24.         
	The main sponsor, Avani Group, will provide 24,000 sq ft air-conditioned space free, besides a parking lot for 150 cars.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Members of a Phoolbagan club were booked and one of them arrested on Tuesday for forcibly collecting Kali puja subscription. This was the first such arrest this Kali puja.        
	Tinku Tiwari, the arrested youth, has been charged with extortion.        
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said none of the extortion victims had mustered courage to lodge a complaint against those who were collecting subscription forcibly.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that members of Sura Yubak Sangha were collecting subscription in Phoolbagan for the past two days. So we registered a case on our own and arrested one of the accused, said Shamim.        
	Sleuths from the detective department came to know that the windscreen of a state bus was smashed by a group of Phoolbagan youths on CIT Road on Monday afternoon after the driver refused to pay puja subscription. Those who attacked the bus fled by the time a team of officers from the Anti-Rowdy Squad reached the spot.        
	From traders and residents of the area we learnt that members of the club were collecting puja subscription forcibly for the past two days, said an officer.        
	The police found out that 15 to 20 youths were stopping motorists and demanding money from them. They did not even spare buses.        
	The driver of the bus that was attacked refused to lodge a complaint. He feared another attack. The local traders also backed out for the same reason, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.        
	Shamim ordered his officers to launch a crackdown on Tuesday. We decided to proceed since we were confident about our findings. In an extensive raid, we rounded up Tiwari, who played a key role in the attack on the state bus, said the deputy commissioner.

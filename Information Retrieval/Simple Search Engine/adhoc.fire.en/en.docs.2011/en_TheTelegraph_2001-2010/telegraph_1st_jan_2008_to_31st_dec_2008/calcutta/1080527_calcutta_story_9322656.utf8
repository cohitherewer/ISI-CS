                      Into a world of hope and sunshine                    The realisation that the child is father of the man had dawned on William Wordsworth way back in 1802, and how apt was he in his observation! Time and again we have witnessed the power of innocent children who, with their clear and innocent vision, lead the myopic grown-ups into a world of peace, one that is not fragmented by petty issues. We often look up to children to guide us through lifes dark dungeons into an illuminated universe. In fact, childrens theatre provides an excellent medium of communication between the young and the adults. Nehru Childrens Museum has been instrumental in bridging this gap to a large extent by providing quality education, entertainment and enrichment for all ages through the performing arts. It is going to host its fifth annual drama festival beginning this evening with Jadiyo Sandhya (a scene from the play appears here). Set in contemporary Indian urban society, the play depicts youths and children who are tremendously swayed by anything that is imported from the West. They hopelessly emulate their counterparts who have been brought up differently in the West. These kids are even willing to give up their time-tested tradition and culture. This results in a hopeless situation. But, not everything is lost yet. Not as long as families like the Ghosals exist who have strong conviction to cling on to tradition. With this power of conviction, the momentary clouds evaporate and sunshine and hope resume. Written and directed by Rama Prasad Banik, the plays will be performed by the little members of Nehru Childrens Museum theatre ensemble. The line-up for the other days are: Bhanga Buker Panjore (May 28), Anubhav (May 29) and on May 30, Saraswati Samipeshu will be premiered.

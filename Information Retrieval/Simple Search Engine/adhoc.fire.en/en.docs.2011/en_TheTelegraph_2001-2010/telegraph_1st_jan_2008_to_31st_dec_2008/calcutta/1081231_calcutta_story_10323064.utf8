                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fire at factory, mill quarters
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A blaze started at a plywood factory on Foreshore Road and spread to the adjoining officers quarters of Fort William Jute Mill on Tuesday evening.        
	Twenty tenders and over 120 firemen were pressed into service to put out the fire at the quarters. The blaze at Amway Plywood was controlled but could not be doused till late on Tuesday.        
	There were no reports of injury. The area was cordoned off by police.        
	We have not been able to ascertain the cause of the fire. The factory did not have any firefighting preparedness though it dealt in combustible materials. We will lodge an FIR against the company on Wednesday morning, said Prafulla Kumar Dutta, the divisional officer of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, Howrah.        
	The factory spreads over 10 cottahs and houses inflammable objects like plywood, adhesives and oil, firemen said. The owner, Arun Agarwal, was not present on the spot.         
	Mohammad Ismail, the gatekeeper of the jute mill quarters, was among the first to spot the fire. He informed the police.        
	The fire started in one of the five sheds in which plywood is stored and spread quickly to three other sheds. Initially, we had sent five fire engines but had to rush in reinforcements, added Dutta.        
	As the fire spread to the terrace of the adjoining quarters, the residents were evacuated. Firemen sprayed water to douse the flames in the quarters. Firemen said the fear of a blast in the factory slowed down the operations. If any of the oil drums bursts, the blaze might spread, said a fire fighter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police veer to vendetta
                                                                                                               Police veer to vendetta
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rakesh Gupta: Now, cash or land deals ruled out                                  
	Police suspect company secretary Rakesh Guptas murder was the fallout of a personal enmity not linked with any property or financial deal.        
	Our probe has revealed that land or money deals that Gupta could have been involved in had nothing to do with the murder, an investigating officer said on Wednesday.        
	On Tuesday, the sleuths had hinted at a deal behind the killing.        
	Gupta earned a little over Rs 50,000 a month. Paying back a loan of around Rs 2.5 lakh that he had taken from office should not have posed a problem, the officer added.        
	But he might have been in a financial spot. He had booked a flat but later withdrew the advance... We have come across some leads and hope to crack the case in a day or two, said a senior officer on the case.        
	Gupta was found dead in Sodepur, 12 km from his Teghoria home, on Monday morning. His face was smashed and limbs tied. The police said the assailants had strangled Gupta with a nylon rope.        
	It seems the killers had forced Rakesh to consume sedatives. Or else, there would have been marks of resistance on the body... Its unlikely that Rakesh was poisoned before being strangled. There would have been froth around his mouth then, the officer said.         
	The spot where the body was dumped, in Bilkanda, was deserted. At least one of the assailants was familiar with the area, the officer added.        
	The sleuths have learnt that Gupta was dropped home on Friday night by a friend called Sanjay Purkiya, who runs a Posta-based transport company. Gupta probably came to know Sanjay at a gym he used to visit while living in Salt Lake.        
	Even after shifting to Teghoria, Gupta kept visiting Sanjays office. The police have questioned Sanjay in search of leads about Guptas acquaintances in Sodepur, Barrackpore and Khardah.         
	The records with Guptas cellphone service provider shows he was in or around Barrackpore before being murdered.        
	The investigators also scanned Guptas computer but failed to come across any leads. Two of his colleagues at Shrachi group have been questioned. We have learnt Gupta was cordial with his colleagues, the officer said.

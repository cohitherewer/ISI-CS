The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Demolition begins at Nandaram
                                                                                                            Demolition begins at Nandaram
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Demolition of the front portion of the top two floors of Nandaram market began on Tuesday, 24 days after a blaze spread to the building from neighbouring Tripalpatti on Jamunalal Bajaj Street.         
	The second phase of the demolition  covering the rear parts of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth floors of Kashiram block of the market complex  will begin on Wednesday, said members of the Nandaram Market Disaster Management Welfare Committee.        
	The portions marked for demolition have been tagged as unsafe by the authorities.        
	Director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol said other portions of the building, if they are found to be unsafe, may also be pulled down.         
	The date of demolition of parts of the market complex was advanced after a concrete chunk from the 12th floor fell on a labourer and injured him on Sunday.        
	A crowd of traders and local residents gathered on Brabourne Road on Tuesday to witnesses the demolition, which continued from 11.30am to 5pm.        
	My shop is on the seventh floor, which is not being demolished, but I am here since I could not stay away, said trader Subodh Chhajer.         
	A portion of Brabourne Road was cordoned off as contractor Bijoy Sonkar and his 70 workers began work. The reduction of road space resulted in traffic snarls in the area, especially in the morning.        
	A pedestrian was hit on the face by a piece of brick that rebounded off an airconditioner and a light post on the way down. He was administered first aid by a policeman in a local saloon.        
	Samar Kanti Chowdhury, the general secretary of the disaster management committee, said the traders body wanted an engineer from IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University or Bengal Engineering and Science University to prepare a report on the stability of the structure. The committee will meet the municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Wednesday with a written appeal to this effect.        
	We cant just trust the civic body blindly, said a member of the committee.        
	The municipal commissioner told us during a meeting on Tuesday that the civic bodys engineers would take time to prepare a report on whether the building is safe or not, added Chowdhury. A private engineer can do the work in a week.

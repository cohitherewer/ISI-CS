     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta has increased the annual fee for its two-year postgraduate diploma course by Rs 1 lakh. 
    
	The increased fee of Rs 3 lakh per annum will be applicable for the batch that will join the course this year. Those currently in the first-year of the course will pay Rs 2 lakh for the second year.
    
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the institutes board of governors on Tuesday afternoon. 
    
	Expansion of infrastructure and campus maintenance have pushed up the institutes expenditure. Hence, the decision to hike the fees, said Shekhar Chaudhuri, the director of IIM Calcutta.
    
	The fee hike at the institute comes on the footsteps of the increase in fees at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore.
    
	IIM Ahmedabad has increased the annual fee of its two-year postgraduate diploma course from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, while IIM Bangalore has hiked the corresponding fee from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, said an IIM official.
    
	We incur a deficit of Rs 1.5 lakh per annum per student. The hike will go a long way in bridging the gap, added the official.
    
	The Joka institute administration has also taken into consideration the possible increase in salaries of the faculty on the basis of the Pay Commissions recommendations while deciding on the fee hike.
    
	Last year, the annual course fee was increased from Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.
    
	Applicants with family income less than Rs 2 lakh per annum are eligible for the institutes scholarship. From the coming academic year, students with family income below Rs 4 lakh per annum will be eligible for scholarship. There will be 25 to 30 scholarships on offer.
    
	This will ensure that meritorious students do not miss out on an opportunity to study at the institute, added Chaudhuri.
    
	The board has not yet decided on increasing the number of seats in the postgraduate diploma course from this year.

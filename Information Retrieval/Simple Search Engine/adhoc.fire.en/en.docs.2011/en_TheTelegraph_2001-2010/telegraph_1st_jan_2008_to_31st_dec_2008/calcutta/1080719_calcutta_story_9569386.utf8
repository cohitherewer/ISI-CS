	The state government is remodelling Gramin retail outlets in the city to promote khadi products.         
	Work has started on the BBD Bag and Bhowanipore outlets. An outlet was inaugurated in Gol Park on Friday by Manabendra Mukherjee, the minister in charge of cottage and small scale industries.        
	We are trying to make the outlets more attractive to customers, said Prabir Banerjee, the CEO of Gramin.

                      Enchanted by horses                    Having explored and mastered various styles of painting in a long career of over 30 years, veteran artist Dhiren Sasmal is perhaps only limited by his own imagination. He works with acrylic, dry pastel and pen amp; ink in his unique style, giving each creation, be it an animal, bird or a human form, an otherworldly quality. His special talent lies in his delicate layering and texturing of print and intricate pen amp; ink works. The basic themes that occupy his vast body of work are horses, young girls at play and Goddess Durga. Though his subject matter may range from Rajput warriors and Hindu goddesses to animals and birds, horses and owls are his special forte. Discovering his fascination for horses during an animal study course in his college days, they symbolise for him youth, tireless energy, power and dynamism. Horses, the ongoing solo show of his works, includes some small works (12 in. x 12 in.) as well as larger canvases (3 ft x 3 ft)  all of which are a collectors delight. Done in mixed media on canvas in characteristic cross-hatch pattern, the vibrant and eye-catching paintings portray the animals as epitomes of masculinity, majesty and mystery.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Dhiren Sasmal When: Till August 16; 1 pm - 7.30 pm Where: Tejas Art Gallery, 11 Mayfair Road

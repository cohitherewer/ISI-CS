          OUR BUREAU                              
	The process of printing confidential documents at Saraswati Press has come under the scanner of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is probing the leak of Joint Entrance Examination (JEM), 2008, question papers.         
	Only 20 employees of the press are allowed to handle confidential documents in the proof-reading section. We have collected a duty roster of the employees, said a senior CID official.         
	A four-member CID team visited the press, which is run by the government, on Tuesday and spoke to some workers.         
	As the diagrams were missing from the leaked question papers, it is clear that the leak happened from the manuscripts. We are checking the system followed in the press to destroy manuscripts, added the official.         
	The police are also checking the call details of Manas Patra, an employee of the press who had allegedly passed on the manuscript to Arun Choudhury, believed to be the kingpin of the racket.         
	Patra, on the run since the arrest of Choudhury and his aide Mihir Dandapat, has been served with a show cause notice by the press authorities.         
	While the investigation into the scam is on, the JEM board is busy deciding on a fresh date for the examination. As of now, the authorities are planning to hold JEM on May 25.        
	We held a meeting today but could not finalise the date. We hope to announce the new date tomorrow, said Siddhartha Dutta, the board chairman.        
	During Tuesdays emergency meeting of the board, the members unanimously decided to conduct the postponed examination after the panchayat elections.         
	The panchayat elections are scheduled to be held between May 11 and May 18. The results of the elections will be declared on May 21.        
	According to a ruling of the Supreme Court, all joint entrance examination boards in the country are required to announce their results within June 15.         
	Under the circumstances, May 25 is the earliest we can hold the examination, said a board member.

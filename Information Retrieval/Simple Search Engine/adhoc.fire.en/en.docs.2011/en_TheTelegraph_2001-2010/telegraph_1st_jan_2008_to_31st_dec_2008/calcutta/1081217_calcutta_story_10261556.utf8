	A special bench of the high court will pronounce its verdict on Ashok Todis bail plea on Wednesday. The hearing of the case ended on Tuesday.        
	The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to admit the bail prayer of Ashok Todis brother Pradip and asked him to petition the high court.         
	Pradip had moved the apex court after a sessions court denied him bail.         
	The Supreme Court directed the high court to decide on Pradip Todis petition expeditiously.        
	The chief justice of the high court, S.S. Nijjar, sent Ashok Todis petition to Justice D.P. Sengupta after a division bench last Monday differed on granting bail to the prime accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The CBI has charged the Todis and five others, including three police officers, of abetting Rizwanurs suicide.        
	Ashok Todi, who surrendered before a CBI court on December 1 following a Supreme Court order, is lodged in Presidency jail. Pradip surrendered on December 8 and was sent to the same jail.        
	Before the special bench on Tuesday, Ashok Todis lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi denied the CBI allegation that his client had paid Pappu, a family friend of the Rahmans, to break up his daughters marriage with Rizwanur.        
	The lawyers appearing for the CBI and the Rahmans opposed the bail plea on the grounds that Ashok Todi would tamper with evidence once he was out of custody.

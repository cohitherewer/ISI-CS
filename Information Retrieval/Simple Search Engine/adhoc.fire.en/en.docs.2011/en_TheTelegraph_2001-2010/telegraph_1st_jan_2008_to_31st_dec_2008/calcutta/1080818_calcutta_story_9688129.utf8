                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JEE pattern to change again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	The rules of the state joint entrance examination (JEE) are set to change for the third time in as many years.         
	The percentage of multiple-choice questions is likely to be reduced from 80 to 60 and the age limit of students seeking admission to medical courses scrapped.         
	The system of deducting marks for the wrong answers is also on the way out.         
	Members of the JEE board and academicians will meet in August to finalise whether the revised system can be implemented from 2009.         
	Repeated changes to the entrance examination structure highlight the problems of a centralised system where engineering and medical colleges have no say in the selection process.         
	The multiple-choice pattern introduced in 2006 has fallen out of favour as good students are not benefiting from it, said a JEE board official.         
	All questions in the 2006 JEE were multiple choice. In the last two years, however, 80 per cent questions were multiple choice and the rest called for short answers.         
	A proposal to return to the pre-2006 system in which students only had to write short answers is also being considered, added the official.         
	An analysis of the JEE results over the past three years reveals that mediocre students who can afford rigorous private coaching are doing well. Many bright students who have the ability to become engineers and doctors but cannot afford private lessons are failing to crack the test. We need to stop this, added the board official.         
	The state government had taken the initiative to introduce the multiple-choice pattern to make the entrance test more student-friendly and ensure transparency.         
	Unfortunately, the system has not worked well, said an official.        
	Students have demanded the other major change on the cards  lifting of the age bar for medical applicants. Before 2007, students aspiring to study medicine could sit for the JEE as many as times as they wanted.         
	Last year, the board introduced a system in which students could appear for medical JEE only within three years of passing their Class XII board examination.         
	This year, the board revised the age criterion for medical applicants and said that students above 24 years would not be allowed to take the entrance test.         
	The board now wants to lift the age bar as no such restriction is imposed by the Medical Council of India, said the official.         
	Some changes are necessary in the JEE. We will be in a position to elaborate on specific changes only after they are finalised. Board members will meet academicians and experts regarding this matter in August, said Siddhartha Dutta, the board chairman.

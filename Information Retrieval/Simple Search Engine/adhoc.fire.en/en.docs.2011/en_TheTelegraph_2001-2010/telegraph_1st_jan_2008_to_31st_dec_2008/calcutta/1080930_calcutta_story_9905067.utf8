                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Heart is where the home is
  - Five days of fun and fervour at 105 apartment blocks this Puja          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Maddox Square and Mohd Ali Park may be where the footfall is, but nothing can match the fervour and the fun of your apartment puja.        
	The Telegraph Hand In Hand, held in association with Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil, embodies the spirit of the barir puja in over a hundred apartment blocks dotting the city. The spirit of camaraderie and cheer.        
	Starting off with a presence in 15 housing complexes in 2003, The Telegraph Hand In Hand has grown over the years, in scale and in stature. From Golf Green to Narendrapur and from Salt Lake to Howrah, The Telegraph Hand In Hand will be an integral part of Puja 2008 at 105 addresses this time.        
	A host of cultural activities and competitions from Sashthi to Dashami mark this Puja programme aimed solely at residents of apartment blocks. From Sit and Draw to Spot Quiz, Antakshari to Dhunuchi Naach, Howzy to recipe contest, Shriman Shrimati to Miss Beautiful Hair crowns, The Telegraph Hand In Hand activities are as diverse as they get.        
	The residents of our complex look forward to The Telegraph Hand In Hand activities every year. There is a lot of excitement generated by the contests and widespread participation, says Chayan Bhattacharjee, president of Hiland Park Utsab Committee, whose association with Hand In Hand enters its third year.        
	Activities and competitions organised in a professional manner but with a personal touch enable people to enjoy better. The grand prizes are an added incentive, says Duke Pramanick of Sherwood Estate in Narendrapur, a new member of The Telegraph Hand In Hand family.         
	Bonhomie is the bedrock of the programme organised to enhance the festive feel within the walls of the apartment complex. For us, Durga puja is the time to bond. Not many of the residents venture out of the complex during the Puja days. The Telegraph Hand In Hand activities help bring everyone together, says Amit Sengupta, secretary of the Vidyasagar Niketan Puja in Salt Lake.        
	So, for 105 addresses around town, Puja 2008 will be where the home is.

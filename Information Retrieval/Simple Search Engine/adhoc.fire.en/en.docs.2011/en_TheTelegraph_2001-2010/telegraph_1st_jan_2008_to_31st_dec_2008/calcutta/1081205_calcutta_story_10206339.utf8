The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stage set for grand carnival
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stage set for grand carnival
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A previous edition of The Great TTIS Challenge at Swabhumi                                  
	The biggest school carnival in town is back. Dabur Babool The Great TTIS Challenge, one of most anticipated school fests in Calcutta, begins on Friday. For three days (December 5 to 7), Swabhumi beckons with its promised dose of fun, games, music and laughter, with exciting prizes to be won.        
	The Telegraph In Schools event, which kicked off with 109 schools in 2005, is now bigger than ever with 147 schools, 16 competitive categories and more than 4,500 participants.        
	Like previous editions, you can expect a host of judges, such as Francis Lepcha, Neel Dutta, Sidhu of Cactus, Subhen Chatterjee and Gabu of Lakkhichara and a special Peace Concert by TV Southasia that will launch the talent hunt show Southasian Superstar. They follow on the heels of Krosswindz, Rupam Islam and Tanmoy Bose in 2006; Taal Tantra, Kunal Ganjawala, Sayan Chaudhuri and participants from Amul Star Voice of India Chhote Ustaad in January 2008.        
	But the real stars of the show, as always, are the students. Students like Nitin Chaturvedi, who won Three Minutes to Fame (a contest which allows students to showcase any talent, however strange, in three minutes) in the 2006 competition and was so well received that he came back as a guest performer this January. His special talent? Singing almost any song in Hindi backwards, with the order of syllables reversed.        
	Or students like Alokananda Bhattacharya who won the Champion of Champions Trophy in January 2008, with a stirring performance of Lambi judai. It was one of the biggest moments of my life. Bigger than the trophy was the opportunity to perform in front of greats like Ustad Rashid Khan and Haimanti Shukla. Ill always cherish the moment, said the Class XII student of St Augustines Day School, Shyamnagar.        
	I regret not being able to participate this time and Im honoured that Ive been invited to perform in the inaugural ceremony, smiled Alokananda.        
	There is plenty in store for all those bored of the usual fest line-up. Like DJ Nite and Mock a Band, where you need not have any musical aptitude and can impress simply with a rock-star attitude. Think your tables are the best percussion instrument ever? Try your luck in the Unconventional Orchestra, where youre allowed to play any instrument of your choice  musical or not.        
	And with exciting prizes to be won that are sponsored by Presto, you have nothing to gain by staying away from the fun.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City pays siege price
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City pays siege price
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	As if inflation was not enough, the Trinamul agitation on Durgapur Expressway has forced a fresh round of price hike on Calcuttans.         
	With trucks getting stuck on the main link between the city and north India, essential food items have become costlier at New Market, Jadubabus Bazaar, Sealdah and Gariahat and Park Circus markets as supplies dwindle.         
	The price of potato has gone up by Rs 3 from Rs 7 per kg since the Singur siege started. Over the course of last week, the price of onion rose from Rs 8 per kg to Rs 16.         
	The supply of potato at Posta has been cut to half as a result of the blockade on the national highway. We are getting some supply via GT Road and roads through villages but for this the transporters are charging extra, said Biswanath Agarwal, the general secretary of the Posta Bazar Market Association.         
	Burdwan, the rice bowl of Calcutta, has also been cut off from the city. The price of minikit rice has gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 22.        
	The impact of the agitation can also be felt in the fruit markets. Apples, primarily sourced from Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, are selling at Rs 80 per kg, up from Rs 65.         
	Rise in apple price is directly related to the blockade at Singur. Transporters are charging extra as loaded trucks are getting stuck for 10 to 12 hours, said Md Sohrab, the president of Mechhua wholesale fruit merchants association and an RJD MLA.         
	Fruit prices will go up even more once Ramazan starts on Tuesday, he added.         
	According to Shyamal Dasgupta of the Truck Owners Association of Bengal, thousands of goods carriers are stuck in the blockade, running up losses for their owners.         
	Homemakers are feeling the pinch. The prices of rice, potato and onion are going up every other day. Onion and potato are the two most essential vegetables for the poor. What will they do? said Maya Datta of Harish Mukherjee Road.        
	Non-vegetarians will not escape either. If the siege continues, prices of meat and beef will go up from this week. The bulk of goats, rams, cows and buffaloes come from north India, said Mohammad Tahir, a meat-seller at New Market.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Oxygen crisis in hospitals
                                                                                                            Oxygen crisis in hospitals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jayanta Das (name changed) was having severe problems breathing after an asthma attack on Saturday. He was rushed to the emergency ward of NRS Medical College and Hospital. But he had to wait for nearly an hour before the hospital authorities could provide him with oxygen, said a family member.         
	The three major state-run hospitals in the city  NRS, SSKM and Medical College and Hospital  are facing a crisis in oxygen supply for the last few days.        
	Theres a shortage even in the emergency ward of the hospital, said a source at Medical College and Hospital.        
	At NRS, the crisis worsened on Saturday. There was a shortfall in supply from BOC, which provides oxygen cylinders and pipeline oxygen to state-run hospitals. However, things are back to normal, said medical superintendent L.N. Ghosh.        
	Extra oxygen cylinders in operating theatres were sent to wards to tackle the situation, he added.        
	In addition to shortage of oxygen cylinders in the emergency ward at SSKM, there is a problem in supply through the pipeline. Recently, a portion of the supply pipe was stolen. It has not been replaced, said a doctor.        
	The health authorities, too, blamed BOC for the crisis.         
	BOC officials claimed that there was no shortage of supply and the hospital authorities were at fault. They have been requested to supervise the supply system and maintain the cylinders, but are not doing it, alleged an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Street hawks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Street hawks                                 Members of the Student Traffic Volunteer Scheme take an oath of loyalty at a city hotel.

	Twenty one-year-old Jayanti Parui left school when she could not clear her Higher Secondary exams. The Habra girl, a member of Cadet Training Squad of India, who supplements the family income by giving tuitions, has been manning traffic from September 1 on some of the citys busiest thoroughfares, for three hours everyday.         
	Eighty such underprivileged youngsters have been selected to participate in the Student Traffic Volunteer Scheme started by Hyundai Motor India, in asso- ciation with the city traffic police.         
	Said commissioner of police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti: The scheme has been successful in Delhi and Chennai. We hope to replicate the experience with students here.         
	The volunteers were taken through a nine-day training programme at Police Training School, where they were put through the basic rules of traffic management  including hand signalling, usage of traffic control devices, administering first aid and post-accident management. As part of their duties, they will control traffic, educate pedestrians about road safety and help drivers park vehicles in crowded areas.         
	The students, between 14 and 20 years, will work for a year for a stipend of Rs 1,000 per month. They will also get special preference if they want to join the police force, Chakrabarti added.         
	Through this scheme, we want to support students so that they can keep studying while working, said managing director of Hyundai Motor India, H S Lheem. The car makers started the project in Delhi in 2006, in association with the Institute of Road Traffic Education and Delhi Police.         
	The selectors received 200 applications from the city this year. There are still 20 vacancies left, informed Chakrabarti. The scheme will be renewed every year.         
	The eight intersections where the youngsters will be posted include the Park Street and Free School Street cross-section, the Exide crossing near Rabindra Sadan, Sarat Bose Road and Elgin Road crossing, the CR Avenue and the Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing. They will work either from 8.30 am to 11am or from 5pm to 8pm.         
	Many, like Sunny Saha of South City College and Karam Hussain, a Class XII student, will have to take time out from busy academic schedules to man the roads. But for Karam, who has been working as a traffic volunteer since he was eight years old, the experience is something to look out for.

	A career in the hospitality sector is hot. If you have a foreign degree to flaunt, its hotter. For students in the city, opportunity came calling when two Swiss institutes held a counselling session at ITC The Sonar on September 6.        
	Les Roches International School of Hotel Management and Glion Institute of Higher Education are offering undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma courses in hotel, event, entertainment and sports management.         
	A student requires at least 55 per cent at the plus two level to apply. Besides, he must participated in several extra-curricular activities and community service.         
	The course fee would put back an aspirant by approximately Rs 12 lakh per semester, said Sarosh Daruwalla, the educational counsellor for Glion and Les Roches. The student would, however, get the chance to work for four to six months in any part of the world, as part of a compulsory paid internship programme. The internship would follow after every semester.         
	Students and parents were all ears as Pimo Mazurczak, the regional admission director for Glion and Les Roches, gave a presentation. Mazurczak has been touring Mumbai, Chennai, Indore, Pune, Delhi, Ooty, Chandigarh, Coimbatore and Darjeeling to attract Indian students. More than academically bright students, we are looking for all-rounders, he explained.         
	Said Anil Jain, who wants his son to go abroad for higher education: It is heartening to find an institute that stresses as much on extra-curricular activities as academics.

	Techno India College celebrated foundation day and freshers welcome together on Teachers Day in September. The chief guest was former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly and footballer Bhaichung Bhutia. Band Crosswindz was also there to entertain.         
	An informal ragging session, that the newcomers expected to be a trial, was fun. After introducing themselves, the freshers were asked to sing a Bengali or Hindi song set to the tune of another number. Imitating a well known dancer and solving n quizzes were other things on the list. There was a Mr and Miss Fresher contest too to spice up the evening.

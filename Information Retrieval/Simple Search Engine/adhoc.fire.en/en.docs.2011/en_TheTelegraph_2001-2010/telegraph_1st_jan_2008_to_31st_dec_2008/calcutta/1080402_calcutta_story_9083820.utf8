The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu downs shutters at film school   Trouble at film school
                                                                                                               Citu downs shutters at film school     - Contract labourers force SRFTI closure, police promise protection          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Union trouble leading to lockout is back in town  this time on campus. A showdown between the authorities and Citu-affiliated workers forced the Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute (SRFTI) to shut on Tuesday.        
	The SRFTI authorities announced in the afternoon that the film school would remain closed... due to militant and strong-arm activities of the Citu-controlled contractors labourers, but police intervention late in the evening prompted a rethink about the shutdown.        
	About 100 labourers have been agitating over demands of dues and other things not in their contract. A new security agency was supposed to take over from Tuesday but they were denied entry, said SRFTI director Swapan Mullick.        
	With the police keeping vigil from the outside, the authorities decided to duck for cover. Since SRFTI is a residential campus with equipment worth Rs 30-40 crore, we decided to shut down.... But with the police promising protection, we will take a call on Wednesday morning, added Mullick.        
	The alleged troublemakers were in no mood to back down. Most of the security personnel have been working at SRFTI since 1995, when the institute was set up. We dont want them to lose their jobs. The authorities can change the security agency but the old employees will have to be retained, said Citu leader Samarendra Roy.         
	Trouble broke out when a notice was put up on Tuesday morning stating that GD Security Company was replacing Star Security and Detective Service.                                      
	Of the 123 contractual labourers on campus, 32 are security personnel. Star Security and Detective Service had been appointed by Citu-backed contractors. But the authorities on Tuesday decided to dump both contractor and security agency, alleged Citu leaders.        
	We will keep a watch on the overall situation so that there is no law-and-order problem. Engaging a new security agency is an internal matter of the institute. We have alerted the labour tribunal and sub-divisional officer of Alipore, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	The sub-divisional officer has called a meeting between the SRFTI authorities and the agitating workers on April 4.        
	The worst-hit, of course, are the students. We are supposed to start our video project from April 16. We will have to reschedule everything and lose valuable work hours if the campus is closed, rued Pravin Kumar Bangari, a third-year student of cinematography.        
	The management has bungled by allowing the matter to snowball, said another student.

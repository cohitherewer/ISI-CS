          A STAFF REPORTER                          Usha Chokhanis Mandeville Gardens address. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Usha Chokhani had put up a strong fight against her killer and was overpowered when she was about to open the main door of her apartment, police said.        
	The 54-year-old, who lived alone, was found murdered in the Mandeville Gardens flat, with a pair of scissors thrust into her throat and a deep wound on her neck.        
	Domestic help Kishan, who is absconding, is the prime accused.        
	The first drop of blood fell in one of the two bedrooms. The trail continued to the main door, where the woman was found lying dead, said Kuldiep Singh, the additional commissioner of police (IV). The woman was first hit on the neck in the bedroom. She then ran towards the main door, with blood oozing from the neck.        
	Usha did not give up even after being overpowered, trying to fight off the killer till the scissors pierced her throat. There were three injury marks on her face, which were caused probably during the scuffle, said an officer.        
	We suspect Kishan, who was hired by Usha only 10 days ago, to be the killer. Police teams are conducting raids in his ancestral village in Bihars Banka district, said Rajesh Subarna, the deputy commissioner of police (south). A source said Ushas former help Pawan, also from Bihar, is accompanying the police team.        
	Kishan wanted to steal valuables but doesnt seem to have succeeded, added the officer.        
	Usha had called sister Rekha at 2pm and her body was found at 3pm. Kishan, assuming he is the killer, might have been in the flat when Rekhas driver came and pressed the doorbell around 2.40pm, said an investigating officer.        
	Usha was dead by then. But the sound of the doorbell made the killer panic and he fled without stealing anything, the officer added.        
	Ushas sons  Bharat and Nikhil  refused to comment when asked whether they suspect anyone.

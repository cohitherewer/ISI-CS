The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Knee-deep in distress
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Knee-deep in distress
  - 48 hours on, rainwater torments Behala pockets                                               
	Pockets in Behala have remained under water nearly 48 hours after heavy showers on Monday morning. Metro took stock of the situation:                 
	Where: Banamali Naskar Road        
	When: 1.15pm        
	What we saw: The area near Behala police station, including the lanes, was under water. The level varied from ankle-deep to knee-deep. The water has entered several houses and shops. Most shops were shut to minimise damage.        
	Woes: I have been living here for 35 years and have faced this situation every monsoon. The furniture has been badly damaged, said Somenath Mukherjee, who has not been able to open his sweet shop for two days.                
	Where: Dwijen Mukherjee Road        
	When: 1.50pm        
	What we saw: Dwijen Pally, a residential area near Parnasree, was under knee-deep water. Most residents had put up barricades to stop the water from entering their homes. The barricades were of little help, said homemaker Anima Das.        
	Those who hired sweepers to remove the water had to shell out between Rs 250 and Rs 350. Residents were seen parking their cars on Dwijen Mukherjee Road and entering the lanes on foot or on rickshaws. Power had been switched off in most houses to avoid short circuits.         
	Woes: My chamber is under ankle-deep water and I have not been able to meet clients for the past two days. Law books worth at least Rs 10,000 have been damaged, said advocate Sudip Banerjee. His niece Ronita could not go to school since Monday.                
	Where: Silpara Narayan Roy Road        
	When: 3.15pm        
	What we saw: The water was waist-deep in places. The western part of adjacent Diamond Harbour Road, from Silpara to Kadamtala, was submerged. As a result, the city-bound traffic was forced to take the other lane, creating chaos. Cars that had broken down were stranded by the side of the road. Lifts could not be operated in highrises like Aastha and Ritwika because of water accumulation in the basement. Ground floors of almost all the houses were flooded.        
	Woes: The water has entered my kitchen, drawing room and bedroom, damaging furniture and the refrigerator. I have sent my son to a relatives place, since the water will not recede before three days, said Deepankar Ganguly, a caterer. Spices and vegetables he had stocked in his house were damaged by the water, forcing him to cancel a party order on Wednesday.                  
	Where: Sashibhusan Road        
	When: 4pm        
	What we saw: Most of the civic taps were under water. Transportation was a problem, with only a handful of autorickshaws plying for triple the fare. Rickshawpullers were making the most of the occasion, charging Rs 60 for a journey from Silpara to Sashibhusan Road, which otherwise costs only Rs 7. A rickshawpuller said he earned Rs 1,200 on Tuesday. Many pedestrians fell into potholes and sustained injuries.        
	Woes: The other day, my sister-in-law fell off a rickshaw when it hit a pothole, said resident Madhusudan Hajra.

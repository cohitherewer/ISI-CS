The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No-dowry clause in admission rules
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No-dowry clause in admission rules

	A private English-medium school in the city has joined the crusade against dowry by introducing a rule that makes it mandatory for guardians of students seeking admission to state in writing that they will not be party to this regressive custom.        
	Rammohan Mission High School, a co-educational institution affiliated to the ICSE board, believes the practice of demanding dowry for marriage can be minimised, if not rooted out, through a campaign that catches them young.        
	Dowry is illegal but the system is widely practised and Calcutta is no exception. We want to start a campaign against the malpractice by motivating our students and their guardians, said Shankar Biswas, the president of Rammohan Mission, the trust that runs the school.         
	The 3,500 students on its rolls are being encouraged to report any instance of dowry being given or accepted in their neighbourhood.         
	The anti-dowry drive will be successful if schoolchildren are made to realise the negativity surrounding the system. Children will form an opinion against dowry early in life,psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee said .        
	The school authorities are, however, pragmatic about the prospects of the campaign.        
	We dont expect every guardian to abide by the undertaking after their wards leave school. Our main intention is to create awareness among them as well as the students. We believe that the campaign will definitely have a long-term impact on the minds of at least a section of the parents, Biswas said.         
	Students from Class IX and above have been asked to watch out for dowry being practised by their families and in their locality and pass on the information to their teachers. Volunteers will then contact the people involved and take appropriate steps.        
	The principal of Central Modern School, Nabarun Dey, hailed the initiative. The parents of our students know that dowry is a social evil. But dowry cases are on the rise. We, too, may start an awareness drive.        
	Rammohan Mission is involved in projects for improvement of position of women and eradication of social evils.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Watery ground beneath runway
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Watery ground beneath runway

	The ground water level at Calcutta airport has risen to six inches below the primary runway this monsoon, adding to safety concerns triggered by rubber deposits and patches of concrete peeling off the main tarmac.        
	One of the reasons for the surface becoming fragile is the rising water level under the runway. During monsoon, the condition is aggravated, and this is causing moisture accumulation on the runway, a senior airport official said on Sunday.        
	The water level has risen not because of excessive rain, though. The drainage system around the airport is getting clogged. Monsoon water is flowing back instead of being drained out, the official said.         
	Three clogged canals  the one that runs through Kaikhali and drains out in the Cantonment canal, another that courses through Salua, behind the airport, and a third that goes through Gopalpur  have been blamed for the problem.        
	We have completed the preliminary survey and found that clearing the channel leading to the Cantonment canal will help ease the problem, the official said.         
	Airport officials met representatives of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur and South Dum Dum municipalities recently to request them to take corrective steps.         
	Airport director V.K. Monga said runway safety had not been compromised, but immediate preventive action was necessary. New Town in Rajarhat is coming up in a big way and preventive measures need to be taken. So, joint inspections are being conducted to ensure there is no water accumulation near the runway.         
	The Airports Authority of India had recently advised pilots to exercise caution while landing on the main runway because of rubber deposits from plane tyres. The task of scraping rubber off the runway was to have begun last month itself, but was delayed by certain formalities.         
	Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality, said the channel leading to the Cantonment canal would have to be manually cleaned because excavators wouldnt go into the narrow passage.

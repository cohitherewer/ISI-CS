                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Math score: 11 to 61
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The marks in the mathematics paper of a Higher Secondary (HS) candidate changed from 11 to 61 after a court prod apparently prompted the examination authorities to fast-track the review process.        
	The high court had on July 22 asked the state HS council to produce the mathematics script of Sudisha Mondal on September 22.        
	But two days ago, Sudisha received a letter from the council which said her marks had increased from 11 to 61. The council also requested Sudisha to collect her revised marksheet.        
	Along with moving the court, the student had applied to the council for a review of the marks. In normal circumstances, she would have had to wait till the last week of August, when the review results are usually announced, to know about any change in her marks.        
	But Justice Soumitra Pals order asking the council to produce Sudishas scripts on September 22 seems to have prompted the authorities to expedite the review, said the students lawyer, Anindya Sundar Das.        
	The Haldia girl had passed Madhyamik in 2006 with 83 per cent marks.        
	In HS, she scored 75 in Bengali, 65 in English, 71 in chemistry, 63 in physics, 70 in biology, 82 in environment science but only 11 in mathematics. She could still clear the exam as the council made mathematics her fourth subject. It was initially her third subject, said Das.        
	According to the lawyer, Sudisha could not take admission in any reputable college because of her marks in mathematics. Confident that her answer script had not been properly evaluated, she applied for review and also moved a petition in the high court, said Das.        
	The lawyer will inform the judge about the change in the marks when the matter comes up for hearing on September 22. Since the announcement of the HS results in May, more than 100 students had moved court for orders asking the council to produce their scripts. The court granted the prayer in at least half the cases.

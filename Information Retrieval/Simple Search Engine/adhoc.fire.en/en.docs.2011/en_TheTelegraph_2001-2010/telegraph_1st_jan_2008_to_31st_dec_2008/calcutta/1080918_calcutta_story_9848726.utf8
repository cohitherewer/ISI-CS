          A STAFF REPORTER                          Numbers game: Students at Bhawanipur college                                  
	The fate of 1,700 students hangs in the balance with the case between Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College and Calcutta University (CU) over the reduction of B.Com seats pending in the high court.        
	The college had moved the court against CU after the university had directed it to reduce the number of B.Com seats from 2,000 to 300.         
	While students are anxiously waiting for classes to begin, sources in the college said on Wednesday that the authorities would not be able to take any decision till the court issues an order. The hearing was completed more than a week ago. We are expecting the order any day, said an official.        
	Many of the 2,000 first-year B.Com students flock to the college every day, hoping for information on the case. They alleged that the authorities are not revealing the details of the case.        
	Whenever we go to the college, they ask us to come two days later. When we turn up after two days, we are asked to come back later, said a student.        
	The students are afraid that time is running out and they would end up losing a year. The college has put up a notice announcing Puja holiday from October 4, which has worried the students even more.        
	If the college does not start by then, what are we going to do? asked a student.        
	Heena Gorsia, the college secretary, admitted that the institution is flooded with queries from B.Com students.        
	Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of CU, said the university will act according to the high court order.

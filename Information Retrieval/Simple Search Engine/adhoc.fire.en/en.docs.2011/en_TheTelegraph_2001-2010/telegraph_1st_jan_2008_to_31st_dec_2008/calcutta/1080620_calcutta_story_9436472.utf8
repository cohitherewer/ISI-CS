          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government has obtained an interim stay from the Supreme Court on a high court order to remove the Esplanade bus terminus. The state lawyer informed the high court about the stay when the case related to pollution around Victoria Memorial came up for hearing on Thursday.        
	A high court division bench headed by Justice Bha-skar Bhattacharya had on September 28 last year ordered the state government to shift the Esplanade bus terminus to a spot at least three km away from Victoria Memorial within six months. The ruling aimed at protecting the marble monument from air pollution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Destination Jaipur falls off travel map
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Destination Jaipur falls off travel map
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Hawa Mahal, in Jaipur, whose vicinity was ripped apart by one of Tuesdays serial blasts. (AFP)                                  
	Harish and Girish Sharma of Dobson Road, Howrah, have been spending their summer holidays with their grandparents in Jaipur since they started going to school. They wont do so this year.        
	The family was to board a flight to the Pink City this Saturday, but the serial blasts on Tuesday prompted their father to cancel the tickets.         
	Once I heard about the blasts and saw the images on television, cancelling the journey for now seemed the right thing to do, Narayan Sharma, a garment trader at the Howrah AC Market, said.        
	Narayan will now take his family to Vizag, a poor substitute for Jaipur, considering Harish and Girish wont find their grandparents there.        
	 We knew Jaipur to be a peaceful city. But right now, we think it is unsuitable for a visit, he said.         
	Summer is, in any case, not the ideal time to visit Jaipur, though that does not stop many Rajasthani families based in Calcutta from making their annual trips around this time. Going by the spate of cancellation requests received by travel agencies, most have altered their plans already.         
	Business travel has been affected, too. I have cancelled my booking for Thursday. I will travel after normality is restored, gemstone trader Ravi Saraf said.        
	Nobody from Calcutta has been reported missing or dead in the blasts. As of now, we are not aware of any Calcuttan being on the casualty or injured list, Sundeep Bhutoria, the secretary of the Rajasthan Foundation, said.        
	Tuesdays blasts killed 63 people and left over 200 injured.

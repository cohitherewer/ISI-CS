          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Galiff Street. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Galiff Street, one of the few north Calcutta roads that remain almost virgin territory for business, could be the answer to both traffic snarls at the Shyambazar five-point crossing and the lack of commercial space in that area.        
	As the traffic bosses work on a plan to convert Galiff Street into an artery of BT Road, owners of buildings on the route are licking their chops at the prospect of a business boom. The architecture department of Jadavpur University has been asked to draft the blueprint for reconstruction of that cobbled stretch of road.        
	Once the new traffic regulations take effect, Bhupen Bose Avenue will be a one-way corridor for CR Avenue-bound buses and minibuses from Sinthee More, Dunlop Bridge, Hooghly, Dakshineswar and Sodepur. The return journey to BT Road will be be through Galiff Street. The idea is to ease the burden at Shyambazar five-point crossing.        
	Traffic planners believe diverting BT Road-bound traffic from CR Avenue through Galiff Street would reduce the number of buses and minibuses going through the five-point crossing by over 15,000 a day.         
	During peak hours, it takes a vehicle between 15 and 20 minutes to cover the stretch from the Galiff Street intersection to the five-point crossing and get past the signal.        
	The Shyambazar crossing is the gateway to Calcutta for vehicles coming from the north through BT Road. Metro Rail connectivity from Shyambazar onwards contributes to the rush, said Madhumita Roy, a professor in Jadavpur Universitys architecture department.         
	Since the northern fringes are connected to Calcutta by a lone bridge, there is not much scope for altering the traffic circulation in north Calcutta. The main advantage of utilising Galiff Street lies in the fact that the Canal West Road diversion of APC Road starts from the opposite side of the BT Road intersection, said local MLA Sadhan Pande.        
	The economic prospects of Galiff Street will be better once it becomes a busy bus route, he added. Housing minister Goutam Deb initiated the Rs 1-crore project.

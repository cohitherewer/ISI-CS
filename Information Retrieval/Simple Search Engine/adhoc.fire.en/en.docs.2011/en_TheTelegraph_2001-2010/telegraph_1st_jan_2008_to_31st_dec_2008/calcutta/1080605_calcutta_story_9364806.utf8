  - University guide on admission rules to be launched next week          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University (CU) will publish an information booklet on courses offered by affiliated colleges, in a bid to simplify the admission process.        
	The booklet will provide students with information on the number of seats in each course in each college, eligibility criteria, admission procedure, other subjects that can be studied, pass marks in university examinations and the provision for appearing in supplementary examinations.         
	Our main aim is to ensure that students have a clear idea of the rules before they are admitted to the time they graduate, said a senior official of the university.        
	Till last year, colleges provided all the admission and course related information.        
	Sources in CU said many students make gross mistakes while filling up entry forms.        
	For example, they opt for combinations of subjects that cannot be taken. Sometimes colleges, also ignorant of the rules, allow students to study wrong combinations of subjects. These students get stuck when the university refuses to allow them to sit for Part I. At that stage, the students can only apply for special permission or take legal help.        
	Many students also do not know about how much they need to score to clear the university examinations, said a CU official.        
	Students can refer to the booklet if they have doubts at any stage of their course, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The booklet, priced at Rs 5, will be available at colleges and the sales counter of CU on the College Street campus.        
	The university had planned to release the booklet on Thursday. The launch was deferred till next week after the consecutive bandhs were called on Thursday and Friday, added the official.

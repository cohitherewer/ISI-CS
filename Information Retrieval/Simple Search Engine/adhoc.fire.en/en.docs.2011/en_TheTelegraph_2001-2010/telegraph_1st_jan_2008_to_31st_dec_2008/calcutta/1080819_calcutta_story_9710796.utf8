                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trapped cleaners rescued from sewer

	Seven young men cleaning a sewage line under EM Bypass without protective equipment were trapped underground after losing their way on Monday morning.         
	They managed to thrust a stick out through a gap in a manhole cover, about 100 metres from the spot near Salt Lake stadium where they had entered the sewage line, drawing the attention of a traffic policeman.         
	Around 10.20am, I noticed a stick bobbing through a manhole cover and realised that someone was trapped below, said Samudra Sen, an officer of Beleghata Traffic Guard.        
	Around the same time, some youths came running to him and told him that seven of them had not come out after going down a nearby manhole half an hour back. Sen immediately informed senior officers and the control rooms.Teams from Beleghata Traffic Guard and Beleghata police station rushed to the spot. After an officer prised the manhole cover open with an iron bar, one of the youths went down.        
	The trapped seven, aged between 22 and 27, were soon pulled out with the help of residents. Most of them collapsed on the road.        
	A civic official said a contractor working on sewage development under the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP) employed the seven to clean the sewage channel.        
	We have sought a report from the contractor on whether steps were taken for the safety of the workers engaged in the project, said Shantanu Basu, the director of the project.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three undertrials were injured in a scuffle among six on Thursday morning, while they were being taken to the sessions court from Presidency jail in a prison van. One of them had a blade.        
	Three undertrials arrested in a dacoity case injured the ones arrested in a murder case in Shyampukur. One of them had to be admitted to hospital with abdominal wounds.        
	The fight broke out when the van was heading towards the court along Red Road. Raju Paswan, Niraj Gupta and Rajesh Prajapati, arrested in connection with a dacoity, suddenly attacked Raju Saha, Uttam Sardar and Ananda Biswas, who were said to be their rivals.        
	The undertrials were being taken for a scheduled hearing. Sub-inspector Lakhinder Soren of the Reserve Force was accompanying the inmates, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Saha, Sardar and Biswas were taken to hospital where Saha had to be admitted. But the other two were released after first-aid.        
	A case has been registered with Maidan police station against the six undertrials. We are yet to recover the blade, said a police officer.        
	According to Goyal, the sub-inspector who was in charge of escorting the undertrials will have to explain how one of the accused boarded the van with a blade. Soren was supposed to check every undertrial for arms before allowing him inside the prison van, he said.

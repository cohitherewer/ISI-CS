The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Law does not humane make 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We Ask You Answer      Law does not humane make 
          Todays question: Should bystanders be punished if they do not take an accident victim to hospital?                                                      
	PB Saha, Salt Lake									      
	Its the police on duty who are supposed to take the lead in taking accident victims to hospital for treatment. But, cops are not expected to be present at every site where accidents take place. In such cases it is the moral responsibility of the bystanders to help the person. The act is voluntary and by no means binding.               
	Pritha Gupta, Paikpara Row        
	There is no question of punishment. Helping an accident victim should come naturally to people. If it doesnt, then the nation has a serious problem because if humanity does not exist, a civilised society becomes a distant dream. But most Calcuttans come to the rescue of the injured without bothering about consequences.      
	A.S. MEHTA, New Alipore									      
	Bystanders should not be punished; instead changes in the system should be made so that when bystanders take a victim to hospital he is not harassed by the police. Once the rules are changed, everyone would certainly help accident victims. Unlike other metros, Calcutta still has a human face.       
	Dilip Kumar Biswas, Green Park									      
	Bystanders should not be punished if they do not help accident victims. It is every civilised persons moral duty to rescue another individual.              
	S. Sinha Dutta, Golf Green         
	In recent times, there is a dearth of sympathetic souls in Calcutta. An accident victim needs compassionate citizens, not mute spectators. I think even the harshest punishment in the world cannot teach a person to be benevolent. Bystanders refrain from helping people because they fear harassment from the authorities. I feel people need assurance from the authorities rather than punishment.             
	Prantik Sanyal,SP Mukherjee Road  
	Why should innocent bystanders be punished? It is solely the responsibility of the state to help such people. If there is an accident, on humanitarian grounds, one may inform the local police. Everyone should carry their personal details, especially emergency contact number, on them.   
	Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake									      
	I think it will be difficult to identify the real bystanders. However, it is neither desirable nor acceptable that they be punished. It is a question of humanity. Instead of being punished, the bystanders may be called to the police station and lectured on morality. The police can undertake a drive to eradicate such mean-mindedness.       
	Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur									      
	There is no dearth of good citizens who are ever-willing to take an accident victim to hospital but refrain from doing so for the fear of police. If the victim passes away while in transit or even at the hospital itself, the samaritan gets treated like a criminal. Let the police commissioner first publicly declare that his force will act rationally and the world will soon witness the kind heart of Bengalis who are eager to stand by people in distress. No one has the right to punish bystanders.       
	Shaioni Sarkar, Vivek Park									        
	Taking an accident victim to the hospital is the duty of every civilian. It is expected that people will come forward to help an accident victim rather than be mute spectators, and if they do not do so it will be their disgrace. No one can do anything by punishing those people.         
	Nikhilesh Pathak, Sodepur         
	It is not justified that bystanders be punished if they do not take an accident victim to hospital. If a person brings an accident victim to hospital, then he or she is interrogated unnecessarily, by the hospital authorities as well as the police.               
	Suranjan Bonnerjee, Salt Lake        
	No law is necessary to motivate bystanders to attend to an accident victim. It is the moral duty of a person to take immediate action and inform the victims relatives. But mostly people avoid this because of fear of police harassment and legal procedures.             
	Debasish Chakraborty,Cossipore  
	Bystanders should willingly come forward to take an accident victim to the hospital. The people who are helping the victim should be spared police harassment. The administration should take care of that or arrange for the treatment of accident victims.   
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee, Konnagar									      
	Bystanders should not be punished because in spite of deep sympathy for an accident victim they cannot help for fear of unnecessary police interrogation. I think, the government should declare an award for bystanders who take accident victims to hospitals.            
	Rathin Chatterjee,Dum Dum   
	Man today is very self-centred. So we dont see anyone coming forward to help accident victims. But we should remember that one is dependent on another at every step of life. Selfishness cannot be rectified by punishment. It depends on our conscience.           
	Sourish Misra,Salt Lake        
	Recently we have seen some accidents where the common people did not help an accident victim. But on the whole Calcuttans are always helpful. It has been seen during major accidents that bystanders not only helped the victims but were the first to reach the spot and take action. They had even helped police and the fire brigade in rescuing the wounded. I think bystanders should be punished if they do not help an accident victim.               
	Gitanshu Naskar,Howrah        
	Bystanders do not help accident victims because they dont have the time to take unknown people to hospitals hampering their own busy schedules. But at times they are also scared of the harassment at the hands of the police and the hospital authorities that they may face. So there is no question of punishing a bystander. The legal system should be changed so that people can come forward to help others.              
	P. Pramanik,Santoshpur Avenue        
	No certainly not. Citizens shirk the responsibility only to avoid police harassment and hospital apathy. I am an ambulance officer of St John Ambulance Brigade for the past 10 years. I aspire to help road accident victims but hesitate to take up the responsibility for these reasons.               
	Pankaj Bhatia,Loudon Street        
	During an accident, arson and police lathicharge always take place which scare off people wanting to help the accident victims.              
	Gautam Ghosh,Banku Bihari Ghosh Lane        
	In todays world, we have no time to spare for others. But we must have fellow-feeling for others in distress. Humanity is an ocean. If a few drops are dirty, that does not mean that the whole ocean is.

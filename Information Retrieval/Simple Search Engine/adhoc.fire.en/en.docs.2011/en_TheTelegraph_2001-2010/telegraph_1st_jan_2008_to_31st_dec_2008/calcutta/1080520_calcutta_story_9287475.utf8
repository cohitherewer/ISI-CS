The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Southern streets dark risks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Southern streets dark risks
                                          
	The lights on some of the busiest roads in south Calcutta do not ever light up. The authorities either pass the buck or just feign ignorance. Metro drives down the dangerous stretches to experience the plight of motorists at night.                
	Where: Burdwan Road        
	When: 9.30pm        
	What we saw: More than half the lights on the stretch between Alipore Road and the Diamond Harbour Road crossing are non-functional. There are three risky turns where, residents complain, accidents are a daily affair.        
	The situation turns worse after 10pm, when trucks are allowed to ply on the road. Motorists often bump into one another while jostling with trucks for space and struggling to locate turns, said Netai Samanta, a guard at a highrise on the stretch.                
	Where: Majerhat flyover        
	When: 9.50pm        
	What we saw: The northern end is lit by only three lamps, while the southern end is dark. Its scary at night, when the stretch is taken over by racing trucks, said Behala resident Sabir Ali, who often drives down the stretch on his two-wheeler. Driving in the dark, we get blinded by the powerful headlights of the trucks.        
	Copspeak: With the lights not functioning, the stretch is among the most dangerous in the city. Early this month, a truck rammed into a car, killing its driver, said an officer of Alipore police station.                
	Where: Deshapran Sashmal Road        
	When:10.20pm        
	What we saw: There are no lights along the north-bound lane of the road between Tollygunge Metro Railway station and the Prince Anwar Shah Road crossing.        
	The darkness, heavy traffic and work on relaying tram tracks make the stretch risky for pedestrians and motorists. Every time I travel down the stretch, I pray for safe passage, said Kasba resident Gouranga Mondal, who works in Metro Railway.                 
	Where: Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector        
	When:10.45pm        
	What we saw: Only three street lights were seen lit up on the stretch between the Jadavpur police station crossing and the Sapuipara junction. Motorists often meet with accidents while negotiating the pothole-ridden stretch in the dark.         
	Its so dark that I dont feel safe even walking down the road. Snatchings and murders, too, are quite frequent on the thoroughfare, said Sananda Dasgupta, a resident of Dhakuria East Road.        
	Councillorspeak: For the past month, I have been asking the mayoral council member in charge of lights to repair the lamps on the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector. But nothing has happened. I will take up the matter again, said Sunil Chandra Chakraborty, the councillor of ward 105.        
	Officialspeak: I havent come across any complaints of ill-lit streets. I will look into the matter, said P.J. Biswas, the chief engineer (lights) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

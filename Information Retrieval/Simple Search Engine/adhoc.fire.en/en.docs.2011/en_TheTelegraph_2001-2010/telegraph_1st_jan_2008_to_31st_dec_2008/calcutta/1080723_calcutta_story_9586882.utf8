          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two warring groups of youths threw bombs and fired at policemen who tried to restrain them at Watgunge on Monday night. Outnumbered and on the retreat, the cops too fired three rounds.        
	Amit Kumar Das, a resident of the area, was hit by a bullet. Seven policemen were also injured.        
	Trouble started around 11.30pm when local youths Sahabuddin, alias Sahab, and Vivek Singh, alias Vicky, picked a fight over settling their bill at an illegal liquor shop in Watgunge. Vickys friends in the area beat up Sahab, who fled to his locality.         
	He returned to the shop with his friends and started exchanging blows with the other group, said an officer.         
	 The fisticuffs continued till 1.30am, when seven officers of Watgunge police station led by the additional officer-in-charge reached the spot.        
	Both groups then attacked the police. Seven policemen, including the additional officer-in-charge, were injured. The injured local resident is being treated at SSKM Hospital, said deputy commissioner (port) Anand Kumar.        
	The Rapid Action Force had to be used to bring the situation under control. Tension prevailed till Tuesday morning, when some youths smashed the windscreens of two private buses. Section 144 was imposed on the area in the evening.        
	Over 50 people have been detained. An investigation is on to ascertain whether there was a gunfight. We are trying to find out what triggered off the violence. A couple of days ago, members of both groups had fought over an eve-teasing incident, said the deputy commissioner.         
	Residents blamed the police for allowing illegal liquor shops to operate in the area. Some of the shops remain open round-the-clock. Criminals from several parts of the city visit these shops at night but police look the other way, said Abid Hussain, a resident.         
	Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the CPM councillor of the area, said: Some criminals created problems in the locality. Such activities cannot be tolerated.

                Arindam Banerjee, 24, of Chandranath Chatterjee Street, in Kalighat, was found unconscious in his room late on Wednesday. He was taken to Shambhunath Pandit Hospital and then to SSKM, where doctors pronounced him dead. Preliminary investigations suggest Banerjee had committed suicide by consuming poison. Police said he was a psychiatric patient, suffering from depression since the death of his aunt.    The body of a 50-year-old woman, who died in North Suburban Hospital two days ago, could not be handed over to her family members as the address provided by them was false, police said on Thursday. The hospital was told that Labonilata Dass address was 99/H/44 Cossipore Road. However, a police inquiry revealed that nobody of that name resided at the address.    Two days after a grenade was found abandoned in the Howrah station area, armymen from Fort William took it away to defuse it. Four armymen examined the grenade on Thursday afternoon and said it would take at least a 300-ft-radius area for defusing it. They decided to take the grenade to Barrackpore.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Pritam Ruz: The right to know. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	An examinee is entitled to see his evaluated answer scripts under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, Calcutta High Court ruled on Friday.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee, while delivering the order, directed Calcutta University to show the script of mathematics paper V (B.Sc) to Pritam Ruz, who had appeared in the graduation Part II exams from Presidency College last year.        
	Students are under great stress while writing the test. At times, they dont even realise what they are writing. So, they must have the right to know whether they had made any mistakes, Justice Banerjee observed. The RTI Act, based on Article 19 of the Constitution, empowers citizens to know facts.        
	Pritam had scored 28 in mathematics paper V. He sought a review, after which the marks increased to 32. But the revised marks did not please him either, and he pleaded with the university to show him the script.        
	The authorities turned down his plea, prompting Pritam to move court on March 4. He claimed that the RTI Act bestowed on him the right to know whether his scripts were properly evaluated or not.         
	Pritams lawyer, Satadal Chattopadhya, argued that the universitys decision went against the act and hence, was unconstitutional.        
	Appearing for the university, Sambuddha Chakraborty said the institutes regulations should not be challenged in court. Pritam, now an M.Sc student, said: The ruling will benefit many students.        
	Riz case: The final hearing in the Rizwanur Rahman death case in the high court has been adjourned till April 2.

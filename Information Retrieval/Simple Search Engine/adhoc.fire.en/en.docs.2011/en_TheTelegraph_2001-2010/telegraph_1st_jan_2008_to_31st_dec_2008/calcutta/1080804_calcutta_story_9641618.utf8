          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 55-year-old leprosy patient living on the streets after being thrown out by his family had to be removed to a home by doms after police and residents refused to touch him when his condition worsened on Saturday.        
	Manoj Dey had been lying on the footpath in front of 15/12 Muraripukur Road, under Maniktala police station area, for six months and surviving on handouts by residents of the area.        
	Some of them alerted the police on Saturday after realising that Deys condition had deteriorated. He was lying unconscious. A foul smell was emanating from his wounds. Fearing that the disease might spread, we decided not to go close to him, said a resident.        
	Two constables from the police station reached the spot. The policemen stood on the footpath, several feet away from the man. Instead of going close to him, they asked us to carry the patient to their van, said another resident.        
	One of the constables went to a nearby slum and came back with some doms who live there. They carried Dey to the van. The policemen drove him to a leprosy-unit run by the Missionaries of Charity in Park Circus.        
	The police claimed that the doms were summoned since it was not possible for the two constables to lift Dey.        
	The residents of the area did not show any responsibility. Since no one came forward to help us, we had no option but to call the doms, said an officer of the police station.        
	Dey could not provide much information about himself except that he was thrown out of home by his relatives. He had become weak because of the disease and from living in the streets, added the officer.        
	When we first noticed him, his hands and feet were wrapped in clothes. We later found out that he was suffering from leprosy. Since it is an infectious disease, we did not dare to touch him. None of us mustered enough courage to interact with him, said Baboni Roy, a resident.        
	We used to throw food like bread and roti in front of him. He was not in a position to walk. We used to see him lying on the pavement, sometimes groaning in pain, said Roy.        
	Most people still do not know that leprosy is mostly non-contagious. Servants, for example, are still fired as soon as they are diagnosed with the disease. But only five to 10 per cent of leprosy cases spread by touch, said city-based dermatologist Subrata Malakar.

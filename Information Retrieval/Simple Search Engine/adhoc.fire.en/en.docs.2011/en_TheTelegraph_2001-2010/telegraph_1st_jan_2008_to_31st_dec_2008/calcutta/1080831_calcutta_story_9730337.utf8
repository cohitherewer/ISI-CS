                            A digital collage of marriage photographs and (below) a man photographed against a backdrop				                                 
	Travel back in time to change the colour of your wedding sari or delete the bore who insisted on standing between you and him in your school group photo, acquire the perfect skin tone and figure without turning a hair, or be photographed by the Niagara while still at Nagerbazar the range of options is limitless.         
	Just anything is possible at modern photographic studios where painted scenes and photographic colour have given way to the myriad magic of Photoshop and other software.        
	Struggling to stay afloat is the century-old Das Studio in Bhowanipore. Up a narrow flight of ill-lit stairs, owner Salil Das still doubts the worth of the newly acquired computer. They get too few orders to justify the signboard that announces them as photographers.         
	Most people have digital cameras these days and people only come for instant passport photos, says Das, who remembers Subhas Chandra Bose had had his photo taken within these walls as did screen actor Ranjit Mullick and his family.         
	Before Independence, taking a photograph was a family affair with everyone turning out in his or her best the day the photographer was called in. The photograph after all had to represent family prestige. Not just the clothes but ornamental furniture and accessories like a book or a cane helped to boost the image.         
	Our studio had wall-to-wall painted scenes before which customers would pose. Most popular were the garden and seaside view canvases. Sure we used to touch up the negatives when there were scratch marks and one unwritten rule was to make the clients look as beautiful as possible. So as a matter of course we made the skin colours lighter, reddened lips and obliterated wrinkles etc, says Das.         
	Choosing the right grade of paper from the 35 or more available made a difference. One used photographic paint and brushes to touch up the prints. The process was long-winded. It took a minimum of 15 days to just see what one had taken, says Das.        
	These days people can see what they have taken within seconds of clicking the digital camera. This has seriously affected our business. People might take 500 photographs, download them into their computers and print only the ones they need, says Arup Bhowmick of Zoom 16 Colour Film Laboratory near Golpark. Some cellphone cameras are so good that photographs taken in daylight are indistinguishable from those taken with digital cameras. We get orders to print from micro SD cards and most are okay for 8 inch by 12 inch prints, says Ashesh Haldar of Zoom.         
	At Zoom most of the work is centred around processing, designing and printing. Few want to be photographed in studios. They give raw photographs to be touched up.         
	Sometimes they ask us to remove spots, make the face look fair, increase the volume of hair. There are orders for converting black-and-white photographs to colour, restore damaged photographs, select and develop single photographs from groups. Sometimes there are requests to change the colour of clothes and even paste ones face to a body of ones choice,  says Deepika Das, an expert in making people appear just as beautiful as they like to be.        
	Who said photographs cannot lie? Reality merges smoothly with fantasy on the computer screen. Haldar is busy giving a late grandmother an image makeover. A gilded volume of the Gita would replace the child in the arms of the octogenarian in the original photograph. The homely walls of the sitting room would be digitally converted into a temple facade.         
	Haldar had downloaded the Gita a long time ago. Beautiful landscapes, picture frames and swastikas are valued acquisitions.         
	Background and colour depend on the clients taste. On the current hot list, especially among non-Bengali communities, are DMs or digitally-mixed images.         
	A collage of several wedding photographs on a wall could seem a better option than a cumbersome album. Orders for 20 inch by 32 inch-DM prints vaguely remind you of film posters. One couple even chose the font one gets to see in horror film titles, laughs Haldar.         
	Another popular DM is of kids either in different moods or selected photos from various ages. Charges vary according to the number of photographs used and designs selected.         
	There are software with samples of hairstyle, skin colour, nose, lips etc. These are used by police to draw up portraits of suspects. One has to just select and double click, says Haldar.        
	A software Bhowmick got from abroad does the digital mixing automatically, albeit to certain standard patterns. One can use video clips, stills anything, and the software will design it into a 28 page album.         
	But with all these software available and people growing more computer savvy what is the future of studios? The photography market is certainly drying up but the studios expertise is still necessary for printing and designing. Big companies entrust us with their printing and touching up jobs. The software I spoke of cannot be used without a dongle. So even if you have the CD, you have to come to us, smiles Bhowmick.

                A nurse at Habra State General Hospital gave an injection to a newborn on Thursday that was meant for her mother. After Iti Das, 22, gave birth to the girl, the doctor asked nurse Tapasi Mondal to give Das an Anti-D injection as her blood group was different from the babys. But Mondal gave the injection to the infant instead. The mistake was discovered when Das noticed the baby had become restless. The baby was shifted to BC Roy Hospital after her condition deteriorated. She is stable now. The superintendent of the Habra hospital said action would be taken against the nurse.    Howrah and Sealdah-bound Rajdhani trains, which were scheduled to arrive at 9.55am and 10.15am, respectively, were delayed by over seven hours on Thursday. Trains services on the Calcutta-Delhi route were disrupted after a goods train was derailed near Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday.

A Class XII student of Yogesh Chandra Girls High School in Howrah attempted suicide by slitting her wrist with a razor after she failed to clear the selection test. An assistant teacher stopped her from inflicting graver injury. She was given first-aid and sent home.    Police officers spoke to students of Ballygunge Siksha Sadan as part of an awareness drive on coping with an emergency. Top cops also met the authorities of La Martiniere School for Boys and spoke about security measures to be undertaken.

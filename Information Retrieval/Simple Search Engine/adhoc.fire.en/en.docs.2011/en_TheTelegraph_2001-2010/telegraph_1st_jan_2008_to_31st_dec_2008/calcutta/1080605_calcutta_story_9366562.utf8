The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Honk up the wrong track
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Honk up the wrong track
  - On Environment Day, clean air and less noise by default          JAYANTA BASU                                                  
	A group of conservationists in Australia will get into World Environment Day action on Thursday with a corporate breakfast at Adelaide Zoo, an Atlanta-based organisation specialising in sanitation technology will make a public presentation called Lets Talk Toilets! and the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards will spend the day advertising the British governments tax-free bicycle purchase scheme.         
	If you think Environment Day activities cant get more attention-grabbing than this, pause for a moment to consider the impact of what Bengal has done. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments heart bleeds for our environment; so, instead of a token no-horn hour, it has gone the whole hog and declared a bandh. There will be no vehicles on the road and, therefore, no emission and no honking. A masterstroke which, alas, will ease the pressure on our lungs and ears only for a day!        
	Heres a Metro checklist of the big  and real  picture...        
	Auto emission         
	Apart from lip service, the government has done little to control auto emission. It has actually encouraged it, a case in point being the environment departments U-turn on the no-PUC-no-diesel notification at the behest of transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys department. Less than 20 per cent of the vehicles on city roads have pollution-under-control certificates.         
	Between 50 and 70 per cent of the five lakh tonnes of pollutants released into the citys air every year is from vehicles, says environmentalist Subhas Dutta.         
	Alternative fuel         
	The first to prepare an action plan for alternative fuel (CNG/LPG), Bengal is the last of the metros when it comes to implementing it. Calcutta does not have any CNG outlet yet, but LPG for vehicles was introduced in 2004. In the four years since then, barely 3,500 autorickshaws and 5,000 cars have switched to LPG.         
	The transport department has fixed several deadlines for converting autos to LPG but nothing has come of it. Autos running on adulterated fuel (kata tel) continue to choke our lungs, says emission expert S.M. Ghosh.         
	Noise nuisance         
	A city that was considered a model in combating noise pollution a decade ago is now the countrys noise capital. Forget general noise violations, norms are routinely flouted even in the designated no-honking zones like hospitals and schools. A few months ago, a soiree was organised under government patronage close to SSKM Hospital.        
	Noise is controlled effectively everywhere, except in our city. Our government seems to have no interest in controlling noise pollution; rather it is abetting the curse, says Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, the man who pronounced a pioneering judgment on controlling noise pollution.        
	Wetland filling        
	So what if the chief minister has warned realtors against trying to grab water bodies and wetlands? In reality, even parts of the East Calcutta Wetlands, a Ramsar site, are being filled up. From the sprawling Bilkanda wetlands in the north to small water bodies in Behala and Tangra, no vacant space escapes the realtors lusty gaze.

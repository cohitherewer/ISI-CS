The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU freezer for fresher food 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JU freezer for fresher food 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A cold store for fish                                   
	Years of research by scientists at Jadavpur Universitys Centre for Rural and Cryogenic Technologies has culminated in a low-cost liquid nitrogen plant that promises to change the way perishables are stored.        
	Farmers, flower traders, and fish and vegetable sellers will benefit the most from this invention, said Siddhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor of the university and the centre head.        
	The USP of the liquid nitrogen plant is its ability to rapidly freeze anything that goes into it. That will help maintain the freshness of vegetables and fish for a longer time than in a conventional freezer, Dutta said.        
	Perishables like fish and vegetables can be preserved in their freshest state for more than 50 hours if kept in special containers fitted with liquid nitrogen-filled devices.        
	The quest for a low-cost liquid nitrogen plant had begun in 2004. Our scientists made the plant operational last week. The minimum budget for a plant of this kind used to be Rs 1 crore. Thanks to our pioneering technology, a plant can now be set up for Rs 16-20 lakh, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.        
	The focus of research at the Centre for Rural and Cryogenic Technologies is rural development. The team of scientists behind the liquid nitrogen plant had begun their research by visiting rural markets. They discovered that farmers and small traders were facing losses mainly because of inadequate cold-storage facilities.        
	We noticed that most fish traders of Calcutta who procure supplies from Diamond Harbour and Canning use only blocks of ice to keep the stocks fresh. But by the time the fish reaches the city markets, a considerable amount goes to waste, Dutta said.         
	Flower traders of Howrah and Midnapore, and vegetable traders from the neighbouring districts face the same problem.        
	We expect the low-cost freezing devices to be used extensively, Dutta said.        
	The new technology will also be used to store medicines and surgical equipment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kin in jail, Todi bail in balance

	Ashok Todis brother Pradip and relative Anil Saraogi landed in Presidency jail on Monday after surrendering before the 17th metropolitan magistrate at Bankshal court.        
	The duo turned up in court even as Todis bail plea on health grounds  he has been lodged in the jail hospital  was being debated in the high court by the two judges who were to take a decision on it. Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar later decided to refer the bail application to a third judge.        
	Pradip and Anil were remanded in judicial custody till Friday and shifted to Presidency jail late in the afternoon. Another accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case, Pappu, is also lodged there.        
	As the one-line remand order issued by metropolitan magistrate Anupam Maiti was being read out, Pradip, wearing a white shirt, sat on the bench next to Anil.        
	The CBI counsel, Partha Tapaswi, had argued that both Anil and Pradip deserved to be sent to jail for trying to break up a marriage between two consenting adults of different religions.        
	There was drama in the high court, too, when Justice A.K. Talukdar accepted Todis bail plea but his colleague, Justice P.S. Banerjee, rejected it. The investigation by the CBI into Rizwanur Rahmans suicide is over. So I find there is no need to keep the petitioner (Todi) in custody now, Justice Talukdar said.        
	But Justice Banerjee opposed the bail plea, saying Todi might tamper with the evidence collected by the CBI against him and the other accused, including three police officers. All of them have been charged with driving Rizwanur, Todis son-in-law, to suicide.         
	It has been alleged that the petitioner spent huge amounts of money to break up Rizwanurs marriage with Priyanka (his daughter). If he is granted bail, he may spend money to tamper with evidence in the case, Justice Banerjee said.        
	The chief justice will set up a special bench to hear the bail application.

                A domestic help, who was appointed to take care of a 92-year-old woman at her Vivekananda Road home, was arrested on Wednesday for stealing gold ornaments worth Rs 1 lakh. Police said the ailing womans daughter had kept the ornaments in a cupboard. Swapna De, the accused, disappeared three days ago and the jewellery was missing. Police raided her home in the Girish Park area and arrested her. The booty was recovered.     To meet the rush of passengers during the festive season, Eastern Railway will attach extra coaches to nine trains, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. These include the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Howrah-New Delhi Express, West Bengal Sampark Kranti Express, Uttarbanga Express, Kanchankanya Express and Jammu Tawi Express. Five other express trains, including the Farakka Express (via Faizabad), Farakka Express (via Sultanpur) and the Gangasagar Express, will also get extra coaches.    Central Calcutta and parts of north Calcutta saw huge traffic snarls for two hours on Wednesday afternoon because of a rally organised by members of Sara Bangla Paricharika Samity. Police said hundreds of women working as domestic help assembled at Sealdah station at noon and proceeded to Rani Rashmoni Avenue, where they held a meeting. They demanded identity cards, railway monthly tickets at a concession, old-age allowance and health insurance policy.     A 50-year-old woman, Minakshi Ghosh, was seriously injured after being hit by a private bus near the Sinthee crossing on Wednesday. Ghosh was taken to Baranagar General Hospital. Police said the bus driver fled. The vehicle was impounded.     Two van drivers and two transport operators were arrested on Wednesday for carrying 1,500 kg of banned fireworks to the city. Sleuths of the detective department, who received a tip-off about the consignment, laid a trap on Tarachand Dutta Road, in the Jorasanko police station area, early on Wednesday. After arresting the drivers, the cops raided the office of the two transport operators  Sanjay Jain and Hareram Mishra  and arrested them.

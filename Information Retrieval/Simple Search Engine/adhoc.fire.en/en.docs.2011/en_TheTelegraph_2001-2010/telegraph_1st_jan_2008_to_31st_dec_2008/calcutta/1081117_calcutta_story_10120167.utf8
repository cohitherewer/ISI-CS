The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flashpoint for Sikkim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flashpoint for Sikkim
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Whether Calcutta can see Sikkim on Monday or not will only be known during the day. Things looked bleak till late on Sunday with Nandan voicing doubts over the censor certificate obtained by the American Center from the Sikkim Royal Trust and a no-objection nod still awaited from Delhi.        
	We have not received the no-objection certificate from the government yet. Also, we are not convinced by the papers that the American Center has provided us with and that is why we are yet to get a positive signal from the information and broadcasting ministry. If we get the green signal, we will screen Sikkim on Monday, said Nilanjan Chatterjee, the Nandan CEO and director of the 14th Calcutta Film Festival.         
	Besides, the American Center hadnt even included Sikkim in its list of films to be screened at the festival.        
	Responding to Nandans allegation, American Centers audio-visual section chief Nilanjan Hazra said: Its entirely up to Nandan to decide about the screening. Nandan has informed us that they have sent our papers to Delhi for verification, which means they are not convinced. We have obtained the no-objection papers from the copyright-holders of Sikkim.        
	Rays 60-minute documentary film was banned by the Congress-led Indian government as well as the Sikkim royalty in 1971.        
	If the central government gives the go-ahead and Nandan the nod, Sikkim will have its first public screening on Monday.

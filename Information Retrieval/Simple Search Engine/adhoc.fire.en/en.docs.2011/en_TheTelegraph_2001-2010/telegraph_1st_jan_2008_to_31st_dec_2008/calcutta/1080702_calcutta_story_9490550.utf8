                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Threats force couple to stay silent
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Rahmat Ali and wife Amina Bibi are still being threatened not to lodge an FIR against the drunken trio who harassed, abused and assaulted them on Sunday night.         
	None of the youths who tormented the young couple at Bagmari burial ground has been arrested, though police identified one of them.         
	The couple had gone to meet Rahmats parents who stay in the staff quarters of the burial ground.         
	We are living in fear. Some youths came this morning and abused me for talking to the media and threatened to kill us if we lodged a complaint. We are poor and cannot risk antagonising them, said Rahmat, who works in a Maniktala garage.         
	They had threatened us on Sunday night in front of the cops at Maniktala police station. Instead of taking action against the trio, the duty officer asked us to settle the issue amicably, he added.         
	Rahmats father Imam Ali Gazi said: My wife is in shock. Local police are hand-in-glove with the trio. They have asked me to settle the issue mutually and I have to accept it.         
	Metro had on Tuesday reported how a 20-strong gang turned up at Maniktala police station on Sunday night and threatened the couple with dire consequences if they lodged a complaint. The accused trio were then present in the police statio.         
	The cops allegedly asked Rahmat to settle the issue mutually. Later, they registered a general diary, which only mentioned a disturbance outside Bagmari burial ground.         
	Senior officers on Tuesday said they were unaware of the incident. I havent heard about it but will look into the matter, said joint police commissioner (administration) P.K. Chatterjee.         
	An officer of Maniktala police station said the trio are backed by local CPM leaders. We have identified one as Amanullah. But since the couple have not lodged any complaint, we cannot act against the youths, said Kamal Kumar Patra, the officer-in-charge of Maniktala police station.         
	He refused comment when told that the police themselves had dissuaded the couple from lodging an FIR.

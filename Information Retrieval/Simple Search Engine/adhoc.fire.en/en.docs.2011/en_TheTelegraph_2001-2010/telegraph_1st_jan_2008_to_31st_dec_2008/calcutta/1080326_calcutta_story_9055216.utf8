A painter and print-maker in his own right, Bhatt records village customs, rituals, arts and traditions with great understanding and aesthetic sensibility. For him, his work is a labour of love. Using carefully selected resources, he has portrayed a picture of both urban and rural India with discernment, insight and objectivity.

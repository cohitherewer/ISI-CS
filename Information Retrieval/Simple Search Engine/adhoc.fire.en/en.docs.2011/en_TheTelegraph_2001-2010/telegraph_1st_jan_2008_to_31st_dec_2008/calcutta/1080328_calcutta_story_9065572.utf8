                                                                                                               For a bigger, better airport
  - State to conduct land acquisition survey        A STAFF REPORTER                          Calcutta airport is slated to get saturated in another two decades and an expansion plan is being drawn up. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The state government will conduct a survey for land acquisition for the proposed expansion of Calcutta airport.        
	We are trying to locate suitable land without disturbing habitat for the airports expansion, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Thursday.        
	The survey was discussed at a meeting between state representatives and Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials at Writers Buildings during the day.        
	The airport will become saturated in another two decades and we will need land for expansion, said S.P.S. Bakshi, the director of the modernisation project at Calcutta airport. There is talk of building a third runway as part of the expansion plan.        
	Bakshi gave a presentation on the airport to the state team, which included transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and Amitabha Nandy, the CPM parliamentarian from Dum Dum. According to AAIs estimates, Calcutta airport handles 250 flights a day. By 2010, when the modernisation project is scheduled to be completed, the figure is likely to increase four-fold.        
	The airport is witnessing a phenomenal growth in terms of flight movement. Hence, there should be a definite expansion plan to avoid saturation, Bakshi pointed out.        
	A presentation on the Rs 2,000-crore modernisation project was also made. Bids will be invited soon, said Bakshi. The modernisation project, which will include building two more terminals, is scheduled to start in April.

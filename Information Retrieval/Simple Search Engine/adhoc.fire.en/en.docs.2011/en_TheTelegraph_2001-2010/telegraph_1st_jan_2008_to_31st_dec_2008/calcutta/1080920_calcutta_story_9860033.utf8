The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chargesheets for death
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chargesheets for death
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	The CBI is free to file chargesheets against the seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The high court division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Maharaja Sinha on Friday rejected a plea by the accused to restrain the probe agency from filing the chargesheets.        
	The appeal moved by the seven against Justice Dipankar Duttas order asking the CBI to prosecute them will be heard after the Puja recess, which ends on November 2.        
	Of those facing trial, three are police officers  special superintendent (intelligence branch) Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das.         
	The rest are Ashok Todi, Rizwanurs father-in-law, his brother Pradip Todi, his relative Anil Saraogi, and Pappu, a friend of the Rahmans.        
	The CBI had informed the high court that charges under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 503 (criminal intimidation) could be brought against the accused.        
	If convicted for abetment to suicide, they could face a jail term of 10 years and a fine.        
	The computer graphics teacher, who had married industrialist Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against her familys wish, was found dead beside the railway tracks at Patipukur on September 21, 2007.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar and the Todis had allegedly tried to separate Priyanka from Rizwanur, driving the youth to suicide.        
	Once the CBI files the chargesheet, the state government can suspend the police officers. But the action is not mandatory, said senior counsel Shekhar Bose. Before suspending Kumar, an IPS officer, the government has to seek the Centres approval.        
	CBI insiders said senior officials would meet next week and go through a copy of the court order to decide on their course of action. The chargesheets will have to be filed at Bankshal court.        
	A source said the charges could be framed as early as next week, adding that arresting the accused is not necessary at this stage.        
	The court order left the Rahmans upbeat. Several attempts were made to malign the CBI probe. Many said the sleuths were not proceeding in the right direction. Todays verdict proved them wrong... We have full faith in the judiciary, Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur said before calling up mother Kishwar Jahan to inform her about the ruling.

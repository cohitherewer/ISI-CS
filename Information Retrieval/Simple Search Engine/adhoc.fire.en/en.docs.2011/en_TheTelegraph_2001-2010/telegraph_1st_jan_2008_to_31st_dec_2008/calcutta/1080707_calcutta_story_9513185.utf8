The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Special classes in school to stamp out private tuition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Special classes in school to stamp out private tuition

	South Point School is trying to wean its students from private tuition by organising special classes for those who feel regular lessons are not enough.         
	The two-pronged model the school has developed calls for an undertaking from teachers that they will stop giving private tuition and a statement from parents that their kids need extra help.         
	We have taken a declaration from the teachers on the number of students they teach outside school. They can continue with private tuition till 2011 but have to stop the practice after that. During these three years, they cannot increase the number of students in their private classes, said Krishna Damani, an official of the South Point Education Society.         
	The parents, too, have been asked to write to the principal, stating whether they want extra classes for their children.         
	Damani admitted that the school does not have the right to force its teachers not to coach privately students of other schools. We are banking on a positive response from the teachers. If they continue with the practice after 2011, we will decide our course of action.        
	Following the western model, South Point will organise tutorial classes for students who need extra help. There are 12,500-odd students in our school. We dont want any of them to be dependent on private tuition. If anyone needs extra help, the school will provide that, Damani said.        
	Students will be enrolled for special coaching against a nominal fee, most of which will go to the teachers, he added.        
	The state government, too, is against private tuition. In 2002, the government had issued a notification debarring teachers of state-aided schools from coaching students in private against money. But the practice is still rampant across the state.         
	After failing to weed out the menace, the government has decided to set up a committee to find out what prompts students to opt for private and personalised help, said an education department official.         
	Damani said South Point has been trying to wean its students from personalised help ever since the government issued the notification.         
	But we do realise that it cannot be done overnight. So, we have decided to wait for three years and roll out several measures to ensure a smooth transition to a no-private tuition regime, he explained. Apart from organising remedial classes and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each student, the measures include regular counselling of the students and their parents.         
	Most parents have welcomed the move. It will reduce the workload of the kids, who are already stressed, said the mother of a South Point student.         
	Its a unique move, said Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the state board of secondary education.

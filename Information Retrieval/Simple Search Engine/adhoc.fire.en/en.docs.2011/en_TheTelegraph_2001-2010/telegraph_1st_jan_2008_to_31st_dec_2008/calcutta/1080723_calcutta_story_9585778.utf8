The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guard killed in ATM booth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Guard killed in ATM booth
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The security guard of a private banks ATM booth in Mahestala, on the southern city fringes, was found murdered on Tuesday morning.         
	Police said 32-year-old Tapas Kumar Shaw was probably killed by a gang before they tried to break the ATM and take away money around 1am. The attempts were unsuccessful.         
	Children going to school noticed blood trickling out of the ATM booths door. They peeped inside and saw the guard lying face down in a pool of blood. The children alerted other pedestrians, who informed Mahestala police station.         
	According to investigators, the security agency that employed Shaw posted him as a night guard at the ATM booth two months ago. He lived in neighbouring Shyampur.         
	The officers are exploring the possibility of local enmity leading to Shaws killing. A preliminary investigation revealed that he was hit on the back of his head with a heavy object and then stabbed on the shoulder.         
	The criminals tried to break the ATM machine after that. When they realised that their attempts would not be successful, they ran away, said an officer. There were no security cameras in the booth.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajay Ranade said all possible motives behind the murder are being explored.        
	The criminals left behind vital clues and we are working on the leads. The post-mortem report will help us to ascertain the cause of his death. We will also talk to the officials of the security agency that employed him. We have already questioned the residents of the area who knew him, said Ranade.

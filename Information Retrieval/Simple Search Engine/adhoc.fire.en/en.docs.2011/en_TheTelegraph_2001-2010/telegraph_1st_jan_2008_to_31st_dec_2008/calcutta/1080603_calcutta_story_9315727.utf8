          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Most judges of Calcutta High Court want the death sentence to be abolished.        
	Of the 41 judges, 32 have voiced their opinion against capital punishment during a nation-wide survey by the National Law Commission.        
	The nine judges who want the punishment to continue are against death by hanging. They have suggested options like administering electric shocks or lethal injections to the convicts. That would be less cruel. Hanging is too grotesque and should stop, a judge is said to have told the officials conducting the survey.        
	The law commission will submit its report to Parliament after talking to the judges of all high courts and the Supreme Court. The commission wants a debate on whether capital punishment should continue or not, said senior counsel Gitanath Ganguli.        
	The last execution in the state was in 2005, when Dhananjoy Chatterjee, convicted of raping and murdering a schoolgirl, was hanged at Presidency jail.         
	The execution had sparking a fierce public debate on capital punishment.        
	While chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees wife Mira rallied for the death sentence, advocate-general Balai Ray opposed it on the grounds that the state had no right to take away a life as it cannot create one.        
	Ganguli said the commission is also discussing the problems resulting from the dearth of hangmen.        
	Nata Mallicks son had to be offered a job as there were no hangmen in the state after his retirement. The person who had hanged former Pakistan Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had to be flown in to Delhi to execute the Billa-Ranga duo in the late 80s, said Ganguli.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ice peels of a glacier in southern Argentina, possibly as an effect of global warming. The phenomenon was the topic of a seminar organised to observe 50 years of IMF. (Reuters)                                  
	In 1957, Keki Bunshah, a lawyer from Mumbai, met Union cabinet secretary S.S. Khera to seek funds for an Indian expedition to Cho Oyu, the sixth highest mountain in the world. It was an ambitious programme during the fledgling days of Indian mountaineering. Thanks to Bunshahs powers of persuasion, a Sponsoring Committee for the Cho Oyu Expedition was formed. The expeditions success paved the way for many more, including the first Indian attempt on the Everest.        
	The committee was named Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) in 1961 and entrusted with overseeing mountaineering in the country. On behalf of the state and the central governments, it grants permission to Indian and foreign teams for conducting expeditions on Himalayan peaks and can also collect handling and environmental charges. It also issues grants towards these expeditions.        
	The organisation, headquartered in New Delhi, has since extended its activities to imparting search and rescue training and organising climbing competitions.         
	On Sunday, as part of the IMFs golden jubilee celebrations, the Himalayan Club in Calcutta organised a seminar at Kalakunj on the impact of global warming on mountains and glaciers.        
	Similar programmes have been organised in Mumbai and Srinagar. The programme in New Delhi on November 26 will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister, said IMF president Major H.P.S. Ahluwalia.         
	Retired air vice-marshal Apurba Bhattacharyya, the vice-president of Himalayan Club, said: The IMF had planned environment seminars in the metros on the occasion of its golden jubilee. We organised the city seminar.        
	Speaking at the seminar, Deepak Srivastava, the deputy director of the Geological Survey of India, stressed that while global warming was a genuine concern, only a part of it could be attributed to human activity. We are passing through an inter-glacial age now, when temperatures rise. Such a period, usually of about 15,000 years, is followed by a glacial stage, when temperatures rise again.        
	The Gangotri glacier, which feeds the Ganga, is receding at an average rate of 18.8m per year, according to scientists.

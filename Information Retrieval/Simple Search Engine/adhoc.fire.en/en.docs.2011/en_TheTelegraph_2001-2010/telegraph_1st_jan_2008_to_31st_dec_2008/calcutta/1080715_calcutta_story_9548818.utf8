          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A ceasework by junior doctors to protest an assault on one of their colleagues disrupted treatment of patients at Medical College and Hospital on Monday.        
	The relatives of a patient beat up a junior doctor on Sunday afternoon. About 150 junior doctors immediately stopped work. The agitation continued till Monday evening.        
	Many patients had to return from the hospital without seeing a doctor because of the agitation. Those who managed to consult a doctor had to wait for hours in queues. All the departments of the hospital were severely hit.        
	Premchand Haldar was among those who could not be treated. After waiting for nearly two hours, he returned home to Amta with his son-in-law Surajit Haldar.        
	He was supposed to be admitted for a surgery in his left hand, which broke a few days back. The hospital authorities told us today that he could not be admitted because there were few doctors and asked us to come back after a few days, said Surajit.        
	Bappa Chakraborty, a resident of Agarpara, came to the hospital with his mother, a cardiac patient, for her check-up. His appointment was deferred by the hospital.        
	A senior hospital official said 30 per cent of the planned surgeries were deferred because of the agitation.        
	A delegation of junior doctors met the hospital authorities and submitted a charter of demands. Our main demand is a boost to security and infrastructure in the emergency department, said an agitating doctor.        
	The ceasework was withdrawn around 6pm after the hospital authorities assured the junior doctors of immediate measures to meet their demands.        
	The ceasework has been withdrawn. We have assured the junior doctors that we will do our best to fulfil their demands, said Anup Roy, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital.

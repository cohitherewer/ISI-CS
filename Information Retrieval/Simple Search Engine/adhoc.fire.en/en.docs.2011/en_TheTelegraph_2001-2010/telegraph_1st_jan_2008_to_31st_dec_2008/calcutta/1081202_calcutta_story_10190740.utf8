                      Lone women dream of liberty                    Woven, embroidered, knitted, stitched and other textiles with hand-crafted work have always been considered as art objects. Kanthas of Bengal, Ikkat of Orissa and Jamdani of Bangladesh are likewise works of art, as are the ornately designed tapestries of French, Italian and Spanish artists. What makes Shrabani Roys works distinctive is her use of fibre-yarn. Mostly dyed, she uses it to form images rather than simply creating a pattern for her surfaces. Unlike traditional craftsmen, this young artist from Santiniketan combines weaving, stitching, knitting and embroidery, blending yarns of different fibres. Though in the past she would construct landscapes in typical Santiniketan style, Shrabanis Alternative, the ongoing show of her recent works, features themes far removed from natural, idyllic surroundings. It depicts lonely and vulnerable young women confined to small spaces, either trying to portray their sexual attractiveness or a desire to communicate and liberate themselves from their state of imprisonment.                  Event: An exhibition of recent fibre-yarn works by Shrabani Roy When: Till December 20 (except Sundays); 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park

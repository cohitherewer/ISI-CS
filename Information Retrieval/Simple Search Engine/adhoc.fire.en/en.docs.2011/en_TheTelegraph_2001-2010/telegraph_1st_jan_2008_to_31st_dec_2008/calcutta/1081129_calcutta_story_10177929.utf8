          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Export of flowers and jute from Calcutta is set to soar, airline operators said on Friday.        
	Flower exports will go up next year. Samples sent to international auction centres were well received and exporters are booking shipments, said Halim Modassir, of Emirates (eastern India). Earlier, we used to mainly carry flower bulbs. Now, cut flowers will also be exported, he said. Flowers from Calcutta are flown to the Netherlands, the UK and Germany.        
	Emirates is also planning to increase export of jute from Bengal. Dubai is one of the biggest potential markets for jute. We are planning to take a team of exporters from Calcutta to meet buyers in Dubai, he said. In the past two months, the airline bought 2,000 to 3,000 kg of jute for its internal requirements.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chikungunya   in Howrah
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Eight out of 10 residents tested for chikungunya in Bally-Jagachha block of Howrah have been found to be positive. The blood samples were sent to the School of Tropical Medicine last week.         
	Nearly 500 residents of Baigachi have been suffering from viral fever. The symptoms indicate chikungunya. We sent blood samples of 10 patients to the School of Tropical Medicine. This afternoon they confirmed that eight of them are suffering from the disease, said Suparna Pal, the Bally-Jagachha medical officer of health.         
	From the symptoms, we are sure they are suffering from chikungunya and have been treating them accordingly. Besides, we have started an awareness campaign in the area, said Dilip Deb, the chief medical officer of health, Howrah.        
	The Bally-Jagacha block remains waterlogged for most of the year. After viral fever broke out, the district health officials asked the administration to spray mosquito repellent oil in the area. Residents alleged the oil has been sprayed only once.

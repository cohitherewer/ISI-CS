                      In the land of the pharaohs                    In Egypts sandy silence, all alone, /Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws/ The only shadow that the Desert knows:/ I am great OZYMANDIAS, saith the stone,/ The King of Kings; this mighty City shows/ The wonders of my hand. The Citys gone, /Nought but the Leg remaining to disclose/ The site of this forgotten Babylon  Horace Smith.        Most people who think of Egypt, think of antiquities, but Egypt offers much more. Certainly it is a great heritage site, including pyramids and wonderful temples, as well as part of the Holy Land. Modern Egypt is equally vibrant and beautiful where people go to make the trip of a lifetime. Two lensmen, Subrato Das and Surajit Hari, have been mesmerised by the beauty of this ancient land and share their wonderment with viewers through a series of exquisite photographs currently on display.

                      Practical aesthetics                    Showcasing a perfect balance of tradition and modernity, the creations of Narayan Sinha are art objects that remain firmly rooted in reality. Narayans World, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, sculptures and handmade jewellery, offers a glimpse into a mind that is sensitive, contemplative and, yet, with an eye for the practical and the necessary. Endowed with mysterious power and energy, Sinhas paintings convey various facets of his imagination and experience. His sculptures (one of them appears left), made from left-over, discarded items, express his respect for the old; his choice of colours reveal his love for the young. His collection of handmade jewellery represents his tribute to womanhood.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings, sculptures and handmade jewellery When: Till March 20; 11 am - 7 pm Where: The Address, 28/1 Shakespeare Sarani, 1st floor

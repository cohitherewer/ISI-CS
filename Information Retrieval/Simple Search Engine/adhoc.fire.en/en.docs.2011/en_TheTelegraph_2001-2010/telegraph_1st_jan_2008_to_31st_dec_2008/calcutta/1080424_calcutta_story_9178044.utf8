          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday directed the CBI to produce all documents relating to Calcutta polices handling of the marriage of Rizwanur Rahman with Priyanka Todi.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta passed the order after the state government informed the court that it was not in a position to produce the documents. The CBI had seized the documents while investigating Rizwanurs death, said advocate general Balai Ray.        
	He, however, produced a letter sent by Rizwanur and Priyanka to former Calcutta police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on August 31 last year.        
	In the letter, the couple had informed the police about their marriage and expressed fears of trouble when the news became public.        
	The court had asked the state government to produce the three letters that Priyankas father Ashoke Todi wrote to the police on September 1, 4 and 14 last year.        
	These letters are also with the CBI, Ray told the court.        
	The court asked the CBI to produce the letters along with other documents on April 29, when the case will be heard again next.        
	The judge also asked television channels to provide unedited footage of Mukherjees press conference on September 26.

                      Opera on canvas                    Evoking dreams that have psychological depth and significance, the surrealistic paintings of Arun Goswami are punctuated with a symbolism that is quintessentially musical. Keatsian unheard melodies are sprinkled across his recent works in oil, titled Of Unheard Melodies and Choreographed Dreams. Theatrical in design and composition, each painting of the series is like an illuminated stage, where dreams are played out. The viewer sees a dense, busy and complex collection of images, with dark-bodied Delacroix-like males and beautiful, sensually alive females, who are the heroes and heroines of the strange plot that is being narrated through symbols and totems. It is as though we are witnessing a scene from the thoughts of a bizarre, absurd, whimsical mind. What holds together the action on canvas is Goswamis brilliant sense of coloration and pigment distribution, consisting of major and minor hues, very much like the major and minor keys in an opera overture.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Arun Goswami When: Till November 10; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

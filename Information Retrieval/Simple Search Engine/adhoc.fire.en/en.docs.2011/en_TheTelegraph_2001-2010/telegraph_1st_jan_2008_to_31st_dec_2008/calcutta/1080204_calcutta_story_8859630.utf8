	A contract labourer, employed by the Nandaram market traders to demolish the upper portions of the building, was injured on Sunday when a concrete chunk from the 12th floor fell on him. 
    
	According to police, the chunk fell on Balaram Yadav, a 45-year-old labourer from Ranigunj, around 3.30pm while he was resting on Brabourne Road. 
    
	Gorachand Mondal, the director-general (building), had ordered the demolition of the portion above the sixth floor of Nandaram market and the adjacent Kashiram block.
    
	We have a squad to demolish unsafe buildings that pose a threat to public safety. In case of an illegal construction, we pull down the illegal portions of the building after a demolition order is issued. In the case of Nandaram, the traders were asked to demolish the unsafe parts of the structure, said Mondal. 
    
	Yadav was injured on his head and shoulder. He was taken to Medical College and Hospital, where he was kept under observation.
    
	We were chatting near the building. Suddenly, there was a loud sound. We rushed to the spot and found a concrete chunk had fallen on a worker, said Samar Chowdhury, the general secretary of the Nandaram Market Disaster Management Welfare Committee. 
    
	After the accident, the residents of the area and the traders demanded that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation pull down the unsafe portions of the building. 
    
	We pass the area so many times Todays incident has proved that the building is unsafe. The civic body should clear up the mess, said Harish Patel, a local trader.

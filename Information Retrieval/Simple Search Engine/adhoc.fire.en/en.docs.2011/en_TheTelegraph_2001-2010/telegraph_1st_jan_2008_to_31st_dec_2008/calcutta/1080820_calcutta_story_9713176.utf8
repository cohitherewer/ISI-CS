                      Death of a tycoon                    A play based on the life of Swedish bogus business mogul Ivar Kreugar, Ayn Rands The Night of January 16th is full of intense mystery and suspense. This Theatrecian production, with a story modified to suit the Indian context, promises to present a gripping drama that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats till the very end. It introduces us to five main characters; Faulkner, a business magnate, Karen, his mistress-cum-secretary, Mr Whitfield, his father-in-law and president of a national bank, Nancy, Faulkners wife, and Regan, a gangster. Its plot revolves around the mysterious death of Faulkner on the night of January 16. The action is concentrated within a courtroom, where his murder trial is underway. Initially, Karen and Mr Whitfield are suspected, for obvious reasons, as also Regan, who is in love with Karen. The plot becomes murkier when, during the course of the trial, it becomes clear that Faulkner is alive. Suspense reaches its climax when the audience learns that he is dead, but at a different place. An open-ended play, it makes the audience aware of the darker side of the lives of prosperous, successful men. Direction: Tathagata Chowdhury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online profile form for domestic help 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Online profile form for domestic help 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The city police have posted a form on their website for Calcuttans who want to share identification details of their domestic help with the local police stations.        
	The Domestic Help Profile Form can be downloaded free from www.kolkatapolice.org. One needs to fill up the form, attach a picture of the help and submit it to the local police station, said Pradip Chattopadhyay, the joint commissioner of police (administration). We are trying to introduce online submission of forms as well.        
	The authorities believe the move will encourage Calcuttans to keep the cops informed about details of domestic help  a must for effective policing.        
	There have been instances of help cleaning out their employers houses or even murdering the residents.        
	To help prevent such incidents, the police for the past four years have been asking Calcuttans for details of their help. But the response is far from encouraging.        
	We have received only 12 forms in the past four years, said an officer of New Alipore police station.        
	With the forms being uploaded on the Net, I hope more people will come forward to share identification details of their help with us, said joint commissioner Chatterjee.        
	Most citizens complain that the help do not want to be photographed. They run away if forced to be clicked, said a central Calcutta resident.        
	Officers suggested that the help be photographed along with the members of the employers families. For instance, a babysitter can be photographed with the baby, said a senior officer in the Lalbazar control room.

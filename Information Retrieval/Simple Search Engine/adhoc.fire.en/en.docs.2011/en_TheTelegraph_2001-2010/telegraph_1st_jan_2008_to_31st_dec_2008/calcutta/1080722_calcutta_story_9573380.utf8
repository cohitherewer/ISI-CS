  - CU admissions to be over in 3 weeks          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The facade of Calcutta University                                        
	Calcutta University has decided to complete admissions to its MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses and commence first-year classes within a month of the graduation results being declared.        
	Results of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part-II and Part-III examinations are to be announced on Tuesday and admission forms will be available from the next day onwards. First-year MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses must begin latest by August 22, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said.        
	Faculty members and senior officials of the university met on Monday to work out a strategy to speed up the process of admissions.         
	The vice-chancellor said admission forms would be uploaded on the university website by Tuesday evening so that prospective applicants did not have to wait a single day. The idea is to complete admissions in three weeks.        
	Forms can even be submitted online. For those who do not have access to the Internet, printed forms will be available over the counter.        
	Until last year, first-year MA, M.Sc and M.Com classes at Calcutta University would begin only in the third week of September.        
	Results of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations are being declared early, too. In 2006 and 2007, the results werent announced until mid-August. This years Part-II and III examinations were held in April and May.        
	Sources said the early announcement of results would benefit students who had secured provisional admission in institutions outside Bengal.        
	As in previous years, scores of students have taken admission in Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, where classes will begin before August 15. They need to produce their original marksheets before joining classes, an official of the examination department said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Priyanka Prasads family on Friday withdrew its complaints against a teacher who had allegedly assaulted the 12-year-old in school.        
	The complaints were withdrawn after teachers from Metropolitan Institution (Main) for Girls, including accused Diptoshree Chakrabarty, visited the family and apologised for the assault.        
	The girls father, Subhash Prasad, had lodged complaints with police and the school. The family withdrew the complaint on its own, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal.        
	Seven teachers had come to meet us. The geography teacher, Diptoshree Chakrabarty, who had hit my girl yesterday, apologised for her conduct. She said she didnt realise that Priyanka would be so badly hurt, said Priyankas mother Tilaka Prasad.

           Sister-speak
          Based on Taslima Nasreens epistolary novella, Oporpokkho: The Other Side is a dramatised reading of letters between two sisters in Bangladesh, one of whom has left home for the city while the other continues to live with her parents. Featuring Churni Ganguly and Sangeeta Datta, it unfolds the physical and psychological experiences and upheavals in their lives. Emotionally stirring and scathing in their critique of patriarchy and religious extremism, the letters reveal that both sisters have reached a point when they must assess their present, leaving behind the baggage of the past. English translation and direction: Sangeeta Datta. Produced by Stormglass Productions UK. Hosted by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts.
      lEvent: Reading of Taslima Nasreens Oporpokkho: The Other Side lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

          SUBHRO SAHA                          BYE BYE GOALIE: Oliver Kahn, soccer legend                                  
	Oliver Kahn will play the last match of his 20-year career under the floodlights of the Salt Lake stadium.        
	The soccer legend will defend his goal one last time in Bayern Munich colours against Mohun Bagan on the evening of May 27.        
	According to an announcement on the Bayern website, the Bundesliga leaders will play the last tie of their 10-day Asian tour  after matches in Indonesia and China  against Mohun Bagan AC, the oldest club in Asia.        
	Were delighted that Bayern will play in Calcutta, the Indian consul-general to Munich, J.S. Mukul, said in Munich on Tuesday.        
	The German club will be hosted by city-based real estate firm Bengal Peerless. Contacted by Metro in Munich, the groups managing director K.S. Bagchi said the formal announcement will be made by Bayern officials in Calcutta on March 19.        
	Yes, we have received a request from Bengal Peerless and we have forwarded it to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), said Utpal Ganguly, the IFA secretary. Itll be a big day for Calcutta football and Salt Lake Stadium should have a 100,000-plus crowd.        
	Some Bayern biggies will be away for Euro 2008, but squaring up against Bagan would be the likes of Mark van Bommel, Martin Demichelis, Lucio and Z Roberto.        
	We see ourselves as a global club, desiring and requiring an overseas presence, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told the clubs website. Our objective is not simply to play an exhibition match and collect our fee. We want to contribute to the development of the game.        
	Former Bagan great Chuni Goswami expressed pleasant surprise when told of the Bayern trip. Its a great honour for Calcuttas and Indias football. I cant wait to watch such a great club play here. It also gives us the opportunity to give one of modern footballs great stars a memorable send-off, he said.

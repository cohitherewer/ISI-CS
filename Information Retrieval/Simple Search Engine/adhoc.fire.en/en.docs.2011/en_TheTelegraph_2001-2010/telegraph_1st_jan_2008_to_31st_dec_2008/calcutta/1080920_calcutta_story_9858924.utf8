The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Park stalls to be razed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Park stalls to be razed
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Construction in full swing at BD Park. Picture by Tamaghna Banerjee                                  
	Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the Bidhannagar Municipality to demolish within 10 days the unauthorised structures it had built in BD Park in Sector I of Salt Lake.         
	The court had last month allowed the civic body to build temporary stalls on 40 per cent of the park to relocate traders from BD Market, which is being renovated and expanded.        
	The demolition order followed a report from Partha Sarathi Roy Burman, the special officer appointed by the high court. Roy Burman said the municipality had violated the court order by encroaching on more than the area sanctioned for the stalls.        
	I found stalls have been constructed on 51.9 per cent area of the park, he said.        
	Residents opposing the conversion of BD Market into a mall and the parks virtual takeover see the court order as a victory. Its a moral victory for us. We will now try to make sure that the municipality is forced to roll back the plans to convert BD market into a mall, said Rony Sarkar of BD 342.        
	The local puja committee is rejoicing, too. They have already destroyed the greenery of the park. We were forced to build our pandal on a smaller area this year. After the 11 per cent area is cleared by the municipality, we can expand our pandal premises, said Amit Nandy, another resident.

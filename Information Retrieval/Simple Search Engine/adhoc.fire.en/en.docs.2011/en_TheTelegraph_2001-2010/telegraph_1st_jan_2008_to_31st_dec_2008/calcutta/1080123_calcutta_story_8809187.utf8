     SUBHRO SAHA
               
	Australia promises improved people-to-people linkages with Calcutta in myriad fields, ranging from HIV/AIDS awareness, arts and education to heritage and conservation, emergency management, sports and tourism.
    
	We hope to forge stronger ties with the city, which remains the intellectual capital of India. Thats the reason the fourth summit of the Indian Association for the Study of Australia (IASA) is happening in Calcutta (January 22-24, St Johns Diocesan Girls HS School), David Holly, the deputy high commissioner of Australia, told Metro.
    
	IASA was created in 2000 for the promotion of studies in Australia. The association hopes to forge links with scholars in far-flung universities and colleges in small towns in India, helping them to access material in their respective areas of study in Australia.
    
	The three-day city conclave  Re-imagining Australia and India  has Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Burdwan University as the focus institutions and features 41 Australian academics, with over 100 counterparts from India joining them in structured sessions.
    
	Over 60,000 Indian youths studied in Australia last year, which makes it the second most preferred destination for Indian students after the US. Of the 26 fellowship awardees in 2007, six were from Calcutta, which reinforces our faith in the city, added Bruce Bennett, a board member of the Australia-India Council.
    
	The council plays an active role in promoting long-term contacts and exchanges between Australia and India on a second-track diplomacy basis in support of government-to-government contacts and exchanges.
    
	Its activities include an HIV/AIDS programme in partnership with the CII. The Border-Gavaskar young cricketer scholarships, art and cultural residencies and science and research exchanges are the other areas of cooperation.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Youths posing as cops robbed two men of lakhs on the road over the past 24 hours.         
	On Tuesday evening, some youths stopped Montu Saha, who works for a promoter, near Jorasanko while he was getting into an autorickshaw on CR Avenue with Rs 6 lakh he had withdrawn from a bank. Pretending to be CID officers, the youths searched Sahas bag and took away the notes saying they were fake.        
	The youths handed a seizure list to Saha and asked him to meet them at Bhawani Bhavan.        
	On Monday evening, another group of youths posing as cops stole Rs 5 lakh from Satyadhan Bariks bag while frisking him at Burrabazar. Barik, who works in a clothes shop, had withdrawn Rs 10 lakh from a bank and was taking the amount to his employer.        
	Both men lodged complaints with police.

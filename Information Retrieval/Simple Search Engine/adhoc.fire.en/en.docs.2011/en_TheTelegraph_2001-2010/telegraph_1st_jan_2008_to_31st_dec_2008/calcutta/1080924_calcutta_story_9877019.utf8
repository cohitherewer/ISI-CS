             Under fire: The report ldquo;Fire singes Writers rsquo; block rdquo;, August 8, does not come as a surprise. Even a cursory look inside the ldquo;Mahakaran rdquo; office reveals piles of dust-laden files and broken furniture stacked all over the place. This makes the entire building a fire hazard. It seems our ministers and officers are too busy ldquo;serving the people rdquo;. One hopes immediate remedial measures are taken;   otherwise there is every danger of the historic building getting destroyed by fire.   
	 A.S. Mehta,

	Junior doctors in government hospitals had joined a strike demanding higher pay (Docs strike, govt studies, August 5). Patients in urgent need of medical care were refused treatment by the junior doctors, who form the backbone of healthcare in government hospitals. Even without any agitation, the shabby state of government hospitals in West Bengal is common knowledge. The rich and middle classes prefer private clinics. Thus, most of the victims of the doctors strike were from the lower socio-economic sections. Is the decision of our healers to go on a strike right  morally, ethically or legally?           
	Peaceful strike by workers is an important weapon to fight injustice in all democratic societies. But can those providing essential services go on a strike to redress grievances and undermine the safety of the rest of society? The answer is a categorical no.           
	Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right to life to all citizens. The right of a few to go on strike can never supersede the combined rights of thousands to life and liberty.           
	Kunal Saha,
  Ohio, US                     Kasturi Sen                  
	Apropos the report Defiance through dress, August 6, whatever happened with Kasturi Sen, the teacher of Akra Krishnanagar Girls High School, is nothing new. Whether there should be a dress code for schoolteachers is an old debate. The government has not fixed any particular dress for schoolteachers yet. I think Kasturi Sen is on the right track. A teacher should wear a respectable dress  something that is not vulgar and which does not affect students. Theres nothing wrong in wearing salwar-kameez as a teacher.             
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore           
	Under the rules laid down in the Constitution, every citizen of India has the right to freedom and Kasturi Sen is no exception. She has the right to wear any dress, be it sari or salwar-kameez, to school. The principals objection to salwar-kameez is completely illogical. Teachers should wear any decent outfit that does not affect the schools atmosphere.           
	Dipanwita Roy,
  Lake Gardens           
	The dress code controversy was created by a school teacher just for some publicity. No dress is inferior or superior. But wherever there is a dress code, particularly in an educational institution, one must strictly abide by it. Non-adherence in such cases is nothing less than an act of indiscipline. Such behaviour was not expected from a schoolteacher, who is a role model for students. The defiance is being described as a victory for the teacher, but does this victory have a moral standing?           
	Raj Bagri, 
  Ho Chi Minh Sarani           
	If this sort of freedom is encouraged, shirts and jeans might be the next thing Kasturi Sen or any other teacher will insist on wearing, in the name of convenience.           
	Jayanti Ghosh Dastidar, 
  Address not given                   
	With reference to your news A week later, still unprepared, August 6, it is unfortunate that when blasts are happenning with chilling regularity in different cities across the country, most hospitals in Calcutta have yet to come up with trauma-care units to cope with emergencies and disasters. The health minister would do well to remember that terrorist activities have necessitated the setting up of trauma-care units on a war footing.             
	Govinda Bakshi, 
  Budge Budge                       
	The joint drive against parking on footpaths being planned by the CMC and Calcutta police (August 6) reminded me of my visit to Madras (now Chennai) in 1956. I was witness to a police officer patrolling Mount Road (now Anna Salai), who stopped his jeep and slapped a fine on the driver of a vehicle parked on the footpath. As a schoolboy from Calcutta, I was surprised and impressed by the action. We, in Calcutta, are five decades behind in such matters.             
	Suman S. Dasgupta,
  Parnasree Palli                   
	It is encouraging to note that Durga puja organisers who want to take part in a government-organised competition will have to go green (Green theme for puja prize, August 4). Pollution is a serious matter and all of us must make an effort to protect the environment. A huge amount of money is spent every year on theme-based pujas. Puja organisers can depict ways of maintaining a clean environment. This will attract the attention of the younger generation, too. Private companies sponsoring Puja awards should stress on green themes. Thousands visit the pandals during Puja. So, the Puja grounds would be an ideal platform for spreading the message of environmental consciousness.             
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
  Behala                   
	Officers of Maniktala police station flouted all norms of public service (Police shun leprosy patient, August 4). Leprosy patient Manoj Dey lay unattended on the pavement of Muraripukur Road for six months while the cops turned a blind eye. When a foul smell started emanating from Deys wasted body, the policemen called doms to send him to a leprosy centre. The commissioner must look into this grave lapse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taken for a taxi ride from rail station
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Taken for a taxi ride from rail station
          ONTHESPOT - KOLKATA TERMINAL                        Cab corner: The site of commuter harassment at Kolkata Terminal; (below) the fare chart. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta				                                       
	Catching a cab from the Kolkata Terminal in Chitpur is a test of a commuters endurance and bargaining power. Though a large fare chart adorns the walkway, the taxi drivers put pressure on commuters to fork out almost double the fixed amount.         
	About three years have passed since trains began chugging out of Kolkata Terminal, but a pre-paid taxi facility is yet to be started in the citys third rail junction after Howrah and Sealdah. With no policeman in sight, the Kolkata Terminal taxi stand has turned into a nightmare for passengers.         
	On the afternoon of December 3, Metro accompanied passenger Subrata Mondal as he stepped out of the Guwahati Garib Rath Express and walked towards the taxi stand. A group of eight taxi drivers surrounded Mondal immediately. After a few minutes of haggling, one of them agreed to drive to New Alipore  Mondals destination  for Rs 275 though the fare chart showed a maximum of Rs 160 for the route. When Mondal insisted on going by the meter, the drivers demanded Rs 20 plus parking fee.         
	A senior railway official later clarified that no parking charge is levied on taxis on the station premises.         
	Subhash Dhameja, a regular on the Calcutta-Lucknow route, has a similar tale to tell. I have to shell out around Rs 300 every time I take a cab from Kolkata Terminal to Barasat though the fare chart indicates Rs 240, rued Dhameja.         
	Policespeak        
	We have not received any specific complaint. Passengers can always take the help of Government Railway Police (GRP) if taxis refuse to charge by the meter, said Barun Mullick, the superintendent of railway police, GRP, Sealdah division.         
	Despite Mullicks claim, GRP personnel are seldom seen monitoring the taxi stand at Kolkata Terminal. Mondal, for one, didnt find a single GRP personnel on the afternoon of December 3 to seek redress.

	Station officials admit receiving complaints of harassment from passengers, but word hasnt reached the top brass yet. I am not aware of the problem but I will certainly inform the government of the matter to ensure that passengers are not harassed anymore. Neither rail officials nor the RPF or the GRP can do anything about it, said Satyender Kumar, the divisional railway manager, Sealdah Division, Eastern Railway.

	The Citu pointed a finger at the Trinamul Congress. The majority of taxi drivers at Kolkata Terminal owe allegiance to Trinamul. They didnt allow the pre-paid taxi booth to open though the transport minister had granted permission. The Trinamul doesnt allow its taxis to run on meter as they charge the drivers Rs 20 per trip, said Pramod Jha, the joint secretary of the Citu-affiliated West Bengal Taxi Workers Federation.         
	Madan Mitra, the president of Trinamuls Progressive Taximens Union, expressed surprise at the accusation: I have never heard of this malpractice. But I assure you that passengers wont face this problem from next week. I will look into the matter and ensure that all the taxis of our union go by the meter.

                Electrician Satyajit Saha, 33, was murdered by unknown assailants while returning to his Sukanta Pally home in Ghola, off Sodepur, on the citys northern fringes, around 1.30am on Sunday. Police said a group of people attacked Saha with bricks, crushing his head.     Debasis Biswas and Subir Biswas, employees of a Baruipur home for destitute children, were arrested on Sunday for molesting female inmates. Debashis was the manager and Subir the cook of the home.    A 15-year-old girl and two men were injured when their car collided with a taxi in Sealdah on Sunday afternoon. Police said it was a case of rash driving. Both cars were impounded.

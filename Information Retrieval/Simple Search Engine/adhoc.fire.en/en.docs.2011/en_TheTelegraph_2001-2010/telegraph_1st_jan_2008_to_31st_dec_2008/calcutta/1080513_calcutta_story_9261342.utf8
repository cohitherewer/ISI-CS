	The final hearing of the Rizwanur Rahman case concluded on Monday. Justice Dipankar Dutta adjourned the verdict and allowed the parties time till May 16 to make written submissions.        
	The judgment will be passed when the high court reopens on June 2 after the summer vacation. During the final hearing, lawyers representing the state government and the Todis had challenged the authenticity of the CBI report, while counsel for the Rahmans had argued that Rizwanur was murdered.        
	According to a directive, the chief metropolitan magistrate, Calcutta, submitted a report in the high court on Monday stating that on November 17 last year, the CBI had informed him that it was going to start an investigation into Rizwanurs death.

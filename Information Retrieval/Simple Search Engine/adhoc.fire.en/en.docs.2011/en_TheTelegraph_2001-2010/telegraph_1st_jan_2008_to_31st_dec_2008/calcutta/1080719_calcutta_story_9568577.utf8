                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Drinks, drug in JU ragging
  - Torment by inebriated seniors knock fresher cold           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An anti-ragging billboard on JU campus. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	The father of the girl who was ragged on the Jadavpur University campus on Wednesday told authorities his daughter was taken to a canteen and forced to smoke marijuana, chew a cigarette and drink till she was knocked unconscious.         
	The perpetrators of the crime, mostly third-year students, were all drunk when they held the student of architecture captive in the canteen till dusk and tortured and verbally abused her, a source quoted her father as saying in his complaint.        
	Registrar Rajat Banerjee declined comment on the nature of the ragging the fresher was subjected to, but admitted it was an unprecedented incident. The four-member probe team could not record the victims statement on Friday because she was still in shock, the source said.        
	Savage ragging is not uncommon in hostels, but this is possibly the first known instance of a student being physically and mentally tortured in a public place on the campus. First-year classes had begun just two days before the ragging incident.        
	It was a horrifying incident. A girl student had never before been ragged in this way on our premises, a senior teacher said.        
	The group of seniors, including girls, allegedly threatened to make the architecture student chew a second cigarette if she threw up while munching on the first.         
	Sources said some freshers in the electronics and chemical engineering departments were ragged, too, but nobody had filed a written complaint yet. Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh and the registrar visited all departments on Friday and spoke to teachers and students about the need to stop ragging.                           
	The duo asked the teacher-student committees of all departments to convene meetings from Monday onwards to discuss the problems being faced by freshers.        
	The student unions of all three streams were asked to be vigilant against ragging in canteens, common rooms and grounds.        
	 We strongly condemn the way the first-year architecture student was ragged on the campus, said Anujit Chakraborty, a leader of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union.        
	Just a week before the commencement of first-year classes, the university authorities had put up banners at various places on the campus to highlight the Supreme Courts ban on ragging and encourage freshers to file complaints if they were harassed.        
	The university and the student unions are locked in a dispute over another proposal to curb ragging  by segregating first-year boarders from senior students.

	The city has a new Park Street. On 31st night, at least.
    
	New Years Eve party zones behind closed doors that open only with cash and contacts comprise the new Park Street of Calcutta.
    
	The seven social clubs and two popular hangouts that partied through the last night of the year were the places to be in when the clock struck 12.
    
	Not long ago, Park Street was where we all would be, honking and shouting and wishing strangers at midnight. It didnt cost a rupee and was great fun, recounted Manish Agarwal. 
    
	Now, Park Street is the last place the young entrepreneur and his friends would go to. They dont mind paying thousands to enter party zones that are safe and selective.
    
	On Monday night, police went on an overdrive to keep Park Street safe, but there was no way they could be selective. Thirty-four arrests for disorderly conduct were carried out, despite three IPS officers manning the police station.
    
	The crowd count at Park Street between 11pm and 1am swelled to around 25,000. The nature of the crowd has changed. The proper party people have all moved away from Park Street, rued a restaurateur.
    
	Among the places replacing Park Street this time was the Nalban Boating Complex, where the Shisha party was presented in association with t2. We raised the price for couple passes from Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 and allowed about 2,500 people in without compromising on quality, said Arvind Bhatnagar of Shisha.
    
	There were hundreds of hopefuls queueing up outside the Nalban gates to grab a pass at a premium. There were people who were ready to pay Rs 12,000 for a pass, said Bhatnagar. They were all refused, to keep the people profile of the party right.
    
	A decent crowd, a variety of food and beverages (not necessarily in that order) and foot-tapping music are the essential ingredients of a great 31st night party. So, Park Streets loss is the clubs gain.
    
	The combined crowd count at the seven social clubs hosting parties in association with The Telegraph on Monday night was 12,000-odd  800-plus at RCGC, 2,000-plus at Tollygunge Club, 2,500-plus at CC amp;FC, 1,200 at DI, 1,800 each at Calcutta Club and Saturday Club and 1,500-plus at Space Circle.
    
	The club parties are gaining prominence because they offer a venue where like-minded people enjoy the special evening. Good ambience, music and food are guaranteed, stressed K.B. Menon of Tollygunge Club.

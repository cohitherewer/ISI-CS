                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Goods carriers to bypass Shyambazar
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The five-point crossing at Shyambazar. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Goods vehicles will not be allowed to clog the Shyambazar five-point crossing from June next year.        
	The traffic police hope that congestion on APC Road during peak hours will lessen once the stretch between Maniktala and Galiff Street becomes off-limits for goods carriers.        
	As part of the project, Canal West Road is being developed as the second Shyambazar bypass after the Lockgate Road flyover.        
	From June 2009, Sealdah-bound goods carriers on BT Road will have to take a left turn after crossing Barrackpore bridge and move along Canal West Road.        
	The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) has started augmenting the roads load-bearing capacity, which will cost over Rs 7 crore.         
	Work on the stretch between Maniktala police station and Aurobindo Setu will start before the Puja.        
	It will be a model road. About Rs 6 crore will be spent on reconditioning and widening it. The width will be increased from six metres to 10.5 metres. There will also be pavements with fencing on both sides, said the vice-chairman of HRBC, Sadhan Banerjee.        
	Accepting a proposal from local MLA Sadhan Pande to housing minister Gautam Deb, the transport department took up the project in consultation with the department of architecture of Jadavpur University.        
	While the state government and the HRBC are spending Rs 3 crore each on the reconstruction of road, CMDA has earmarked Rs 1 crore for setting up roadside toilets, parks and kiosks. Pande has given Rs 10 lakh from his local area development fund.        
	The project includes setting up of parking facilities for trucks and cars, bus bay, parks, gardens and toilets. Once completed, motorists will enjoy driving along this stretch, said Madhumita Roy, an urban design expert of Jadavpur University.        
	There will be 26 kiosks along the road, to be used for eateries, telephone booths, and auto parts shops, she added.

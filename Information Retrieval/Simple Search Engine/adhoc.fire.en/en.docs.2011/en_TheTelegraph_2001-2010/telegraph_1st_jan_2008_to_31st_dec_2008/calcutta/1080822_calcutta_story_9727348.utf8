                      Lessons for life                    Growing up in a simple, small-town environment, Subroto Bagchi imbibed from his family a sense of contentment, constant wonder, eagerness to learn from unusual sources and a connectedness to the larger whole. From his self-confessed humble beginnings, he went on to achieve extraordinary professional success, eventually co-founding MindTree, one of Indias most flourishing software services companies. Through personal anecdotes and simple words of wisdom, Bagchis latest work in management literature, Go Kiss the World: Life Lessons for the Young Professional, offers lessons in working and living, energising ordinary people to lead extraordinary lives. With a remarkable story of courage, integrity and enterprise, the book is an inspiration to young India and to those who come from small-town India, urging them to recognise and develop their inner strengths, thereby helping them realise their own, unique potential. This evening, Penguin Books India and Starmark host the launch of the book. To be followed by an interactive session between Rita Bhimani and the author, who will also read excerpts from it.                    Event: Launch of Subroto Bagchis book Go Kiss the World along with reading and interaction When: Today at 6 pm Where: Starmark, 3 Lord Sinha Road

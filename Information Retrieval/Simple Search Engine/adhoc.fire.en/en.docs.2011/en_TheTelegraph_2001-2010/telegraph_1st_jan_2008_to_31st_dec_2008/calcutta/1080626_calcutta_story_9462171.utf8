          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old homemaker was found dead in her in-laws Howrah home after twice quarrelling with her husband and being slapped once. Rita Majumders husband, 38-year-old Biswajit, was arrested on Wednesday on the charge of driving his wife to suicide.         
	According to Biswajits statement to police, Rita hanged herself from the ceiling of their prayer room on Tuesday night. He, his elder brother and sister-in-law Nupur brought down the body after breaking open the door and untying the dupatta around her neck.         
	Biswajit admitted to slapping Rita in a fit of rage when they quarrelled in the morning. He said his wife did not speak to him after that.        
	Nupurs version was similar. She said: Around 10 last night, Rita entered the thakurghar and bolted the door. When she did not come out for more than 15 minutes, we started pleading with her to open the door but got no answer. Then we broke open the door and brought her down from the ceiling. She had died by then.         
	The police, however, doubt that the family is speaking the truth. There are discrepancies in their statements. They have claimed that they brought down the body by breaking open the door of the thakurghar, but we noticed that the door was intact. Why did they not call the police and inform neighbours immediately after the incident, which, according to them, occurred around 10pm? Why did they wait till next morning? asked an officer at Bally police station.        
	He said the family did not even call a doctor to check if Rita was alive. We have not got satisfactory answers from them to our queries.         
	Investigators said Rita and Biswajits relationship soured a few months after their marriage a year and a half ago.         
	Biswajit lost his job in a private company a few months after the wedding. Rita, who worked in a private nursing home in Baranagar, gave up hers on becoming a mother.         
	The family was financially unstable, the police said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Howrah boy bags gold

	This boy is on the road to success. After securing second position in medicine in the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination, Subhrashis Guha Niyogi of Howrah has added yet another feather to his cap by winning gold at the 19th International Biology Olympiad (IBO, 2008).         
	I gave it my best shot and I am happy to have made my parents and country proud. I want more students to come forward and take these exams, quot; said the 17-year-old.         
	IBO, 2008 was held at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education in Mumbai from July 13 to 20. Over 220 students from 55 nations participated in the event.         
	The Indian team was represented by PG Nandan of Chennai, Siddharth Bharat Iyengar of Bangalore, Sachit Daniel from Mangalore, along with Subhrashis. Nandan and Siddharth won silver while Sachit got a bronze. The four students were selected through a three-tier process. A nation-wide screening on biology for over 10,000 students was followed by another set of written tests and a final round of practicals.         
	In Mumbai, practical knowledge in plant and animal physiology and anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology and animal behaviour were tested. There were also table-based questions that demanded intense calculations. The questions were tough but interesting. They were mostly application based, said Subhrashis.        
	About his mantra for success, he said: I never bury myself under a huge pile of books. I always have a storybook with me and switch to it if I am too tired of studying.         
	But the seven days in Mumbai were not all work without play. I have made many friends. I also learnt numbers in Italian and Persian and how to greet people in Japanese, French and Spanish.         
	He has also discovered dance. I never thought I could dance, but an Irish girl taught me. My calf muscles are still aching, smiles Subhrashis who wishes to pursue research after studying medicine.

	Helping hand for needy                           JU students collect items for pavement dwellers      
	Ninety students from three faculties of Jadavpur University (JU) joined hands to supply clothes and other items of daily use to pavement dwellers. The project that took off on July 5, was the initiative of the varsitys National Service Scheme unit.        
	Every year our students take part in community service programmes, but the response this year has been overwhelming, said Bappa Mullick, director of youth welfare, JU. Usually the strength of volunteers for such initiatives is around 50. This year, we have received such good response that we cant accommodate any more, he added.         
	The students have been divided into six groups. They work on Saturdays and Sundays every week. On the first week, we went on a door-to-door campaign, informing prospective donors about our initiative. From the next week we began our collection, said Samir Biswas, a student of sociology. Around 3,000 articles like clothes, water bottles, shoes, books, bags have already been collected.        
	The items were mostly donated by families in Central Road, opposite the university campus, Poddar Nagar off Prince Anwar Shah Road, Jodhpur Park, Dhakuria, the staff quarters on the JU campus and the students hostel.         
	The response was mixed. Some were eager to help while others shut the door on our faces. At some housing complexes we were shooed away from the gate itself, recalls Sukanya Tikadar, a student of English.        
	We have another week of collections left. The articles will then be disinfected and distributed, said Mullick. The areas earmarked for distribution are Garia, Moulali, Gariahat and the railway stations from Sonarpur to Sealdah.

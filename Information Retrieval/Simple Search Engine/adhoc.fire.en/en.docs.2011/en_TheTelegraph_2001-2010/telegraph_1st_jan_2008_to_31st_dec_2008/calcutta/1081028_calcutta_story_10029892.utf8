                      Colours of celebration                    The festivals of Id and Durga Puja both occupy important positions in Bengals cultural calendar. Celebrated with traditional grandeur and gaiety, they have now become a reason for the happy confluence of people of all religions. Spiritual Quest in Colour, the ongoing art exhibition, attempts to capture the spirit of the two festivals as envisaged in the artists imagination. What is particularly interesting about the show is the way in which religious dogmas of Hinduism and Islam have been done away with in the depiction of the festivals. Departing from religious conventions, the artists have portrayed Id and Durga Puja from an original, innovative perspective, highlighting their social and cultural symbolism instead of a strictly religious one. The help of religious iconography has been taken chiefly for aesthetic purposes. Participating artists include Bimal Kar, Ratan Acharya, Sheila Kapoor, Shipra Bhattacharya, Sekhar Kar, Snehangshu Sekhar Das and Shakila.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings on Id and Durga Puja When: Till November 10; 1 pm - 8 pm Where: Silpi Art Gallery, 32A Judges Court Road

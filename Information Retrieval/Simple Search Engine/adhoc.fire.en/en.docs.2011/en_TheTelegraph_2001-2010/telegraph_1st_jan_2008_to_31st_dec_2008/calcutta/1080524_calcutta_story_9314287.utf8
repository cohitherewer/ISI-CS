                      Lilliputs lord on stage                    Children live in an increasingly complex world, and their real concerns deserve to be addressed. Nandikars Children-friendly Festival of Plays focuses on this specific area and presents a bouquet of six plays. This evening, it hosts Sunil Gangopadhyays Satyi Rajputra (direction: Sohini Sengupta; lyrics, music and dramatisation by Swatilekha Sengupta) and Three Little Piglets and The Frog Prince (picture along; both snippets by Tyst Theatre, a Swedish silence group in association with members of Nandikar Childrens Ensemble, local children with speech and hearing impairment and performers from Hooghly, Howrah and Salt Lake). Satyi Rajputra is about a boy who is tauntingly referred to by his schoolmates as Rajputra simply because his ancestors once ruled the land. The boys family tries hard to put up a show and re-live those bygone days despite meagre resources. The external pomp and splendour attract unwanted attention and one day the boy is kidnapped from school.... Tyst Theatres improvisational, process-centred form of drama culminates in the performance of two well-known fairy tales. The exuberance and spontaneity of the kids are infectious. The festival concludes tomorrow (May 25) and members of Nandikar Childrens Ensemble will present Satyajit Rays Pil-Pil-Pil (drama amp; direction: Susanta Mandal) and Guidance Academy will stage Rajesh Basus SMS-e-Esho (drama amp; direction: Anirban Roychowdhury). Pil-Pil-Pil is about the funny and frolicking caprices of five families of cats, herons, ducks, parrots and ants  each family has five naughty off-springs. With 60 children on stage its nothing less than fun and merry-making all the way.

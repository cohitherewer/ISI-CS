          Todays question: Who is to blame for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh?                     Bike brigade: Forward Bloc supporters patrol the streets during a bandh called by the party. A Telegraph picture                         
	AMIT BANERJEE, 
  Golf Green					      
	It is principally the ruling Left parties and their trade unions, aided by the state administrations inaction, that ensure a complete shutdown. People venture out during a bandh called by the Opposition because they are fed up with shutdowns enough to brave an Opposition bandh and the state government ensures transport is available. Things are just the opposite during a Left sponsored-bandh. Muscle power of cadres and the state ensures that people and transport are off the streets. The state does not have a bad governance, it has no governance at all. If the administration followed the Constitution and court rulings, it would have ensured that bandhs dont take place.                 Moumita Sengupta, 
  Behala								       
	Surely the political leaders of our country are to be blamed for a total workless day on bandhs. Considering the economic and social condition of our country, protest is needed. But the protest should be done in such a way that show results.                 UJJAL BHATTACHARYYA, 
  Entally								       
	Political parties are to be blamed for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh. A bandh asks for the cooperation of the people. But in reality, bandh supporters adopt violent means to drive home the point that it is a bandh.                 Soma Sarkar, 
  Dum Dum					       
	What is the use of these write-ups every time we have a bandh unless there is some result? The government is a nuisance in coping with such problems and the only thing people look up to is the media. People who are working in offices are very happy to enjoy the sudden holiday and they are the real supporters of the government. Surveys have already revealed that Calcutta is far behind other metros in terms of income. Lets have a bandh and close down this city once and for all.                 Salil Kumar Kar, 
  KN Das Lane								       
	The people are to be blamed for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh. When a smaller political party calls a bandh,we come out to see that it is defied. But when the ruling party calls a bandh we confine ourselves in our houses out of fear. Cant we disregard all bandhs irrespective of the political party sponsoring it and uphold the verdict of the court?                 A.S.Mehta 
  New Alipore								       
	Political parties are to be blamed for the complete shut down of the city. Other than a few exceptions, Calcuttans would not like to waste their time lazing around the house. Political parties deploy goons to enforce a bandh.Goons and criminals have no party affiliations, they are only there to ensure a total shutdown.                 Tuhin Purkayastha,
  Parnashree Palli								       
	I think political parties should be the first to be blamed for a complete shutdown during bandhs. If a bandh has a positive effect then people can support it but bandhs dont help in lowering the price of anything.                 D.P. Bhattacharya, 
  Sonarpur								       
	It seems the political leaders are the guardians of the people of West Bengal. They call a bandh at their discretion and their armed cadres make it a success. People should come forward to resist bandhs or else Bengal will lose all hopes of industrialisation and development.                 Biplab Kumar Paul, 
  Dankuni, Hooghly								       
	The political parties are to blame for the complete shutdown during a bandh. People dont come in the way of the party goons out of fear.       
	 Arka Prova Halder,
  Kalyani   
	 Bandhs have no more significance than a holiday for everyone. The political parties are to be blamed for shutting down Calcutta and the rest of the state.             Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 
  Barasat								       
	When a strike is called by the ruling party, Writers Buildings wears a deserted look, public transport is not available and police remain mute spectators while Calcutta sleeps. But the scenario changes when the strike is called by the Opposition. State buses ply, Writers gives the impression that the people have rejected the bandh-call, police help bandh-breakers.                 Arun Sen, 
  NN Dutta Road								       
	It is the people of Calcutta who are to be blamed for the shutdown on a bandh. They should defy such calls. They are too timid to face the intimidation of party cadres. It is about time people took the bull by the horns. We must unite to get rid of this perennial fear of political parties.                Manasi Chakraborti, 
  Behala								       
	Bandh paralyses normal life. The government should be held responsible for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh.                 Sourish Misra, 
  Salt Lake								       
	Political parties are the only ones responsible for shutting down Calcutta on a bandh day. They do everything possible to ensure the success of the bandh. Hooligans backed by politicians give a hard time to those defying bandhs. They love to abuse people verbally and physically.                 B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park								       
	Bandh has never yielded any fruitful result. It has only created misery for the people. It must be rooted out of the city.                 Amaresh Paul, 
  Bandel								       
	The dirty politics of today is to be blamed for Calcutta shutting down during bandhs. According to the court order, bandhs should not be called on working days. The parties know that bandh does not offer any solution to any problem. So, why should it be observed as a festival throughout the year?                Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum								       
	Political parties are to blame for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh. The bandh is called to show that might is right. In general, people do not support bandhs, parties force the public to shut down. Bandh supporters do not care for the peoples troubles.                 Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia								       
	Bandhs are irrelevant and worthless as they rob the incomes of daily-wage earner. The political party calling the bandh should be blamed.                 Debasish Chakraborty, 
  Cossipore								       
	The ruling party is to blame for Calcutta shutting down on a bandh. They could have at least kept flights and trains out of its ambit. The aged and the ailing, suffer most during such bandhs.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths on a motorcycle snatched Rs 1 lakh from a man travelling in a rickshaw in Shalimar, Howrah, on Wednesday morning.         
	Pranab Sengupta, a retired high court clerk, had withdrawn the money from the Shalimar branch of Punjab National Bank for his daughters wedding next month.         
	He was returning home to Bharpara, in Shibpur, in the rickshaw.        
	As the motorcycle sped past the rickshaw near Bataitala bazaar, the pillion rider snatched the plastic packet in which Sengupta was carrying the money. The youths disappeared in the direction of Foreshore Road. The incident took place around 11.30am.         
	Sengupta said the duo had been following him on their motorcycle since he left home for the bank.        
	On Tuesday, two youths on a motorcycle had snatched a necklace from Smita Agasti, 31, on Andul Road.        
	According to police, the same gang could be behind both incidents.

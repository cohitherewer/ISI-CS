  - Besu seethes over flare-up, police presence          A STAFF REPORTER                          CAMPUS CAULDRON: Besu teachers protest at the Shibpur universitys lobby on Thursday. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	A students demonstration at Esplanade and teachers protest meetings off Esplanade and on campus dominated a day of mid-semester examinations at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu).        
	That puts things into perspective and proves how low on the priority list academics is on the Shibpur campus at present, lamented a Besu teacher.        
	Both students and teachers spent Thursday protesting the most recent flare-up on campus. With reporters being denied entry into the Shibpur institute, a section of students took up position opposite Metro cinema to protest the recent violence on campus and the police atrocities.        
	The police entered our hostels and beat us up indiscriminately. Even a physically handicapped student was not spared, alleged Shyamasis Das, a spokesperson.        
	FIRs have been lodged against some students who were not present on campus on March 19-20. Outsiders are beating up students just beyond the varsity gates. The authorities and the police are doing nothing to stop them. We live in fear, added Das.        
	Not far from the students protest platform, the Bengal Engineering and Science University Teachers Association (Besuta) presented its case at the Press Club. Association chairman Subrata Pal said: We are demanding immediate withdrawal of police force from the campus. All FIRs (22) against students should be withdrawn.        
	If the police stay on beyond Sunday, the association will urge chancellor Gopalkrishna Gandhi to intervene and also demand the resignation of vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea.        
	Besuta secretary Partha Pratim Chattopadhyay said: Prolonged presence of police on campus underlines the failure of the administration and vitiates the atmosphere on campus.        
	Besuta had earlier written to the Governor on January 31, drawing his attention to the problems on campus. Gandhi had, reportedly, forwarded the letter to the state government for appropriate action.        
	The teachers association  also critical of the absence of a students union since 2006  has decided to boycott the ongoing mid-semester exams, which was conducted according to schedule on Thursday.        
	Vice-chancellor Banerjea said: A certain section of teachers is not cooperating in conducting the exams, but there are others involved in the process. We will conduct the rest of the exams, with their help.

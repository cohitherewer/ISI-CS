	The job was mostly done by Jhontu, an associate who rode pillion. The cops are looking for Jhontu.        
	Somenath, a Harish Mukherjee Road resident, used to leave early in the morning on his two-wheeler, telling his parents that he was going to a gym.

Priya Gupta lost a chain worth Rs 18,000 to Somenath at the Rowdon Street-Shakespeare Sarani crossing around 8am on August 2, when she came to drop her daughter to school.

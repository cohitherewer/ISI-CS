          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	A Kingfisher flight that was supposed to wait in the taxiway before taking off on Wednesday afternoon advanced to the runway where a Jet Airways plane was about to land.         
	The Jet Airways Boeing, with 95 on board, hovered in the air for 10 minutes till the Kingfisher ATR aircraft, carrying 27 passengers, backed away from the runway.         
	The Kingfisher plane had advanced to Taxiway D for taking off for Aizwal. It was asked to wait till the Jet flight, which was coming from Guwahati, landed on the runway. The Kingfisher pilot, however, crossed the holding point and moved a few yards into the runway, said a senior airport official. The incident took place around 12.55am.         
	According to the standard procedure, the arriving aircraft lands and clears the runway before the departing aircraft starts taxiing on it for take off. The departing aircraft is supposed to remain behind the holding point till the runway is empty, said an airport official.         
	The pilot of the Jet flight saw an obstruction  the nose of the Kingfisher plane extending beyond the holding point, he added. Air traffic controllers radioed an urgent message to the Jet pilot asking him to hover for a few minutes.         
	The radio controllers then sent a missive to the Kingfisher pilot instructing him to back away behind the holding point. After he complied, the Jet flight got the clearance to land.         
	Officials of both airlines underplayed the incident, claiming that nothing serious had occurred and no one was inconvenienced.         
	An airport official said the lapse could have been costly. It should not have occurred since the movement of aircraft is closely monitored by the Air Traffic Control (ATC), Apron Control and Ground Control. The ATC monitors aircraft movement in air, apron controllers are responsible for aircraft movement in the apron area and ground controllers for guiding aircraft to the runways and back.        
	A probe would be conducted to find out who was at fault, added the official.

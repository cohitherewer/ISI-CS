          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two associates of Arunabha Das, allegedly involved in duping youths with the promise of jobs in private airlines, were arrested in Nimta on Wednesday.        
	Das, a 35-year-old resident of Baguiati, was arrested at the airport on Monday after an FIR was filed against him. Sandip Pal and Suman were held on the basis of information provided by Das, said an officer of airport police station.        
	Amarnath Keshari had complained to the police that Das had taken Rs 85,000 to get him a job as a ground staff member in a private airline.        
	According to sources, at least five victims of the racket have been identified and there could be many more.        
	Sleuths investigating the racket suspect there was a nexus involving the accused and ground staff of private airlines.        
	We have found out that Das and his associates had opened an institute for training airline ground staff members and used to change their office address frequently, said an officer.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that members of the racket used to publish advertisements in newspapers. Those interested in undergoing the training would be made to believe that Das and his assistants were close to senior officials of private airlines and the Airports Authority of India Employees Union.        
	The cheats used to initially take Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh from each candidate as fees. Later, they used to demand more money, claiming that the airline officials needed to be bribed, added the investigating officer.

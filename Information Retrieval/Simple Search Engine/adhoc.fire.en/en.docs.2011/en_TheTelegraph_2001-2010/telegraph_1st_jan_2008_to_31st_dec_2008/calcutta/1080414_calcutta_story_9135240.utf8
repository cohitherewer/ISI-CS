                      A colourful view from the top                    The significance of film (image) as an information source is increasing. Images have the power to break through indifference and hence there is a global shift towards a visual culture. The 13th European Union (EU) Film Festival, currently being held in the city, offers a bouquet of contemporary films ranging from thrillers to finger-on-the-pulse comedies and forceful modern-day dramas. Todays screenings include I am (Poland, 4 pm) and Bye Bye Blackbird (Luxembourg, 6 pm). I Am is the story of an 11-year-old boy in search of his place in life and his identity. He lives alone on an abandoned boat and befriends a girl living in a house nearby. Bye Bye Blackbird (picture above) is a period drama set in the early years of the 20th century and features a bravura performance by James Thirre (Charlie Chaplins grandson) who choreographed the thrilling aerial sequences and shares with his legendary forebear a prodigious gift for physical business. Director Robinson Savary deftly offers a romantic view of big top life, with a poetic sensibility that speaks to the heart.

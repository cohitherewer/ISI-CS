          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Help has started trickling in for Seema Mukherjee, the cancer patient who lost Rs 3 lakh in a taxi and had to stop her treatment because of the lack of funds.        
	On Friday, a couple of BPO employees and two others handed over cheques for Rs 1,000 each to Seema, while a senior executive of a private company also pledged his monetary support.        
	The chief ministers secretariat had promised financial assistance to the 38-year-old cancer patient on Thursday after Metro reported on Seemas plight.         
	Though no one from the state government has contacted Seema yet, the people of Calcutta came forward to show that they care.        
	On June 23, Seema had hired a taxi from Howrah station to go to her in-laws house in Ultadanga. She was carrying the Rs 3 lakh  her fathers life-savings  in a small bag.        
	Moments after she got down, Seema realised she had left the money inside the taxi. She immediately informed the police. Sleuths of the detective department prepared a sketch of the taxi driver and Seema searched taxi stands across the city for him.         
	She even went to the Writers Buildings, but was shooed away by the chief ministers staff.        
	I am waiting to collect enough money to resume my treatment, she said. I am grateful to all those who came forward to help me.

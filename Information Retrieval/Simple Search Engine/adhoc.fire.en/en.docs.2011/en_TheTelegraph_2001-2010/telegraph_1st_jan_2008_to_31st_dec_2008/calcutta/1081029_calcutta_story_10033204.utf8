                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Upkeep onus on CMC

	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been taking over properties owned and run by various government agencies following the Centres one-city-one-city-government policy.        
	The civic body, from now on, will be responsible for maintaining these properties, which include flyovers, markets, roads, booster and drainage pumping stations, parks, street lights and sanitation infrastructure in slums. The annual cost will be around Rs 10 crore.        
	We are taking over these assets in accordance with the guidelines in the 74th amendment to the Constitution. I am trying to persuade the state government to provide more funds for the upkeep of the assets, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.        
	The agencies whose properties are being taken over are the CMDA, HRBC, CIT and the state public works and irrigation departments. Sources said the PWD and the CPT are reluctant to hand over the responsibility of maintaining roads, street lights and a township in Baishnabghata-Patuli and running the conservancy service to the civic authorities. Talks are on with the port trust and the PWD, the mayor said.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the new system would provide a centralised, hassle-free service to the citizens. The agencies have been working for the betterment of the city. But the problem with most of them is that they can create assets but lack the funds or infrastructure for their upkeep.

                      For a beautiful world                    Drawing creative inspiration from the world around him, Subrata Ghosh is genuinely concerned about the loss of natures beauty and resources. Rich in earthy metaphors, his paintings lament mankinds abuse of nature and at the same time articulate the need to preserve, protect and nurture the environment. The ongoing solo show of his recent works features 16 paintings on the theme of conservation of nature and wildlife, stressing on ecological balance based on harmonious relationships between man and nature. Ghosh also emphasises the power of women to bring about positive change in the world. His compositions like Shakti, Graceful, The Queen and others convey his belief that women, with their innate power of love, compassion and imagination, can lead the way for a peaceful revolution towards a pure, clean planet.

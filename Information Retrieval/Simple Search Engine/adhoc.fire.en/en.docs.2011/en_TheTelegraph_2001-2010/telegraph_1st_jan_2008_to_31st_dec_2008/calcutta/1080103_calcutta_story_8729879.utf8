The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 08 brings home son
                                                                                                            08 brings home son
  - Metro picture leads NGO team to parents          RITH BASU                          Babai Mandal reunited with his parents on Monday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	The Mandals of Shyamnagar could not have asked for a happier new year gift  they got back their mentally-challenged son Babai on Monday after several years.        
	The photograph of the 22-year-old was published in Metro on November 26, along with a report on homeless mental patients who are being looked after by NGOs and neighbourhood clubs.        
	The report and the picture helped us locate Babais house, said Saikat Das, a member of Iswar Sankalpa, an NGO that had been looking after the youth. Neighbours who had seen the picture led us to his father on Saturday.        
	Babais mother Malati, who works as a maid, and father Lakshmi Charan, a vegetable-seller, almost choked on tears on seeing their son again after two years. This is a miracle. We had given up all hope after spending months without any news from him, said the mother.        
	Babai, she recalled, had no mental ailment as a child. But things changed after he went to work at a goldsmiths in Gujarat in 2002. He had been writing to us for a year and a half and then we lost track of him. A couple of years ago, a Mumbai NGO bought him back, but he left home again after a few days.        
	Babai had been spotted lying on the pavement in front of Tollygunge Club by Jenny Brown, the overseas director of The Hope Foundation, in November. She called Iswar Sankalpa, which attended to him right away.        
	At first, Babai was incoherent. But he gradually began responding to medication and was able to give us a fair idea about where he lived, said Das.        
	A Shyamnagar shopkeeper who saw Babai after many years said: He looked quite happy as his mother stroked his head.        
	Since Iswar Sankalpa does not have a shelter of its own for mental patients, it had made arrangement for Babai to sleep in a roadside shop at night.        
	Following a request from the NGO, Niranjan Sarkar, who runs a tea-stall in Tollygunge, provided the youth food and medicines. The organisation ensured that Babai was looked after well.

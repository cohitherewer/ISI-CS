The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Missile melee in fire fright
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Missile melee in fire fright
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The audience at a roadside soiree in Entally clashed with police early on Wednesday after the programme was disrupted by sparks from a lamp post and a transformer.         
	P.K Dam, the officer-in-charge of Entally police station, and additional officer-in-charge Rahul Kumar Sarkar were injured when the mob pelted stones at them. A local youth sustained head injuries in the police lathicharge.        
	The sparks were noticed around 1am, while the soiree was in progress. The audience panicked. They called the police station to say that a major fire had broken out. As soon as we reached the spot, a group of people surrounded us and started pelting stones, said Dam.        
	The police, who were initially caught off guard, resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the mob. What could we do? They attacked us with bricks and stones and we were outnumbered. Most of the attackers were drunk, stated Dam.        
	According to deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal, the residents were angry because the firemen had not reached the spot and vented their ire on the policemen.         
	Our officers tried to convince the residents that the fire brigade had been informed and the police station had nothing to do with the delay. But they were not convinced and continued pelting stones at our men, added Goyal.        
	The residents alleged that the police lathicharged them without provocation and this triggered the clash.        
	The sparks could have caused a major fire but the firemen did not turn up despite several reminders, complained a resident.

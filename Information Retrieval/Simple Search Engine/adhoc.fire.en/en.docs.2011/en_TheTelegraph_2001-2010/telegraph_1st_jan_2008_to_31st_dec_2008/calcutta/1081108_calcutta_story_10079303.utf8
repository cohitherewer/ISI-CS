The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass plea to Buddha
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bypass plea to Buddha
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A private firm assigned to build the Barasat Bypass has written to the chief minister seeking his intervention to facilitate land acquisition for the project.        
	The Consulting Engineering Services (India) Private Limited (CES), which was awarded the contract in 2004, has written to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressing the fear that the project may be scrapped if the land issue is not resolved soon.        
	Conceived in the late 1990s as part of the National Highway Authoritys plan to expand National Highway 34, the project is yet to be implemented because of the land knot.        
	We did make an attempt to resolve the issue on our own but our men got beaten up by villagers, who felt we were trying to grab land for some unheard of project, S.S. Chakraborty, the chairman-cum-managing director of CES, said on Friday.        
	The project, designed to bring about increased freight movement from other states to Calcutta and Haldia ports, has not progressed since being conceived.        
	According to the plan, the state will have to find the land while the Centre will pay compensation to the owners.        
	The proposed Bypass, to run 14 km in a semi-circle, will connect Nilgunge Road near Barasat to Jessore Road near Doltala. The feasibility study was carried out in 2000.        
	Officials said building the Bypass is integral to the plan to expand National Highway from two to four lanes. As part of the project, the CES had also offered to set up an airport interchange which will ensure smooth flow of traffic from the airport to both north and south.

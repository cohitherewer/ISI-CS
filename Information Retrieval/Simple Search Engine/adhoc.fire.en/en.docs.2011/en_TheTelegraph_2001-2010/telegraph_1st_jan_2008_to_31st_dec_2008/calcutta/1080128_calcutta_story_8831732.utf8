	Centrifuge saw eight teams shaking a leg. The team from Heritage Institute of Technology came up trumps, followed by Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society. A performance by rock band Pentagram brought down the curtains on the fest.        
	The opening act for Pentagram was the band that won Wildfire, the campus rock contest on January 24. UK-based band Breathe  The Delicate Sound of Floyd and Sukhwinder Singh were the biggest draws on the first two days.

	A salsa workshop at Vikramsheela was one of the biggest successes, drawing over 250 participants.

	Dum Dum Central Correctional Home is offering its inmates an opportunity to tailor their future after release.        
	The jail authorities have started a one-year certificate course in tailoring and dress making under the West Bengal State Council of Technical Education. Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, Barrackpore, is in charge of imparting the training.         
	Thirty-four inmates have signed up for the vocational course, which started in August. The clothes made by the students are used as inmates uniforms.         
	I chose tailoring as I will be able to practise it after I am released, said Zahid Hussain, who is serving a sentence in the jail. I had done some tailoring before coming here. Now I am learning the technical aspects of it, said another inmate, M.D. Mukhtar.         
	Instructors from Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission visit the prison to hold classes thrice a week for three hours each. After the course is over, the inmates will take a test and receive a certificate.         
	The course is being funded by the department of jails of the state government. This is the first course approved by the state council of technical education to be taught in a correctional home.        
	Vocational training is the most important among correctional home activities because by imparting such training, we are making the inmates self-reliant. If they are skilled, they are less likely to resort to crime after release. This kind of training is important in developing countries like India, where the jail inmates are mostly poor, said B.D. Sharma, the inspector-general of correctional services, West Bengal.         
	Weaving and carpentry are also offered to the Dum Dum inmates. We wish to offer more vocational courses so that inmates can earn a living after they are released, said Biplab Dasgupta, the jail superintendent.

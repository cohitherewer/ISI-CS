	City-based surgeon Subir K. Chatterjee has been awarded the BC Roy National Award for development of paediatric surgery. The award will be handed over to him by President Pratibha Patil at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday.        
	Chatterjee was associated in an honorary capacity with NRS Medical College and Hospital for 30 years, during which he created the department of paediatric surgery, the first of its kind in eastern India. He also founded Park Clinic, a non-profit making hospital that succeeded Park Nursing Home.         
	A consultant physician at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, he and his team are noted for handling several complicated surgeries, including the separation of two sets of conjoined twins.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Jadavpur University (JU) students held demonstrations and gheraoed the dean of student affairs for more than two hours on Tuesday, claiming that there were gross errors in the arts faculty voters list.
    
	The authorities denied the claim and would publish a voters list on Wednesday.
    
	The polls to elect students representatives to the universitys court and executive council will be held on March 18.
    
	Around 4pm on Tuesday, the members of the Faculty of Arts Students (FAS), an anti-SFI organisation, assembled in front of the office of Rajat Roy, the JU dean of student affairs, to demand revision in the voters list, which has not been published.
    
	There are nearly 3,200 students in the arts faculty. We have found that the list does not contain the names of many students. However, the names of several ex-students have been included in the list, alleged a FAS leader.
    
	According to the FAS supporters, the mistakes are intentional to help pro-SFI candidates secure votes.
    
	After a meeting, the university authorities told the agitating students that a list would be published on Wednesday.
    
	University registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay said the authorities did not find gross errors in the list.
    
	We are maintaining a very transparent procedure for holding the students elections, he added.

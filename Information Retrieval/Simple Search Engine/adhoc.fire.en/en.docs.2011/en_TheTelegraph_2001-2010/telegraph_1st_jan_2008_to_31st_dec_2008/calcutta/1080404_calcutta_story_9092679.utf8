                                                                                                               Convoy hits motorcyclist
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A motorcyclist who reportedly ignored police warnings and came in the way of the governors convoy was hit by the pilot car in Bagnan, Howrah, on Thursday evening.        
	Dipankar Meur, 38, who was not wearing a helmet, was injured on the head and admitted to Bagnan Grameen Hospital. His aunt, riding pillion, escaped unhurt.        
	The convoy was held up for 10 minutes, during which Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi stepped out of his car and directed the officers on the spot to ensure proper treatment of Meur, a resident of Amta, in Howrah.        
	Gandhi was returning to the city after spending the morning at Vidyasagar University, in Midnapore.        
	An officer had repeatedly asked the motorcyclist to stop while the convoy was switching lanes on National Highway 6, but he ignored the order. The driver of the pilot car managed to swerve on time and averted a disaster, said Neeraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah).        
	A case of traffic violation will be lodged against Meur, said an officer.

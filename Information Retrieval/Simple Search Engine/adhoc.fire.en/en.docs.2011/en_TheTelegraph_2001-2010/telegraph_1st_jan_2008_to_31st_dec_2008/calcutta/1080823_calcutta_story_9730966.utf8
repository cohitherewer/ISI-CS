  - Gang plotted pre-Puja raids on trade and jewellery hubs          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Nine alleged dacoits, who police claimed had plotted a series of raids before the Puja, were arrested over the past two days.        
	Five firearms and 23 cartridges were seized from the nine. Police said the youths had planned to rob shops in Burrabazar and jewellery outlets on BB Ganguly Street in the next few weeks.        
	The sleuths came to know during interrogation that the gang had committed four dacoities in central Calcutta.        
	Many more such operations  in Burrabazar and the jewellery hub in central Calcutta  were planned in the run up to the Puja, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	They knew that these hubs deal in lakhs daily once the festive season kicks in. So, they were looking forward to the next 30 days, Shamim added.        
	Following a tip-off, the police picked up Sheikh Aslam, Sheikh Nihaluddin and Mohammad Raffique from the northern fringes of the city on Thursday afternoon.        
	Their statements led the sleuths to three more  Gautam Chakrabarty, Shyamal Biswas and Ashok Singh  who were picked up from BB Ganguly Street around 2.30pm on Friday. The police said the trio were on their way to raid a shop in Bowbazar when they were arrested.        
	After a second round of interrogation, the police picked up the remaining three members of the gang  Mohammad Yasin, Ashoke Das and Laltu Shau  from BT Road around 4pm.        
	The were going to join Chakrabarty, Biswas and Singh when our men reached the spot, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Yasin was arrested in 1997 on charges of dacoity and spent 10 years in jail. Aslam and Nihaluddin, too, were behind bars for four years. The trio came in touch with each other while serving their sentences. After being released from prison, they formed a gang and recruited others.        
	Police said the four dacoities took place in Entally, Amherst Street and Burrabazar. We were groping in the dark to ascertain which gang was involved, said Abhranta Bandhu Majumdar, the officer-in-charge of the dacoity section.        
	The first lead came while the sleuths were probing a dacoity in a three-storeyed building, which houses a jewellery unit, in Ramtanu Bose Lane under Amherst Street police station.        
	We are looking for another youth who received a bullet injury while raiding a business outlet on Strand Road in May, said an officer.

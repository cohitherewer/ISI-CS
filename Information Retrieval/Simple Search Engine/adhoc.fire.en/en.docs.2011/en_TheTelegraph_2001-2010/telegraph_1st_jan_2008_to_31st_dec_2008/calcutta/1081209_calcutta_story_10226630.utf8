                An unattended bag sparked a bomb scare near Chandni Chowk on Monday, but it took the bomb disposal squad (BDS) an hour-and-a-half to reach the spot, punching holes in the governments security claims. The bag was later found to contain clothes. Asked about the delay of the BDS, which is a quick response team, a source in the detective department said the local police and the control room had informed them late. Local councillor Sheila Kapoor blamed communication protocol of the police for the delay. The black bag was noticed in front of 4/1 Madan Street around 7.45pm, and the police cordoned off the area at 8pm. The BDS, which was summoned from the Police Training School near the race-course, arrived at 9.20pm, with a sniffer dog. Cops suspect an Id shopper had mistakenly left behind the bag while boarding a taxi.    The condition of actress Rituparna Sengupta, who was admitted to the ICCU in AMRI last Tuesday with high fever, is stable. She will be discharged on Tuesday, but doctors have advised her bed rest for a week. But the condition of film-maker Tapan Sinha remained critical for the third consecutive day on Monday. The 84-year-old was admitted at CMRI on Saturday with chest infection and breathing problems. The breathing problem persists but his fever has subsided, said a hospital source.    Science City will open a two-storey gallery on the Earths biodiversity on Tuesday. Called the Earth Exploration Hall, it has 48 interactive audio-visual exhibits on the Earths geological phenomena, culture, flora and fauna and was built at a cost of Rs 2.6 crore.    A 42-year-old woman allegedly set herself ablaze on Monday morning in her home near Mahestala after her husband left for work. Rina Dey was declared dead when police took her to Vidyasagar Hospital. Police said she was suffering from depression. The body has been sent for post-mortem.    Metro railway services were disrupted on Monday at the Maidan station following a snag in the automated signalling system. Trains had to be operated using manual signalling till 2.57pm and service was stopped for 20 minutes at 3pm. At Tollygunge, six trains left from the arrival platform between 9.18am and 10am because of repair work at the other platform.

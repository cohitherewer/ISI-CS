                Pragya Jha, 21, whose mother had lodged a complaint with Bally police station on Sunday that her daughter was kidnapped by their neighbour, surrendered to the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, on Monday. In a statement, she said she had married Anil Rajak, 18, and wanted to stay with him. After getting bail, she was reluctant to return to Anil and wanted to go back to her parents home. This enraged Anil, who attacked her brother. Police said Anil had been arrested earlier for involvement in several crimes.     Two traffic guards were inaugurated at Bhowanipore and Beleghata to ease the pressure on Tollygunge and Sealdah traffic guards, respectively, on Monday. The total number of traffic guards in the city is now 14. During the inauguration, finance minister Asim Dasgupta announced that the count of traffic sergeants had increased from 250 to 350 and the number of traffic constables from 2,500 to 3,000. He also said 665 constables and 64 senior officers will be deployed exclusively to handle the traffic situation in North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Howrah districts.     A middle-aged man hanged himself at his Gopal Dutta Lane residence, in Jorabagan, on Monday morning. According to neighbours, Tarun Das, 35, lived alone. He was unemployed and a habitual drunkard. Preliminary investigation revealed that Das died around 11pm on Sunday. The body was taken to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.    A crude bomb was hurled on the wall of a Munshigunge Road building, in Watgunge, on Monday afternoon. Pradip Das, 35, was arrested. No injuries were reported.     Sheikh Matlub of Jhargram was arrested on Monday for a string of bank robberies and his alleged involvement in the murder of contractor Ashok Agarwal of Jamshedpur. Acting on a tip-off, police picked him up from a flat in the city. Cops claimed they were investigating if he was behind the recent murder of the Sreeleathers unit head in Jamshedpur.

	The zilla parishad sabhadhipatis who will take office after the ongoing panchayat polls are over will be trained at the Indian Institute Management Calcutta (IIMC).        
	The Joka institute, which has been approached by the state panchayat and rural development department for the training, is developing a week-long residential module that will cover all aspects of good governance.        
	We are working out the details in consultation with the department, said Raghabendra Chattopadhyay, of IIMCs business environment department, who will conduct the training. The institute had earlier trained a few engineers and officials involved with the panchayat administration.        
	During the training, the sabhadhipatis will be introduced to modern managerial skills, including e-governance, and pressing issues.        
	A sabhadhipati is equivalent to a minister of state in status and is responsible for the general and financial administration of the zilla parishad and maintenance of records.        
	There will be a lot of new faces after the polls. They will need to be oriented to their roles and responsibilities, pointed out Chattopadhyay.        
	The institute is also thinking of a follow-up programme of a shorter duration.        
	We will not be able to finalise the details till the newly-elected sabhadhipatis take their oath, said M.N. Roy, the principal secretary in the panchayat and rural development department.        
	The department has also asked the B-school to conduct a study on the functioning of the three-tier panchayat system in the state.        
	We will focus on better integration of the three tiers, said Chattopadhyay.

	Calcutta University has selected five colleges which the University Grants Commission (UGC) will upgrade to centres of excellence.        
	The five colleges are Lady Brabourne, Bethune, Maulana Azad, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir (Belur) and Bijoykrishna Girls (Howrah).        
	Sources said the university would also recommend RK Mission Residential College (Narendrapur), an autonomous institution, for the upgrade.        
	The UGC had written to the state government and various universities in Bengal, expressing its willingness to upgrade eight colleges to centres of excellence.         
	Calcutta University had shortlisted 16 colleges but the UGC asked it to send the names of only five. Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das refused to comment on the final list but confirmed that it had been sent to the UGC.         
	The UGC is likely to inspect the shortlisted colleges in the next three months, an official said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Train goes over   but youth lives
          OUR BUREAU                                             
	A youth whose luck was stronger than his death wish emerged unscathed from under a Metro train on Monday afternoon but another who jumped on the tracks hours later died.         
	Subhas Manna, a resident of Amtala on Diamond Harbour Road, tried to end his life by throwing himself in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at 3.16pm but fell into the drain between the rails. As the train went over him and motorman R.B. Prasad used the emergency brakes, the 25-year-old remained safe in the drain.         
	What followed was even more dramatic. Subhas, 25, could not be traced for around 20 minutes as he held the third rail  power had been switched off  and crawled further away under the train.        
	When we found him, he was holding on to a rod between the undercarriage of the third and fourth compartments, a Metro Railway official said.         
	Subhas refused to let go of the rod and had to be dragged out. When Metro employees took him to the station managers office and asked him who he was, the youth refused to speak. He was later handed over to Hare Street police station.         
	It wasnt until late in the evening that interrogators confirmed his identity and contacted his family. But they could not get him to talk about the reason for attempting suicide.         
	Subhass parents told the police that their son was mentally unstable and had been undergoing treatment. They brought along prescriptions and medical certificates to prove it, an officer at Hare Street police station said.         
	Subhas was carrying a wallet that was empty except for a picture of actress Rani Mukerji and folded postcards of some other celebrities.         
	Three trains were cancelled after the incident. Metro services resumed at 3.50pm, an official said.         
	The second incident occurred at Belgachhia around 6pm. Kaushik Das, 36, jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train and died instantly. His right leg was severed. He also had a fatal head injury, an official said.         
	Two Dum Dum-bound and three Tollygunge-bound trains had to be cancelled as Metro Railway employees extracted the body. Train services resumed at 6.40 pm.         
	Although attempt to suicide is a crime, the police wont file a case against Subhas because he is mentally unstable. In such cases, the police generally send the person to a mental asylum after seeking a magistrates order.

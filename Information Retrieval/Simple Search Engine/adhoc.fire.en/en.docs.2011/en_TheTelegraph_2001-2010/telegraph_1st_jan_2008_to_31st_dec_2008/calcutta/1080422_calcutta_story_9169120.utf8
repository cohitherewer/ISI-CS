          OUR BUREAU                          The jewellery seized from the arrested six. Picture by Pronab Biswas                                  
	Saali bahut shor macha rahi hai. Usko gira de.        
	One of the criminals yelled these words before pushing Chandana Das off the third-floor balcony of her house in Kanchrapara early on February 21. She was trying to alert neighbours.        
	The sleuths, who were not sure whether the woman was pushed by the robbers, reconstructed the events leading to the 42-year-old homemakers death following the arrest of six criminals who were part of the 13-member gang that had raided the Das house. They were picked up from Dhaniakhali, in Hooghly district, on Sunday night.        
	The other seven criminals had been arrested earlier. Of the 13, five are from Uttar Pradesh and two from Rajasthan, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Around two kg of gold jewellery, worth around Rs 20 lakh, and precious stones were seized from the criminals, said an officer. We suspect that a chunk of the items was robbed from the house of Chandana, whose husband Bimal runs a jewellery store.        
	Three revolvers, eight rounds of cartridges and three cellphones were among the other items seized from the six  Ganpat Ram, Prempal, Babulal Singh, Balveer Singh, Bhagwan Singh and Banwari Lal  who were arrested in Hooghly.        
	The sleuths came across the first set of leads while interrogating six local members of the gang who were picked up from North 24-Parganas, Nadia and Hooghly on February 25.        
	Surya Golder (alias Gabbar), Ratan Tarui and Babar Ali  the other three were their associates  reportedly told the police that the dacoity was masterminded by Sishu Pal and Ganpat, both residents of UP. The sleuths had also traced Bimals cellphone that the gang had taken away to UP.        
	A fortnight ago, a team from North 24-Parganas police left for UP and arrested Pal in Badaun. He is being brought to the city. An officer of UP police said Pal had served four years in jail for a dacoity.        
	He told the police that the other six members of the gang were holed up in Hooghlys Dhaniakhali.        
	Gabbar, also a gunrunner, came in touch with Pal and Ganpat while procuring arms from UP, said an officer.

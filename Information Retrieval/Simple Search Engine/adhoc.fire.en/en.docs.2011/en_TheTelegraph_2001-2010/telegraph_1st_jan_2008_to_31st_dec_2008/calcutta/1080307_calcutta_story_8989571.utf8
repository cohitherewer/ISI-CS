The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Thrashed for child molest, slits throat
                                                                                                               Thrashed for child molest, slits throat
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old slit his throat on Thursday after being caught allegedly molesting an eight-year-old girl. He was thrashed by a mob in the Park Street police station area.        
	Murshed Ali Mollah, a zari worker from Murshidabad, was admitted to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he underwent an operation. Doctors said he had damaged his windpipe.        
	A molestation case has been slapped on the youth following a complaint lodged by the girls family.        
	He will also be charged with attempting suicide. If Murshed dies and our probe reveals that there was a provocation to the suicide, those who beat him up will be prosecuted on an abetment charge, said Kuldiep Singh, the additional commissioner of police (IV).        
	Singh said Murshed had lured the girl, who lives close to his rented shelter on Nawab Abdul Rahman Street, to Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square around noon. He took the girl to a corner in the park and started misbehaving with her, Singh said.        
	A group of four youths noticed the duo and got suspicious. They immediately went over and asked Murshed what he was doing in the park with the girl. Murshed could not give a satisfactory reply, said Singh.        
	On being quizzed further, he said the girl was his niece.        
	One of the youths challenged the statement, saying he knew the girls family well. The group then took Murshed to the girls house, where his statement was proved false, said an officer of Park Street police station.        
	As news of the molestation spread, around 50 people gathered on the spot and started assaulting Murshed.        
	While the mob was pouncing on him, Murshed took out a pair of scissors from his trouser pocket and slashed his throat. The mob panicked on seeing blood oozing from a gash on the youths throat and informed Park Street police station, the officer said.        
	After reaching the spot, the police saw Murshed lying on the road, groaning in pain. We immediately took him to hospital, where doctors said his windpipe was badly damaged. He was soon operated on and will be kept under observation for the next two days, the officer added.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bengal playground for BJP biggies
  - Raje in town, Modi arrives next week to sell business opportunities          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                          Vasundhara Raje at a city hotel on Thursday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The BJPs star chief ministers are fishing in the troubled waters of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal.        
	Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje touched down in Calcutta on Thursday evening to woo the non-resident Rajasthani community ahead of Assembly elections in her state. Next week, Narendra Modi will visit the city  not to commiserate with Bhattacharjee for losing the Nano to him but to sell investment opportunities as part of his nation-wide Vibrant Gujarat tour.        
	I love Calcutta and frequently keep coming back to this city There are so many people known to me here, said Raje, who attended a Rajasthan Foundation programme on Thursday evening. The foundation is an autonomous body under the Rajasthan government.        
	Around 12 lakh people from Rajasthan, most of them traders, live in Calcutta.        
	The Rajasthan chief minister will leave on Friday evening, after meeting representatives of various Rajasthani associations through the day. From seeking assistance for various development projects in the state to inviting industrialists to set up shop there, Raje intends to make non-resident Rajasthanis feel they are as much a part of that state as the domiciles.        
	For Modi, who will be making his second visit to Marxist Bengal since taking over as Gujarat chief minister in 2001, the challenge will be to take more out of the state than just Tata Motors Nano project from Singur to Sanand. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is partnering his government in the investment hunt.        
	Neither Modi nor Raje has any political engagement in Calcutta, indicating that the focus will be on business.        
	People from Rajasthan living in Calcutta are already with me. They are part of our teamDo I need to pitch here, asked Raje, stealing a glance at the business representatives attending the Rajasthan Foundation programme.                          
	She found an ally in state Rajasthan Foundation president H.M. Bangur. The managing director of the Rs 2,800-crore Shree Cement said with a smile: I run the company from Calcutta but all my investments are in Rajasthan.         
	It is not just about investment in industry. Various business houses based in Calcutta are setting up speciality hospitals and schools and colleges in Rajasthan.        
	But remember, we are not competing with any other state. My objective is to improve the condition of Rajasthan, Raje said.        
	She insisted that the state had shed the image of a laggard and attracted investment since her government rolled out the Resurgent Rajasthan initiative.        
	The administrative and bureaucratic complexities are much less in        
	Rajasthan compared to Bengal. But it still has a lot of catching up to do, if the comparison is with Gujarat, said an industrialist who attended the programme.        
	Modis impending visit has already generated interest among the investor community in Bengal. People have started talking about the meeting on October 24. But the number and nature of the gathering will show how much of Bengals loss will be Gujarats gain.

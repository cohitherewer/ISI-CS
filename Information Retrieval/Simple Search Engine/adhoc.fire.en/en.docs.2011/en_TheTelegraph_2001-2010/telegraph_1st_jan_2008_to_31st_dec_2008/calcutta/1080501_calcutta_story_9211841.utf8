          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The executive council of Jadavpur University has virtually discarded the report of the one-man commission that probed violence on the campus in April 2007.         
	The council, one of the two highest decision-making bodies of the university, on Wednesday described Ashoke Mohan Chakrabortys findings and recommendations as inconclusive and irrelevant.         
	The commission, set up by the government, had submitted its report in December.        
	The council, controlled by pro-CPM members, suggested that vice chancellor P.N. Ghosh independently take steps to stop violence on the campus.        
	The commission has failed to identify the main culprits for lack of witnesses. It has suggested that the university authorities initiate a further inquiry. In such a situation, we feel the university should take measures on its own to ensure that violence does not recur, said a member of the council.        
	The commission had found out that We the Independents and the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students, two anti-CPM students bodies in the university, were not solely responsible for the violence on the night April 5, 2007.        
	The commission did not recommend punishment for any student and questioned the role of an employees union.         
	The council punished four students for misbehaving with a reveller on December 31. Two of them have been expelled from their hostel for two years, while another has been expelled for a year. The fourth student has been warned. His conduct will be assessed after six months.

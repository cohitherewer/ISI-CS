The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power boost for pumps
                                                                                                            Power boost for pumps
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Tourists wade through a waterlogged street                                  
	CESC will chip in with a Rs 4-crore project to help the civic body minimise waterlogging.        
	The private sector power utility has drawn up a plan to upgrade the 70-year-old supply network of pumping stations to ensure that they operate to capacity.        
	Waterlogging would be lot less if we could ensure proper utilisation of the pumps, said a senior official in the civic drainage department.        
	The company will relay the supply cables, provide emergency lines to the pumping stations and set up transformers where needed.        
	None of the pumping stations now has an emergency line, resulting in shutdown during a disruption. The old cables often spring leaks and are unable to feed the required wattage to the pumps. There are also frequent instances of cable burst, leading to disruption in supply, said an official in the power department.        
	Speaking about the CESCs revamp plan, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said: Better supply will ensure proper utilisation of the pumps and, in turn, faster draining out of water.        
	Of the 21 pumping stations, 14 will be brought under the supply upgrade scheme. The stations in Dhapa, Ballygunge and Palmerbazar will be covered in the first phase, said civic chief engineer (electric) Pradipjyoti Biswas. Among the rest to be covered in later phases are the ones in Hrishikesh Park, Maniktala, Tollygunge, Ultadanga and Mominpur.        
	The civic body has prepared a Rs 253-crore scheme, to be funded by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, to replace old pumps. A civic engineer said the capacity of 70 per cent of the drainage pumps had declined by 70 per cent.        
	But the old pumps will be replaced with modern ones only after CESC completes its revamp work, said an official.

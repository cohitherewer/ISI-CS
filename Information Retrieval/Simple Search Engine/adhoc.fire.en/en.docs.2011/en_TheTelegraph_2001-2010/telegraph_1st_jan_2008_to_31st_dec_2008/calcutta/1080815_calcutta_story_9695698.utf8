  - After culpable homicide, Kundalia accused of fraud          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      Pradip Kundalia      
	Pradip Kundalia, the realtor charged with culpable homicide for a 1989 building collapse that killed 11 people, has been arrested a second time for allegedly duping an elderly tenant into vacating his house.         
	Police arrested Kundalia on Thursday on the basis of a complaint by 78-year-old Manas Chandra Dutta, who said the realtor had promised to give him a flat in return for vacating the house in which he was a tenant from 1956 till 2004.        
	Kundalia had entered into an agreement with Dutta in 2004, promising a flat in exchange for his rented 2,000-square-foot apartment that was later demolished to construct a housing complex. But Dutta has yet to get the promised flat in Bhowanipore, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police in charge of the detective department.         
	A team from the detective department arrested Kundalia, 52, from his Chandni Chowk office around 6pm and registered a case of criminal conspiracy and cheating against him. The culpable homicide case in which he and 11 co-promoters are accused is still awaiting disposal in an Alipore court.         
	Dutta said in his complaint that Kundalia purchased the three-storey building in which he was a tenant from Arya Kumar Ghosh in 2004 and struck separate deals with all the residents.         
	The other tenants at 35/9 Padmapukur Road (in Bhowanipore) handed over their flats to Kundalia in return for money. Dutta was offered money, too, but he asked for a flat instead because he had no other place to go to. Dutta even told him (Kundalia) that he did not need a flat measuring 2,000 square feet, which was the size of the apartment where he used to live. He agreed to accept a flat half that size, a member of the investigation team said.         
	Kundalia was to have given Dutta, who shifted to his sisters house on Maniktala Main Road after vacating the apartment, a flat in another location within 18 months. As time went by, the realtor allegedly started avoiding the elderly man.         
	Dutta was convinced he had been duped when Kundalia refused to speak to him. He lodged a complaint on Wednesday.

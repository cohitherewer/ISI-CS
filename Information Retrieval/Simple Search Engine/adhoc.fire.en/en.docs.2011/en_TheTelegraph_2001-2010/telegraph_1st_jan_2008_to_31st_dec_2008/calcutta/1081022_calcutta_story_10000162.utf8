                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bank agent held for theft bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A sub-agent of a nationalised bank was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly attacking a colleague and trying to snatch Rs 85,000 from him.        
	Saikat Barua, in his late-30s, was allegedly attacked by Nirmal Bhattacharjee, 50, and one of his aides at the Sealdah branch of Canara Bank.         
	Barua and Bhattacharjee work as sub-agents for a company that collects money for the bank, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	Police said Barua was on his way to deposit his previous days collection at 8.30am when Bhattacharjee drew his attention to some Rs 10 notes lying on the stairs. As Barua bent down, Bhattacharjee hit him on the head with a chopper and tried to snatch the money. Barua was bleeding profusely but still managed to punch Bhattacharjee in the face.         
	Hearing the commotion, a sweeper rushed to the spot and took both to NRS Hospital. Bhattacharjees aide had fled by then.         
	Bhattacharjee told the police that he and Barua had been attacked by snatchers. But there were discrepancies in his statement, said Shamim.

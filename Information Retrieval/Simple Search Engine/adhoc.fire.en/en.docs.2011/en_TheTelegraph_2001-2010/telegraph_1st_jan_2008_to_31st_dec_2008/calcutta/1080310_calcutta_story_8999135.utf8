The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Detained for fake cash links
                                                                                                               Detained for fake cash links
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two persons were detained on Sunday for their alleged links with a fake currency racket. The duo were picked up after a tip-off. A probe is on to ascertain whether they were part of the racket, said an officer of New Market police station.        
	The kingpins are based in Bangladesh and the Northeast, the officer added. They have been operating in the city through agents, most of whom are from the fringes. We have alerted all police stations in the city and North and South 24-Parganas, the officer said.        
	On Thursday night, 50 fake notes of Rs 500 denomination and five of Rs 1,000 denomination were seized from Shahjahan Mohammad at the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-Lenin Sarani crossing. Shahjahan was on his way to deliver the consignment to a person in Jorasanko. He used to be paid on the number of fake notes he delivered in a month, an investigating officer said.        
	Shahjahan, originally from Bihar, reportedly told the police that several people were engaged in ferrying fake notes.        
	He has given the addresses of some of the carriers and raids are on to arrest them. Most of them are unemployed and live in slums, another officer said.        
	The kingpins often visit the city and stay in hotels in central Calcutta. Some of the hotels have been raided but they could not be tracked down because of a lack of coordination among the police stations, the officer pointed out.

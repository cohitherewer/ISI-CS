  - Man sparks panic on platform          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	His name was Bipad and he put the lives of many in danger, running on a crowded Howrah station platform wielding a chopper. A home guard was injured while trying to rein him in.        
	Police said Bipad Paswan, who works as a mason in Bangalore, arrived in Howrah on Monday afternoon on his way home to Vaishali, in Bihar.        
	Around 1pm, commuters on platform No. 8 were terrified on seeing Bipad swinging the chopper over his head and charging at the crowd every now and then.        
	As people panicked and started running helter-skelter, Swapan Samanta, a home guard of the government railway police (GRP), decided to confront the man and seized the weapon. But Bipad was in no mood to be reined in and hit Samanta on the face and the left ear. Samanta was rushed to hospital, where his wounds were stitched.        
	Bipad was finally overpowered by a commuter, Jugal Parekh, who caught him from behind after scanning his movements for a couple of minutes.        
	I was behind a stall and the man was in front of the platform inspectors office. I was watching him for some time, hoping to catch him unawares. At an opportune moment, I grabbed him from behind and shook the weapon out of his grip. He did resist a bit but finally gave in, said Parekh.        
	Bipad was later handed over to the GRP.         
	The man was arrested. He will be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court on Tuesday. We are trying to find out whether he is mad or had acted under the influence of alcohol or any drug, said Shankar Singh, the superintendent of railway police.        
	The man had a wild look and he seemed determined on striking someone, Samanta said, lying in his hospital bed.

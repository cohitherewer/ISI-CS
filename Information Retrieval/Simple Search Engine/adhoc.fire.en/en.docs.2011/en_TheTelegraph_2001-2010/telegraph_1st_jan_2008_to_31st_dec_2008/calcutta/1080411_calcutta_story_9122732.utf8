                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blood on VIP Road

	An elderly pedestrian was killed by a speeding taxi on VIP Road on Thursday evening.        
	Purnendu Roy, in his 60s, was hit by the taxi while crossing VIP Road at Narayantala, about a kilometre from where a 217B bus had plunged into Lower Bagjola Canal last Friday, killing 21 people.        
	Witnesses said the taxi was speeding towards Ultadanga when it hit the pedestrian, around 8.50pm. Roys head was smashed and he died on the spot, police said.        
	Over 2,000 residents and commuters blocked VIP Road and refused to let anyone remove the body till senior police officers turned up. A round of lathicharge failed to disperse the mob.        
	A large contingent comprising forces from five police stations (including airport, Baguiati and Rajarhat), led by senior officials of Belghoria and Barasat, removed the body around 10.20pm.         
	Sugata Sen, the additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said: We are trying to find out how the accident occurred and a search is on for the taxi-driver.        
	The police said Roy had been living in a temple near the mishap spot since his sons death 10 years ago. There was no news of other family members till late on Thursday.        
	Traffic on both flanks of VIP Road came to a halt for an hour and a half.        
	Road mishaps: A 55-year-old CESC employee was mowed down by a private bus at the AJC Bose Road-Park Street crossing on Thursday morning. Rameswar Shaw was crossing the intersection when the traffic light turned green, witnesses said.         
	The Behala resident was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. He is survived by his wife and four sons. He was always so calm and alert. Why would he be trying to cross the road in a hurry? wondered Sujoy, the youngest son of Rameswar.        
	The bus will be sent for mechanical tests. If it is proved that the driver could have avoided the accident, he would be booked, said an officer.        
	An unidentified man was knocked down and killed by a private bus in Garia around 9.30pm. He died at MR Bangur Hospital.

                      Explorations in printmaking                    From the beginning of her artistic career, Samita Nag has endeavoured to master the finer points of the various modes of printmaking. She has experimented with the intricacies of intaglio, as well as drypoint, mezzotint and colography techniques. She has also worked on a melange of plates of different materials and coloration methods. Her early works are landscapes, where she has tried to capture the iridescence of rural Bengal with its sensuous charm of the seasons and vignettes of rural life, like scenes with jugglers, bird sellers, fairs and festivals. More recently, her artistic sensibilities have been inspired by pre-historic rock paintings of Bhimbhatka in central India. An attempt to discover the contemporary in these primitive works of art led Nag to do a series of etchings based on them. The ongoing exhibition presents works that are distinctive, personal expressions of her creativity, where she has infused a dynamic plasticity and paradox of form and content, while trying to convey the raw primal energy and the silent cry of the long lost creatures of imagination depicted in the cave paintings.                  Event: Graphic works by Samita Nag When: Till June 14; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

	The debate over the Book Fair venue first reached the court in 2002, when the state government resolved to set up a permanent fairground. It has failed to deliver on its promise, leading to uncertainty over the fair since 2006.        
	2002         
	October: Environment activist Subhas Dutta files a petition in the high court stating that fairs on the Maidan are harming Victoria Memorial. The court orders the constitution of an expert committee to look into the matter.        
	2003        
	September: The expert committee states that the fairs are harming the Memorial.        
	November 11: The court orders the state government to shift all fairs from the area.        
	November 27: The advocate-general tells the court that the government will shift all fairs from the Maidan to a permanent fairground on the EM Bypass and that funds have been allotted for the project. He asks for time.         
	2004        
	Book Fair, Trade Fair and Handloom Expo held on the Maidan. The other fairs are shifted.        
	2005        
	January: A division bench blames the government for failing to protect the Maidan. Only Book Fair is held on the Maidan.        
	2006        
	January: Dutta files a fresh petition against holding the Book Fair on the Maidan. Army initially refuses the Publisher and Booksellers Guild permission to hold the fair on the Maidan. Guild files a petition in the high court, which grants permission to hold the fair on the Maidan for one last time but with proper environmental checks.        
	November: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announces that the government will move court to ensure that the fair is held on the Maidan.        
	2007        
	January: The guild files a PIL, which the high court dismisses. The government bypasses Fort William and gets the defence ministrys nod to hold the fair on the Maidan.        
	A court directive stops preparations for the fair, pending clearances, which the guild procures overnight from the government departments. Court says no to the fair being held on the Maidan on environmental grounds. The fair is held in the Salt Lake stadium compound.        
	2008         
	The guild secures permission from the civic body to hold the fair on Park Circus Maidan. Three petitions filed in the high court against the choice of venue. On Monday, the court says no to Book Fair on Park Circus Maidan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green theme for puja prize
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Green theme for puja prize
  - Siliguri to vie with city          A STAFF REPORTER                          Idol size and decoration will matter less in this years green puja award                                        
	Durga puja organisers will have to go green to take part in the government-organised Sera Desh Sera Nirmal Puja Purashkar 2008. Environment minister Sailen Sarkar conveyed this to all puja committees at a recent meeting.        
	This year, our theme is environment. We have requested all clubs and NGOs to organise environment-friendly Durga puja, environment secretary M.L. Meena said. Ten of the 1,000-odd big puja committees in the city will be shortlisted depending on how well they uphold the theme. The best of the 10 will win the award.        
	The organisers concern for the environment will count more than the pandal decoration or the idol size, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department. A set of guidelines is being prepared which will primarily emphasise on the kinds of material to be used while decorating pandals.        
	The guidelines will be handed over to the organisers a month before the puja, said Mukherjee. One of the conditions for the organisers is to set up a small green pavilion, which will serve as a centre to create awareness about the environment among the people.        
	Sources said the rise in pollution, felling of trees and the neglect of the environment contributed to the choice of this years theme.        
	The award, introduced last year, includes a trophy and a certificate. This year Siliguri has been brought within the ambit of the award, said an official of the environment department. The panel of judges will include environmentalists and NGOs.

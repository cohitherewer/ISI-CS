The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back to court for maimed Maidan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Back to court for maimed Maidan 
          A STAFF REPORTER                         Violation 1: A hole drilled for a flagpole flouting green norms. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				             Violation 2: Vehicles parked on the Maidan during Saturday rsquo;s rally. The high court banned parking around the Victoria Memorial in 2007            Violation 3: A pile of ash on the Maidan stands testimony to the excesses of Saturday rsquo;s rally. Cooking on the greens is banned                                
	Green activists found a mountain of evidence to drag the CPMs youth wing to court for mauling the Maidan despite the organisation claiming to have cleaned up after Saturdays rally.         
	We have taken photographs of the portions that were damaged. We will give the court an authentic picture of what the rallyists did to the Maidan when it opens on Monday, Subhas Dutta, the face of green activism in the city, said after a survey on Sunday morning.         
	The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) had turned a part of the Maidan into a community kitchen where chicken curry was cooked for 130 busloads of supporters.         
	Both the rally and the picnic that followed were in violation of a Calcutta High Court order banning parking on roads around the Maidan and cooking in the open within a three-kilometre radius of the Victoria Memorial.         
	As many as 15 large utensils had been used to cook chicken curry and rice on the greens, barely a kilometre from the monument, for around 1 lakh people. Dutta said around 1,000 holes were drilled to erect bamboo flagpoles, put up barricades and install loudspeakers.         
	A group of DYFI activists tried to mend the damage on Sunday morning but signs of Saturdays excesses proved difficult to hide. The damage is irreparable. How can they restore the greens to their original state by filling up the holes with sand and mud? In any case, rules have been flouted and we intend to take it up with the court, Dutta said.         
	Avash Roychoudhury, the state secretary of the DYFI, admitted that food was cooked and served to the rallyists but not on the Maidan. He claimed the DYFI had no intention of violating the courts guidelines. Some of our rural supporters were unaware of the intricacies of the courts order (issued in September 2007) and unintentionally did some damage to the greens. We had obtained permission to hold the rally and published a set of guidelines, including the high courts order.         
	The army, which maintains the Maidan, indicated it would think twice before allowing another rally of this scale. We had given permission for the rally when the political party gave us an undertaking that it would restore the ground back to its previous condition. Our representatives will visit the Maidan and assess the restoration work. We will take a stand after that, an army spokesperson said.

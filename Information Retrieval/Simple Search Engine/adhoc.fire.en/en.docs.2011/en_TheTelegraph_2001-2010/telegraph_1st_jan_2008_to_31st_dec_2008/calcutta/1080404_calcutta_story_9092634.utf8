	The interim bail granted to Mohun Bagan footballer Jose Ramirez Barreto after his arrest on March 20 was upheld on Thursday.        
	The 31-year-old Brazilian was picked up from NSC Bose International Airport for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act.         
	While upholding the bail plea, Ratan Gupta, the acting chief judicial magistrate of Barasat, asked Barreto to appear before the investigating officer once in a fortnight. Earlier, he was asked to appear once a week.        
	The judge, however, ruled out returning Barretos passport that the customs officials had seized. The court has not taken cognisance of the matter. So, the return of the passport was not decided during Thursdays hearing, said Hiralal Bhattacharjee, who represented the customs department.        
	Barreto, who was to fly to Sao Paolo on vacation, was arrested after he was found carrying $20,500 without declaring the amount.        
	According to the rules, foreigners have to make a declaration if they are carrying, into the country or out of it, more than $10,000 in foreign exchange.        
	Barretos counsel Dipak Dey argued that the soccer star did not know the rule.        
	The case will be heard again on April 5.

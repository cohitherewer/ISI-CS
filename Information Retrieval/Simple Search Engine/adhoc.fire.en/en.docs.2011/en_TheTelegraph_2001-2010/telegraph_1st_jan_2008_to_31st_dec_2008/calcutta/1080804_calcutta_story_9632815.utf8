The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Notice to collect tax dues
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Notice to collect tax dues
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic body has decided to paste notices on buildings for which property tax hasnt been paid for at least two years. The notices will proclaim their owners as defaulters.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) owes over Rs 150 crore from the owners of 55,000-plus residential and commercial buildings. The civic revenue department expects to realise about Rs 40 crore by putting up the notices. The owners will pay up fearing loss of social standing. It is an unpleasant option for us but unfortunately, most of the defaulters are financially capable of clearing the dues but are not doing so, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday.        
	This is the first step of our operation to realise unpaid property tax. In the second phase, civic revenue officials will visit the defaulters with copies of unpaid bills and ask them to pay up on the spot. If they dont, the civic authorities will seize movable assets. Finally, we will approach the court for orders to attach the properties, said chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee.         
	The Science City authorities have reached an agreement with the civic body, according to Mukherjee, to clear property tax dues to the tune of about Rs 21 crore. The authorities will hand over five acres from the campus on Park Circus connector to the civic body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire razes Tangra unit
                                                                                                               Fire razes Tangra unit
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in a machinery spare-parts factory, where huge quantities of plastic and inflammable materials were stocked, in Tangra on Wednesday morning.        
	Twenty tenders took three hours to douse the blaze. There was no casualty or injury.        
	We were informed about the fire around 10.30am and rushed eight tenders to the spot, said an officer of West Bengal Fire Services. Later, 12 more tenders were pressed into service.        
	The cause of the fire could not be ascertained. Officers said the property was extensively damaged.         
	The extent of loss can be assessed only after the burnt unit was cleared out and surveyed.        
	The fire started in the manufacturing unit of Rachna Collapsible Tube, one of the several units in the walled compound at 12 Radhanath Chowdhury Road. The other units are engaged in the manufacture and processing of chemicals, rubber and plastic items and machine spares, among other things.        
	There were over 25 employees working in the affected unit when thick smoke was noticed. The unit was immediately evacuated and the fire brigade was informed.        
	Negotiating the narrow approach road to the single entry point of the premises where the unit is located was a problem. But the fire fighting operation went off smoothly, a fire brigade officer said. The factory owners had adequate fire-safety measures in place, including hydrants and extinguishers, he added.        
	However, the unit was packed with inflammable goods, including paint, thinner spirits and plastics, enabling the flames to spread rapidly.         
	The fire-fighters first concentrated on containing the blaze, since the affected unit is close to other factories and warehouses and a cluster of slums as well.        
	The fire has destroyed the factory. It will be a while before the unit becomes operational again, said Nasir Ahmed, an employee of Rachna Collapsible Tube.

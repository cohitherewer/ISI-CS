          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 61-year-old man wanted in Mumbai and Calcutta for allegedly cheating several promoters and students of lakhs was arrested in his rented New Alipore flat on Tuesday.         
	Dipankar Mukherjee claimed he practised law till a few years back. According to police, he had taken Rs 25-30 lakh from promoters in the past four years by offering the right to develop a 20-cottah plot with a dilapidated house on Ekbalpore Road.        
	Mukherjee also cheated students and their parents by promising admission in private medical colleges under the management quota, said an officer of Ekbalpore police station.        
	He had taken Rs 3.5 lakh from a surgeon based in Behala by promising him space to set up a chamber in the highrise building that would come up on his Ekbalpore Road property.        
	He allegedly took Rs 1 lakh from Gayatri Sarkar of Ekbalpore this year by offering her son a job overseas. When the offer letter did not arrive, Gayatri lodged a complaint with the police station. Sharmila Farque of Tiljala Lane also lodged a complaint against Mukherjee for duping her by promising an overseas job.        
	In Mumbai, Mukherjee had pretended to be the proprietor of a fictitious firm and took money from those interested in developing properties in Calcutta, added the officer.        
	A Mumbai court had recently issued an arrest warrant against him. Ekbalpore police executed the warrant on Tuesday.

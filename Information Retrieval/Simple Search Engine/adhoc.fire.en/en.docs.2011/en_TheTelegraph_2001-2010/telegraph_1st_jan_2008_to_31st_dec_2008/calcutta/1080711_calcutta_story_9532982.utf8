          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old man was crushed by a lorry in Domjur on Thursday morning while he was cycling to a shop to buy medicine for his ailing daughter.        
	Madhu Patra, a resident of Debirpara in Domjur, died on the spot.         
	The sand-laden lorry from Calcutta was plying down Benaras Road. Two local youths chased the lorry after the mishap, but the driver and the cleaner fled leaving the vehicle near Rajchandrapur toll plaza.        
	The lorry has been impounded. We are trying to trace the duo, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	Patra, who worked with a stockist, went to buy medicine for her 10-year-old daughter Dola, who has been suffering from fever for the past few days. He went to a store in Jagadishpur Bazar but it had run out of stock. He was on his way to another shop in Aksara Bazar, two km from home, when the mishap occurred.

                      Enchanting reality                    A fondness for vast, natural landscapes characterises the paintings of Sambhu Saha. He has made oil on canvas his favourite medium of expression as he considers that oil produces brighter images with greater depth. Working with slow deliberation and vivid imagination, his works have an ethereal, dream-like quality that gives forth the feeling that one is in the middle of a reverie. Primarily working with the spatula to produce effects reminiscent of late 19th century impressionists, his oils have visible strokes, open composition and familiar subject-matter. Yet, they are represented from a peculiar perspective, often with an emphasis on light and its changing qualities. Giving greater importance to colour than theme, he uses an unusual palette of colours that offers viewers an overall visual effect rather than highlighting details. His short, broken strokes of pure and unmixed colour, not smoothly blended with the surface, produce a vibrant, dynamic effect, capturing images as they would appear to viewers had they barely caught a fleeting glimpse of the scene. Impressions, his ongoing maiden solo show of oil paintings, features scenes from everyday life that appear draped in mysterious, magical beauty.                    Event: Paintings by Sambhu Saha When: Till September 30; 1 pm - 7.30 pm Where: Tejas Art Gallery, 11 Mayfair Road

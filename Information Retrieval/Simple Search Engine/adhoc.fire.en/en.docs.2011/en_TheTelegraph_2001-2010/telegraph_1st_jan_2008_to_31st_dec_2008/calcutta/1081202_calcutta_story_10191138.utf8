                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Doubt over Besu upgrade
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Centre is having second thoughts about the proposed upgrade of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) following the recent student violence that led to the campus being closes down indefinitely.        
	The Union human resource development ministry has written to the Shibpur institute seeking its opinion on whether it deserved the upgrade in the wake of the violence.        
	The ministry had sent a letter asking us to give our opinion on the recent incidents on the campus. We have sent our reply, said Besu registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	The Anandakrishnan Committee appointed by the Centre had recommended that Besu and four other institutes be upgraded to Indian institutes of engineering science and technology.        
	Sources said the timing of the letter had left the Besu authorities worried as the Centre was scheduled to decide on the upgrade in a month. The letter indicates the Centre is having doubts about the proposed upgrade, said an official.        
	The teachers, too, are rattled by the Centres stand. We do not know what the ministry had in mind when it sought the report. But we are sure that our academic achievements are not under the scanner, said Manas Heera, the secretary of the Besu teachers association. He blamed the inefficiency of Besu authorities for the recent violence.                                            
	The campus was indefinitely shut down on November 6 and boys were asked to vacate hostels following clashes between two groups of students, led by the CPM-backed Students Federation of India and the Independents Consolidation.        
	Classes for the first and second year students resumed on November 18. The third and fourth year students will have their classes resumed this week.

                      Colours of the season                    The advent of the monsoons in the city brings in its wake a colourful celebration of the moods of the season. Monsoon Hue, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by 15 contemporary artists, features a collection that, besides offering a delightful sensuous feast, inspires and elevates the sensitive imagination. Created in photographic style, the paintings of Apurba Debnath manifest a peculiar narcissism. Ashis Mondals works express his disgust with a political order that thrives on social and economic differences. While Bibhuti Chakraborty explores the relationship between art and civilisation, Chayan Roy explores human sufferings. B.V. Nalekars canvases are inspired by ancient royal architecture while Jiban Biswas draws his inspiration from daily realities. Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty and Pradeep Bhawmick (a painting by him appears here) depict their love for nature and village life, whereas Vaskar Sheel mourns the loss of our natural surroundings. Samarjit Biswas expresses his philosophy of life through his works. The works of Dewasish Das, Pratibha Gadgil and Jayanta Chakraborty portray human emotions. Dipankar Chanda and Ranadip Das highlight the dramatic effect created by the interplay of light and shade through their paintings.

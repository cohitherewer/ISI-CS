                      In search of nirvana                    When the Vedas-based Hindu religion was mired in class distinctions, casteism and various other prejudices, Gautama Buddha led the way to a new socio-religious system that emphasised qualities like equality, kindness, tolerance and sacrifice. Based on the life of the Siddhartha Gautama Buddha as narrated in Dr Herman Hess celebrated novel Siddhartha, Shraman traces his lifes journey as he gives up a life of luxury and becomes a mendicant while travelling in search of the ultimate truth. His burning inquisitiveness about life, an immense urge to understand its real meaning and the desire to seek what lay beyond prompt him to mingle with an old beggar, a beautiful prostitute, a businessman and a gambler. He gathers much knowledge about life and family from them, but it is from an illiterate boatman and his family that he finds what he has been searching for. As the boatman has learnt from the river, so does he learn that life and time are eternal and ever-flowing; nothing is lost in life, everything that we lose is ultimately returned to us. Drama: Nirup Mitra. Direction: Sanjib Ray.                    Event: Play in Bengali, Shraman, produced by Kathakriti When: Today at 3 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

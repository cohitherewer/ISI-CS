The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One More hawker hurdle 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       One More hawker hurdle

	Hawkers owing allegiance to Citu attempted to stop farm produce from being sold in a retail mart owned by the Aditya Birla Group on a day when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tried to resolve policy issues with German retail giant Metro Cash amp; Carry.         
	Over 300 hawkers affiliated to the Citu-backed Footpath Hawkers Committee gathered outside a More store on Dum Dum Road  part of a retail chain that is spreading its wings in Bengal  to prevent fruits and fresh vegetables from being sold there.        
	We will not allow this store to sell vegetables, fruits, meat and fish as that will endanger hundreds of hawkers in the area, said Dilip Majumder of the hawkers committee.        
	Spencers, owned by the RPG Group, had faced a similar protest on the day its Rashbehari Avenue hypermart was to be inaugurated. Reliance Fresh, too, has faced opposition from hawkers in Calcutta.        
	The More store in Dum Dum opened last month but was scheduled to start selling farm produce from Wednesday.        
	Witnesses said hawkers assembled outside the store since morning and tried to prevent a truckload of farm produce from being unloaded around 12.30pm. Some of the protesters allegedly entered the store and attempted to remove fresh vegetables and fruits from the shelves.         
	They threatened us with dire consequences if we continued to sell fresh produce, a store employee said.         
	Sources said sale of farm produce at the 2,500-sq ft store was immediately suspended because of the protest. But Lakshmi Majumder, the secretary of the South Dum Dum 1 unit of Citu, denied the face-off. Our people had gone there only to enquire about the companys retail system and check its price list.         
	Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh said he was unaware of the protest. This (opposition to retail stores) is not our policy, he told Metro.         
	No senior official from More, which launched operations in Bengal in January and has since set up 26 stores, was available for comment.

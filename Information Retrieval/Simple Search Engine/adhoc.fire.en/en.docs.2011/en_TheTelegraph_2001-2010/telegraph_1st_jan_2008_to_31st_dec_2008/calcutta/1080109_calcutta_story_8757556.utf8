The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wife torture, Shibpur to Sunnyvale
                                                                                                            Wife torture, Shibpur to Sunnyvale
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bipul Parua: charged with torture                                  
	A California-based computer professional was arrested at Mumbai airport on Sunday on charges of torturing his wife, a resident of Shibpur.        
	Bipul Parua, 34, from Bhagwanpur in East Midnapore, was about to board a flight for the US when police booked him, acting on an arrest warrant from the chief judicial magistrate of the district.        
	East Midnapore police superintendent Satyashankar Panda said: A man with the passport number (G3312546 dated July 8, 2007) has been arrested. The passport number tallies with that of Bipuls.        
	A police team from the district has reached Mumbai to bring back the accused.        
	The police said Sampa, 30, whom Bipul had divorced in a California court last year, had filed a complaint, alleging that the IIT Kanpur graduate had tortured her for dowry during her stay in Sunnyvale, California from 2003 to 2006.        
	Bipuls elder brother Biplob refused to comment on the matter, late on Tuesday.        
	The two got married on February 21, 2001, and the couple put up at Sampas parental home in Ramkumar Ganguly Lane, Shibpur. Bipul left for the US in April 2001, while Sampa stayed back in Shibpur as her passport and visa were not ready.        
	On August 30, 2002, Sampa met with an accident on her way to her in-laws house in Bhagwanpur and was admitted to a private hospital, where she was in a coma for three months. None of her in-laws bothered to visit her at the hospital, from where she was released in December 2002, said her mother Rekha Mondal.        
	Sampa finally left for the US with Bipul in February 2003. But soon after reaching California, she was subjected to mental and physical torture. Sampa conceived in May 2003 but Bipul forced her to terminate the pregnancy, alleged Rekha.        
	The couple came to Shibpur in October 2006. A few days later, Bipul left for the US alone. He told us he would come again soon and take Sampa along. But we never heard from him. In March 2007, he filed for divorce in a California court and got a verdict in his favour, said Rekha.        
	Sampas family then went to Bhagwanpur police station to lodge a complaint against Bipul, his mother Rita Parua (a schoolteacher) and other members of the family.        
	But the officers there refused to register the complaint and even threatened us. We finally lodged the complaint with Tamluk police station, said Rekha.        
	Bipul was allegedly in Bhagwanpur for the past few days.

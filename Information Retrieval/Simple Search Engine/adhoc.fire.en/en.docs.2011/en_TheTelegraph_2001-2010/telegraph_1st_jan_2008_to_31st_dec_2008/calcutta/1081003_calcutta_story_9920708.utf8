                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bail dance cops go scot-free

	The police commissioner said on Thursday that he was not considering action against the cops who broke into a jig in court after the three officers accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case were granted bail on Wednesday.        
	Commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said no complaint against the cops behaviour had reached the Lalbazar police headquarters yet.        
	Besides, none of the superior officers informed me that any policeman working under him or her skipped duty and went to the court, he added.        
	Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur, however, said: When the officers got bail, we were shocked. The cops jubilation was very frustrating for us. He said the family would move the high court challenging the bail order.         
	The sessions court granted interim bail to deputy commissioner, detective department Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das. The three officers had spent Tuesday night in Presidency jail in Alipore after the CBI court rejected their bail pleas.        
	On Thursday, a 500-strong crowd took part in a rally condemning the behaviour of the cops in court.         
	Led by Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, the rally had, among others, Rukbanur Rahman and local Trinamul MLA Javed Khan walking along parts of Tiljala Road, No. 4 bridge and adjoining areas before gathering at Rizwanur Rahmans Tiljala Road home in the afternoon.        
	In his suicide note, Rizwanur had mentioned Khan as one of those morally responsible for his death. Mamata, however, said I dont think Javed is involved.        
	For the Rahmans, it was a muted Id on Thursday. Their neighbours organised a special prayer session in front of the familys residence.

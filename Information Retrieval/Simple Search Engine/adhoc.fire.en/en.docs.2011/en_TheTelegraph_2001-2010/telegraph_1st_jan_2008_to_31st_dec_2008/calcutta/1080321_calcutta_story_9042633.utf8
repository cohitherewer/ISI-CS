                                                                                                               Undertrial body found in morgue
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a 30-year-old undertrial, who went missing after being granted bail by Alipore court on March 10, was identified in Kantapukur morgue on Tuesday.         
	Shankar Gupta, who worked as a truck drivers help, was arrested by Behala police on March 9 for disorderly conduct under the influence of alcohol. His family members alleged that the police tortured him in custody and suppressed the news of his death.        
	 Guptas family members, who did not go to Alipore court on March 10, lodged a missing diary with Alipore police station after he did not return to his Buroshibtala Main Road home. On Tuesday, an officer of Alipore police station asked us to visit Kantapukur morgue. We went there and identified the body, said Guptas sister Dolly.        
	Officers of Behala police station had refused to register a missing diary from the family on March 11. They abused us and asked us to leave the police station immediately. They even threatened to put the entire family behind bars, added Dolly.         
	The family members then lodged a missing diary with Alipore police station, as the court falls under its jurisdiction. According to officers of the police station, they took a man found lying on the court premises on March 10 to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The body was sent for post-mortem and was lying in Kantapukur morgue since then.         
	We asked Guptas family members to visit the morgue after they showed us his photograph, said Alipore police station officer-in-charge B. Saha.         
	Shankar was the only earning member of our family. He succumbed to police torture. We were not even told that he had died, said Guptas mother Jayanti Devi.

	The spate of campus violence at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) has forced the government to take a close look at the functioning of the oldest engineering institution in the state.         
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury on Monday renewed efforts to push through Besus upgrade and recommended ways to bring peace back to the Shibpur campus.        
	A senior official of the higher education department will leave for Delhi next week to pursue Besus upgrade to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), said the minister.        
	The recent incidents at Besu are unfortunate, particularly when the institute is set to be upgraded to an IIEST, said Ray Chaudhury.         
	He spoke to vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea over the telephone on Monday morning and advised him to take steps necessary to resume academic activities at Besu.        
	Ray Chaudhury also asked Banerjea to be careful in dealing with issues related to students problems and internal administrative matters.         
	The vice-chancellor can take a decision on his own in an emergency and in unusual situations. But given the current situation, the vice-chancellor should discuss his decisions with all levels of the university administration, said Ray Chaudhury. He did not say whether unilateral decision-making by Banerjea had resulted in the trouble.        
	The authorities shut down the institute for an indefinite period last Thursday, following clashes between two groups of students. The police were called in and boys studying in undergraduate courses were asked to leave the campus.        
	The state government is also examining a proposal to formulate a code of conduct for Besu students. The minister has spoken to former Besu head Sparshamani Chatterjee in this regard.         
	A group of Besu teachers met Banerjea on Monday and urged him to bring students back to the hostels and resume classes.        
	Members of Bengal Engineering and Science University Teachers Association (Besuta), however, remained firm in their stand of launching a movement against the authorities decision.        
	Students supporting Independent Consolidation organised a rally on College Street demanding the release of the arrested students.        
	Members of the civil society also organised a rally supporting the students.

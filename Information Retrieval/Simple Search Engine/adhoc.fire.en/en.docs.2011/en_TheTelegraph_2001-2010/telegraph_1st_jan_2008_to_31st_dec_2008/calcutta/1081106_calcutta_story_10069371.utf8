          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An armed gang broke into the house of a photographer, Tapan Das, in Belgachhia early on Wednesday and decamped with Rs 5,000.         
	The robbers also tried to break open the door of the room where Das was sleeping with his wife and son on the first floor. There were five or six men. They tried to break our door with some sharp, metallic object, said Das.         
	The gang fled when Das raised an alarm.         
	Around 5am, they reached the terrace by scaling the wall. Breaking the lock of the terrace door, they entered the ground floor. It seems the gang had accurate information about our household. They broke open two almirahs, ransacked the room and took the cash, Das said.         
	Cops from Ultadanga police station and Lalbazar police headquarters scanned the house. We hope to crack the case soon, said an investigating officer.

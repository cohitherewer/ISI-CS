          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Nakari Chatterjee, the 19-year-old Dankuni youth arrested for allegedly murdering his next-door neighbour and friend Abhijit Dutta, committed suicide at Presidency Jail on Thursday afternoon.         
	Nakari was found hanging from the ceiling of a jail toilet with a gamchha around his neck.        
	Arrested from a relatives house in Burdwan the day after Abhijits murder on May 29, Nakari was in judicial custody for the past two months.        
	The murder was initially thought to have been a crime of passion because Abhijit had been seen with his teenaged girlfriend 15 minutes before he was found with a fatal stab wound in his chest.        
	But investigators later said that Nakaris rivalry with Abhijit, a student of City College on Amherst Street, had nothing to do with the girl.        
	Abhijit and his friends used to abuse Nakari over trivial issues and he was looking to settle scores, a police officer said.        
	The police named Nakari as the murder accused because he went missing from the neighbourhood on the day of the incident.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Vineet Goyal, said Nakaris trial hadnt even begun.         
	During his time in jail, the youth hardly interacted with the other inmates. He actually used to be confined to his cell most of the time, Goyal quoted a jail official as saying.        
	Nakari was found hanging by some inmates at 12.05pm.         
	He was in the toilet beside the verandah. When some inmates found the door bolted and received no answer, they broke it open, Goyal said.        
	He was taken to the jail hospital but doctors said the youth was already dead.

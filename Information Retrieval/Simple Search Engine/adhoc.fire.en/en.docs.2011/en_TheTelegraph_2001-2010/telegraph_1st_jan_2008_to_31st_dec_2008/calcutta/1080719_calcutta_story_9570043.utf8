          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police officers from Calcutta and six districts of the state on Friday attended a workshop on new forms of music piracy and ways to curb them.         
	The Rs 500-crore Indian music industry loses Rs 600-700 crore yearly because of piracy, according to The Indian Music Institute (IMI), a consortium of 142 music companies.         
	We receive many complaints regarding music and movie piracy. Sometimes, the shop-owners claim that their products are legal even when they are not so. This workshop would make our future raids more effective, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal.        
	Piracy using mobile phone memory chips is the newest form. Shop-owners often upload songs, clips and video games on memory chips to draw customers. But hardly anyone knows that the practice violates intellectual property laws of the country, said Savio DSouza, the secretary-general of IMI.        
	Circulation of discs of illegal MP3s is the most common form of piracy and has played an important role in bringing down the size of the Indian music market from Rs 13,000 crore in 1997 to Rs 500 crore now, he added.        
	In the past six months, 103 people were arrested in 72 raids in Bengal.        
	Public prosecutors do not have a clear understanding of the intellectual property laws in the country. Thus the rate of conviction is low. Even if someone is convicted, the verdict is light, said the former Mumbai police commissioner, J.F. Riberio, now an adviser to IMI.         
	The consortium plans to organise similar workshops for public prosecutors as part of its sensitisation initiative.

  - 40-year-old lies unattended on road for three hours          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 40-year-old unconscious man was left to die for three hours on a Howrah road on Sunday morning as one police station shirked its responsibility on grounds of jurisdiction and another sent its men late.        
	The nearest healthcare unit was barely 250 metres away but a team from Bantra police station finally took Dilip Santra to the Howrah district hospital 8km away. That was around 10am, three hours after he had slumped to the ground. The foundry worker was declared dead on arrival, probably of a heart attack.        
	Dilip is survived by his mother Asha, wife Bhanumati, son Amit, 16, and daughter Moumita, 13. Amit is in Class X and Moumita in Class VI.        
	Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh has ordered a probe into the role played by Liluah and Bantra police stations.        
	If any officer is found guilty, action will be taken against him, he said.        
	Additional police superintendent (town) Sukesh Jain visited Belgachhia, where Dilip was found lying unconscious, in the afternoon to trace the course of events leading to the Domjur residents death.         
	Dilip left home for work around 5am and boarded a Belgachhia-bound private bus on route 57A. Witnesses said he got off the bus around 7am and started walking towards the foundry. But after taking a few steps, he started shaking violently and slumped to the ground. He then passed out, an officer quoted a witness as saying.        
	A crowd soon gathered around Dilip but no one took him to the nearby nursing home fearing police harassment.        
	Around 7.45am, the bystanders alerted a traffic constable of Liluah police station. The constable called his duty-officer who allegedly pleaded helplessness, saying the spot where Dilip lay dying was under the jurisdiction of Bantra police.        
	The officer called Bantra thana, from where a team came around 9.30am.        
	Half an hour later  Dilip was probably dead by then  the cops lifted him into a van and took him to hospital.         
	He lay unattended on the road for around three hours. If only someone had stepped forward and taken him to hospital in time, said Dilips cousin Swapan.        
	He also claimed Dilip did not have a history of cardiac problems.        
	In April, Padam Prasad Panth, a 75-year-old Nepali national, died on a road in Howrah as Bantra and Shibpur police stations fought over jurisdiction for more than three hours.

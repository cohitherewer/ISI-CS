          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Forensic experts threw a dummy of the same height and weight as Bimala Khetawat off the 10th floor balcony of Rameswara Apartments to find out how she met with her death on Monday.         
	The body of the 63-year-old wife of a realtor was found near the Out gate of the building on Sarat Bose Road. She had been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing a neighbour couple and was awaiting the verdict of the Supreme Court.        
	Experts conducted the dummy drill to find out if she was pushed off the balcony. They noted the distance between the wall of the apartment block and the spots where the dummy and Bimala landed, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.         
	The experts also dropped the dummy from the balcony without pushing it to examine where someone would land if he jumps on his own. A person jumping off the balcony would land closer to the building than someone who is pushed off, said an officer.        
	The investigators are collecting circumstantial evidence. We are also waiting for the post-mortem report, said deputy commissioner (south division) Rajesh Subarna.        
	The woman who used to look after Bimala and her two domestic help have been questioned several times.         
	We have not found any discrepancy in their statements. We questioned all of them separately and asked them to tell us what they were doing when Bimala supposedly jumped off the balcony. The statements of all three matched, said an officer working on the case.

                      Art and imagination                    Power of imagination is often regarded as the yardstick of creative excellence. Since the days of Abanindranath Tagore, artists in Bengal have been widely known to stretch their imagination to a romantic and sentimental plane. Taking off from a bland, human reality, their works reach a state of expression far from the real and the mundane. Whereas the focus was on myths and legends in the early 20th century, the social scene attracted artists imagination soon afterwards. The tendency to discover myths in real life became prominent with a growing global awareness of human limitations. Stretch of Imagination, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by well-known artists, can be hailed as an authentic record of the way in which artists have used their imagination in this part of the country. The show also features works by some eminent artists from outside Bengal. Participants include Bijon Chowdhury, Chhatrapati Dutta, Fawad Tamkanat (a painting by him appears right), Laxman Aelay, Prokash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Shuvaprasanna, Subrata Gangopadhyay and Thota Vaikuntham.

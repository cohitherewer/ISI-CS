The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Still chicken over buying chicken
                                                                                                               Still chicken over buying chicken
  - Fresh stocks, say suppliers, but most opt to wait amp; watch          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	At 7am on Wednesday, Alok Ray walked up to a chicken seller in the Bansdroni market, asked what the price was, wondered aloud if it was safe to buy chicken yet, and wandered off to buy mutton instead.        
	At 8am on Wednesday, Swapan Bandopadhyay decided to replace all mutton dishes with chicken at his daughters wedding four days later. He called up the caterers at once.        
	One mans meat was another mans chicken the day after the poultry ban was lifted. I would like to buy chicken, but I dont want to risk it. What if it is not fresh stock? said Ray, a resident of Bansdroni.        
	With the ban being lifted, why spend so much more on mutton dishes at the wedding? countered Bandopadhyay, a CESC employee.        
	Many opted to wait and watch, while some made a dash for chicken and eggs on Wednesday. Prices hovered around Rs 40-45 a kg for whole chicken, but not for long, warned sellers.                
	Pappu Singh, the owner of Super Poultry at Entally market, warned of a sharp price rise powered by demand-supply imbalance. There will be a scramble for chicken by the weekend. Dont be surprised if the rate touches Rs 100 a kg due to sluggish supply following the ban, he said.        
	But the West Bengal Poultry Forum on Wednesday allayed fears of an impending price hike and stressed that the stocks being supplied to local markets from Wednesday were fresh. There is no question mark over the stocks, said Madan Mohan Maity, the chairman of National Egg Coordination Committee, West Bengal.        
	Rashbehari Das, a retired bank employee shopping at Lake Market, was not convinced. I am not planning to buy chicken for at least a week. Why take a chance? said Das, with four of nine chicken shops in the market shut.        
	At Gariahat market, seven of the 12 chicken shops opened the morning after the ban was lifted. It was no different at Park Circus, Garia and Kasba.         
	We havent sold a single bird from the morning. We hope the sales pick up soon, said an employee at Arambaghs outlet, on the Gariahat connector.

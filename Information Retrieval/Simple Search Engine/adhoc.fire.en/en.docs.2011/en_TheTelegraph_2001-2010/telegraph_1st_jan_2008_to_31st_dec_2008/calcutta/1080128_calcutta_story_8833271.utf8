	The Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, S.S. Nijjar, visited Park Circus Maidan on Saturday, two days before his bench decides on the fate of Book Fair 2008.        
	The chief justice also went to Don Bosco School and National Medical College and Hospital, which are close to the ground.        
	A source said the chief justice wanted to know whether traffic will be disrupted if the fair is allowed on Park Circus Maidan. The main issue is whether the fair will hold up traffic in an area where there are four schools and two hospitals.        
	The fair is scheduled to continue from January 29 to February 10.        
	The high court will deliver on Monday its verdict on the petitions filed by the Dargah Road Citizens Forum and Voice of People, challenging the legality of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations decision to allow the fair on Park Circus Maidan. The hearing on both petitions was completed on January 25.

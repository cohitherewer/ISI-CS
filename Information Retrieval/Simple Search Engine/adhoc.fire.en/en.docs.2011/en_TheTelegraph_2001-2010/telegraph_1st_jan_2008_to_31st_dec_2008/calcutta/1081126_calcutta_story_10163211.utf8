The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Todi must surrender to get bail 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Todi must surrender to get bail 
          OUR BUREAU                           Ashok Todi                                  
	The Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted Ashok Todi to appear before a Calcutta metropolitan magistrate (CMM)s court on December 1 to pray for bail in connection with the Rizwanur Rehman case.        
	Legally, though, Ashok Todi will have to surrender to apply for bail as merely appearing before the court wouldnt be enough, said legal experts in the Supreme Court.        
	Todi had moved the apex court seeking a stay on the execution of arrest warrant issued by the CMM court against him, brother Pradip and relative Anil Saraogi.        
	The bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan turned down a plea by Todis counsel Harish Salve that the magistrates court be asked to grant bail to his client the same day. Why bypass procedures that are applicable to all? the bench remarked.        
	The bench, however, ruled that the magistrates court would hear the bail plea the day it was moved.        
	The apex court also directed the CBI not to execute a non-bailable arrest warrant issued by the magistrates court against Todi till December 1.        
	On October 31, the CMM court had issued arrest warrants against the Todis and Saraogi after the trio failed to turn up in court in response to summons.        
	The Todis have been charged with abetting Rizwanurs suicide, criminal intimidation and conspiracy.        
	The computer graphics teacher, whose body was found beside the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21 last year, had married industrialist Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against the wishes of her family.        
	Pradip Todi and Saraogi, too, had moved the apex court seeking a stay on their arrest. The pleas will be heard on November 28. The Todis have challenged the arrest warrants on the ground that the apex court had stayed the trial.

	Normal and special children of Akshar staged a cultural programme at Kala Mandir on July 7. The occasion was the 10th anniversary of their school, the first inclusive institution in Eastern India.        
	The evening started with a medley of songs  like Kholo Kholo Darwaze from Taare Zameen Par and Rabindranath Tagores Pagla Hawa and Ekla Cholo Re  followed by a twenty-minute mime show that brought out the essence of Akshar. It traced the predicament of an intelligent but physically-challenged boy called Raj whose parents did not know which school to put him in. Finally he found happiness within the walls of Akshar.         
	The performance of Vishesh Pachisia (who played Raj) and Manasi Manik (who played the principal) were sensitive and much appreciated. But the highlight of the event was a Hindi rendition of Tagores Tasher Desh. Translated by Jalod Bhaduri and choreographed by Kathak danseuse Keya Chanda, the dance drama saw 63 participants mesmerising the audience with their acting skills and colourful costumes. Twenty-one among them were special kids.        
	My son Parijat Banerjee, is effected with a congenital disease, mylomeningocoele, which has left his lower body paralysed. Initially I did not know where to put my son. Akshar proved to be a boon for him, said Luna Banerjee, who also teaches there.         
	Manasi, a student of Class VII and physically-challenged too, was all smiles after her performance. My teachers and other students are very co-operative. They boost our confidence a lot, she gushed. Besides the cultural do, the ICSE topper of the school, Madhu Kamak, was also awarded. Other award-winners included Pragyavi Singhee, also a special child, who was adjudged The Lady of Quality.        
	We had parents of special children approaching us. That is when we came up with this concept of an integrated school. Today it is heartening to see children affected with autistism, Downs Syndrome and other disabilities studying together with normal children, said Nina Singh, executive director of the school.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IT no more the first choice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IT no more the first choice
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                            
	Information technology has lost its sheen and core engineering subjects such as electronics amp; communication, mechanical, civil and computer science are again among the most sought-after ones.        
	The counselling session of over 22,000 students who had cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) this year has confirmed the trend reversal.        
	We have noticed a surge in demand for core engineering subjects. Information technology (IT) was among the most sought-after streams over the past few years. But this year, students who opted for IT mostly did so after failing to secure a berth in any of the core subjects, said Siddhartha Dutta, the JEE board chairman.        
	According to Dutta, who is also pro vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, this years top draws were electronics amp; communication and computer science.         
	Computer science exposes students to hardware, high-end computing and also software programming, while the primary focus of IT courses is on software development.         
	Students have also showed an increased interest in traditional favourites like mechanical, civil and chemical engineering, said officials who attended the counselling sessions in Science City.        
	The waning of interest in IT was apparent last year. This years response only reinforces our perception, said Manas Sanyal, a senior teacher and placement officer of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu).        
	At the Shibpur institute, the last student to opt for IT in 2007 had ranked somewhere near 1,200 on the JEE merit list. This year, the corresponding rank was below 1,400.        
	Similar is the trend in most private engineering colleges. At BP Poddar Institute of Engineering and Technology, a private college on the northern city fringes, the last student who took admission in IT in 2007 had ranked around 6,000. This year, the corresponding rank was below 8,000.        
	I could have got IT but have opted for electrical engineering. If the situation in the IT industry worsens, it will be difficult for an IT engineer to switch to another sector. But an electrical engineer will have more options, said a Jadavpur University student.        
	The other factor responsible for waning of interest include the recession-like situation in the US, shrinking employment opportunities in the domestic IT industry, news pink slips, little or no increment in big ticket IT companies and limited opportunities to go abroad on projects.        
	The growth in the IT sector is tapering off and recruitment norms are becoming stringent. This is telling on the market. Students are no longer assured of good jobs, said Sanjay Mukherjee of People Power, a city-based HR firm.        
	The boom in other sectors like infrastructure and manufacturing have opened a lot of attractive avenues for mechanical, civil and electronics engineers. So, students are looking for careers beyond IT, he added.        
	Besides, Mukherjee pointed out, there is no dearth of job offers in core sectors from south-east Asia and Australia.        
	The IT industry, however, is not alarmed at the changing trend.        
	This is a short-term phenomenon Students will return with renewed interest as soon as they see growth possibilities in the industry, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.

	A hotline between 29 nationalised banks and the Lalbazar police headquarters was launched on Tuesday.
    
	The hotline, which will allow bank officials to alert the Lalbazar control room at the touch of a button, will help to curb robberies and other crimes, said deputy commissioner Jawed Shamim.
    
	The system started operating today. We conducted a mock trial which was successful, he said.
    
	The deputy commissioner said: After receiving the emergency signal from the bank, the officers at the headquarters will alert the police station nearest to the bank and inform the radio flying squads. Our officers will reach the spot within a few minutes and take charge, he added.
    
	A police officer said the decision to connect banks with Lalbazar was taken last year, after a meeting with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials. Experts were working on the software required to set up the hotline.
    
	The RBI had set up a committee to supervise the security arrangement in banks across the city. The panel had approached us last year for the arrangement and we agreed to it, a police officer said.
    
	Initially, 26 nationalised bank branches across Calcutta will be connected to Lalbazar on an experimental basis. Later, the rest of the banks will be added.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Late start to Besu inquiry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The one-man commission set up to probe unrest on the campus of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) in March started proceedings last week, almost six months after the inquiry was ordered.        
	The investigation was to start on April 8 and the report submitted to the government by the first week of July. But Sparshmani Chatterjee, the former Besu vice-chancellor entrusted with the probe, took ill before he could start work.        
	The notification inviting suggestions on how to avoid campus unrest could not be issued till Chatterjee fully recovered from illness. That was done on September 8 and the last date for submission of suggestions was September 29, said a government official.         
	The commission has since begun examining the submissions by Besu students, teachers, officers, students union representatives, non-academic staff, alumni and others.        
	Nearly 100 people, mostly students beaten up during the clashes in March, have agreed to depose before the panel. They will be interviewed shortly. The report should be ready by December, the official said.         
	According to Besu registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay, the commission was trying to make up for lost time.         
	Besu officials said the beginning of the probe was delayed mainly because Chatterjee had to be hospitalised for more than a month and was unable to start the work until he recovered fully. It seems the report will not be ready before January, said a Besu teacher.        
	The government had postponed the deadline for submission of the report to October 8 after Chatterjee was hospitalised.

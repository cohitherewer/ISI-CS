           Death by water: The bus being pulled out of Bagjola Canal                             
	The ruling by Alipore Court that working women will have to pay maintenance to their ill and unemployed husbands is significant (Ailing husbands can get alimony, April 7).           
	Some women try to snap ties with their husbands over minor issues knowing that they will not have to pay alimony after separation. The legal system generally treats women leniently. A section of women misuses this freedom to create trouble and unpleasant situations in their family.           
	The ruling of Alipore Court can go a long way in stopping this kind of practices. Such verdicts are commonplace abroad.           
	Men are human too. Why should they have to suffer because of societys bias. Women must pay as much alimony to their estranged husbands as a man would to his estranged wife.           
	Women who resort to domestic violence or mental torture should also be punished as hard as a man would be for a similar crime. Men should not be made to suffer in silence.           
	Diptimoy Ghosh,
  Salt Lake                       
	Bus drivers are ignoring road rules with increasing regularity (Delay conspires with disaster, April 5). The government cannot wash its hands off the matter merely by paying compensation to the kin of those who lost their lives after a bus fell into Lower Bagjola Canal.             
	It is astonishing that even if the licences of errant drivers are seized, they manage to get hold of duplicate licences with the help of touts in the RTOs (Easy street of deadly wheels, April 7). Police might need some time to send a list of seized licences to the RTOs. But why isnt it possible to trace the drivers and seize their duplicate licences again? Setting up a network between the RTOs and the police is another easy solution.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

	Apropos the report Tragedy on 217B, April 5, time and time again reckless disregard for road rules has resulted in tragedy on the city roads. The latest mishap seems the most gruesome. But such accidents will be repeated if the guilty are not punished.           
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia           
	There is virtually no concept of lane driving in Calcutta. We can notice buses in every lane even on a six-lane road and buses changing lanes from left to right to left. Calcutta is also perhaps the only city where one can find traffic policemen at every crossing and hundreds of sergeants moving around. They are witnesses to this reckless driving but dont take the culprits to book. The state government is primarily responsible for the state of affairs.           
	Raj Bagri, 
  Ho Chi Minh Sarani                   
	Apropos the report Sergeants siren saves man, April 3, kudos to Soumik Sengupta and his colleagues for coming to the aid of a septuagenarian who had a heart attack in a bus. Police officers often take great pains to do the right thing but their efforts are not recognised.             
	Pranabananda Sen, 
  Ho Chi Minh Sarani    
	We often sing paeans to the growing economic clout of India but there are few countries in the world where a 75-year-old suffering from acute respiratory distress would be left untreated and without oxygen support for nearly two hours (Breathless denied oxygen, April 2). The callousness of the staff of National Medical College and Hospital must be condemned and punitive steps taken.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park           
	Total neglect of patients has become the norm in state-run hospitals. It is the grim truth that the elderly patients life was saved because his relatives got him discharged and rushed him to a private hospital.           
	Govinda Bakshi, 
  Budge Budge                   
	Kudos for exposing the appaling conditions in Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (A hub of healing is ailing, March 20). The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pointed out glaring violations in the functioning of the institute, which enjoys both central and state government funding.             
	While funds are no constraint at the institute, utilisation is the major cause for concern. Will the government that swears by peoples welfare wake up and act?           
	Ranesh Chandra Dey,
  Dum Dum Park                   
	Apropos the report Aftermath, March 24, it is horrifying that trees were uprooted in a storm in the Maidan area. Roadside trees in the city pose a threat to pedestrians. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should cut down trees that endanger the pedestrians and plant saplings in their place.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia    
	Apropos the report Puff ban greets Buddha, March 18, smoking in Writers Buildings and various other government offices should have been prohibited much earlier. In case of a fire at the state secretariat, invaluable documents are going to be destroyed. It is amazing that ministers and officials were not paying heed to the smoking ban despite repeated warnings of the fire minister. By flouting the rule, the chief minister and his colleagues are undermining their own authority.

	Two traders from Calcutta and Howrah and a youth from the suburbs died of vector-borne diseases on Friday, taking the toll to 33.         
	Kishore Roy, a 50-year-old resident of Sovabazar, died of malignant malaria at Marwari Relief Society Hospital in the morning.        
	Roy had gone to Bihar a week back. He returned with high fever. A blood test at the local malaria clinic revealed that he was suffering from malignant malaria, said his friend and neighbour Alokendu Saha.        
	Roy, who ran a hosiery-manufacturing unit in his home on Nandaram Sen Street  in ward eight of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  went to a local physician. After taking the prescribed medicines, the trader underwent a second blood test in a private diagnostic clinic and found that he still had malignant malaria.         
	His condition deteriorated on Thursday. He was admitted to the hospital at 2.30am on Friday with high temperature and severe headache. Roy died around 10.40am.        
	The CMC authorities claimed that Roy had contracted the disease in Bihar. His relatives said he was there for only a couple of days.        
	Many of Roys neighbours are suffering from vector-borne diseases but the civic body has allegedly not taken steps to control the situation. Civic employees have not sprayed mosquito repellents in our area since the outbreak of malaria and dengue. There has been no awareness campaign either, said Somsubhra Chowdhury, a resident of the area.         
	Lakshmikanta Hajra, a 40-year-old resident of Hut Lane in Howrah, also died of malaria on Friday morning.        
	The trader was running a temperature since October 22. He was admitted to a local nursing home on November 3 after a blood test confirmed malaria. He died around 8.30am.        
	We requested the Howrah Municipal Corporation to remove the garbage dumped in our locality to stop the spread of diseases but the officials did not pay heed, said Jaya, Hajras wife. Four other residents of the area are also suffering from malaria.        
	A 27-year-old man from Kultali, South 24-Parganas, died of dengue at Medical College and Hospital on Friday morning. The hospital and the CMC authorities refused to provide information about him.        
	People should get admitted to hospital if they have high fever, said a health official of the civic body.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am lucky   to be alive

	Arnab Biswas, a civil engineer with Bengal Unitech Universal, was on the bus that turned turtle outside the main gate of Nicco Park on Monday evening. He fractured his left hand and left collar bone and suffered minor head and leg injuries. The 32-year-old resident of Bagha Jatin spoke to Metro from the hospital bed...              
	I had lost consciousness just after the bus turned turtle. I regained my senses and realised that I was stuck between two seats. The lights inside the bus had gone off and everyone was screaming.         
	People from outside were barking out instructions. I could hear someone screaming at the top of his voice  Samner dikey asar cheshta korun. Amra kanch bhenge diyechhi. (Try to come forward. We have smashed the windscreen).        
	As I tried to crawl, I felt excruciating pain on the left side. I knew I had suffered some major injuries. But I kept crawling and reached the windscreen. Some people then dragged me out of the bus.        
	Everyone was asking me whether I was alright. But I could barely speak and I slumped to the road.        
	Then, some people put me into a taxi and I was taken to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital. There was absolute pandemonium in the hospital. I was given some first aid and I felt a little stable. Then I, along with some other injured colleagues, was shifted to ILS Clinic.        
	As the doctors and nurses were treating my wounds, I was just thinking what went wrong. It was like any other day for around 30 of us, who boarded the same bus from the same place at the same time, around 6.35pm. Even the driver was the same.        
	The traffic flow was normal and we were crossing Nicco Park. Suddenly, something went horribly wrong and before we could figure out what was happening, the bus overturned on its left side with a huge thud.        
	I was sitting in the fourth row on the left side. As the bus turned turtle, I could realise that two people fell on me and I hit the floor of the bus. When I tried to raise my head, some people trampled on me and I lost consciousness.        
	I think I spent around 10 to 15 minutes inside the bus after it overturned. I had really panicked when I was stuck there. I consider myself lucky to have survived the accident.

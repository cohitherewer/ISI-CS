  - MURDER ACCUSED ENGAGES DUMMY           PRONAB MONDAL                                                  
	The discerning eyes of a police officer on Wednesday prevented a murder accused from escaping trial and punishment by hiring someone else to bear the burden of his alleged crime.        
	Zakir Purkayat thought nothing could go wrong for him when he not only found someone willing to stand in for him in an Alipore courtroom, but also face any sentence that the judge pronounced.         
	Lured by Rs 50,000 and the promise of financial security for his family if he went to jail, Suraj Ali Laskar followed the script perfectly and would have been taken for Zakir, had the police officer not spoiled the show. Zakir had not been attending the hearings since getting bail in 2005, but I was sure that the man who made an appearance on Wednesday was not him, the officer said.         
	The truth was out after barely half an hour of intense interrogation. Suraj confessed to the police that he took the risk of masquerading as the murder accused because he needed the money.        
	Based on information provided by him, Zakir was arrested on Thursday. Suraj was remanded in police custody till June 17. Zakir will be produced before a magistrate on Friday.        
	Zakir is the prime accused in the murder of a man named Uttam Roy. The incident occurred at Canning in 2005. Roys decomposed body, stashed into a jute bag, was found in a water body. Zakir got bail a few days after his arrest and had been on the run.        
	Deputy commissioner of police (south) Rajesh Subarna said Zakir took the trouble of hiring Suraj because a second warrant for his arrest would have been issued had he not attended the hearing on Wednesday. Chief judicial magistrate Arup Singha Roy had summoned all the accused because charges were to be framed against them shortly. Zakir thought police officers had forgotten what he looked like and struck a deal with Laskar.        
	Suraj took every precaution. He stood behind the other 11 accused in the court lock-up, hoping nobody would take a good look at him. Trouble started when the magistrate asked all the accused to raise their hands and show their faces. The moment Laskar came forward, the investigating officer shouted that he had doubts whether this man was the same one he had arrested three years ago, an officer at Canning police station said.

	A young woman changing in her room was buried under a heap of bricks and plaster that crashed through the roof when an old, abandoned building next to her house collapsed on Tuesday.        
	Priyanka Joshi, 22, had just returned home from tuition when the second-storey wall of the adjacent building collapsed on the tiled roof of her room at 12 Baidyanath Mullick Lane around 11.30am. She was pulled out from the debris and taken to Visuddhananda Saraswati Hospital, but declared dead on arrival.        
	Neighbour Santosh Kumar Shukla said the girl suffered fatal neck and head injuries.        
	Priyanka was a graduate and used to contribute to the family income by tutoring students in her locality. Her father Binay Kumar, a priest, said he had complained to the municipal authorities several times about the possibility of the abandoned building crashing in a heap. But they never paid heed, and look what happened, he said.        
	Barring the ground floor, the century-old building has been abandoned for over 40 years. The two families that occupy the ground floor dont know who owns the building.        
	We are trying to find the owner and asked for records of the building from the municipal archives, an officer at Posta police station said.

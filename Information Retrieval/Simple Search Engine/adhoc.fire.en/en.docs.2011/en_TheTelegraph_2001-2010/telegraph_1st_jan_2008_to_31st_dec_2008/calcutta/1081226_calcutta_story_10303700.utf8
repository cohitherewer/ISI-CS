                      Surreal expressions                    T he wings of surrealism not only reveal the ideas and passions of a creative mind, they also mould universal concepts according to the colours of the artists personal experiences. Personal Feelings, the ongoing solo exhibition of paintings by Rajesh Roy, displays such a creative passion. The artist conceives the rectangular area of canvas as the tabula rasa of mind and memory. Rhythmic dabs of crimson red, black and yellow ochre, along with their symbolic associations, produce an abstract interpolation of human emotions. Created with minimalist, simplistic technique, Roys works are dense and surrealistic without attempting to appear intimidating to the casual viewer. A particularly striking example of his art is that of a black semi-circular space blending into a fluid mass that drips down onto a red opaque sphere underneath, with a frozen white gulf connecting (or separating?) the two. Often deliberately ambiguous in meaning and expression, his abstract works are bewildering, even baffling at times. Yet, his sheer artistic power and courage to be different allow his works to leave an impression on the mind.                  Event: An exhibition of art works by Rajesh Roy When: Till December 27; 11.30 am - 7.30 pm Where: Gallery Nakshatra, 2/1 Outram Street, 2nd floor

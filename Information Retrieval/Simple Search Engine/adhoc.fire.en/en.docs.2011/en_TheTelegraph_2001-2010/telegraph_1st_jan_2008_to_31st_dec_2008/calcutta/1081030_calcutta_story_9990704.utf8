The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Canal link plan from Salt Lake to Howrah
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Canal link plan from Salt Lake to Howrah
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                      
	The city civic authorities are contemplating a 10km road along the northern bank of Circular Canal to provide residents of Salt Lake-Ultadanga-VIP Road easy access to Burrabazar and Howrah.        
	The proposed road will connect VIP Road with Strandbank Road via Lockgate, RG Kar Road, Maniktala and Ultadanga.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has asked deputy chief civic engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya to engage Rites, a subsidiary of the railway ministry, to prepare a survey report of the project. The estimated cost will be about Rs 5 crore.        
	Currently, travelling from Salt Lake-Ultadanga-VIP Road and other areas on the citys eastern fringes to Burrabazar and Howrah is an ordeal. The journey could take more than two-and-a-half-hours if traffic is bad. The proposed road could reduce the commute time to 45 minutes.        
	The plan is to build a four-lane road but lack of space at certain points could be a problem, said Bhattacharya.         
	Rites has agreed to construct a tunnel under the railway tracks near Gajnavi bridge, which will establish another road link between the eastern fringes and north Calcutta and Howrah, added Bandyopadhyay.         
	He pointed out that businesses would thrive on the canal bank, which has been lying neglected, once the new road link is built. It will add value to the plots and buildings dotting the bank of the canal.        
	The canal has been cleaned by the irrigation department and is navigable again, particularly during high tide. There is an opportunity to introduce freight service along the canal, improving the link between the east and the north further, said a government official.

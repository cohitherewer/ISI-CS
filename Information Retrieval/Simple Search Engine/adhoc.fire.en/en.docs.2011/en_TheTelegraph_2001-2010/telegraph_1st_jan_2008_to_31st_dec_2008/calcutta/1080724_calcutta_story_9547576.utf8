The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crores wasted on hawker eviction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Crores wasted on hawker eviction
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                                
	The stalls that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation erected for over Rs 8 crore to resettle hawkers evicted in Operation Sunshine are now occupied by outsiders or are being used as storerooms.        
	Metro visited some of the 24 city pockets where over 7,000 hawkers evicted 12 years ago from footpaths in Gariahat, Shyambazar, Hatibagan, Bijon Setu, Ultadanga, Behala and Jadavpur were rehabilitated:        
	 Fancy Bazar on Rashbehari Avenue was sold to a private party by the last civic board, formed by the Trinamul. A shopping centre has come up there.        
	 About 150 hawkers were accommodated in Bengal Music College at Gol Park. Not a single hawker can be seen in the building now.        
	 At Gariahat market, the civic authorities spent Rs 99.77 lakh to construct 235 stalls in the basement for resettlement of the hawkers evicted from the footpaths and boulevard of Gariahat-Gol Park. The resettled hawkers are back on the footpaths and are using the stalls as storeroom.        
	 Over Rs 1 crore was spent on resettling 824 hawkers on Galiff Street. Civic sweepers occupy the stalls that were built.        
	 A five-storey building that came up for the evicted hawkers at Kalighat for Rs 82.10 lakh has been lying vacant for over a decade.        
	 Only at Entally market, 126 stalls have been distributed among hawkers.        
	I have no idea about the hawker rehabilitation scheme since records are not available. I will ask the municipal commissioner to prepare a report on the utilisation of the stalls, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	It was a big wastage of public money. A lot of development work could have been done with the money, he added.        
	Shaktiman Ghosh of Hawker Sangram Committee said: We had reservations about accepting the stalls only on Galiff Street and EM Bypass. Of the 7,000-plus stalls set up, only 126 in Entally market were distributed among hawkers. Most of the other stalls were distributed among party cadres by preparing false lists of displaced hawkers.

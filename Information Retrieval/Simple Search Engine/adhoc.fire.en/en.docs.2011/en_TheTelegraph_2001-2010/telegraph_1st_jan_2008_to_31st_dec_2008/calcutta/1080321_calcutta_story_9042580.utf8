The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 15-yr-old commits suicide
                                                                                                               15-yr-old commits suicide
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Abhirup Maity, 15, committed suicide by hanging himself in his house in Thakurpukur Cooperative Housing Society on Thursday.         
	Abhirups parents were away when he killed himself. A preliminary probe revealed that he had been suffering from depression. He was also apprehensive about his school results, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Abhirup was a student of Class IX of a local school. Father Asish Maity is a doctor and mother Dolly works in a private organisation.        
	Dolly returned home in the afternoon. She raised an alarm when her repeated knocks on the door went unanswered.        
	Immediately after opening the door, we found that Abhirup was hanging from the ceiling fan of the dining room. He was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared dead on arrival, said a resident. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

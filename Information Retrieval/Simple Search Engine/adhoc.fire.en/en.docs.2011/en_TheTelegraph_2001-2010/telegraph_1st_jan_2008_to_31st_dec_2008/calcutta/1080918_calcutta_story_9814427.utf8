The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze clearance at civic door
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blaze clearance at civic door
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          The Nandaram blaze led to change in trade licence norms. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is set to revise the order it had issued in May, making a no-objection from fire services mandatory for renewal of trade licences.        
	The official reason for the rethink is that the fire services department doesnt have the infrastructure to assess the firefighting preparedness of over 3 lakh traders every year.         
	According to civic officials, harassment of traders by the fire brigade and extortion by fire services officers have prompted a rethink.         
	Thousands of applications have piled up at the fire services office. What can we do? There are only two inspectors to deal with this huge number of applications. If they inspect and clear 10 applications a day, it will take 100 years to clear all of them, said a divisional officer of West Bengal Fire Services.        
	Under the new arrangement, civic officials will evaluate firefighting preparedness of business establishments with the help of fire services experts before renewing or issuing trade licences.        
	The CMC authorities are working on a proposal to recruit retired fire experts, said an officer of the civic personnel department.         
	The experts will also inspect establishments round the year, pointing out fire risks and prescribing preventive measures. If the owner does not follow the instructions within a stipulated period, the CMC will brand the establishment fire-prone.        
	The mayor said the fire services clearance was made mandatory for obtaining or renewing trade licences following the 100-hour Nandaram Market fire. Traders had blamed the CMC for allowing business activities in the fire-prone market.        
	We are monitoring the situation and the current policy will be suitably modified. We have no intention of harassing traders, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The CMC earns over Rs 30 crore annually from issuing five lakh-plus trade enlistment certificates, popularly known as trade licences.         
	According to estimates of licence officials, the figure will not cross Rs 10 crore this year since about three lakh establishments will have to produce clearances from the fire brigade.

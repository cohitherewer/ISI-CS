The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mend the gaps after rains set in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mend the gaps after rains set in

	The gaping holes on Rishi Bankim Setu in Howrah were to have been filled before monsoon set in, but the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority began repairs only a few weeks ago and is unlikely to complete the task anytime soon.        
	The one-km bridge connects Howrah Maidan with the railway station and is the main link between north and south Howrah. Traffic on this stretch has increased 10 times in as many years, but neither flank has been repaired even once.        
	Motorists who take this route say it is difficult to accelerate above 20 kmph on Bankim Setu. There are so many potholes on the bridge that a motorist has to keep swaying left and right to avoid falling into one, said Mahesh Sau, a resident of Mullickphatak.         
	At some places where chunks of concrete have come off, one can even see the rail tracks below the bridge. Although the damaged portions are being repaired, it could take workers longer than normal to complete the task because of rain disruptions. That apart, moisture will not allow cement and mastic asphalt to grip the surface.        
	The condition of Bankim Setu has been like this for years. The fact that you can see the rail tracks below the bridge is proof of its condition. I cannot recall any repairs being carried out in the past few years. Now that the rains have started, they have begun repairing the bridge. It is clear that the contractor has paid a good amount of money to the babus, said Kunal Goswami, a resident of Sandhya Bazar who has to cross the bridge daily to reach his BBD Bag office.         
	Officials of the CMDA blamed a shortage of funds for the delayed repairs. Work was long overdue but we could not go ahead with it for want of funds, said a senior engineer of the traffic and transport wing of the development authority.         
	On being asked why repairs had been undertaken just when monsoon had set in, he declined comment.         
	Police said accidents were common on the bridge. In the past few years, flow of traffic on this stretch has increased manifold and it has become imperative to repair it completely. Some portions are in such bad shape that they can crumble any time. Two-wheeler riders slip on the cracks and hurt themselves almost every day, said a sergeant on duty near Howrah railway station.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cops claim press proof

	The sleuths of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have got evidence of the involvement of a section of employees of Saraswati Press in the leak of Joint Entrance question papers.         
	It is clear from our investigation that the papers were leaked from the printing press and some employees of the proof-reading section were involved, said CID special inspector general P. Nirajnayan.        
	The CID officers have got in touch with the authorities of Saraswati Press, a state government unit that prints official documents and question papers of various examinations, for more information about the employees under the scanner.         
	One of the prime suspects is Manas Patra, an employee of the press who is absconding, said a CID officer, adding that a team will visit the Baranagar press.         
	When Metro visited Patras Konnagar residence in Hooghly on Monday, his wife Meena was at home with her four-year-old son.         
	I am shocked to learn about his involvement in a question paper leak racket. He left home after returning from office on Saturday. I dont know where he has gone, said Meena, an employee of Howrah State General Hospital.         
	I have told the detectives that the moment my husband returns home, I will inform them, she added.        
	According to CID officers, Patra fled after he learnt about the arrest of Arun Choudhury, believed to be the kingpin of the racket, and his aide Mihir Dandapat.         
	We have gathered evidence on how Choudhury lured Patra and some of his colleagues into the racket, said a CID officer.         
	Saraswati Press has started an internal inquiry into the question paper leak.         
	We are conducting a thorough probe. We will complete questioning of employees involved in confidential work by Tuesday. The report is expected on Wednesday. We will share the findings with the police, said Subodh Majumdar, the managing director of the press.         
	We are reviewing our existing system to ensure confidentiality, added Majumdar.

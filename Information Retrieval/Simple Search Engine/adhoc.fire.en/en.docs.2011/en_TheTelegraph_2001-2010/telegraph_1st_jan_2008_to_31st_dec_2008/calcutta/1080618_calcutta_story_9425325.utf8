The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dummy drill for death
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dummy drill for death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police probing Bimala Khetawats death after a fall from her 10th-floor balcony are not ruling out the possibility of murder or accident, after having termed it a suicide.        
	The sleuths will use a dummy, of the same height and weight as Bimala, to find out how the 63-year-old met with her end on Monday.         
	The body was found near the Out gate of the 12-storeyed Rameswara Apartments on Sarat Bose Road.         
	The dummy will be thrown off the balcony. Judging by the spot where it lands, we can guess how Bimala fell. The distance between the spot and the wall of the apartment block will be less if one is pushed off the balcony than if she falls on her own, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.         
	Since the post-mortem report is yet to reach us, we are exploring all angles, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	A preliminary probe has revealed that Bimala was alive before hitting the ground. The bones of her legs were smashed, suggesting that the legs had hit the ground first. Besides, the hip joint was broken and the ribs were damaged, said an officer.         
	The police on Tuesday examined Rekha Thakur, who took care of Bimala. She was appointed a couple of weeks ago. When I wanted to go to the toilet through the drawing room, Bimala asked me to use an alternative door and closed the drawing room door. I was in the toilet when Bimala fell, police sources quoted Rekha as saying.         
	The other two help in the flat said they were eating lunch in the kitchen when the mishap occurred. We are matching the statements with circumstantial evidence, which is crucial in cases of death due to a fall, said an officer.         
	Bimala, whose husband Jugal Kishore is a director of South City Projects, which own South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road, was convicted of murdering a couple  Bina and Girish Nawlakha. The sleuths said Bimala suspected her husband was having an affair with Bina.

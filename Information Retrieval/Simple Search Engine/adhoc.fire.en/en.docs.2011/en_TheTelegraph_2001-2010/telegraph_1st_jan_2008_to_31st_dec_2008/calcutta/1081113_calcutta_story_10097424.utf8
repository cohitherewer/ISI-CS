          A STAFF REPORTER                          James Simpson, conservation architect from Edinburgh, makes his presentation on Tuesday. Picture by Biswarup Dutta                                   
	Before the Scotland-Calcutta Connection takes up restoration of the Scottish cemetery in Karaya, James Simpson, renowned conservation architect from Edinburgh, was in town for a recce of the graveyard.        
	Before he made a presentation of his work on Tuesday evening, Sujata Sen, the director (East India) of British Council, said a bid has been submitted to declare Calcutta Unesco City of Literature, and in all probability the proposal will be accepted.        
	Simpson focused on specifics of conservation and stressed that there is no greener building than an existing building and that conservation is environmentally and economically important.        
	But Simpson is no standpatter. Conservation is management of change and any building that is restored has to have a sound economic future. It has to earn its keep. There is no merit in pouring money into a black hole.        
	Research of the history of a building, its documents and a thorough study of its fabrics are of utmost importance. He mentioned the British Standard that is a guide to the principles of conservation of historic buildings. Systematic care and a fresh coat of paint after every five years were recommended.        
	He was all in favour of modernisation of old buildings but in line with Ruskin and William Morris, he said that one should never replace what is missing except in exceptional cases. For old stones and materials can never be replaced. If additions or alterations are to be made, instead of conforming to the style of original structure, he was in favour of a balanced approach and juxtaposition of the existing with contemporary forms. He said he is after all a conservation architect and not merely a conservationist.        
	Responding to a question on whether the terracotta capitals of the Corinthian columns of the General Post Office in Dalhousie Square should be replaced, he said there was scope for departure but only after research and analysis.        
	As to the lack of skilled craftspersons to execute conservation projects, he said a career in crafts should be attractive. When the Scottish cemetery is restored, training will be provided in the use of lime mortar and lime plaster.         
	Asked how middle-class owners of heritage buildings in Edinburgh, listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1995, coped with the problem of taxes, Simpson said till the 1960s the city faced this challenge as those burdened with heritage buildings in Calcutta do today.        
	In Edinburgh, building owners are allowed grants subject to evidence produced. He advocated the carrot and stick approach and stressed that there must be a system of protection of such house owners. The corporate sector in the UK provides hefty support for public conservation projects, but Simpson wondered how that would be possible during economic recession.

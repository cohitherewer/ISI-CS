The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ransack turmoil at Besu
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ransack turmoil at Besu
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) was plunged into turmoil once again after a group of students allegedly vandalised the students union office early on Sunday.        
	The lone computer in the room was damaged, chairs and tables were broken and the unions signboard was yanked off the wall.        
	Independents Consolidation (IC), which runs the BE College Students Union (Becsu), blamed SFI supporters for the vandalism.        
	The SFI, however, denied the charge. Afazuddin Ahmed, a member of the SFIs Besu unit, said: IC students had ransacked the office themselves, following a factional feud.        
	Becsu spokesperson Rajarshi Dutta said: Some third-year students owing allegiance to the SFI had organised a farewell for a few fourth-year students in Wolfenden Hall. Around 3.30am, some students came out of the hostel drunk and ransacked the office.        
	Sources said the guards on the campus were outnumbered by the ransackers. Bapan Sahu, a guard who was on duty on Saturday night, said the students of Wolfenden Hall drank till late at night. Some of them later ransacked the union office... We immediately informed the policemen posted at the first gate.        
	Registrar Biman Bandopadhyay said the police have been asked to probe the incident. We are also in touch with former vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chatterjee, who is probing the March unrest on the campus, said Bandopadhyay.

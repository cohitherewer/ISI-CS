                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Third dengue death in city 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Dengue claimed its third victim in the city this year on Thursday with the death of 23-year-old Rupesh Mishra of Bechu Chatterjee Street in north Calcutta.        
	Rupeshs death certificate records Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever with Septicaemia with multi-organ failure as the cause of death.        
	Rupesh, originally from Jaunpur in Bihar, completed his masters from Purvanchal University (Jaunpur) earlier this year and came to Calcutta in August to join the family business.        
	He had high fever since October 8 and was admitted to Sanjeevani Nursing Home on Saturday, said father Premnath. Blood tests confirmed dengue, said a spokesperson for the nursing home.        
	He was bleeding from the mouth and nose and had been on ventilator since October 21. Later, his kidneys stopped functioning and he was put on bedside dialysis on Tuesday evening, he added.        
	But officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) disputed the cause of death. He hadnt developed rashes which are quite common in dengue. Again unlike in dengue, his fever subsided for for three days while he was being treated at home, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay.        
	The civic body, he added, will ask the state health department to conduct a probe to find out the cause of Rupeshs death.        
	Residents blamed the civic authorities for the mosquito menace in the locality. Dengue is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.        
	In the past two months, we have registered over 180 cases of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. We will organise an awareness campaign on Friday, said Salil Chakraborty, the CPM councillor of ward 38.        
	Another death: Kashi Saha, 43, who was admitted to a nursing home in Moulali, died on Thursday. The nursing home cited malignant malaria as the cause of death but civic officials did not confirm it.

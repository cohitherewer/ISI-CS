The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin protests hold up traffic
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Twin protests hold up traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Blockades by political parties made commuting a nightmare in central, east and south Calcutta on Tuesday.        
	Around 2.30pm, over 200 employees of tanneries in the Topsia-Tangra-Tiljala belt blocked the Park Circus connector for almost two hours to protest a high court order to shut down the units. The protest was led by Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Ahmed Khan and the leader of the Opposition, Partho Chatterjee.         
	Park Circus, Shakespeare Sarani, Park Street, Darga Road and Syed Amir Ali Avenue were the worst affected in the resulting traffic snarls.        
	Earlier in the day, nine illegal tanneries were sealed in Tiljala and South Tangra in a joint raid by police, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, CESC and the pollution control board.         
	Three of the tanneries were large. The others were small units, operating in a clandestine manner. We will conduct more raids on Wednesday along with the city police and other agencies, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade.        
	On Monday, 11 tanneries were shut down in the area.        
	The Pragatisheel Indira Congress caused the other major traffic disruption by blocking 34 key stretches between 12.30pm and 1pm. There were snarls at Esplanade, Mullickbazar, Sealdah and Bhowanipore and on College Street.        
	The programme was organised to protest anti-people policies of the state government though it only served to hold up people for hours.

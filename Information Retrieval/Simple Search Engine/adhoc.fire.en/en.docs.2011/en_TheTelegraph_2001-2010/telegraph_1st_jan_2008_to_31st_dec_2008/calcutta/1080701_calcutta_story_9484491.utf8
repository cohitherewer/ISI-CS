                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coffee House facelift
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The proposed renovation of Indian Coffee House, on Bankim Chatterjee Street, is scheduled to begin by August.        
	This was decided at a meeting between Bengal Shelter, which will execute the project, and Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society Ltd on Monday. The Society is running Indian Coffee House since 1958.        
	The Rs 25-lakh project includes repairs, painting the walls and renovating the staircase, kitchen and toilets.        
	There are also plans to hang a canvas on the wooden wall where paintings by Coffee House frequenters can be displayed, and set up a folding stage beside the counter. We do not want a permanent stage as that will occupy space, said Subhash Ganguly, an accountant of the Society, which wants the work to be complete before the Puja.        
	The staircase will be paved with stones. Texture paints will be used in bright and dull colours to blend the old and the new. We will try to complete the work in a month, said Amitav Biswas, of Prakalpa, the consulting agency of Bengal Shelter.

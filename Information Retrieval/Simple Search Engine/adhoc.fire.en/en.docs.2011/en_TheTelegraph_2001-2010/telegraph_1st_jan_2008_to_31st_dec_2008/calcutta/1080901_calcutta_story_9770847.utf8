          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Guwahati-bound passenger was arrested at the city airport on Sunday afternoon after he smashed a bottle of acid he was not allowed to carry, injuring two employees of an airline.        
	Sailesh Khatri, 45, a Mumbai-based businessman, was scheduled to take an IndiGo flight to Guwahati around 1.30pm but was stopped when a bottle containing 750 ml of glycolic acid was found in his baggage.        
	Khatri became enraged and smashed the bottle on the ground, injuring the employees. They were treated at the airport.

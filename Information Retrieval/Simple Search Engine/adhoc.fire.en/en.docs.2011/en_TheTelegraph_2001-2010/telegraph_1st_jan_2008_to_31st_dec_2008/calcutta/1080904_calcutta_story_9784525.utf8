The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patty peeve at judges party
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Patty peeve at judges party
  - Kathleens faces inquiry after metal gets stuck in throat          RITH BASU                            Rama Acharya at the consumer forums office on Wednesday and (above) the pieces of metal she found in the patty. Pictures by Rith Basu                                       
	When pieces of metal in a Kathleens chicken patty pricked consumer court judge Rama Acharyas throat three days ago, she threw up and the confectioner choked.        
	Acharya, 45, a member judge of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, was at a farewell party for her colleague Arup Das and had taken only the first bite of the patty when she felt the metallic intrusion into her gullet. She vomited and out came two pieces of what looked like twisted staples along with traces of blood.        
	I felt a sharp pain in my throat. I spat out two metal pieces but the one that caused the bleeding may have gone in, Acharya told Metro.        
	The consumer court judge has been advised an ultrasound scan to confirm it.         
	The six judges who had attended the party jointly filed a complaint against Kathleen Confectioners at New Market police station on Wednesday. They also slapped a showcause notice on the company for negligence in providing service.        
	The general manager of Kathleen Confectioners, J.P. Nigam, faced a barrage of questions when he visited the consumer forums office near New Market on Wednesday afternoon.        
	I cannot understand how metal pieces got into the patty. We are very careful about the quality of our food and lay stress on cleanliness and safety. We will conduct an inquiry and get back to the forum by Tuesday, he said later.         
	Products sold at all Kathleens outlets are made in a factory on Free School Street. On Monday, the Kathleens shop on 12/1 Lindsay Street, a stones throw from the consumer forums office, supplied 11 chicken patties and eight chicken tikkas for Dass farewell.        
	That was around 5.15pm. We were conversing and having the snacks when Acharya coughed and vomited. Once we saw the metal pieces, all of us felt uncomfortable and threw away what we were having, said J.N. Ray, the president of the forums second city unit.        
	His colleague L.K. Banerjee, who often buys pastries for his family from the Lindsay Street shop, had remarked moments earlier that the chicken patties did not look fresh and were harder than usual.        
	Summoned to the office, an employee of the Kathleens outlet said he would inform the management about the incident. He promised to get back to us by 10.30am the next day, which he never did. We were forced to lodge an FIR against the company, Ray said.        
	An officer at New Market police station said an investigation was under way.

Fliers stranded: Sixty-eight passengers of a flight to Dimapur, including Nagaland chief minister Neiphu Rio, were stranded at the airport on Thursday because of a technical snag in the aircraft. The flight was scheduled to take off at 2.50pm. The passengers were made to board another aircraft which got delayed as other flights were taking off. The replacement plane could not take off on Thursday due to sunset limitations in Dimapur.

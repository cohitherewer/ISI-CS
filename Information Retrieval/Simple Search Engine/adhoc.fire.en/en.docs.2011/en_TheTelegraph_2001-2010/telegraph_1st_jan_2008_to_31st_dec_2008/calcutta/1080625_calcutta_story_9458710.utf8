          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mob demonstrating against power cuts pelted stones at a team from Bowbazar police station on Tuesday morning, injuring sub-inspector Saroj Kumar Ghosh.        
	The officer, injured in the chest, has been admitted to Medical College and Hospital. Five men have been arrested.        
	The police said around 50 residents blocked the crossing of Bowbazar Street and Phears Lane around noon. The blockade was lifted after 15 minutes following an intervention by senior officers.        
	Around 2.15pm, a 150-strong mob gathered at the crossing and stopped traffic to protest power cuts.        
	When cops tried to disperse the mob, the protesters started throwing stones at them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runway flaws revealed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Runway flaws revealed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An inspection of Calcutta airports runways by the airlines operators committee on Wednesday revealed several safety hazards. The main runway is uneven in several places and there is a lot of rubber deposits, said a member of the inspection team. The operators committee will submit a report to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) on Friday.        
	The team also found that grass along the runways was not being cut properly. The green cover provides shelter to animals like jackals and dogs, an airline official said.        
	Flight operations at Calcutta airport are often disrupted as jackals enter the runway.         
	The team was also concerned about the rubber deposit on the main runway, which may cause aircraft to skid while landing.        
	Also, an uneven surface can damage the landing gear and may result in a rough landing, a pilot pointed out.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Richer variety at zoo 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city zoo has a richer representation of the animal planet  11 pairs of birds and animals has just arrived from Orissas Nadankanan Zoological Park.        
	Sundays consignment is the largest ever we have received, said Subir K. Chowdhury, the director of Alipore zoo. In exchange, Nandankanan got a male giraffe.        
	The new residents are
  Two pairs of langur
  A pair of black buck
  A pair of gharial
  A pair of python
  Two pairs of white ibis birds
  A pair of white peafowl
  Two pairs of open billed stork 
  A pair of hamadryas baboons         
	A pair of hippopotamuses will arrive after the authorities construct an appropriate enclosure for them.        
	Calcuttans can see white peafowls, hamadryas baboons and open billed storks for the first time from Monday. We expect visitors will appreciate these three special species and the other new ones, he said.        
	The animals started by road from the Bhubaneswar zoo on Saturday evening and reached Alipore zoo at 7pm.        
	Sundor, the giraffe who has been exchanged for the new inmates, was born to Sagar and Uttara at the Alipore zoo in 1997. He will leave for his new home in a week.         
	Calcutta could manage to get so many birds and animals in return of Sundor as the Nandankanan zoo badly needed a male giraffe.        
	After Sundor leaves, Alipore will still have three pairs of giraffes. Animals are normally exchanged in pairs but we will upset the balance if a female accompanies Sundor. So the Nandankanan authorities have decided to make do with only one for the time being, said Chowdhury.

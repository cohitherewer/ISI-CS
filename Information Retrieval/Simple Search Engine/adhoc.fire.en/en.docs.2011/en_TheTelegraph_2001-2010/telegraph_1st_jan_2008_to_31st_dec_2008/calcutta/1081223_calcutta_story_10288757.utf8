          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 16-year-old girl abducted from near her Kalighat home on Sunday night was rescued from a Thakurpukur house on Monday afternoon.        
	The girl told police that Pintu Das, a Kalighat youth with criminal antecedents, had abducted and forcibly married her.        
	Das and his accomplices are absconding. The Sarsuna Main Road house in which the girl was kept belongs to Dass friend Prasanta Saha. The police are investigating whether Saha was involved in the kidnapping.        
	We registered a case of abduction on the basis of a complaint filed by the girls mother. The victim told us that she did not know Pintu. We are trying to verify her statement, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south division).        
	The complaint stated that the girl and her mother were walking along DL Khan Road, near their house, when a Maruti van stopped before them and three youths came out. They grabbed the teenager by her hands and dragged her into the vehicle.        
	The chief of the city polices detective department, Jawed Shamim, said Das had been arrested several times on the charge of rioting and extorting money from traders in Bhowanipore, Tollygunge, Rabindra Sarobar and other parts of south Calcutta.        
	An officer of Kalighat police station said sources confirmed that Das had abducted the girl.        
	Since Das had been arrested several times in the recent past, we could find out about his hideouts from our sources, added the officer.        
	A team raided Sahas house in Thakurpukur and rescued the teenager, on the basis of a tip-off.

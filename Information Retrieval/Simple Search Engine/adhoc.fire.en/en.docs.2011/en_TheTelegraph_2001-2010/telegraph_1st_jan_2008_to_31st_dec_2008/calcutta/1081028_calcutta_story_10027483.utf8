The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drenched and downcast, city shoppers give Dhanteras midnight tryst a miss
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Drenched and downcast, city shoppers give Dhanteras midnight tryst a miss
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          damp squib: A jewellery store tries in vain to woo Dhanteras customers by displaying the best time for making a purchase. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	While fears of a recession have dimmed the Diwali sparkle this year, on Dhanteras, the rain played a bigger spoilsport in the city. Metro checked out popular jewellery stores on Sunday night only to find scattered buyers and shops preparing to down shutters early.              
	First stop: City Centre        
	Time: 10.30pm        
	What we saw: At Jalans Glint and Glitters, a few families were checking out the jewellery and silverware collection, but the crowd at the mall  which houses jewellery brands like Saakshi and Diagold  didnt live up to its weekend standards, let alone a festive occasion.         
	What we heard: Rain has been a damper. Only people from north Calcutta came to shop and we lost out on customers from the south. The footfall was about 25 per cent less than what we had expected, but even then it is 5-10 per cent more than last year, said Vivek Jalan of Jalans Glint and Glitters.               
	Second stop: Anjali Jewellers, Sovabazar        
	Time: 11.15pm        
	What we saw: The long queue outside Anjali  a familiar sight on Dhanteras  was missing. There were a few customers, but the day was clearly over.         
	What we heard: Theres always a crowd at this store, even at night. This year, there are hardly any people, mostly because of the rain, said Shibani Dey. Her daughter Tirthaa said: Weve been reading about the economic slump and that too has affected our mood. Earlier, our Dhanteras budget would be around Rs 10,000, but this year we have slashed it by half.         
	We had a rush till 10. I think with the stock market in a tizzy, people feel gold is the only safe investment, so the slump has not affected us, said Anargha Chowdhury of Anjali Jewellers.              
	Third stop: Burrabazar        
	Time: 11.30pm to 12.20am        
	What we saw: Burrabazar wore a ravaged look around midnight. Stalls displayed mounds of colours for rangoli, diyas, candles and other decorative items while shopkeepers sought shelter from the rain under tarpaulin sheets, as did a few buyers.         
	Some jewellery stores had already shut shop for the day while others catered to the few who dropped in.         
	What we heard: We are iron merchants and our business has been affected by the recession. That has naturally dampened our Dhanteras mood, said Poonam Saraf, shopping at Bhatters. Her husband, however, differed, insisting that the family shopping was on in full swing.         
	The economic turmoil has not affected sales so much, but the rains have hampered business, said Shreelal Bhatter of M. Ramdeo amp; Co. (Bhatter).         
	Sanjiv Kejariwal of Gold Silver Arts echoed him. The footfall is about 20 per cent less than past years.               
	Fourth stop: Shakespeare Sarani-Camac Street        
	Time: 12.30am to 1am        
	What we saw: Where were the people who would throng the shops late at night, after performing puja at home? At Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons on Shakespeare Sarani, there were a couple browsing in one corner, and a few scattered buyers. At Fort Knox, the jewellery mall, the shutters of Tanishq were half-way down. B.Motiram, Saakshi, Adora, Zenith and a host of others kept their showrooms open, but the mall was deserted.         
	What we heard: Footfall has gone up by 20-25 per cent, said Bachhraj Bamalwa of Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons.        
	But the big buyers were totally missing, he added.         
	The slump would have hit us also, but the dip in gold prices last week saved us, said Vijay Mahtani, the director of B. Motiram.         
	Siddhartha Sawansukha of Sawansukha Jewellers put up a brave front.        
	If the market hadnt crashed, business would have been better, but even then, our sales were good. But the rain affected the number of customers, especially after 9.30pm, which is usually a very busy time on Dhanteras.        
	From Camac Street, Metro moved to Bowbazar, the gold hub. But the area looked like a ghost town, with deserted streets and closed shops.

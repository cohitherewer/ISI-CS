           Pollution point: A Durga idol immersed in the Hooghly                             
	The state environment departments decision to constitute a cell within the pollution control board and an independent committee to monitor pollution of the Hooghly is welcome (Scan on river pollution, April 19). Everything necessary must be done to check pollution of the Hooghly.           
	The centres refusal to form an independent authority for the protection of the Hooghly is unfortunate. Since the river flows through several states, any scheme to protect it needs to be initiated by the Centre. The efforts of a single state in isolation would be useless .           
	The sources of pollution in the Hooghly need to be clearly identified. Various industrial and municipal authorities should be made to ensure that they do not pollute the river under any circumstances.           
	It is shocking that effluent from the CMDA area causes 75 per cent of the pollution. May be, a part of the expenditure to keep the Hooghly clean should be borne by the industries and the municipalities. Having said that, the Centre cannot abdicate its responsibility.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                       
	Apropos the report Panel against toxic colours, April 23, it is prudent on the part of the state environment department to take up a project to stop use of toxic colours on idols. But the government should not be oblivious to the toxic elements in the colours used by Holi revellers. Those with sensitive skin, especially children, often contract diseases from the colours.             
	For greater benefit of the common people, the environment and the health departments should find out ways to deal with health hazards caused by all kinds colours  be they those used in food or those used on idols. A comprehensive approach is the need of the hour.           
	Nishith Mitra,
  Malancha, Mahinagar           
	While on a visit to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, I learnt from the clay idol makers that they use eco-friendly colours on Ganesh idols so that they do not pollute the water during immersion. A blueprint must be readied in West Bengal to phase out colours with toxic components.           
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                   
	Apropos the picture in The City Diary column on April 21, some of our talented artisans have been making fibre glass Durga idols for Bengalis settled in the US, the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia. These artisans toil as hard as those who make idols for the city pujas but their creations do not receive publicity. May the demand from overseas go up so that the artisans can enjoy a better life.             
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                               
	Apropos the report Sleep and medicine, after 10 days, April 12, the negligence of doctors in government-run hospitals has become a regular feature. I was visiting a government hospital for a month and experienced first hand the indifference of the staff.             
	Even the junior doctors are neither compassionate nor cooperative. Doctors to door-keepers, attendants to ward-boys, everyone is unapproachable. The poor people are caught in a terrible bind: if they go to private hospitals they are fleeced; if they go to state-run hospitals they are neglected.           
	Samita Pal,
  Kalindi                   
	Apropos the report Probe reveals JEE leak last year, April 21, I am most disappointed to find out that the state joint entrance examination has been postponed indefinitely and the reason is that the board doesnt have the infrastructure to send the back-up test paper to the exam centres in less than a day. What is the logic of having back-up papers if the board doesnt have the infrastructure to distribute them at short notice? The students should not have to go through the ordeal of postponed examinations because of the lack of proper planning and coordination by the board.             
	Poulomi Saha Mukerji, 
  Singapore                   
	Are abandoned buses being used for public transport (A life lost and a wish for death, April 11)? Otherwise, why cant the owner of a killer bus be traced immediately after an accident? It is also difficult to understand how the commission system continues to be in place despite everyone identifying it as one of the most important reasons for mishaps. The bus operators benefit by sticking to the commissions system. The spot fines need to be raised to force them to abolish the system.             
	Shiv Shanker Almal,
  Lower Rawdon Street             
	Apropos the report The living victims, April 10, most pool cars are illegal, according to norms laid down by the Supreme Court. Why should not the parents who avail themselves of the illegal service be charged with contempt of court? They patronise a banned activity. It is easy to blame police. If the cops stop illegal pool cars, the parents will scream that they are after money. As long as parents continue to dump their children in unsafe pool cars, the vehicles would continue to face mishaps.

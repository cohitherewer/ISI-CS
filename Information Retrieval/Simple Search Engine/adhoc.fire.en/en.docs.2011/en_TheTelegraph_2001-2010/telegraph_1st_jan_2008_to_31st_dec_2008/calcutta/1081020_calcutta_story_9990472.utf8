                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Robbery on local train
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths with a knife robbed several passengers in the womens compartment of a Sealdah-Baruipur local train on Sunday morning.         
	The youths squatted near a gate of the compartment as the train started moving from Sealdah towards Park Circus. After a few minutes, one of them got up, grabbed a woman and held a knife to her throat, while the other took away cellphones and handbags from eight passengers.        
	The duo completed the operation in minutes and jumped off the train as it slowed near Park Circus station.        
	Khardah residents Puja Roy, 22, and her homemaker mother Nupur, 48, who were in the compartment, said Namita Dey of Naihati was held at knifepoint.        
	Namita suffered a cut while trying to protect herself. My mother was wearing gold ornaments and carrying about Rs 3,500 in her purse, so I decided to divert the criminals attention. I handed over my bag which contained my cellphone and the youth moved on to other passengers, said Puja.        
	Namita, the Roys and another passenger, Srimoyee Bose of Noapara, went to the Government Railway Police (GRP) booth at Ballygunge but were redirected to the GRP outpost in Sealdah.        
	The police were co-operative but took a long time to lodge the complaint, said Nupur Roy.        
	The four had to sit at the Sealdah outpost from 10am to 12.40pm to complete the formalities.        
	B.K. Mallick, the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah, said the robbery appeared to be the work of a new gang.

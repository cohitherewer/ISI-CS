          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Sunil Shaw, the prime accused in the murder of his younger brother Rajesh, surrendered before the Howrah chief metropolitan magistrate on Thursday. He has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.        
	Sunil, 38, has been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (suppressing evidence).        
	He had been absconding since March 29, the day Rajeshs body was found in an underground reservoir of the Shaws godown on Jaibibi Road, in Bally.        
	Rajeshs wife Maya had lodged a complaint alleging that Sunil had engineered the murder of her husband, following a property dispute. Last month, Manoj Puri, an associate of Sunils, was arrested in Uttar Pradesh. He reportedly told the police that the two had killed Rajesh.        
	N.K. Singh, the superintendent of police, said: We will seek police custody for Sunil as we would like to interrogate him further. Certain clues that emerged during Manojs interrogation will be cross-checked with Sunils statements. The cops are yet to recover the murder weapon.

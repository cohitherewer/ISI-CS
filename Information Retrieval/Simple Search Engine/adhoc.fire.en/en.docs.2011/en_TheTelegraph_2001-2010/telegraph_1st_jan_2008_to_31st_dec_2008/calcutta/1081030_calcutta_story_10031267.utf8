The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech town braces for blaze battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tech town braces for blaze battle
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sector V is trying to boost its firefighting infrastructure that was stretched by the blaze at the Videocon plant in April.        
	Infinity Building, which houses 23 offices, is installing a fresh set of tools, including special doors on each floor, emergency exits and fire extinguishers. Fire safety is of utmost importance to us and the companies whose offices are located here. The special doors had become outdated, so we are replacing them, said Piyush Goenka, the vice-president of Infinity Infotech Parks.        
	Companies like Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), which has its own campus, are also making sure that they are prepared for emergencies.        
	The company has firefighting tools like extinguishers and water reservoirs in place. It also organises regular drills for employees to keep them ready for an emergency.        
	We have a leader in each block who can guide others to safety in case of a fire, said an official of CTS.        
	The Videocon fire was an eye-opener. Most of the companies are self-sufficient in terms of fire-fighting measures but we have to take extra care, especially since we work with computers and electrical gadgets, which are highly combustible, said an official of a IT services company.        
	The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative body of the tech hub, is trying to enforce fire-safety norms more stringently in offices but there are doubts about its infrastructure.         
	The township authority has made it clear that no building will be allowed to come up in Sector V without a No-Objection Certificate from the fire department. However, many of the buildings in Sector V were erected before the township authority came into being and had not adopted fire-safety measures, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the body. We are making sure such measures are taken now.        
	Gopal Bhattacharjee, the fire services director-general, echoed him: The buildings that came up in Sector V before the Fire Prevention Act was enforced in 1996 do not have fire-safety measures in place. The companies must take the initiative to protect themselves against fire hazards.        
	The lone fire station in Salt Lake  serving over 300,000 people  is responsible for dousing Sector V fires. It has acquired a bouser that can hold 16 kilolitres of water from CR Avenue fire station.        
	The fire services department is yet to be allotted land for the new fire station in New Town. Everybody is making promises but so far no one has come forward to give us land to build the fire station, said Bhattacharjee.

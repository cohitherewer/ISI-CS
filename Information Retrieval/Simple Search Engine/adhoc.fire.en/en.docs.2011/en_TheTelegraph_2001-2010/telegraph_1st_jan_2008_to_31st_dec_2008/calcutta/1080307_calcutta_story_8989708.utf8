The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jharkhand cell thieves rounded up 
                                                                                                               Jharkhand cell thieves rounded up 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A gang of eight cellphone thieves from Jharkhand, on the prowl across the city for the past week, was rounded up early on Thursday.        
	Fifty-two handsets were seized from them.        
	Among those held was an eight-year-old boy. The police said a few other children who had accompanied the gang from Jharkhands Rajmahal are absconding.        
	The thieves had reached the city eight days ago and put up in rented houses near the cancer hospital in Thakurpukur. Every day, they would divide themselves into small groups and go about stealing cellphones in various parts of the city. They had planned to sell the stolen phones in Jharkhand at a price ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 9,000, said Ajey Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central).        
	The thieves operated in crowded zones like Sealdah, New Market, Janbazar and on Metro Railway trains. A child would usually accompany each group. After a phone was stolen, it would be passed on to the kid, said an officer.        
	We were receiving complaints of cellphone thefts for quite some time now. Following a tip-off, we picked up one of the thieves, Vijay Mahato, from Janbazar on Wednesday night, said an officer of New Market police station.        
	He reportedly admitted to the crime during interrogation and led the police to where the rest of the gang had put up in Thakurpukur.        
	The youths  all in their mid-20s  were skilled hands. They would remove the SIM card immediately after stealing a set. They knew that once they moved out of a telecom circle where the phone had been stolen, it would be difficult to track down the set even with its IMEI number, the officer said.        
	The gang had planned to stay in the city for another week, by which time they would have stolen more than 100 cellphones.

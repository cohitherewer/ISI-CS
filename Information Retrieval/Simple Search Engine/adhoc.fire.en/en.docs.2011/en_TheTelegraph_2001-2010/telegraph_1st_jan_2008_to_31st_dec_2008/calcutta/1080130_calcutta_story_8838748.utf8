     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Flight operations at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport were disrupted for the second consecutive day on Tuesday because of fog.
    
	There was light fog for about half an hour from 6am, but there were no major disruptions, an airport official said. Some flights were delayed briefly but that was because the airlines opted for the delay, he added.
    
	Spokespersons for various airlines said around 10 flights  bound for Port Blair, Delhi, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Jamshedpur and Mumbai  were delayed by 15 to 45 minutes.
    
	There were no complaints from the passengers.
    
	International flights were not disrupted, an airport official said.
    
	The schedules went haywire on Monday morning, with 24 flights being stranded for three hours on an average. An IndiGo flight had to circle over the airport for half an hour before it could land.
    
	Visibility dropped below 350 metres, rendering the CAT II Instrumental Landing System ineffective. At times, visibility was as low as 50 metres.
    
	The condition was better on Tuesday morning and the situation is likely to improve further on Wednesday, with Met officials ruling out chances of dense fog.
    
	We expect slight mist on Wednesday morning, but there is no indication of dense fog, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.
    
	An Airports Authority of India official said the CAT II system, installed last year, is capable of guiding aircraft to land or take off in light fog.
    
	There will be no disruption in the flight schedules so long the runway visibility does not drop below 350 metres, said an official.

                      Southern imagination        In post-colonial India, the image of a cultures self or consciousness and the art activity that leads to it, has contributed to the emergence of new inter-cultural relationships with diversity in visual language. From the Sixties and Seventies of the last century, there was an emphasis on the development of indigenous styles of art, particularly in south India. The Madras Art Movement also encouraged the blossoming of a school of art that appealed to tradition. The decades of the Eighties and Nineties enabled southern artists to move away from any hegemonic agenda and create art forms that would strongly underscore their individual ideologies in form and content. By this time, the focus of art had shifted from the search of aesthetic universals to the search for images that will convey cultural identity, simultaneously reflecting and guiding its shifts. From Beyond the Vindhyas, the ongoing group exhibition, features the works of a constellation of artists from south India, whose works can broadly be classified to fall within categories like conceptual, non-representational, everyday genre and iconic and folk. Participating artists include KM Adimoolam, Laxman Aelay, KS Chari, SG Vasudev (a painting by him appears here), S Gopinath, K Muralidharan, S Nandgopal, RM Palaniappan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic balm on plot tax
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic balm on plot tax
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	Property tax on vacant city plots up to five cottahs is set to be reduced from seven per cent to 2.5 per cent of the annual valuation.        
	For bigger plots, however, the tax will remain at seven per cent.        
	Till May 2006, property tax on all vacant plots was 2.5 per cent of the annual valuation.        
	To bring about the change, the government will table an amendment to the CMC Act, 1980, in Assembly on July 17.        
	The state municipal affairs department estimates that over 1.5 lakh plot owners in east Calcutta and in the added areas comprising Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach will benefit from the reduction in property tax.        
	At the same time, the amendment will boost the revenue collection of the civic body as plot owners who have not yet mutated their properties will feel encouraged to do so. The steep property tax is a deterrent to getting plots mutated on time, said a civic official.        
	The government is also eyeing a third benefit: reducing the number of cases pending with the Municipal Assessment Tribunal. At least 72,000 cases of dispute over property tax on vacant plots are pending with the tribunal.        
	The number of mutation of newly-purchased vacant plots in the city has started dwindling since June 2006, when the civic authorities, in accordance with the CMC Act, 1980, hiked the property tax from 2.5 per cent to seven per cent of annual valuation.        
	Before that, since 1997, the civic assessment department used to charge property tax on vacant plots at 2.5 per cent of the annual valuation.        
	A civic assessment department official pointed out that in Calcutta, the property tax on a vacant plot is more than what is charged on buildings.        
	This is so because the annual valuation of a structure is calculated on the basis of its notional rent  the amount the owner could earn by letting out the building.        
	A building on a three-cottah plot, with a covered area of 1,500 sq ft, could earn, say, Rs 60,000 annually.         
	The property tax will be seven per cent of that amount, which is Rs 4,200.        
	But if the three-cottah plot lies vacant, the annual valuation will be calculated on the basis of the price per cottah as fixed by the registrar.        
	If the price is fixed at Rs 50,000 per cottah, the annual property tax will be as high as Rs 10,500.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Roadblock after raids

	More than 100 autorickshaw drivers flexed their muscle against the administration the day the high court ordered a crackdown on unauthorised three-wheelers.        
	A drive against rogue autos by the police and the public vehicles department on Friday afternoon led to a mob of drivers blocking Prince Anwar Shah Road and throwing stones at a depot where some seized vehicles were kept.         
	Two auto stands on Prince Anwar Shah Road  at the crossing with DP Sashmal Road and the Lake Gardens intersection  were raided. Thirteen three-wheelers were seized as the drivers could not produce permits. The vehicles were towed to the Lake depot.         
	Around 150 auto drivers, loyal to the CPMs labour arm Citu, swung into action immediately after the drive and lined up more than a dozen three-wheelers at the busy Prince Anwar Shah Road-DP Sashmal Road crossing from 1.55pm to 3.30pm.        
	Two smaller roadblocks were soon put up at the Lake Gardens crossing and in front of the Lake depot. Traffic was reduced to a crawl on Anwar Shah Road and DP Sashmal Road (from Tollygunj tram depot to the Rashbehari Avenue crossing) as well as on smaller roads leading to Golf Green and Lake Gardens.         
	A few protesters pelted the Lake depot with stones, smashing the windshields of some buses parked inside. The situation was brought under control after a large police team comprising men from Lake and Charu Market police stations reached the spot.        
	The officials harassed the auto drivers, resulting in tension and the roadblocks, said Gautam Banerjee, a member of the CPM Calcutta district committee who took part in the protest.        
	The drivers were treated like animals. They were grabbed by their collar and dragged away, said Citu leader Dipankar Mukherjee.        
	The police said the raid was part of an ongoing drive against illegal auto drivers. In the past 10 days, more than 160 autos have been booked by the police and the public vehicles department, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

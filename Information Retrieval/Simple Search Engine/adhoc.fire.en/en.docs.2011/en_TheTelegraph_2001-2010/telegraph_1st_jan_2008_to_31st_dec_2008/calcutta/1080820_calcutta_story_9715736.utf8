                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JU seniors guilty of ragging 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The anti-ragging committee of Jadavpur University has found five students were directly involved in ragging a first-year girl student of the architecture department last month. The panel has also found at least 20 other students indirectly involved in ragging the fresher.        
	The committee submitted its report to vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh on Tuesday.        
	Appropriate action will be taken against those who have been found guilty, said a senior JU official. The report is likely to be placed before the universitys executive council next week, sources said.         
	The parents of the victim had lodged a complaint with the JU authorities on July 17 that a group of senior boys and girls had forced their daughter to smoke marijuana, drink alcohol and chew cigarettes. Before being physically abused, she had also faced severe mental torture, the complaint said.        
	The panel found that the girl was ragged verbally and physically for three days. The five students directly involved in the incident are third and fifth year students of the architecture department.         
	The panel has, however, dismissed the allegation that the student was forced to drink alcohol and marijuana, sources said.        
	She was asked to chew cigarettes and then swallow it. The girl fell sick after swallowing the cigarettes, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car plunges into canal near VIP fatal spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Car plunges into canal near VIP fatal spot
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Two men had a close shave when the Tata Sumo they were travelling in plunged into Lower Bagjola Canal from VIP Road, near Kestopur, early on Sunday. The duo, including the driver, jumped off the car at the last moment.        
	The spot is close to the place from where a bus on route 217B had fallen into the canal on April 4, killing 21 people.        
	Sujoy Das, the driver, was arrested on Sunday afternoon. The other man was the owner of the Sumo whom police did not identify.        
	It seems Das was drunk. He said he had lost control after the steering stopped functioning. The car will be sent for test to verify his claim, said an investigating officer.        
	The Sumo was returning to Rajarhat from Digha when the mishap occurred.        
	We were standing on the opposite bank of the canal around 1am when we heard a screech. We turned around immediately and saw two men jump off the car as it plunged into the canal, said Bapi Ghosh, a witness.        
	Soon after, a few local residents rushed to the spot and started a rescue operation. We called Baguiati police station and requested the officer on duty to send a breakdown van, said Chandu Rajbangshi, who was among those who rescued the passengers of the 217B bus.        
	We rushed the 15-tonne breakdown van that was deployed this month to the spot. The car was pulled out in 10 minutes, said the officer-in-charge of Baguiati police station, Paresh Roy. But the men in the car could not be found. It was only on Sunday afternoon that the driver could be traced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2 deaths in road mishaps
                                                                                                               2 deaths in road mishaps
  - Pedestrians knocked down across the city by cars and bus          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A youth and a middle-aged woman were killed and a man was injured in road mishaps across the city on Wednesday.         
	The first mishap took place around 7am near Boat Club, on the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector. A private car hit 25-year-old Ram Bahadur Rai, a resident of Hathgachhia Road, flinging him a few feet away.        
	Pedestrians noted down the number of the car and informed Parama Investigation Centre. Police chased down the car and arrested the driver.        
	Rai was taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where he passed away before the doctors could treat him.        
	The next mishap occurred around 9.30am, near Writers Buildings, when a private bus plying on route 55 knocked down 52-year-old Supriya Sen on Brabourne Road.        
	The witnesses once again informed the traffic police about the mishap. The bus was intercepted at the crossing of Strand Road and Armenian Street.        
	Sen, a resident of Bally who worked for Eastern Railway, died at Medical College and Hospital.        
	People often try to cross the road outside Writers Buildings when the traffic is moving, resulting in mishaps, said an officer of the headquarters traffic guard.        
	The third mishap took place around 1pm at the intersection of Deshapran Sashmal Road and Tollygunge Road when a taxi knocked down 50-year-old Kalipada Sarkar.         
	The Tollygunge resident was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital with serious injuries in his head and legs.         
	The taxi was later tracked down and the driver arrested.        
	We have been trying hard to bring down the number of mishaps in the city by beefing up policing and extending it to the night. But pedestrians, too, need to abide by traffic rules to bring down the number of mishaps, said a senior traffic officer at Lalbazar.

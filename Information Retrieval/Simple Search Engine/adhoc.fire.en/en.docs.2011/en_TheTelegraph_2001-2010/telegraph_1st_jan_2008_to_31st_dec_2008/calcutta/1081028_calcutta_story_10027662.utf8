                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Unions clash at Writers

	Employees supporting rival unions turned the first-floor Writers Buildings corridor into a battlefield on Monday afternoon, dealing another body blow to the work culture at the state secretariat.        
	Over 100 employees owing allegiance to anti-Left unions assembled outside the office of the finance departments special secretary Swapan Bhattacharya at 1.30pm  when the lunch break starts  to demand that the showcause notices against eight workers be withdrawn and the departmental proceedings against seven others stopped.        
	Around 1.40pm, employees supporting the CPM-backed Co-ordination Committee objected to the rival groups slogan-shouting and allegedly beat up some protesters.        
	Deputy commissioner (central) Damayanti Sen, special additional commissioner (traffic) Ranvir Kumar and other senior officers had to rush to the seat of power to bring the situation under control.        
	Four of the agitating employees sustained minor injuries in the clash with the Co-ordination Committee members, said a police officer.        
	Mondays incident was a sequel to the trouble that started at Writers in September after 15 workers were hauled up for allegedly heckling an official.        
	Employees supporting the anti-Left unions have been staging demonstrations during the lunch break against the disciplinary action.        
	On September 12, around 500 employees assembled during the break and shouted slogans for an hour in defiance of a circular issued by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.        
	Describing Mondays violence as undesirable and unfortunate, Deb said the police report on it would determine whether a probe would be conducted or not.        
	We have lodged an FIR against the Co-ordination Committee members who attacked us. Ten of our supporters were injured. Two have been admitted to Medical College and Hospital, alleged Shyamal Mitra, the convener of the Mahakaran Sangram Committee, which is leading the protests.        
	The general secretary of the Co-ordination Committee, Ananta Bandopadhyay, denied the unions involvement in the incident

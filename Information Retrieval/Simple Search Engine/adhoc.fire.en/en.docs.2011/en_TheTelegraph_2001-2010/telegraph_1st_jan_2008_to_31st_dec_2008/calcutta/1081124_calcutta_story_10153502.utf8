The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 25 lakh lost in quest for medical seat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       25 lakh lost in quest for medical seat
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A doctor desperate to see his son in his robe has been fleeced of around Rs 25 lakh.        
	Samiran Basu and Ashok Basu were arrested on Sunday for allegedly taking Rs 25.6 lakh from Bhaskar Ghoshal after promising to ensure a seat for his son in a medical college.        
	The duo are being interrogated. We are trying to find out how many people they have duped, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	Samiran and Ashok, who the police said ran a consultancy firm on Sarat Bose Road, had published advertisements in newspapers in 2004 promising admission in the MBBS course against Rs 12 lakh.        
	In a state-run medical college, a student has to spend Rs 1.5 lakh for the five-year MBBS course. In private colleges, the cost varies between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 35 lakh.        
	Ghosal said he and his son visited the duos office in July 2004. Samiran asked me for Rs 30,000 as processing fee. I paid the amount, the doctor recalled. A couple of weeks later, Samiran accompanied the father-son duo to Lucknow, where he said the son would be admitted to King Georges Medical College. He introduced us to a contact person and took Rs 6 lakh from me. Next day, he asked us to leave as the contact person had been arrested, the Gariahat resident said.        
	After a few days, Samiran took the duo to Mumbai. He took another Rs 3 lakh from me but failed to arrange a berth for my son. When I protested, he refunded Rs 2.7 lakh, Ghoshal added.        
	In 2005, the two accompanied Samiran to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Orissa and paid him another Rs 5 lakh. This time, too, they returned empty-handed. I asked Samiran to return whatever I paid him but he fled, Ghosal added.        
	Ashok appeared on the scene in 2006, assuring the doctor to get his son admitted to RG Kar Medical College for Rs 14 lakh. Ghoshal loaned the amount from a bank but was again taken for a ride.        
	Last year, too, Ashok tried to play the same trick but Ghosal asked him to refund the money by February 2008. After Ashok failed to pay up, the doctor lodged a complaint with Tollygunge police station.         
	Samiran was picked up from his Cossipore house and Ashok in Habra.

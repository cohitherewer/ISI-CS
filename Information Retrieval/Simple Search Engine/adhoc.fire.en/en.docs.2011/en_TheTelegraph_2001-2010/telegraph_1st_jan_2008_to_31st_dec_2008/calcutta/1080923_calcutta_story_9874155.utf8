The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Six decades of craftsmanship
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Six decades of craftsmanship

	On the bank of Beleghata Circular Canal, now clogged with hyacinth and weeds, Sambhu Pal uses a kerosene flame to dry a Durga face. With less than a fortnight to go for the pujas, Sambhu is working overtime. A cluster of Durga idols is lined up by his side, waiting to be dried, painted and decorated.         
	Around 300 Durga idols will trundle out of Canal East Road, off Maniktala Main Road, where about 30 artisans have turned a 250m stretch by the canal into an idol-making hub.        
	Most of the artisans had settled here in the early fifties, post-Partition. The potters were looking for empty space. The banks were ideal as the canal back then helped transport clay, wood and bamboo from the interiors of Bengal. They started out by making pots and dolls and switched to idol-making in the early sixties. When the market grew, idol-making became their sole pursuit, explains Prasad Chandra Dey, the president of Canal East Road Mritshilpi Samiti.        
	Today, the Canal East Road idol market attracts both retailers and wholesalers. We sell about 300-350 Durga idols every year. Our quality is by no means inferior to that of Kumartuli, claims Shyamal Pal, the Samiti secretary, whose grandfather was one of the early settlers.        
	Orders start pouring in August onwards from neighbouring areas like Maniktala, Salt Lake, Bagmari and Beleghata, as well as Ballygunge, Park Circus, Jadavpur and Behala. A few idols travel all the way to Panagarh and Mandarmani.         
	To meet the rush, artisans have to hire workers from Howrah, Nabadwip and Burdwan. About 4,000 people are dependent on this market for their livelihood, says Dey.        
	The growth in sales has necessitated improvisation and the artisans on Canal East Road have long taken to producing gimmicky idols alongside traditional ones. This year, however, the spotlight is on the traditional ekchala style with a touch of creativity.        
	The trend of using leaves, wood and glass has fallen out of favour. People now want idols of clay but with a little variation, says Dulal Pal, who has to finish work on 60-65 idols by the first week of October.        
	In the lean season, several potters turn to making images of Radha, Krishna, Sitala and Shiv. Some, like Dulal Pal, make decorative pieces from fibreglass.        
	Theres respect for what we do but the money is not good. So, the next generation doesnt want to stick to idol-making, rues Dulal.        
	But more than the money, Dulal and his colleagues are concerned about the patch of land they have called home for the past six decades.        
	Their unauthorised, wobbly bamboo-plastic structures are at the mercy of wind and rain.        
	We have written to the government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to build us concrete structures on this stretch. It becomes very difficult during monsoon because we are always scared that our thatched roofs will be blown away by the wind. We are willing to pay rent if the government wants us to. We can also build the structures ourselves if the government helps us with loans, says Dey, the Samiti president.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sweeper slap cop identified
                                                                                                               Sweeper slap cop identified
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The police van driver who allegedly slapped a civic sweeper for protesting against his rash driving near the chief ministers residence, was identified on Thursday as Arun Aditya.        
	A search was conducted with the vehicles registration number provided by witnesses. An investigation is on, a senior officer at Lalbazar said.        
	Aditya was on his way to drop Rapid Action Force personnel to be deployed near Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees house on Tuesday morning when he hit the garbage cart being pushed by Ajay Mahato at the Broad Street-Palm Avenue crossing.         
	A case of negligent driving has been started against the driver based on Mahatos complaint. A letter has been sent to deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal with details of the driver and the vehicle, an officer said. Mahato will be called to identify Aditya, who will be questioned on the charges levelled against him, he added.         
	Mahato was flung to the ground when his cart was dashed by the van. His protest against rash driving provoked Aditya to get off the vehicle and slap him before speeding off.        
	We dont have any witness to substantiate Mahatos allegation. Action will be taken against Aditya if he is found guilty, the officer said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Over 20,000 students of Calcutta University (CU), who had applied for a review of their answer scripts, will not have to wait beyond March to know their revised results.         
	Following a record number of failures  the pass percentage in the BA and B.Sc Part I examinations (1+1+1 system) dropped to 75.69 and 69.5, respectively, from 90 and 92 per cent in 2006  CU has taken steps to expedite the review process and the publication of results of the supplementary examinations.        
	The students need to prepare for the Part II examinations, which are scheduled for April-May. We are trying our best to publish the results by February-end to give the successful candidates enough time to prepare for Part II examinations, said an official of the university.         
	The decision to hold the supplementary tests  slated to start from January 29  was taken by the authorities following demands from the students.         
	The university on Friday began the exercise to speed up the result publication process by holding a meeting with the examination coordinators of various subjects. Ways to complete re-evaluation of answer scripts and correct the special supplementary scripts by end of February were the main topics of discussion at the meeting, sources said.        
	Officials of the university have convened a meeting with the principals of all affiliated colleges on Saturday to discuss major issues related to the 1+1+1 pattern.        
	The 1+1+1 pattern was introduced replacing the old 2+1 system with an intention to make the examination more student-friendly. We have started the exercise to ensure that students can benefit from the system, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das.         
	We are also trying to evolve the best method of ensuring that supplementary and review results can be declared in the shortest possible period of time, added Das.

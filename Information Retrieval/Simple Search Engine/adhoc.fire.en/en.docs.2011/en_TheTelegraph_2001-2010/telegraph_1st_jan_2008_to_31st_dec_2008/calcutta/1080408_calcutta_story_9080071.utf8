The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Laldighi car park on track
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Laldighi car park on track

	The grounds opposite Writers Buildings, where once stood the government car park, statues of heroes of the Indian freedom movement and that of BC Roy, with tram lines laid out behind them, have been levelled.        
	The earth has been gouged out on the side of St Andrews Church, as the first step towards building the two-tier underground parking plaza that will extend practically up to Laldighi, the famous water tank at the epicentre of BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square).        
	The foundation was laid on June 4, 2007, but the actual work began later. The tram lines have been shifted behind Telephone Bhavan. Forty-four trees were felled but arrangements have been made with the forest department for planting 500 trees.         
	The project, greenlighted by the heritage commission, is targeted to be complete in two years and is being built at a cost of Rs 37 crore. Manisha Rakshit, the chief government architect, says the car park will be 212 metres long, 45 metres wide and 6.5 metres deep, and is designed to accommodate 300 cars on each floor.        
	Now, a maximum of 400 to 430 cars are parked in that area. Eighty cm of this structure will extend above ground level, but that is not going to be the eyesore many fear it could be. Rakshit said a rooftop garden will be created and greenery will camouflage the structure. The three entrances and three exits will, however, be visible.        
	Efforts have been made to create a design that will not depend on power supply. None of the six ramps, with the exception of a sick car lift, is mechanised. An air-handling unit will be installed to purify the air. The car park will also be fitted with a state-of-the-art fire-fighting system. An electrical sub-station will be built there.        
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami is supervising the implementation of the project.        
	It will require 365 bore piles and it will be surrounded with z sheet piles for the retaining wall to hold back the water in the tank.         
	The foundation is way below the tank water level, and the bottom slab is expected to be concretised on April 10.

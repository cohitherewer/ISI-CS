The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pollution rein withdrawn
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pollution rein withdrawn
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A government notification making it mandatory for fuel pumps to check the pollution-control certificates of diesel vehicles before selling oil was withdrawn on Wednesday, just a week before it was to take effect.        
	The transport minister has requested the environment minister to withhold implementation of the order till further discussions are held on the issue, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said. The notification was issued in March but meant to be implemented only from June 5, which the world observes as International Environment Day.        
	The government decided to withdraw the order  only temporarily, officials said  after representatives of the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association met Chakraborty at Writers Buildings.        
	We requested the minister to withhold the order for now. We are not against the governments move to reduce pollution in the city, but we do not agree with the means. The government cannot impose such a responsibility on us, said Tushar Sen, the president of the association.        
	The environment departments order was based on the premise that diesel vehicles turned away by fuel pumps would be forced to undergo pollution checks and renew their certificates every six months. The department had planned to extend the rule to petrol vehicles later.

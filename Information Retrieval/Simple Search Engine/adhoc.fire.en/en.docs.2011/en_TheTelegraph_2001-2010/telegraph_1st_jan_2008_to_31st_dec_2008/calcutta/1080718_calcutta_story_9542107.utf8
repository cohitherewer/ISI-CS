The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seats for second string
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Seats for second string
  - CU to increase admission quotas of 50-odd colleges          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University has decided to allow more than 50 colleges in the city to increase their intake of students, holding out hope for those still waiting to get into courses and institutions of their choice.         
	There is a great demand for seats in many colleges, especially in subjects like English, geography, chemistry and accountancy. We will soon increase the number of seats in those colleges where the authorities have been able to upgrade infrastructure, the pro vice-chancellor of academic affairs, Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, said.        
	Inspection teams from the university had visited colleges known to overshoot their admission quotas in June. The university then slashed the number of seats in institutions that were found to lack infrastructure or hadnt upgraded their facilities in years.         
	We are revisiting colleges in the city and recommending an increase in the number of seats in institutions that have upgraded their facilities. This will help students in the waiting lists of these colleges to study their preferred subjects in the institutions of their choice, another official said.        
	He said the principals of several colleges that had been asked to reduce their intake wrote to the university last month, promising to comply with all norms within a month.        
	When the admission season began, the 102-odd colleges in the city had around 85,000 seats. The increase in the admission quotas of some colleges means the likes of Sujata Halder (name changed), who is in the waiting list of the geography department at Jogmaya Devi College, now stand a chance of getting through.         
	I scored more than 88 per cent in geography and my Higher Secondary aggregate is 72 per cent. But I was refused admission for geography honours, forcing me to opt for a seat in the general course, Sujata said.         
	Jogmaya Devi College is one of the institutions that had to reduce the number of seats for geography because the infrastructure there was found to be inadequate. The college has since informed us that it has purchased additional equipment for its geography laboratories and appointed extra part-time teachers. We will revisit the college soon and grant permission to increase the number of seats if it meets our standards, the pro vice-chancellor said.         
	Bhawanipur Education Society College, Asutosh College, New Alipore College and Bagbazar Womens College were among the institutions asked to cut down on the number of admissions after the first review.

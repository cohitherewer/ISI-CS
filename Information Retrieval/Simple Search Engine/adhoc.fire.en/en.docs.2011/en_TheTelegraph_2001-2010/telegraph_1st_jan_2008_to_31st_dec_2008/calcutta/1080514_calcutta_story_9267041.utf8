          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Mohammad Rashid, in his mid-30s, has been arrested on the charge of raping two minor girls.        
	Police said the Collin Lane resident even paid the girls, both around 10 years old, to keep their mouths shut.        
	The two used to spend the day under the staircase of a building in front of an NGOs office on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. At night, they stayed in a shelter provided by the NGO.        
	It was during a counselling session with NGO officials that the duo broke down and narrated the ordeal they had gone through.        
	The detective department took up the case after the NGO lodged a complaint with Park Street police station.        
	We picked up Rashid on May 10 and charged him with rape, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	The girls told the sleuths that Rashid, involved in a construction business, would lure them into his room with chocolates and abuse them.         
	Rashid is lodged in police custody. He will be produced in court again on May 17.

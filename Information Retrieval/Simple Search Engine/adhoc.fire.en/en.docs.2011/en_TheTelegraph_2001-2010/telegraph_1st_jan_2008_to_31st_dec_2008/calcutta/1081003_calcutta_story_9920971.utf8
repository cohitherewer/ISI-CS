	The Met office has warned of a wet Puja. The final countdown to the festivities this weekend may also see scattered thundershower.        
	A cyclonic circulation has developed over the Bangladesh coast, bringing in moisture from the Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, there will be scattered thundershower in the next two-three days. There is also the possibility of rain on the the Puja days, said G.C.Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore. The monsoon current, he added, is yet to withdraw from the state.        
	There is no possibility of heavy rainfall yet but we are keeping our fingers crossed as the cyclone season starts from October, said an official.

                      Humdrum reflections                    An inveterate introvert, the world of work-a-day reality does not attract Kartick Chandra Pyne. From the very beginning of his career, Pyne began to move away from the tenets of both classical Indian and Western art to respond to the beckoning of his artistic impulses. Landscapes fascinated him initially. But with the world of nature and flora emerged his own reconstructed images of fauna that often signified as metaphors of human passion and energy, and his paean to the elemental magic of women. The works showcased in the ongoing exhibition transport us to the sylvan fairytale world created by his use of colour and capricious embodiment of forms. God, as Pablo Picasso argued, is only another artist who invented the giraffe, the elephant and the tiger, and went on trying without having any consistent style. Perhaps in a more self-indulgent fashion, Pyne creates his creatures in his imaginary space without even consulting the dictum of Gods standard taxonomic logic. The works are mostly done in watercolour.

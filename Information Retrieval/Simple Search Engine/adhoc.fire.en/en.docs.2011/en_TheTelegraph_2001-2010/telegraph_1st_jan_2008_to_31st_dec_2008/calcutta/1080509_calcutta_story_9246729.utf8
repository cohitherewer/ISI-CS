                      A different street show                    The street is littered with a million physical and metaphoric allusions. It is a place of many emotions, feelings, meanings and memories. It is sensuous in a very unique sort of way; bearing different implications and associations for different people. The Street, the ongoing exhibition of paintings of street scenes by Yusuf Arakkal, presents a series of compassionate portraits of ordinary people integrated into a murky landscape. Sustained by subtle overtones of inner-city strains and tensions, the paintings articulate a common, if silent, lingo of life on the street. Despite the obvious burdens of toil, trouble and struggle, the artist manages to hold on to a soft, tender and firmly affirmative view of life. Knowingly or unknowingly, he also appears to rejoice in the sweetness of his freedom and choice. The show also marks the height of a visual technique that begins with digital art and ends with oil and acrylic on fairly large canvasses. Hosted by Art Alive Gallery, New Delhi and Gallery Sanskriti.

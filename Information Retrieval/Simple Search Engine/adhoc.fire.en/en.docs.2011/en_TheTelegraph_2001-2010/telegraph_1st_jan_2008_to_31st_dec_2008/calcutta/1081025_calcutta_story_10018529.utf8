                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pappu denied bail 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Pappu                                  
	A vacation judge rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Pappu, one of the seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case, three days before his scheduled appearance in the CBI court.        
	Pappu, also known as Syed Mohiuddin, was a family friend of the Rahmans and stands accused of accepting money from Rizwanurs in-laws to break up his marriage with Priyanka Todi.        
	CBI counsel Partha Tapaswi opposed Pappus bail application on the ground that investigators had gathered evidence to nail him.        
	The Todis paid Pappu over Rs 5 lakh at a hotel on the EM Bypass on March 13 last year. On March 19, a second meeting between Pappu and the Todis was held at the same venue, where he was given another Rs 6 lakh, the lawyer said.        
	Pappus counsel, Sudipto Moitra, insisted that the CBI had no clinching evidence against his client.         
	He also argued that Rizwanur did not mention Pappu as one of his tormentors in the suicide note that was retrieved from a computer.

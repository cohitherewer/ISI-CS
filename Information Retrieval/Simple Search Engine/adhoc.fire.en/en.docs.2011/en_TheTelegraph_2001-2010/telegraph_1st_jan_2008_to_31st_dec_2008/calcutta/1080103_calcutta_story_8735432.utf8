The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Thieves clean up 2 houses
                                                                                                            Thieves clean up 2 houses
  - Early morning swoop by armed gang of seven          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	An armed gang of seven raided two houses in a Narendrapur estate early on Wednesday and decamped with cash and jewellery worth more than Rs 3 lakh.        
	The dacoits, armed with pistols and knives, were aged between 25 and 30 years and spoke Bengali, said an officer of Sonarpur police station. We suspect they are all residents of the locality, as their faces were covered with cloth. The operation continued from 1.30am to 2.30am.        
	The dacoits, who came riding motorcycles, first struck at Soma Chowdhurys house in Sonargaon Housing Complex around 1.30am. Chowdhury lives with her 16-year-old son. Her husband, a Coal India employee, is posted in Jharkhand.        
	After barging into the house, the dacoits tied Chowdhurys hands and legs and locked her son in a room. Then they broke open a cupboard and looted cash and jewellery, worth about Rs 75,000. Before leaving, they locked the door.        
	The gang then raided the house of Chowdhurys neighbour Tapas Kumar Halder, a doctor with Howrah State General Hospital. Halders elderly parents were in the house.        
	The dacoits forced their way in, locked the couple in a room, broke open a cupboard and took away cash and ornaments worth Rs 2.5 lakh.        
	While Halders house was being robbed, Chowdhury and her son kept shouting in a bid to alert neighbours, but none came to their rescue.        
	Before leaving the estate, the dacoits warned the residents not to call police. A police team arrived in the morning and questioned the residents of the estate throughout the day. We are not ruling out the possibility of an insider being involved in the dacoity, said an officer.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An illegible licence plate led to the recovery of a stolen motorcycle on Friday afternoon.         
	Subrata Sen, the officer-in-charge of Lake Town traffic guard, was on his way to Barrackpore when he noticed that the licence plate of the motorcycle moving in front of his car had been tampered with.         
	The motorcycle bore the number WB 24N 7080. But as my car came close to it, I saw that 7 and 8 had been written over 1 and 2. The original number was of a stolen motorcycle, whose particulars I had with me, said Sen.        
	As both vehicles were passing Khardah police station, the rider sensed he was being followed. He tried to speed off but got stuck in a snarl.         
	The thief then got off the bike, ran to the other side of the road and fled by boarding a moving bus, said an officer.        
	The motorcycle had been stolen at gunpoint in Lake Town in April.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops goof up on traffic plan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cops goof up on traffic plan 
          KINSUK BASU                              
	A traffic diversion plan that had been finalised on Wednesday after months of planning was jettisoned on Thursday by some police officers who developed cold feet about making AJC Bose Road out of bounds for buses.        
	The same officers had on Wednesday agreed to close the stretch between Loudon Street and Theatre Road to buses and minibuses to allow a ramp to be constructed on the AJC Bose Road flyover.        
	The timeline for the project was fixed at 160 days and copies of the traffic diversion plan handed to reporters. Text alerts were to be sent through cellphone service providers and travel advisories released for broadcast through FM radio stations.         
	But on Thursday morning, it dawned on senior officers that students might be affected by the traffic diversion plan during exams in March-April.         
	Apart from annual tests in schools, the roster includes Madhyamik, ICSE, CBSE and Higher Secondary examinations, an officer in Lalbazar said.        
	What nobody could explain was why no officer had thought of it before finalising the plan.        
	Ironically, the police had given the green signal to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) to begin constructing the Rs 28-crore ramp from Thursday because most schools are to close soon for winter vacations.         
	Sources said the commissioner of police, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, was about to sign the notification for traffic diversion when officers raised the issue of students being inconvenienced during exam time.         
	The last time the traffic department had goofed up on a traffic plan was when the one-way timings for several thoroughfares, including Park Street, were changed without notice earlier this year.         
	We are working on a new date. The diversion plan hasnt been stalled, said K. Hari Rajan, the additional commissioner of police.         
	Sadhan Banerjee, the vice-chairman of the HRBC, hoped the police authorities would promptly come up with a new schedule.         
	We have received Rs 1.6 crore out of the Rs 6 crore promised by Delhi. We hope to know the new dates by Monday, he said.

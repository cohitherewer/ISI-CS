	New Delhi, Oct. 24: Whats in a name if you have someones number, Shakespeare might have written had he been alive to watch Indian MPs and ministers confusion this week.        
	A Parliament session has just closed with no one quite sure what to call it.        
	Was it the monsoon session? The winter session? Some of the most seasoned dodged the issue, saying it was merely the current session.        
	P.D.T. Achary, Lok Sabha secretary-general, provided the technically correct answer. This is the 14th session of the 14th Lok Sabha, he said.         
	The root of the problem is that the session summoned in July for the trust vote was never prorogued. Instead, Parliament adjourned and was revived on October 17.        
	Ministers letters over the week reflected the confusion. The routine letters were sent to party whips to let MPs know when they could meet the ministers during the session.        
	The minister of state for parliamentary affairs, V. Narayanaswamy, referred to the monsoon session while minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay called it the winter session. Like a good finance minister in times of crisis, P. Chidambaram played it safe with current session.        
	This can be termed the second part of the 14th session of the 14th Lok Sabha, Achary elaborated.        
	Rupchand Pal, CPM chief whip in the Lok Sabha, disagreed: There has to be a budget session, a monsoon session and a winter session.        
	The Constitution does not provide for the naming of a Parliament session, Achary insisted.        
	The Left alleged the Centre was hiding behind a technicality to avoid a no-trust motion. A no-confidence motion and a confidence motion cannot be moved in the same session, the CPMs Sitaram Yechury said.        
	The government decided tonight not to prorogue the House, so the 14th session would resume again on December 10 and, most likely, last till December 23. Another session may be called in February to take a vote-on-account if polls are held by May.        
	Yechury told a news conference: Parliament has met only for some 35 days this year. The track record was better even during Emergency.

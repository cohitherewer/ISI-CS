	 New Delhi, March 29: A four-storey building under construction in northeast Delhi collapsed this morning, killing five labourers at the site and two children in a neighbouring house.

	A mammoth rescue effort has been launched to clear the debris, said Rajiv Ranjan, the additional deputy commissioner of police.          
	The building is said to have collapsed when the labourers were digging the basement. It also destroyed the neighbouring house, said a police official. So far, 14 people are injured in the collapse.

	Patna, May 28: Even as Nitish Kumar announced Rs 25,000 to rank-holders in matriculation and intermediate examinations, the Opposition has questioned the decision to dole out the award money from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund.

In intermediate examinations, 83.41 per cent girls made it while 76.06 per cent passed the exam in science, arts and commerce faculties. The overall pass percentage in matriculation this year was 67.13 and 78.87 in intermediate examinations.         
	Soon after the results were published today, the Bihar chief minister announced that Rs 25,000 each would be given to toppers in matriculation and three disciplines in intermediate exams.        
	Nitish said first 10 toppers from each category would be given Rs 10,000 each as a token of encouragement. Topper in each district would also get Rs 10,000.         
	Bihar School Examination Board has put the results on the internet today. Out of 769,247 candidates in matriculation, 61,228 boys and 90,365 girls got first division followed by 257,137 candidates getting second division.         
	In the intermediate exam, 504,818 candidates appeared. Of it 29,725 boys and 25,171 girls got first division. While the Opposition RJD lauded the governments gesture to give monetary encouragement to toppers, it questioned the urgency to give award money from the fund. RJD spokesperson Shyam Rajak said: The relief fund is meant for natural disasters. Diverting relief fund is not acceptable.

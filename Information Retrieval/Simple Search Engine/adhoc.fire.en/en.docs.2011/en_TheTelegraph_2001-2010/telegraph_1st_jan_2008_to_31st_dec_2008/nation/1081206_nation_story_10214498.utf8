	 New Delhi, Dec. 5 (PTI): A passenger at Delhi airport claimed to have heard two gunshots near gate No. 4 around 1.15am on Friday, but there was no eyewitness and no cartridge shells were found, the commissioner of security for airports said.           
	The CISF and Delhi police intensified checking at the airport, already on high alert. While the checking was on, a white Qualis jumped the queue and sped away, adding to the confusion.          
	Delhi police have now prohibited assembling of people or parking of vehicles on a 500-metre stretch on NH 8 near the airport. The order, however, did not mention the high alert at the airport but said it came in the wake of reports that large gatherings near the landing and takeoff areas may cause security risk to aircraft.                  
	 Mumbai (PTI): Negotiations for the release of MT Biscaglia has begun. The ship, with 25 Indians among its crew, was hijacked a week ago in the Gulf of Aden. The manager of the vessel has appointed a professional negotiator to talk with the Somalia hijackers, Abdulgani Y. Serang, general secretary of the National Union of Seafarers of India, said.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has stayed proceedings pending in Delhi High Court relating to the construction of 1,100 flats for the Commonwealth Games village near the Yamuna. The high court had appointed a committee to assess its ecological impact.                   
	 Chandigarh (PTI): Auto-rickshaws will not be allowed to ferry children to school and back from January 1 next year, state transport department officials said on Friday. Four-wheelers that are covered on all sides could be introduced as a replacement, they said.                   
	 Sitapur, UP (PTI): Forest officials are trying to capture a tiger that had strayed into a village from Dudhwa forest in Uttar Pradesh. The officials said the villagers might kill the tiger to save themselves. The tiger has already killed two cows. Sugarcane fields were providing a perfect hiding place for the big cat, they said.

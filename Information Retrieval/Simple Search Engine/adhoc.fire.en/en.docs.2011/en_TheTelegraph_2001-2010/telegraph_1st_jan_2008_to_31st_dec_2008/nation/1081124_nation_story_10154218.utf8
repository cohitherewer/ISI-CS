	Bosasso (Somalia), Nov. 23 (Reuters): As dawn breaks over the Indian Ocean each morning, elders in Somali pirate bases sip strong coffee and clutch mobile phones to their ears, eager to hear the latest from the gunmen out at sea.        
	Have any more ships been hijacked or ransom talks concluded? Any news of the western warships hunting them?        
	Last weekends capture of a Saudi Arabian super-tanker loaded with oil worth $100 million (Rs 500 crore) has jacked up the stakes in what is probably the only growth industry in the failed Horn of Africa state.        
	Massive ransom amounts have brought rapid development to former fishing villages that now thrive with business and boast new beachside hotels, patronised by cash-rich buccaneers.        
	Investors have been attracted from around Somalia.        
	There are some pirates who never shoulder a gun or go out into the ocean, but they own boats which earn them a hell of a lot of money, gang member Bashir Abdulle said.        
	Just three years ago, maritime security experts estimated there were just five Somali pirate groups and fewer than 100 gunmen. Now they think there are more than 1,200. Some analysts trace the gangs roots to ties forged with criminal networks across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen during years of people-smuggling operations.        
	Others say the buccaneers began life as a rag-tag coast guard formed by elders enraged by European fleets illegally trawling Somali waters for tuna, and even more clandestine craft dumping deadly toxic waste on its shore.        
	But the biggest lure now, of course, is the ransom being paid for captured ships. Kenya says it thinks the pirates have received more than $150 million this year alone.        
	Many young men who used to work as bodyguards and militia fighters for Somalias many warlords and feuding politicians have quit with their guns to chase the rewards available out on the waves.        
	I know piracy isnt good, but if it wasnt for them I wouldnt be able to make a living, shrugs Kadija Duale, a mother of four in Eyl. She sells the gunmen $3 cups of tea on credit, then collects the money when they receive their share of ransom. A kilo of khat, a popular mild narcotic plant, now costs $65 in Eyl, compared with $20 elsewhere, thanks to pirate demand.        
	Abdiqadir Yusuf Ow Muse, the Eyl chairman, said his village had existed since 1927, but had long been only a tiny fishing community. This year, he said, all that had changed. Now its a district with almost all facilities you would expect, because of the convergence of rich pirates, he said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cong bother over shootout

	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Congress is grappling with questions from its MPs and MLAs about the Jamianagar encounter two weeks ago.        
	Would any terrorist have supplied his real address while applying for a SIM card?        
	Why did the police say one of those apprehended had a bank balance of Rs 3 crore when it was just Rs 1,400?         
	Where was the constable who was wounded in the encounter and what did he tell the police?         
	How come slain cop Mohan Chand Sharma was seen walking with the support of two of his colleagues in a spotless shirt and trousers after he was reportedly shot at?        
	These are some of the questions the party is searching for answers to.        
	Union minister Kapil Sibal, MP from Chandni Chowk, and Uttar Pradesh leader Salman Khurshid, a resident of Jamianagar, have been inundated with horror stories of a community under siege from a minority-friendly government. Sibal, sources said, was worked up because his constituency has a large Muslim population.        
	Party sources said they were trying to verify if there was a basis for the questions before demanding answers from the administration.        
	But asked to give a face to the administration and spell out who they would address the questions to  home minister Shivraj Patil, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan or the Delhi police commissioner  the sources merely said: The police.        
	The home ministry is responsible for law and order in the Delhi state but we must not say anything that could undermine Delhi police and the martyrdom of Sharma, said a general secretary.

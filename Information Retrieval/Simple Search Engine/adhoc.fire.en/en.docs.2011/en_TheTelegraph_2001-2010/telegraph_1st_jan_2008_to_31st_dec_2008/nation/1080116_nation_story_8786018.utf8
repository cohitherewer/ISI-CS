	Cuttack, Jan. 15: Regular supply of potable pipe-water remains a dream in many of Cuttacks neighbourhoods due to a slow distribution system.
    
	The existing network is meant to cater to 3,15,000 people, but it has not been upgraded although the number of people in the city has swelled to over 7,00,000. 
    
	The present system supplies 115-million-litres per day from 116 production wells and 113 hand-pump tube wells. With lines laid out for only 2,4,203 homes and 2,028 stand posts in the streets, nearly 4-lakh people do not have access to piped water supply. 
    
	While the distribution is yet to be extended to the 13 of the 48 wards in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation area, for many, piped water is a sporadic phenomenon owing to faulty and often outdated distribution.
    
	Though the supply status indicates some 115-million-litres being ferried every day, more than 25 per cent is wasted due to leakage, admit public health department officials. Also, rampant illegal tapping adds to the woes. However, the situation is expected to improve as the department promises to change old lines and extend the distribution network to most wards in the city.
    
	A Rs 282-crore plan for augmentation of the supply is on the anvil, said D. Patnaik, the chief engineer of the department.
    
	While spelling out the plans to the media, Patnaik said the blue print includes plans to have 25 overhead reservoirs and to draw out water from the Mahanadi and Kathajodi. A water treatment plant would also be set up over 15-acres at Naraj for another 100-million-litres in addition to the 115-ml being supplied now. 
    
	The project would be implemented after work on the old lines is completed and new lines in areas deprived of piped water is finished. Officials also admitted that checking pilferage of piped water would be a priority.
    
	The public health department has further plans to introduce water meters by 2009 in houses with service connections. Water cess would be charged according to the number of connections, officials said.

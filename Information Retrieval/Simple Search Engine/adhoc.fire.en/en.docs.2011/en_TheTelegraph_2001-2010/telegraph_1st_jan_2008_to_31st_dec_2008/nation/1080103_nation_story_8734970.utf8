                                                                                                            Cops in Nitish firing line
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Tough talking                                  
	Patna, Jan. 2: Asking senior policemen to take to regular firing practice is a subtle way of showing frustration and raising doubts on police leadership, feel some senior police officers, who have served under several political dispensations.        
	On December 31 last year, chief minister Nitish Kumar asked all top senior police officers  from deputy inspector-generals to director-general of police  to get into regular firing practice while addressing senior government officials of several districts through video-conferencing.        
	While several senior police officers interpret the chief ministers instruction a routine way to gear up and motivate forces, several others read between the lines of the chief ministers stern message for Bihar police unable to rein in rebels in particular. Naxalites gunned down four policemen in Munger yesterday.        
	A DIG rank officer, who studied police reforms at the US recently, said: Stress on parades, badges and firing practice orders to top officers are only rituals, which seldom change police attitude.        
	He added that senior police officers must be conversant with firing but they were more policy makers. An officer is anyway given a public security officer, who carries a pistol or revolver. A senior Bihar police officer does not carry his pistol, which automatically comes with his uniform. Carrying a pistol does not feel one comfortable in carrying out administrative work, said an officer.        
	A senior police officer generally does not take up a pistol unless there is a question of serious security threat. He may well ask his security officer to fire or at best take the security officers firearm to fire. Under such cases, the responsibility of firing automatically gets transferred to the police officer.        
	He said: Nitish asking his police officers to get into firing practice simply means he is not happy with the police leadership. The chief minister might have clearly meant that police are not delivering up to his expectation. Or it is way to say that the police leadership does not inspire.        
	Bihar has nine commissionarates. Each has a commissioner, inspector-general and a deputy inspector-general. Besides, over 70 senior police officers are posted at police headquarters, criminal investigation department, vigilance wing, crime records bureau and some other police wings.        
	The government has asked policemen to lose weight, too.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, May 3: Nalini Sriharans lawyers today accused the jail superintendent who had denied that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had met the convict in prison of wilful suppression of facts.        
	Raja Soundari, the superintendent, could not be reached for comment.        
	In reply to an application under the Right to Information Act seeking details of a meeting between Nalini, serving a life term for her role in Rajiv Gandhis assassination, and his daughter Priyanka, Soundari denied that any such interaction took place in the prison on March 19.         
	Unconfirmed reports from Vellore tonight said Nalini may have been taken out of the prison on March 19 and the meeting arranged in a circuit house near the town.         
	Soundaris reply to the April 8 notice was dated April 11. On April 15, Priyanka confirmed the meeting in a written statement. Nalini, too, has confirmed the interaction.         
	This is wilful suppression of facts, under pressure from officials in Delhi and political leaders, charged Nalinis senior counsel, Doraisamy.         
	Informed sources said if the jail heads statement was proved correct, it could have an impact on her petition filed in the high court for early release from prison on account of good conduct.

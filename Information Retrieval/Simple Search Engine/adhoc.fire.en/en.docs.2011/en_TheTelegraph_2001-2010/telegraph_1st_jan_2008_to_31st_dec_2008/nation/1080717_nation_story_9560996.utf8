          OUR BUREAU                              
	Lucknow/New Delhi, July 16: The nuclear war is now being fought in jails.        
	Scrambling for numbers, the rival camps have been sending emissaries to woo jailed MPs because, come July 22, every vote is going to count.        
	Yesterday, it was Umakant Yadavs turn.        
	The BSP MP had an unexpected visitor  the chief ministers confidant and minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui.        
	Sources said Umakant, who has nearly 50 cases against him, was offered a ticket from his old constituency. He was also told his bail process would be speeded up. But on one condition: he would have to vote against the UPA government at the Centre.        
	Siddiques visit followed efforts by rival Samajwadi Party leaders to try and persuade the MP to vote for the nuke deal.        
	Siddique stayed perhaps less than an hour, but it was enough to change Umakants status in jail. At dinner last night, sources said, butter naan and dal makhani replaced tasteless roti, dal and sabji. For dessert, there was ice cream.        
	The minister met him in jail as he is still our party MP, admitted BSP Uttar Pradesh chief Swamy Prasad Maurya. What is wrong if a minister meets his party MP?        
	No one, however, could confirm if Umakant was offered money.        
	But allegations of splurging crores to buy out MPs flew thick and fast. Sources close to Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh said the partys good relations with the Sahara Parivar had soured and that Mayavati had approached the group to help the BSP get MPs from Mulayam Singh Yadavs party.        
	One Samajwadi source claimed there was a secret meeting between party MP Atiq Ahmeds wife and Mayavati to work out a deal.        
	The Samajwadis, too, have done their bit to win over Atiq. Party boss Mulayams nephew Dharmendra met the murder accused in jail last week.        
	Mulayam today claimed party MPs who were in prison were being threatened. The states ruling party is not just offering money and party tickets, it is dangling cold, crisp threats to psyche them into voting against the deal, he said.        
	A Samajwadi leader said BSP MP Akbar Ahmed Dumpy met Samajwadi MP Afzal Ansari in jail to convince him to vote against the deal. A BSP release, however, said it was a personal visit.        
	High court nod        
	Two jailed MPs, whose parties are UPA constituents, were today allowed by Patna High Court to take part in the trust vote in Parliament.        
	A PTI report said the court gave RJD MP Mohd Shahabuddin and LJP MP Surajbhan Singh  both life convicts  permission to go to Delhi for the confidence vote.

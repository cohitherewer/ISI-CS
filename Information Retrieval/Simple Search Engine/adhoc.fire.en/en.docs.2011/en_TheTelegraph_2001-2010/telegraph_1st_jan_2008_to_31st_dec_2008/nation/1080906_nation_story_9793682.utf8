          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 5: The Opposition today demanded imposition of Presidents rule in the state, alleging that the BJD-BJP government had failed in its constitutional responsibility to protect the life and property of people.        
	The state government and police have failed to contain the communal violence which has assumed an alarming proportion, NCP state unit president Bijoy Mohapatra told reporters today.        
	Army should be deployed in the state and the Presidents rule should be imposed to bring the situation under control, he demanded.         
	Mohapatra, a former minister, expressed concern over the fact that instead of the communal violence subsiding after 13 days, it was spreading to other areas.        
	Holding chief minister Naveen Patnaik solely responsible for the recent communal strife, the NCP leader said Naveen, also in charge of the home portfolio, failed to protect the life of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, who had received threat letters and filed an FIR.         
	The killings led to communal clashes and law and order problem in the state. For the callousness and inefficiency of the chief minister and his government, more than hundred innocent people had lost their lives, he alleged. He wondered as to why the Naveen government was afraid of facing a CBI probe, as demanded by several political parties and minorities.        
	State Youth Congress also supported the demand for Presidents rule and CBI probe into the recent communal incidents. Its president Rohit Pujari said the youth association would observe September 8 as black day across the state.        
	CPM today accused the BJD-BJP government of being soft towards the VHP and Sangh Parivar which had threatened to defy the Supreme Court and proceed with its proposed kalash yatra. The VHP and Sangh Parivar want to spread communal fire by organising the processions throughout the state, said CPM state secretary Janaradan Pati.

                                                                                                               Promise amp; plea to fleeing migrants
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Deshmukh                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh today appealed to north Indians to return to Maharashtra and promised them protection.        
	The assurance came a tad too late, with over 10,000 migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having already fled Nashiks industrial belt to escape the violence unleashed by Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).        
	Deshmukh had last week toured the state with President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh before camping in his constituency, Latur, to prepare for his sons wedding.        
	Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme in Pune today, Deshmukh termed the Nashik exodus a temporary reaction.        
	People move to safer places when there is trouble and return in a few days. Everybody is welcome to Maharashtra. I promise protection to all, he said.        
	Defending his governments late action against Raj and Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, the chief minister said he had asked senior police officials to deal firmly with the perpetrators of violence. A survey has been ordered to find out the extent of damage caused to life and property in clashes between MNS and Samajwadi Party workers since February 3.        
	The Deshmukh government is considering paying compensation to taxi and autorickshaw drivers who had borne the brunt of the MNS attacks. It also plans to file a chargesheet against Raj and Azmi in the next eight days and set up a fast-track court for the case.         
	The Samajwadi Party has announced a Rs 5-lakh compensation for the family of Ambadas Dharrao, the 53-year-old Maharashtrian who was killed in Nashik a few minutes after Rajs arrest in Mumbai on Wednesday.         
	I would like to meet Dharraos family if they give me time, party general secretary Amar Singh said.

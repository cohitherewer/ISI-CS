          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 6: Fresh controversy has struck the Amarnath pilgrimage, this time over its route.        
	The custodian of the holy mace, Mahant Deependra Giri, has said the yatra through the Pahalgam route alone is mentioned in the Hindu scriptures.        
	If you look at our scriptures, you will find only the Pahalgam route mentioned there. It is the traditional route. I have never taken the Baltal route since it is not mentioned in the scriptures. It is man-made, Giri said days before the annual pilgrimage begins on June 16.        
	The pilgrimage to the cave, earlier caught up in a scandal following charges that the ice Shivalingam had been artificially created by the shrine board, is taken either through the longer Pahalgam route or the shorter Baltal route.        
	The return journey through Baltal can take only a day. This route, though, began to be used only a few years ago.        
	The yatra has already kicked off a political row after the state government recently transferred around 40 hectares of forest land near Baltal to the board.         
	Forest minister and Peoples Democratic Party leader Qazi Mohammad Afzal is under fire from the Opposition National Conference and separatist groups for transferring the land despite his partys public stand against any such move.

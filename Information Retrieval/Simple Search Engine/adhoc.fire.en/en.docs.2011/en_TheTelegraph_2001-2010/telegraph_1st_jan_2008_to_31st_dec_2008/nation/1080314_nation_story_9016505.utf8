                                                                                                               IMA trashes kidney theft slur
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 13: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) today rubbished claims made by the kin of one Bhagwan Singh (50) that the kidney of the deceased was stolen by a private hospital during surgery.         
	Singh, a Sonepur resident, succumbed to intestinal disorders after a second surgery last night.         
	His kin lodged an FIR against Shyamal Hospital at Rajiv Nagar police station here today. In the FIR, Singhs relatives have alleged that doctors removed the kidney of the deceased during laparodomy, a surgical procedure.         
	Former IMA national president and chairman of Urology Society of India Ajay Kumar today told reporters: We refute all charges against Shyamal Hospital because we understand that techniques involved in such a theft is not available at the hospital. Kumar said the charges arose because of a misunderstanding between the patients family and doctors and possible medical negligence. He added that the association would like a recorded post-mortem to get to the truth.         
	IMAs Bihar president Basant Singh said removal of a kidney and its preservation needed technical and medical expertise. Though some city hospitals conduct kidney transplantation, this hospital conducts only dialysis, said Singh.         
	B.K. Jha of the Shyam Hospital said: The patient had been suffering from porous intestine for long. In his case the risk factor was higher, as he had already undergone three surgeries previously.

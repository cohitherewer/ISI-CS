     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, March 3: The BJP today unveiled its strategy to counter P. Chidambarams please-all budget, saying it will not solve the problems of the poor as long as prices kept rising.
    
	L.K. Advani made two points: one, the budgets proposals would not help the farmers as much as the Centre claimed and two, the growing inflation would undo the benefits.
    
	He linked the agrarian distress to the rising input costs, and said most small farmers had borrowed from private moneylenders and would not get relief from the loan waiver.
    
	Will this package help the needy? Where will the money come from, the Prime Minister should explain, he said while speaking on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address in the Lok Sabha.
    
	Advani also attacked the Centre for naming every scheme after one family, drawing Congress protests. I ask the Prime Minister why every scheme is being named after Nehru, Indira or Rajiv?
    
	Congress MPs crowed over the budgets populist provisions and the Centres measures like the rural job scheme.

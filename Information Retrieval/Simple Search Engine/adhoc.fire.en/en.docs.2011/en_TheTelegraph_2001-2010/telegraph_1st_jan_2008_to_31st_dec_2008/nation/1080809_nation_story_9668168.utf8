                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Court therapy: Flog officials 
  - Judges slam bureaucrats, cops for not responding to FIR directive                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Where God may fail, flogging may succeed.        
	In this country, you need huntering (flogging) to make you work. Is this Ram rajya in this country? This is the concept of swaraj, a Supreme Court bench of Justices B.N. Agarwal and G.S. Singhvi said today.        
	The judges were giving vent to their dismay at the failure of officials to respond to its directives on punishing cops who failed to register FIRs on public complaints.        
	Two days ago, Agarwal had said while hearing a case on squatters in government buildings: Nothing can save this country. Only God can help this country. Not even God, if he were to come down, can help this country.        
	Today, giving chief secretaries and police commissioners two more weeks to file their response, the apex court warned that if they failed to respond they would have to be personally present for the next hearing.        
	The bench lamented that apart from Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh, no state or Union territory had responded to its July 14 directives.        
	On July 14, the bench had said that a citizen whose FIR was not registered could approach a judicial magistrate to direct the police officer concerned to register the first information report.         
	However, if the policeman failed to register the FIR even after the directive of the judicial magistrate, the cop should be jailed.        
	The Supreme Court had asked the states and Union territories to file their replies in three weeks.        
	But when the matter came up for hearing today, only Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh filed their response, provoking the bench to make the observations.        
	The bench pointed out that even though it had posted the matter on the Supreme Court website, the officials chose to ignore them.        
	It is a pathetic state of affairs that only two states, viz states of Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh, have responded and other states did not bother to file their responses. Some of them have simply engaged their counsel, who are appearing in court and, as usual, they have made prayer for time to file responses, the bench said.        
	The directives were passed on a habeas corpus petition filed by Bhola Kamat whose 16-year-old daughter was abducted in a land dispute.        
	When Kamat filed a complaint, the police allegedly told him to withdraw it and arrive at an understanding with the accused, allegedly including advocate Sobha Gupta.        
	Pranesh, Kamats counsel, had earlier told the court that the victims daughter, Lalita Kumar of Ilaichipur village in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, was kidnapped at the alleged instance of Sobha Gupta.        
	The police have been demanding a bribe to arrest the accused, Kamat said in his petition.                    WRITTEN WITH PTI REPORT

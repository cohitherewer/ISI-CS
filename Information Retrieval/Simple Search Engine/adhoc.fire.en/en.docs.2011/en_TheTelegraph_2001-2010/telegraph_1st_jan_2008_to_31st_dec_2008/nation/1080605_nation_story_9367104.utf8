          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 4: The CBI today put Rajesh Talwar through a lie-detector test to piece together the sequence of events on the night his daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj were killed.        
	Sources said the CBI also planned to do a lie test on the 15-year-olds mother Nupur as her version of events had several discrepancies.        
	Since Nupur is not under arrest, the CBI will have to take the courts permission to do the test. Nupur will also have to give her consent.        
	The results of the lie test on Rajesh are expected tomorrow. The dentist, the main accused in the May 15 murder, has been in CBI custody since Monday.        
	With speculation about the twin murders swirling, the CBI today put out a statement. A spokesperson said 10 teams had been set up to look into various aspects of the probe.         
	He said blood samples still present on the scene of crime, suspected finger prints, palm print etc and other forensic evidence were collected from the scene of crime.        
	A blood-soaked blanket found on Aarushi and other clothing with suspected bloodstains had also been seized, he said. The material had been sent for forensic tests and the vicinity of the crime site was being scanned further.        
	CBI director Vijay Shankar, his officials and forensic experts from AIIMS had reviewed the case, he said.        
	Sources said the CBI had questioned the Talwars neighbours in Noida as well as Aarushis teachers and friends in Delhi Public School.        
	Some of her teachers and friends have indicated that she seemed quite disturbed in the last few days. We are not sure what that means and if it had something to do with her murder. All the more reason why Dr Talwars and his wife Nupurs statements are crucial, an official said.        
	There are too many loose links. We need to corroborate and establish some things to reach a positive conclusion.

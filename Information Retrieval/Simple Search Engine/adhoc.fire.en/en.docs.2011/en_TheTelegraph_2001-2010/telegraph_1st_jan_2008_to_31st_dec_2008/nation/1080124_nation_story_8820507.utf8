	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Rahul Gandhi wants democracy to begin at home for the Congress.
    
	By instinct and education, I believe in democracy, the young MP told a meeting of the Congress group that looks into future challenges.
    
	If the others in the 13-member group headed by M. Veerappa Moily had thought these were just words  lofty but empty  Rahul made it clear he meant business. 
    
	The party should do away with the nomination culture and hold elections at every tier of the organisation, he said.
    
	At present, Congress office-bearers  at the Centre and in states, districts and blocks  are nominated though they are described as elected. The party has not held organisational elections in years because of unsavoury experiences in the past, when polls inevitably spawned street fights. 
    
	Murmurs were audible in the Congress when word got out that the heir-apparent does not approve of nominations, which have long been used to paper over faction fights.
    
	The process is deeply embedded and was introduced after a lot of thought and discussion. The decision was taken at the highest level (the Congress Working Committee) and was okayed by everyone. It cant be changed just like that, a veteran office-bearer said.
    
	But a colleague recalled that there was a time when candidates for local body and state elections were shortlisted, vetted and approved by district or state party chiefs without running to the high command. They were familiar with the micro-level politics and took more informed decisions, he said. 
    
	Sources said many CWC members stand no chance of winning an organisational poll because the workers cant relate to them. Their best survival mechanism is nomination. 
    
	Rahul is looking to banish such vested interests and power brokers who call the shots in Delhi and remote-control their fiefs in the states, sources said.
    
	His father Rajiv Gandhi had  in a 1985 speech shortly after he took over as Prime Minister  said the Congress should be cleansed of vested interests and power brokers. The sources recalled that he was forced to compromise when he became vulnerable after the Bofors campaign.
    
	At the meeting today, Rahul said it would be his priority to bring in more young people and give them larger responsibilities. 
    
	In the last organisational shuffle, Sonia had inducted Rahuls peers like Sachin Pilot, Sandeep Dikshit and Jitin Prasada. The Prime Minister, too, is inclined to induct some of them as ministers.

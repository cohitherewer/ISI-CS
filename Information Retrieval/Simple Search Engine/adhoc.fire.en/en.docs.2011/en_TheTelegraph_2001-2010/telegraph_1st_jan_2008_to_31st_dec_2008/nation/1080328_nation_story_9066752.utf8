The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | FIR against Speaker
                                                                                                               FIR against Speaker
                            
	Bhubaneswar, March 27: Gayatri Panda, an assistant marshal of the Orissa Assembly, today filed an FIR accusing Speaker Maheshwar Mohanty of sexual harassment, reports our correspondent.         
	The victim could not come to the police station because of a threat, said Rituparna Mohanty, a womens rights activist who signed the FIR on her behalf. Assistant commissioner B.N. Guru said the FIR had been accepted but a case was yet to be registered.         
	The FIR says Panda was assigned duty after work hours and out of her jurisdiction at the Speakers behest. He was making lewd gestures and sending his driver and other staff to persuade me to have a sexual relationship with him, it said.

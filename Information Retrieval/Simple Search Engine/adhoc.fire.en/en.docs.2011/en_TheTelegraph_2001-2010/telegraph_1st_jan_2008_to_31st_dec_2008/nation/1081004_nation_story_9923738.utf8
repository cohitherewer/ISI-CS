	Sambalpur, Oct. 3: Hundreds of people, many institutions and organisations paid tribute to Swami Laxmananda here today.         
	A rally was also organised where participants shouted slogans against conversion, arrest of Hindus in Kandhamal and other parts of the state, cow slaughter among others. They also demanded stringent punishment against the assailants of Swamiji and persons involved in the violence.        
	In the memorial service held in front of the collectorate, speakers from all walks of life condemned police action in Kandhamal and narrated it to be one-sided.         
	The police are unable to trace the assailants and also culprits creating violence after the murder on August 23. On the other hand, it spread a reign of terror by arresting innocent Hindus, said Jatin Pujari, the president of the meeting today.

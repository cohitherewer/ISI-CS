The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chinese threat to national flower
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chinese threat to national flower
          G.S. MUDUR                          Lotus eaters                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: A fly from China that has been gorging on lotus leaves in faraway Kerala is threatening to dislodge Deng Xiaopings famous flies from their perch.        
	As China was opening up to the West many summers ago and undesirable practices like corruption, drugs and prostitution were creeping in, Deng had told his people: If you open the window the flies will come in.        
	What he probably didnt foresee was that along with the flies that came in, a Chinese fly or two  nothing figurative about this  could go out too.        
	Such a fly from China has been eating lotus plants across vast stretches of shallow freshwater fields in Keralas Malappuram district, one of Indias largest hubs for commercial lotus cultivation.         
	The yellowish-brown larvae of the two-winged insect have been feeding on lotus leaves for over two years, causing an infestation not previously observed in the country, scientists at the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) have said.        
	Chinese scientists had first identified the fly, Stenochironomus nelumbus, in 1986 a botanical garden in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing. Since then, it has spread fast within China, feeding on the rose-petalled lotus lily.        
	It is now threatening Indias national flower, said Deepu Mathew, a scientist at the KAU now pursuing post-doctoral research at the Institute of Plant Sciences in Israel.        
	Mathew and his senior colleague, P.V. Habeeburrahman, began investigating after farmers of freshwater fields in Thirunavaya complained that the leaves of their lotus plants were rotting.         
	Their studies revealed that newly hatched larvae from eggs laid in water were feeding on the leaves. The KAU team working with insect taxonomists at Purdue University in the US identified the larvae as the lotus-eating fly.         
	We dont know how it got into the lotus in Malappuram.... I dont think anybody knows. Its a mystery, Mathew told The Telegraph over the phone from Israel.         
	Malappuram has emerged as one of the nations largest lotus cultivation zones with several farmers shifting from paddy crop to lotus. Its an important cash crop for farmers, said Habeeburrahman.        
	The lotus lily grows over thousands of hectares of shallow freshwater fields in the region. Farmers harvest the flowers for distribution to temples across the southern states.         
	In some places, the flower yield has dropped by 60 per cent, said Mathew. The fly appears confined to Kerala right now, but well need quick control action to prevent its spread to other parts of the country.         
	The scientists have ruled out the use of chemical pesticides because the plants grow in a freshwater ecosystem with fish and links to the human food chain. Conventional pesticides could lead to an ecological disaster, Mathew said.         
	The KAU team has asked the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for funds to begin a trial that will involve the use of neem oil soap sprays to tackle the pest.         
	Researchers are concerned that the infestation observed in Malappuram might represent the start of a fresh invasion of a species alien to India. We have lessons from the past, said Mathew.

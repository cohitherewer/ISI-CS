                                                                                                               BJP rails at govts Tibet response
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 26: The BJPs top leadership today lashed out at the Manmohan Singh government for its cautious handling of the Tibet turmoil.        
	The party said Delhi had not fulfilled its duty and had demonstrated its readiness to compromise with independent foreign policy.         
	The BJP has been critical of the UPA governments inadequate response ever since China used force to suppress the Tibetan uprising.        
	In a joint statement issued by leader of Opposition L.K. Advani, BJP president Rajnath Singh and former foreign minister Jaswant Singh, the party said: India must give voice to its concerns  correctly, unequivocally and unambiguously. This is not any interference. It is standing up, by India, for preserving that which is our own, and that which is Indias contribution to all humanity  Tibets Buddhist culture and civilisation. This is our bounden duty and our very dharma.         
	The BJP leaders pointed out that the Ashok Chakra on the Tricolour is a Buddhist symbol  the Dharma Chakra. How can we adopt the symbol but ignore the reality?

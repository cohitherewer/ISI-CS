	Bhubaneswar, June 20: The situation in the flood-hit regions of the state continued to be grim today with more than 6.20 lakh people in 887 villages marooned.         
	The flood victims continued to go without food, as relief materials did not reach them even as the state government air-dropped food packets with the help of two Indian Air Force helicopters.         
	Though water receded in Jalaka, Subernarekha, Budhabalang and Baitarani after rains stopped in catchment areas, residents in Balasore and Mayurbhanj continued to wait for food.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who reviewed the situation in the evening, said the food packets would be dropped till floodwaters recede. Naveen today spoke to defence minister A.K. Antony and requested him to send more helicopters to carry out relief and rescue. As a result, three more IAF helicopters are expected to join the operations tomorrow morning.         
	Naveen announced that distribution of emergency relief materials would be extended to four more days. Earlier, the government had decided to provide relief for three days. As many as 90 medical teams have been deputed to flood-affected districts. Eight teams have started work in Balasore, health department sources said, adding that all the contaminated drinking water sources would be disinfected within three days.         
	Repair and restoration of the damaged roads and bridges would be undertaken within a week after the floodwater recedes.

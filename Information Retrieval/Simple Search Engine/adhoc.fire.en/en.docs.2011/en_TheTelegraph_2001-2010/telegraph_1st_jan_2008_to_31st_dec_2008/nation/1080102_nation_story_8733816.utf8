	New York, Jan. 1 (PTI): Police in Wisconsin are looking for a 34-year-old Indian who allegedly spiked his pregnant girlfriends drink with an abortion pill to kill their unborn baby.
    
	Manish Patel jumped his $750,000-bail last week, and his attorney said he had not heard from him since December 19.
    
	Patel is charged with attempted first-degree homicide of an unborn child, six other felonies and two misdemeanours.
    
	Authorities say he gave Darshana Patel, 39, also from India, a drink spiked with RU-486, a drug used to induce abortions.
    
	He is married to another woman, but has had relationships with Darshana at various times since 2001. She miscarried on September 30.
    
	Patel was freed from jail on December 3 after his friends pooled their resources to come with $750,000 in cash needed for his bail.
    
	As conditions of the bond, Patel was ordered to report at the Outagamie county sheriff departments Day Report Center on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
    
	I did not learn that he was gone until I got a call from the sheriffs department on Friday, his lawyer Thomas Zoesch said, adding that he had been unable to reach Patel on his mobile phone.
    
	According to the criminal complaint, Patel told detectives that he contacted someone in India, where he lived until he immigrated to Wisconsin in 1999, about how to end a pregnancy.
    
	The person suggested the pills. According to the complaint, Patel said he got the pills shipped to him from India, where the drug is less restricted than in the US. 
    
	Patel told the detectives he was confident the foetus his girlfriend miscarried was his and that having children was her idea. 
    
	He told investigators he didnt need more babies and said: I didnt want it.
    
	Attorney Zoesch said the whereabouts of Patels wife were also not known.
    
	Patel was in the US on a work visa and turned in his Indian passport to authorities as a condition for bail.

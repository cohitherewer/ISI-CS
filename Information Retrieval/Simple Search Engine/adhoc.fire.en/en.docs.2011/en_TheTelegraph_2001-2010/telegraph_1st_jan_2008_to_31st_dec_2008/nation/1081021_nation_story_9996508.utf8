          OUR BUREAU                          Raj Thackeray: Payback time?                                  
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Oct. 20: Arrest looms over Raj Thackeray for his anti-migrant politics a day after his party activists beat up north Indian candidates at railway recruitment exam centres in Mumbai.        
	A non-bailable warrant from a Jamshedpur court, issued over Rajs remarks against migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in February, reached Mumbai police today.        
	Officers said the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief would be arrested after his expected return, on October 23 or 25, from a tour of western Maharashtra and the Konkan.        
	In case he delays his return, we can serve the warrant on him wherever he is, said city police chief Hasan Gaffoor, whose force arrested some 500 MNS activists today to prevent a backlash.        
	According to the warrant, Raj must be produced before Jamshedpur first-class judicial magistrate A.K. Tiwary by November 17. But MNS general secretary Nitin Sardesai said the party would move a higher court and get the case transferred to Mumbai.        
	We moved Jharkhand High Court today challenging the warrant, he said. The hearing will be on Saturday.        
	At a news conference in Sindhudurg, Raj said the Supreme Court had ruled such cases should be transferred to the home state of the accused.        
	He reacted to Lalu Prasad calling him a mental case yesterday by dubbing the railway minister a murkha (fool).        
	Why were the exam advertisements not published in Marathi newspapers if the exams were being held in Maharashtra? he asked.        
	The Shiv Sena, involved in a similar attack on north Indians at a Navi Mumbai exam centre yesterday, asked the same question.        
	In Delhi, Lalu Prasad said if candidates were beaten up in Maharashtra, the railways would stop conducting exams in the state.         
	Yesterdays violence rocked Parliament today with several parties demanding a ban on the MNS and a directive under Article 355  a step short of dismissal  to Vilasrao Deshmukhs Congress-led government.        
	The Congress was left squirming as two major allies, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Samajwadi Party, led the charge.        
	With the clamour for Rajs arrest growing, the Jharkhand warrant gives Deshmukh an opportunity to nab the MNS chief while claiming it wasnt his decision.        
	The court had issued the warrant on September 30 after Raj ignored repeated summons. A Jamshedpur lawyer, Hamid Raza Khan, had filed a petition accusing Raj of hurting the sentiments of a section of society.        
	The non-bailable warrant will be served according to the norms. We will take all the necessary precautions before carrying out the courts orders, Deshmukh said.

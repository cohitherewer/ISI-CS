          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 15: The eviction drive by Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation last Friday has robbed six orphans in Gajapatinagar of their last support  a home.        
	The six children, all aged between three to 12 years, had lost their parents in a road accident two years ago and had since then stayed with their grandparents in a shanty. Two of the four girls work as domestic helpers.        
	Other slum dwellers raised their voice against the evictions but in vain. This is not done. They did not give any notice before demolishing the house. If they continue like this where shall we go with our children? There should be a proper eviction policy, alleged Dalit Mukti Sangathan secretary Pratap Sahoo.         
	Many in the slum requested the BMC officials to help us as we were too old, said Sanatan Das, the childrens grandfather. But the only relief they got was from BMC commissioner Aparajita Sarangi who offered them a shelter in the outhouse of her residence till the couple can be sent to an old-age home and the children to a hostel.        
	There is no provision of sending notice prior to eviction of encroachment from government land. Still, we warned the residents an hour before the eviction drive through public address systems, said Sarangi, standing firm by the eviction decision.

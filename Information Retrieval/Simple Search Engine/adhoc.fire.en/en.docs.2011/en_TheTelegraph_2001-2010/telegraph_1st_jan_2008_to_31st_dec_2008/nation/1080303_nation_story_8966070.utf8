  - Konark lore discussed at talk          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The Sun Temple                                        
	Bhubaneswar, March 2: Designed in the shape of a chariot mounted on 24 exquisite wheels pulled by seven horses, Konark Sun Temple is a testimony to the creative energy of Oriya artistes.         
	The architectural marvel is enlisted as a World Heritage Monument, perhaps the only one in eastern India to enjoy such a distinction. To preserve its beauty for posterity, temple conservation began way back in the 1900s.         
	Yet, little has been done till date to record its cultural heritage, rue historians.         
	A group of history enthusiasts came together on Friday in Bhubaneswar to share their views at the National workshop on documenting the intangible cultural heritage around the world heritage site of Konark.        
	The talk was organised by Bhopal-based Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya and Bhubaneswar Centre for Heritage Studies.         
	Did a character called Dharmapada really exist? Did the 12-year-old truly jump into the Chandrabhaga (that flowed by the temple then) to save his father and 1,200 artisans who built the temple  such questions and more were discussed and analysed at the seminar. Sadly, we have no proof to the myths. There are just the stories, which may be lost within the next few generations, said S.P. Rath, the executive member of the Centre for Heritage Studies.        
	When it comes to Orissa  its myths, legends and rituals have been largely left unrecorded. A documentation of Orissas cultural history is the need of the hour, stressed K.K. Basa, the director of the Bhopal institute.        
	Konark is a treasure house of our cultural heritage. We need to start researching its history without losing more time, he added.        
	Local legends state that King Narasimha Deva-I of Ganga dynasty had ordered the Sun Temple to be built, as a symbol of his political supremacy. Over 1,200 of the most capable artisans and architects worked continuously for 12 years on the construction.         
	Its also said that the king spent an amount equal over 12 years of the tax collections.         
	When the temple seemed far from being complete after the deadline due to an architectural snag, an enraged king issued an ultimatum to the architects team, headed by Bisu Maharana.        
	Legend states that Dharmapada, the 12-year-old son of Bisu Maharana, visited the site one day and upon noticing the anxiety looming large among the architects he reportedly studied the theories of architecture.         
	He surprised everyone, including his father, by offering a simple solution to the snag that was plaguing the more experienced architects.         
	Soon after the glorious achievement, the body of this adolescent prodigy was found on the beach at the foot of the temple. Its often said that Dharmapada laid down his life.         
	The objectives of the workshop was to identify and determine issues associated with intangible cultural heritage around Konark. These and many more lore attached to the temple can lead to an encyclopaedia of idea if documented properly. We will soon start a documentation process with video, audio and photography, admitted Basa.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 31: India is not sure which way China will move at tomorrows meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency to pass the safeguards agreement.        
	Officially, Beijing says it has no objections to peaceful international cooperation on nuclear energy as long as such co-operation sticks to non-proliferation commitments.        
	For India, the vague stance amounts to being neither here nor there. China made the right sounds but we dont know what they will actually do, an official said.        
	Chinas abstention or a negative vote is unlikely to affect the boards final outcome  the draft agreement can be ratified by a majority vote  but the Indian establishment believes it could send a strong political message for two reasons.        
	First, China is considered the most important country in the geopolitical dynamics underlying the nuclear deal. Second, a decision taken by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which meets towards the end of August, will be by consensus, not a majority.         
	Chinese representatives who have met their Indian counterparts in recent weeks have promised that while they had friendly relations with some political parties in India and knew their views on the deal  an allusion to the CPM  they would not let the perceptions affect their decision at the IAEA.        
	Pakistans objections to the safeguards agreement did not figure during these discussions.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs special envoy and minister Prithviraj Chavan stressed during his visit to Beijing earlier this week that the nuclear deal was needed for clean affordable energy to fight poverty, raise living standards and help reduce carbon emissions.        
	Chavan, in China to drum up support for the clearance from the IAEA and the NSG, handed over letters from the Prime Minister to President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.         
	During his discussions with Dai Binguo, the state councillor in charge of foreign affairs to whom he handed over the letters, Chavan highlighted Indias impeccable record on prevention of proliferation.         
	He made the point that the agreement was not a bilateral accord with the US but an international civilian nuclear energy co-operation aimed at ending Indias nuclear isolation.         
	Chavan also met Wang Jia Rui, minister for the international department of the central committee of the Communist Party of China, and assistant foreign minister Liu Jia Yi during his six-hour stopover.

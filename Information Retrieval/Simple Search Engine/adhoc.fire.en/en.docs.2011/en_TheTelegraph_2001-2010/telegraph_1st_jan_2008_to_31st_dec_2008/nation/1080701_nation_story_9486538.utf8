                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Manekshaw centre in Delhi 
                            
	New Delhi, June 30 (PTI): The government will name a complex for warfare studies in the Delhi cantonment after the late Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.        
	We have decided to rename the Param Vir Complex, being constructed at the entrance to the Delhi cantonment, Manekshaw Centre in memory of the iconic military leader, General Deepak Kapoor, the army chief, said today.        
	The complex will house a centre for land and air warfare studies and one for peace-keeping operations.         
	It will also serve as a hub for seminars, discussions and other events.        
	The army reveres Sam Manekshaw, under whose leadership the 1971 Indo-Pak war was won, Kapoor said after recording his message in a condolence book kept at the India Gate.        
	It will be right, not just for the army, but the whole nation to commemorate the field marshals memory, he said when asked about the delay in paying respects to Manekshaw and the absence of the military top brass at his state funeral in Tamil Nadu.        
	Earlier, defence minister A.K. Antony had said: People can have different opinions on what should have been done after the field marshals demise, but the fact is that the government decision to accord him a state funeral is proof enough to show we hold him in high esteem.

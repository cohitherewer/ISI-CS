          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 30: CPM leader Prakash Karat met two allies of the central coalition on a day of hectic behind-the-scenes parleys even as the Prime Minister made it clear he intended to go ahead with the nuclear deal.        
	Karat held talks with Republican Party of India MP Ramdas Athawale, who later said he was in favour of a delay in activating the deal.        
	Athawale said he was appealing to Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Karat to avoid an early election as he sensed the CPM would vote against the government if it came to a confidence motion.        
	NCP leader D.P. Tripathi, who also met Karat, told reporters that responsible UPA leaders had said they were hopeful of finding a solution to the crisis.        
	The CPMs opposition to the deal has remained constant. There is nothing new in the politburo statement saying they would withdraw support if the government goes ahead with the deal, he added, but made it clear the NCP was party to the cabinet decision that had approved the 123 Agreement with America.         
	The Prime Minister today said he was prepared to face Parliament before activating the deal and all that he wanted was the government should be allowed to complete the negotiation process with atomic watchdog IAEA and the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group.        
	Karat said the Left parties were working on the timing of the withdrawal.        
	Left sources said Singhs decision to attend the G8 summit in Tokyo was an indication that the government would go ahead with the deal.

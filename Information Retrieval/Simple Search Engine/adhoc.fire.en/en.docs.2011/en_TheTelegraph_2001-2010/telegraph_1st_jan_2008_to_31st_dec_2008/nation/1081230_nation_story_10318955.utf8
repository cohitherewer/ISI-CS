          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A woman and her child wait at Indira Gandhi International Airport after fog delayed many morning flights in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Fog caused widespread chaos in the capital today, forcing suspension of flights, holding up trains, many from Calcutta, and hitting road traffic.        
	No take-off was possible for five hours, between 6am and 11am, a spokesperson for Delhi International Airport Limited said.        
	Although only three flights were cancelled, over 50 were delayed and two had to be diverted to Mumbai after runway visibility declined to 50 metres.        
	The minimum visibility required for landings and take-offs is 100 metres. All operations, barring five arrivals, were suspended, the official said.        
	Flights became almost normal around noon, when visibility improved a little. But hopes of normality receded after weather officials predicted similar weather conditions for the next three to four days.        
	Visibility fell to 50 metres at 7am. The thick fog was coupled with high humidity. The minimum temperature was 8.4Celsius and maximum 25.5Celsius, the Safdarjung Met office said.        
	The two flights diverted were Royal Jordanian Airlines (from Amman) and Jet Airways (from Dubai). Both planes were sent to Mumbai, the official said.         
	The three cancellations included Jet flights to Amritsar and Lucknow, and a GoAir flight to Goa. At Amritsars Raja Sansi airport, no flight has landed or taken off in the past two days.        
	The railways werent as hard hit as flights, but trains to the capital ran behind schedule by several hours.        
	These included the Rajdhanis from Howrah and Sealdah, in addition to the Poorva Express. The delays forced authorities to reschedule the Rajdhanis, supposed to leave Delhi this evening, by up to three hours.        
	Some trains, like the Sampark Kranti from Guwahati and the Mahananda Express from north Bengals Alipurduar, were running late by a day. The fog forced down speeds to only 30-40km an hour.        
	A Northern Railway official said deceleration had been ordered in some stretches in the interest of the safety of passengers.        
	In Haryanas Gurgaon and Faridabad, which are just outside Delhi, visibility was almost nil on many stretches of highways, Met officials said.        
	The road visibility in Chandigarh, which had remained fog-free so far, was reduced to only 50 metres this morning.        
	Punjab police reported minor accidents, including three separate pile-ups in Ludhiana involving 10 vehicles. The mishaps left around 16 persons injured.

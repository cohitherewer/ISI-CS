	Cuttack, Feb. 1: Death of hundreds of Olive Ridley Turtles near the Devi river mouth on the Orissa coast over the past week has triggered concern among conservationists.
    
	Experts believe that trawlers may be responsible for the death, even though laws mandate boats to use protective devices while fishing in the area.
    
	One of three beaches used by Olive Ridley for nesting is located near Devi, 90km from here. Though Gahirmatha, 100km to the north, is the worlds largest nesting beach, a significant proportion of the population that migrates every year to Orissa mate and nest near the Devi.
    
	Maneka Gandhis People for Animals (PFA) and its Orissa affiliates found hundreds of dead turtles both on the beach and inside the sea during a field survey. There has been a spate of deaths due to trawler attack, alleged PFA Orissa secretary J.B. Das, talking to The Telegraph today. We found a number of trawlers in the prohibited mating zones. And we did not see any forest or wildlife officers checking the illegal trawling, Das added. 
    
	Government officers admitted that the death toll stood at 2,900.
    
	State government had enforced a ban on marine fishing and trawling operations within 20km of the coastline under the Orissa Marine Fishing Regulations Act, 1982. The Devi mouth is a vulnerable point, as the turtles had shifted their nesting base south of their traditional habitat in the Gahirmatha marine sanctuary. From the carcasses it was evident that death occurred due to suffocation perhaps after the turtles were entangled in mono-filament fishing nets or due to fatal injuries caused by trawler propellers, said the PFA-Orissa secretary.
    
	Dogs, gulls and crows were seen feasting on the carcasses strewn across the beach. This is like a mass annihilation of an endangered species, Das rued, urging the government to engage special force to protect the turtles.
    
	The forest department is monitoring the situation and has taking steps to beef up patrolling at the nesting beaches jointly with the Coast Guard.
    
	As a part of the protection measures, 45 base camps had been set up along the coast. The Coast Guard has seized 15 trawlers so far. We have also asked police to provide armed personnel for patrolling, said chief wildlife warden B.P. Patnaik. 
    
	Meanwhile, Operation Kachhap that surveys the mortality rate of the Olive Ridleys has sought the intervention of chief minister Patnaik. Operation Kachhapp co-ordinator B. Mohanty has claimed that the death toll had crossed the 8,000-mark this season.

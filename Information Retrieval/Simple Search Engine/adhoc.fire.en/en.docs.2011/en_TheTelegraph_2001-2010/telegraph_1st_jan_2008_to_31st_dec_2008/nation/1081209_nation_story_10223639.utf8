	Calcutta, Dec. 8: The government is planning to set up a state-aided university in Bankura or Purulia, the bill for which will be placed in the Assemblys budget session, sources in the higher education department have said.         
	Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury, the higher education minister, said: A proposal to establish a new university to increase facilities of higher education for students in Purulia and Bankura districts is under the consideration.        
	Details of the plan like its location, student and subjects to be taught are yet to be finalised. The proposed university will be the third one to be set up in a span of two years.         
	The location of the proposed university will depend on the availability of land, Chaudhury added.        
	The two new universities  the West Bengal State University in Barasat, North 24- Parganas, and the Gourbanga University in Malda  have been set up to reduce pressure on Calcutta University and North Bengal University, respectively. Similarly, the proposed university will lower the workload of Burdwan University, a source said.        
	It will be fully funded by the state government like the West Bengal State University and Gourbanga.        
	Thirty-two colleges 18 in Bankura and 14 in Purulia  will come under the new university. These colleges are affiliated to Burdwan University now.        
	The exact location, the thrust areas in education and the specialised courses to be offered will be finalised after consultations with teachers and academics.         
	There is a proposal that along with conventional subjects, the new university should lay emphasis on courses in management and technical education.

          SANTOSH SINGH                              
	Patna, June 11: The tussle between six Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) junior doctors and photographers have left a dent in the reputation of the government-run hospital and talks have started of a smearing campaign.         
	Senior doctors and administration believe that disgruntled groups suffering loss of business due to the PMCH in the past two years are out on a smearing campaign against the doctors in their bid to defame the hospital and thus wean patients away.        
	A senior doctor at the PMCH said: Our general surgery, gynaecology, orthopaedic and paediatric wards are full of patients and have been so for the past two years, leaving private nursing homes with fewer patients. It is also being said that drug stores outside the hospital premises have received a setback, as the government is distributing free medicines to patients from the hospital.        
	They also allege that there are usually a number of ambulances waiting before PMCH gates to take away patients to private nursing homes. An PMCH insider said: It is easy to target young doctors. The juniors work under tremendous pressure. .         
	He added that the past weeks clash between lens-men and doctors was engineered and pre-planned. It was nothing short of a sting operation, he added.         
	Six junior doctors lost their tempers after they caught photographers taking pictures of them without prior information. An argument followed by a tussle ensued which caused political parties and hospital protests.         
	Senior doctors, who have come out in support of their juniors, wanted the chief minister Nitish Kumar to talk to the representatives of the 600 junior residents and give them a patient hearing, rather than issue warnings.        
	Over 500 seniors yesterday asked the government to resolve the crisis, which they term as Bal haath versus Raj haath (junior doctors recalcitrance versus governments stiff posturing).         
	Nitish Kumar had earlier had threatened the closure of the PMCH if the doctors did not mend their ways.         
	The convener of the doctors association, D.K. Sinha, told The Telegraph: I wonder why the government is not talking with the people involved. Our names were dragged into controversies four times in the past month. It is all a part of a well-planned strategy.         
	He demanded that the government study the video footages of all four incidents in which some faces (of complainants) are common. The association has demanded the withdrawal of the doctors suspension and reinstatement of PMCH principal R.K.P. Singh with immediate effect. The association would be meeting tomorrow after its 72-hour ultimatum expires to decide if senior doctors, too, would join the strike.

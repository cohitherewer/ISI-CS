          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 7: A court notice at the wrong address cannot be construed as an effective notice, the Supreme Court has said, especially if its known that the affected person has settled abroad for years.        
	A purported service by beat of drum or publication of a notice in a local newspaper which has no circulation in the United States of America cannot be said to be an effective service, a two-judge bench said.        
	The order came during a ruling on a civil appeal filed by NRI Rabindra Singh against a land decree passed against him ex-parte, a hearing held in the absence of or often without notice to one party.        
	A land revenue court had passed the partition decree against Singh, who has been living in Houston, Texas, for the past 25 years.        
	Although his brother knew his full and correct address, Singh was not served any notice at that address.        
	Instead, notices were served at his ancestral place at Kotheran, a village in Punjabs Nawanshahr district.        
	Since there was no response from his side, the land revenue authorities  the assistant collector in this case  decreed a partition suit against Singh without hearing him.        
	The decree was later upheld by the high court on the ground that Singhs attorney was aware of the partition proceedings.         
	The apex court, however, set aside the decree, saying Singh had not received effective notice of the partition proceedings.        
	The court said the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887, was enacted when agriculturists lived in villages, and the mode of summons such as beat of drums or any other customary method was relevant to that period. But such modes of service could not be said to be effective now.        
	With the development of science and technology, ongoing statutes cannot be construed in a way as to take society backwards and not forwards, it said.        
	No attempt had also been made in this case to serve the summons to Singhs attorney to enable him to defend his case, the court noted.        
	The court set aside the order, saying Singh had been denied an opportunity to challenge the allotment of land, which violated the principles of natural justice.        
	It referred the matter back to the land revenue authorities to decide the case afresh.

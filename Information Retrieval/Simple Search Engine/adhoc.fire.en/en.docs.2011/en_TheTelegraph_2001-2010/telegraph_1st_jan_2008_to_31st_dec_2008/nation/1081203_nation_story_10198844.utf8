          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Congress finds itself in knots over choosing a successor to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh after taking the moral high ground on accountability.         
	Deshmukh, who was summoned to Delhi today following his delay in resigning, called on party chief Sonia Gandhi and reiterated his offer to quit. His fall became imminent yesterday after NCP boss Sharad Pawar prevailed on colleague R.R. Patil to step down as deputy chief minister.         
	Daylong discussions between leaders of the Congress and the NCP today failed to throw up a consensus with most insisting that the next chief minister too would have to be a Maratha  kshatriyas in the caste hierarchy. Marathas have traditionally dominated state politics since the formation of Maharashtra in 1960.         
	A highly placed Congress source asserted that Deshmukh would have to go and that a successor would be found in the next two days, maybe even tomorrow. The process of consultation is on, was all that defence minister A.K. Antony, who looks after the Congresss affairs in Maharashtra, was willing to say.         
	A section of influential Congress functionaries perceived to be Deshmukhs patrons raised the issue of the coming Assembly polls in Maharashtra to drive home the point that a successor would have to be anointed after taking all things into consideration. They argued that the presence of a Maratha as chief minister would enhance the Congresss prospects.         
	Deshmukh, Patil and several state ministers are Marathas, a formation which has been demanding Other Backward Class status in the state. The Congress is toying with the idea of agreeing to the demand before the polls. Marathas make up 30-35 per cent of the states population.

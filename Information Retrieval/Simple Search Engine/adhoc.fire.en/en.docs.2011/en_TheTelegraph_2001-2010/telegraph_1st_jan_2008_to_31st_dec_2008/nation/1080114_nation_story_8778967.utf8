 - Marijuana worth rs 30 crore burnt
     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                  
	Cuttack, Jan. 13: The hilly terrain in and around the reserve forests adjoining Orissas Chandaka sanctuary seems to have emerged as a hub for marijuana.
    
	Though Banki sub-divisional administration, under Cuttack division, has conducted regular raids in the area, they have not been able to keep a constant vigil. 
    
	Its no wonder then that last weeks raids, conducted by a Special Operation Task Force of the states excise department, have proved handy  as a plantation spread over 120 acres and valued over Rs 30 crore was traced and destroyed.
    
	Nearly 5.5 lakh trees were burnt and the operation is still on, said S.C. Panigrahi, the deputy commissioner of excise, while talking to The Telegraph.
    
	Over 100-odd personnel, including officers from the intelligence wing, flying squad, district administration and excise, along with 50 workers participated in the operation in the presence of executive magistrates. 
    
	Panigrahi said the plants had grown over 5feet and were ready for harvest.
    
	Marijuana is found in stretches along Bhagapur, Hamara, Dulanapur, Pushpangi, Baghua and Talabasta  spread over a radius of 15km in the hills of Dompada reserve forests. The sowing begins with the rains. 
    
	 The problems of accessibility, identification of the plants in these remote areas and lack of mobility are the major problems in tackling the problem, said Bhimsen Pradhan, an excise inspector said after a Talabasta operation.
    
	On December 28, during raids conducted by excise officers, plantation spread over five acres was destroyed in Dompada reserve forest. 
    
	The spurt in marijuana cultivation within the reserve forest areas under Chandaka apparently enjoys the patronage of forest officers. Sources said the lure of quick buck also prompts villagers to start the trade.

	Jamling Tenzing Norgay, son of Tenzing Norgay, recalls the Edmund Hillary he knew. The Darjeeling-based Jamling, who has also climbed Everest, was in Kathmandu when he learnt of Hillarys death.
       
	I will always remember Hillary as a father figure to the Sherpa people. He will not only be remembered for his great achievements but also for his immense humanitarian efforts. He dedicated his life to improve the quality of life of the Sherpas. Nepal was his second home and he kept returning regularly to meet and interact with the Sherpa people.
    
	He was an exact replica of my father. Very simple, very humble, bereft of any ego.
    
	No two greater people could have conquered Everest first than my father and Hillary. They climbed Everest for passion, not for ego.
    
	Hillary gave back to the Sherpas and the Himalayas all that he earned in his lifetime.
    
	To me, his death is a great personal loss as he had been a part of my family for the last 50 years. I hope his life will be an inspiration for future generations. 
    
	The closeness of our families resulted in a great friendship between me and Hillarys son Peter. In fact, Peter and I collaborated on several expeditions and projects, including documentaries, for National Geographic and we also lecture all across the world.
    
	I hope both Peter and I will be able to fit into the shoes of our illustrious fathers. 
    
	I will always remember Hillary for his demeanour. His smiling face will be etched in my memory. He used to visit us at our home in Darjeeling every time he came to India. 
    
	The last time he spent a few days with us in Darjeeling was in 1999. My brother Norbu will represent the Tenzing family at Hillarys funeral in Auckland. May his soul rest in peace.
       
	Tashi Tenzing, grandson of Tenzing Norgay, speaks on the special friendship between the two legendary mountaineers. Based in Kathmandu, Tashi has summited Everest thrice. 
    
	Hillary was a big man with a big heart. In 1986, when my grandfather passed away in Darjeeling, he came all the way from New Zealand to bid goodbye to his dear friend. He used to meet my grandfather whenever he could and I had seen him from my childhood days.
    
	I started visiting him regularly when I went to Delhi to attend university. I was then 19 years old and he was New Zealands high commissioner to India. Even when I lived in Australia, I would often visit him in New Zealand.
    
	During an event in Australia, Hillary told the audience that Tenzing was a great man and both trusted their lives with each other. He also spoke of how my grandfather had rescued him from a crevice during their famous climb. 
    
	Even though they climbed Everest together, I think it did take some time for the friendship to become stronger. I think they became great friends when Tenzing visited New Zealand after the climb. 
    
	It is true that there was a controversy on who climbed Everest first. I never heard him talk on this subject. (Dorji Latoo, a relative of the Everest legend, told The Telegraph today that Tenzing always used to say dont ask such silly questions whenever the topic was broached). I guess there is no end to such controversies and as an Everester, I believe there should be no controversies. I do not think my family wants this controversy.
    
	After the successful ascent, both became high-profile personalities and I guess this controversy was as a result of everyone wanting to take a piece of the cake as my grandfather was simple and could not even sign. There have been people who wanted to prove that Tenzing was the first to climb.
    
	Hillary has achieved much. He has opened schools and hospitals for the Sherpas. I have seen many children passing out of Hillarys school and going on to become pilots and doctors. He has inspired thousands and thousands of people and I, too, would like to keep the legacy of these two climbers. His death is a very big loss for people like us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hearing on request for IIT names
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hearing on request for IIT names
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Central Information Commission has ordered a hearing with the IITs to decide if contact details of students, denied seats because of discrepancies in the 2006 admissions, can be disclosed.         
	The apex umpire on the under the Right to Information (RTI) panel has called the registrar and a former director of IIT Kharagpur  the organising institute for the 2006 joint entrance examination  to appear for the hearing on September 19 at 3pm, sources said.         
	The RTI Act prohibits the disclosure of personal details, especially of those who are not direct parties to a case  as the appellant or the respondent  without their consent.         
	But the father of an aggrieved student approached the commission to identify others who, too, may have suffered in 2006 because the IITs did not use the cut-off determination procedure they claimed to have implemented.         
	The Telegraph had reported, on August 6, 2007, the discrepancies between the cut-offs used by the IITs in 2006 and those arrived at using the formula the institutes claimed they used. As a result, 994 students who merited a chance to study in the IITs were denied seats.         
	The IITs disclosed marks of all students who appeared in the 2006 JEE. The appellant has requested contact details of the 994 students.

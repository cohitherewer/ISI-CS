  - Lady alleges pressure to withdraw complaint against constables before suicide          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Panchkula, June 9: A young woman who had accused two constables of raping her today killed herself by swallowing poison inside the office of a top Haryana police officer claiming she was being pressured to withdraw her complaint.         
	Sarita, 27, walked into the office of additional director-general (law and order) V.B. Singh around 11am alleging inaction against the two police personnel from Rohtak.         
	Rohtak is the home district of Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. His son, Deepender, is the Lok Sabha member from Rohtak.        
	The woman had claimed that head constable S.C. Balraj and constable Tilak Raj had raped her when she had gone to the police station in April after her husband was arrested on the charge of stealing a motorcycle.         
	Both constables have been suspended and a probe is on.         
	Police sources said Sarita came to Singhs office with a written complaint alleging that the suspended constables were pressuring her to withdraw the case.         
	She was narrating her complaint to the additional director-general when she said she had consumed a poisonous substance as the two policemen had been pressuring her to withdraw her charge of rape against them, a police officer said.        
	The poisonous substance, she said, was a sulphos tablet, a potent insecticide used by farmers. It has been used by many in Haryana to commit suicide.         
	Amid the din in Singhs office  there were around 20 people in the room  her claim wasnt taken seriously. She came out of the chamber, sat in the visitors waiting room and slumped in the chair. Realising that something indeed was wrong, the officials took Sarita to the civil hospital where her condition deteriorated. She was referred to Chandigarhs Post Graduate Institute of Medical Engineering and Research where she died in the evening.        
	Senior superintendent of police, Rohtak, Hanif Qureshi said the womans husband, Subhash, who is out on bail, did not accompany her to Panchkula. He is here, in Rohtak. He doesnt know who took her to Panchkula. Neither do we, he said.        
	Singh said the police had registered a case against the two policemen on May 31 and investigations were on. A probe has been ordered and the district police have been asked to explain why no action had been taken against the two, he said.        
	Qureshi said Sarita had submitted a statement on April 29 claiming that she had been raped.         
	A case was registered under Section 376 (rape). She initially named one criminal investigation agency constable and during investigations conducted by a deputy superintendent of police, identified another as having raped her. Investigations are on and the two accused have been placed under suspension, he said.        
	In her complaint to Singh, Sarita categorically mentioned that she was committing suicide as the two policemen had been trying to force her to withdraw her complaint and had also been humiliating her.

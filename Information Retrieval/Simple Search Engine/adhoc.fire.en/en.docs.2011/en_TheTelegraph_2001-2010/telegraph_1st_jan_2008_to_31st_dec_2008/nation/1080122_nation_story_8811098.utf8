	Jan. 21: Gang violence did not appear to be the motive behind the murder of Abhijit Mahato, a US university student who was killed on Friday night, police said.
 
	The 29-year-old IIT alumnus, studying for an engineering doctorate degree at Duke University in North Carolinas Durham, was found dead in his flat near the campus.
 
	Detectives and crime-scene technicians combed the spot on Saturday morning and found some clues, US media reports said. Durham police chief Jose Lopez has been quoted as saying the crime was not believed to be related to gang violence.
 
	Mahatos guardian in Durham, however, said the police were not revealing anything about the murder.
 
	Shyamal Majumdar said the autopsy was conducted this morning and Abhijits body would be handed over to his family shortly. 
 
	Abhijit was shot in the head, which led to his death. This has come out in the preliminary report of the autopsy that was done today, he said.
 
	Abhijits family is waiting for the body to be sent to his home in Gamharia, Jharkhand. 
 
	His father, Sitaram Mahato, faxed an authorisation letter to one of Abhijits friends to receive the body from Durham police. Anirban Dutta, who studies at Michigan University, flew to Durham after receiving the letter.
 
	Grandfather Dhananjay Mahato, a former Congress MLA, faxed another letter to the external affairs ministry, asking it to ensure the body reached Jamshedpur without any glitches. 
 
	We have only one thing on our mind, and that is how can the body be flown to India and eventually to Gamharia so that we can perform the last rites, Sitaram said .
 
	We have not been able to communicate with the police to learn about the motive. But we are more concerned about the body, which I hope will reach Gamharia soon. 
 
	Sources said Sitaram and Dhananjay would also approach Jharkhand deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto to urge him to take the initiative to ensure the early arrival of Abhijits body. 
 
	Senior Indian embassy officials are travelling to Duke University to meet the authorities and make arrangements for sending the body home.

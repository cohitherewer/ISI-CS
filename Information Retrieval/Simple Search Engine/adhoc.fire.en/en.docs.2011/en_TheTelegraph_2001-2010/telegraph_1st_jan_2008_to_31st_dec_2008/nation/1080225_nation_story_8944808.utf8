	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Bengal may struggle to put Nandigram behind it but the Centre is keen to flaunt a half-baked land compensation policy before the world.        
	Activists have panned the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, as a mockery of its objectives, but the government is preparing to showcase it at the United Nations Convention on Human Rights in Geneva in April.         
	The policy is being hailed as a landmark human rights intervention that aims to protect the interests of those whose land needs to be acquired.        
	If it is acknowledged and recognised, it will be a big boost for the government, a senior official said.         
	However, sources said some in the Centre were not in favour of sending the rehabilitation scheme, especially since it had been criticised by an expert body, the Asian Centre for Human Rights, as Indias failed national rehabilitation policy.               
	It has also not found favour with activists like Medha Patkar and Aruna Roy.        
	More important, the rehabilitation scheme, going hand-in-hand with the Land Acquisition Policy, 2007, is yet to be approved by Parliament, having only received cabinet clearance. The parliamentary panel on rural development is debating it.        
	Comments from the public on the policy have been invited, the last date for which is February 22.

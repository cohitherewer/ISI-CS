          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, May 7: In an enactment of the Bhagalpur blinding case of 1979-80, a mob thrashed a suspected criminal and poured acid into his eyes at a village in Purnea on the Bihar-Bengal border, 350km from here.         
	Confirming the incident, deputy inspector-general of Purnea range S.C. Singh told The Telegraph: Police have arrested all five persons involved in the case and we have registered a named FIR.         
	Residents of Radhapur under Banmankhi police station caught hold of Vinay Yadav alias Pappu Yadav (30) and poured acid in his eyes after beating him black and blue. Police added that the man probably suffered permanent eye damage.        
	The police said Vinay Yadav was involved in cases of murder and abduction.         
	He figured as an accused in a murder case in his (Radhapur) village earning the distrust of a section of villagers, police added.         
	But, nothing justifies todays act of vigilante justice. We have arrested the accused involved and will ensure that they are convicted by a court of law, the DIG remarked.         
	A police team rescued Vinay from the villagers and admitted him to a hospital.         
	Todays incident comes a day after a Dalit youth was beaten to death at Mallikpura village in north Bihars Vaishali that has turned out to be an epicentre of vigilante justice, after a mob lynched 10 members of a nomadic tribe in September last year.

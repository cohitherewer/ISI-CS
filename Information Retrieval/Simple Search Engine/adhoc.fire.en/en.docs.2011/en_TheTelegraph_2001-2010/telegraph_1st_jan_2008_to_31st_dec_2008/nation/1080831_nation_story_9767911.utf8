	Ghatshila/Jamshedpur, Aug. 30: A landmine blast, allegedly triggered by Maoists, killed 11 Jharkhand Armed Police personnel when they were returning from nearby villages in Ghatshila after searching for stolen motorbikes.        
	Police sources said Maoists belonging to the Bhelaipahari platoon was behind the attack that occurred around 1.30pm when two teams from Ghatshila police station were returning after the raids.        
	The first team of 22 jawans was travelling ahead while the other team was coming back on foot. They boarded their jeep to cross a mud road. The blast occurred soon after, killing all of them on the spot.        
	The victims included the sub-inspector in charge of Digha police picket, Ravikant Sinha, six jawans, three havildars and the driver.         
	Last week, the police stepped up the hunt for stolen motorcycles after alleged Maoists killed JMM leader Krishna Mahto in East Singhbhum and took away his bike. They believe Maoists are using stolen bikes to move around.

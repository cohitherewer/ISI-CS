          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 30: A court today denied bail to Rajesh Talwar in the murder of his daughter Aarushi and remanded him in judicial custody till June 6.        
	It fixed June 2 for the hearing of a police application for brain-mapping and narco-analysis tests on the dentist.        
	The Noida police today refrained from demanding an extension of Rajeshs police remand. The police have found neither the murder weapon nor the mobile phones of Aarushi and servant Hemraj, who was murdered with the girl on May 15 night.        
	Sources said it was futile to keep Rajesh in custody since he wasnt co-operating. The police told the court that the accused was wasting their time.        
	Earlier this morning, the police took the dentist, whose whereabouts were kept secret during his three-day police remand, to Hardwar to try and collect more evidence.        
	Rajesh and wife Nupur had gone to Hardwar a day after Aarushis murder to perform her last rites. Also present were Rajeshs brothers Dinesh and Ramesh, and friend Bharat Bhushan, who is a doctor.        
	Plainclothes policemen led Rajesh through the streets of the temple town while a posse of journalists followed them. Officers questioned Upendra Pancholi, the head priest of a temple who had supervised the last rites.        
	A National Commission for Women member, Nirmala Venkatesh, met Nupur today.        
	We spoke to her for 25 minutes alone at her home and she gave us the details about what happened on the fateful day. We will be providing her statement to the Noida police, Venkatesh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress prince to follow papas path
                                                                                                               Congress prince to follow papas path
          SUBRAT DAS                          Can he repeat the Gandhi effect                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 6: Congress, it seems, is trying to evoke the past by beginning Rahul Gandhis Discovery India tour from Kalahandi, once the face of poverty in the country.        
	Rahul is scheduled to start his tour from Sinapali in Kalahandi tomorrow.        
	Way back in 1985, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi had toured the same areas following reports of poverty, starvation deaths and the sale of a 14-year-old girl for Rs 40, enough to buy 3kg of rice and a sari.         
	Banitas sale to an older Bidyadhar Podh by her sister-in-law, Phanas Punji, had laid bare the state of Orissas hinterland. Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited the area extensively, said Bhakta Charan Das, the former Kalahandi MP.         
	During his visit, the hilly rivers were overflowing. He (Rajiv) crossed a river on an army boat and visited Khariar, Boden and Sinapali and saw the plight himself, recalled Das.         
	Soon after his visit, the Prime Ministers office and the Planning Commission directly monitored the development of Kalahandi.         
	A new scheme called ADAPT was launched and around Rs 2,000 crore was invested in irrigation in the drought-prone district, remembers Das, who was then a Janata Dal leader and was trying to highlight Kalahandi issues at national-level.         
	The Gandhi family put up a fight to highlight Kalahandis issues, believes Das.         
	Senior Congress leader J.B. Patnaik, who was the chief minister of Orissa at the time of Rajivs visit, said: There was a lot of developmental activities in Kalahandi after Rajivjis visit. Today, Kalahandi has bettered in terms of communication and irrigation. It has turned into a major rice producing region.         
	Now the attention is riveted on the junior Gandhi. He is the symbol of our party leadership and a youth leader. His visit will have an effect on the masses, believes J.B. Patnaik.         
	We are now fighting a new problem, a threat to environment and displacement. Rahulji will be addressing a save the forests rally at Bhawanipatna and would be visiting Ijurpa forest, interact with tribals and have lunch with them, said Bhakta Das, the former Kalahandi MP.         
	Kalahandi had turned into a granary due to Rajivjis effort. But now it is facing problems due to indiscriminate industrialisation and mining, said Das.         
	He has been spearheading protests against Vedanta alumina refinery and bauxite mining projects in the district.        
	Earlier, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had revealed that he came to know about the proposed visit of Rahul from newspapers. He had expressed hope that Rahul would have a better idea of the situation once he visited the areas himself.         
	But, he also stressed that the visit would have little effect on Orissas masses.

	Thiruvananthapuram, June 12: A father who preserved his dead sons body after the young man killed himself in lock-up is no more, but the law has caught up with those responsible for the illegal detention.        
	A magistrate on Tuesday sent two retired police officers to jail, 20 years after they illegally detained the 24-year-old, who couldnt bear the humiliation and committed suicide.        
	Thankappan had kept his son Gopis body in a specially built tank for more than 11 years as a mark of protest against the flawed investigation into the death.        
	Gopi had been summoned to the Cherthala police station (Alappuzha district) in connection with a theft. Though Thankappan, a coir worker, and others pleaded he was innocent, the police detained him for more than 24 hours, which went against the law because an accused cannot be kept in custody for more than 24 hours without being arrested and produced in court.        
	Unable to suffer the ignominy, Gopi committed suicide in the lock-up by piercing a tube light into his stomach.         
	Kerala police and the state crime branch, as well as the CBI, later, said it was a case of mere suicide. But Thankappan, who built a cement tank in front his hut and preserved his sons body in formalin, didnt give up.        
	He moved the high court, which ordered the state government to pay Rs 300,000 as relief and register a fresh case for illegal detention against the police officers.        
	Thankappan died in 2004, five years after he had demolished the tank and cremated the body.

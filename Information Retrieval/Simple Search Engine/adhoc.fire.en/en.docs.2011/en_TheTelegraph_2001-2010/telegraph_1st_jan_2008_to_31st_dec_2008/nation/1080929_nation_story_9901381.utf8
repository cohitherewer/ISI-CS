	Patna, Sept. 28 (UNI): Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee donated a months salary and Rs 25 lakh from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development Fund for flood relief operations in Bihar, said the national media co-in-charge Sanjay Mayukh in a release today.        
	Bihar experienced one of the worst floods following a breach in the Kosi embankment at Kusaha in Nepal on August 18. Madhya Pradesh director-general of police S.K. Raut today flagged off a truck loaded with essential relief material for the Bihar victims.         
	Besides sending the aid, the Chhattisgarh police also contributed Rs 1 crore to the Chief Ministers Relief Fund by donating the days salary. The lorry will head for Supaul via Patna, Raut told reporters in Raipur.         
	The truck was loaded with rice, pulses, wheat, oil, medicine, blankets and clothes. Organisations such as Nagar Suraksha Samiti and NGOs also contributed handsomely.

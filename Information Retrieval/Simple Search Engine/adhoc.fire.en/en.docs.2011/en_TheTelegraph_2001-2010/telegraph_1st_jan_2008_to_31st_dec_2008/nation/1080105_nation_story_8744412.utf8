          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Curfew was imposed in Phiringia town for the first time today evening, even as the government claimed that the situation had normalised in Khandhamal.         
	Night curfew continues in four other sensitive towns  Brahmanaigaon, Baliguda, Daringibadi and Phulbani  since December 25 clashes. Though home secretary T.K. Mishra and DGP G.C. Nanda confirmed imposition of night curfew in Phiringia, they said no fresh communal incident had taken place in the district during the past 24 hours.         
	They added that the Phiringia curfew was to make the people, who were living in fear, feel safe. However, senior officers of Khandhamal, conceded that fresh tension had erupted in five villages of Phiringia. Briefing the media about Khandhamal, chief secretary Ajit Tripathy said the situation would normalise fully within four to five days.         
	Presently all schools and colleges, except three in Brahmanigaon, Baliguda and Barakhama where relief camps had been set up, have opened for classes. Traffic has been normalised during day. Some 99 cases have been registered and 104 persons have been arrested so far (13 arrested during the past 24 hours), Tripathy said.         
	At the news meet, the DGP said the number of arrests were expected to rise as residents return home and register their cases. But, he added, some of the recent cases lodged were related more to rivalry rather than communal lines.         
	Twenty-one peace committees have been formed which have held 35 meetings (11 meetings during the past 24 hours). The process of formation of peace committees has now trickled down to gram panchayat level, said Tripathy.        
	While providing details of the damage, chief secretary said the clashes have claimed three lives, while 25 persons have been injured. As many as 657 houses in 58 villages of the district had been fully or partially damaged. Assessment of the loss of property is on and is expected to be over by the next four to five days.         
	The secretary added that 225 polythene sheets, 400 blankets, 6,025 garments, 700 saris and 1960 dhotis have been distributed among the riot-affected people and medical assistance has been sent to the health camps.

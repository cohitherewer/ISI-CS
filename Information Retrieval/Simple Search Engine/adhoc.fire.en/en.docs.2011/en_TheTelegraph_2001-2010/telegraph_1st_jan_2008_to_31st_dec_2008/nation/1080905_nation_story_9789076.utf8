          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 4: A day after Union home minister Shivraj Patil visited Kandhamal and appealed for peace, the situation turned volatile once more today in the strife-torn district.        
	A group of residents, all women, attacked a relief camp demanding aid, while its inmates were also staging a demonstration near the Tikabali block office seeking sufficient succour. The women complained that they, toom were rendered hungry like the refugees because of the curfew, which was preventing them from getting work.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, too, chaired a meeting at the secretariat to take stock of the situation. More relief will be sent to Kandhamal, said Naveen, adding that additional forces would be deputed to the district. However, talking to the reporters regarding the law and order situation he called the situation as normal and under control. An inspector-general would be deputed to Jeypore to assess the situation, said Naveen.         
	The situation at Jeypore town was normal with the curfew relaxed for 12 hours from 6am to 6pm. Traffic movement was normal and the shops were open.         
	A senior police officer said the women pelted stones at the camp and tried to set it ablaze. However, police foiled their attempts. Revenue divisional commissioner Satyabrata Sahu told The Telegraph that police resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse the mob. He conceded that some women were injured in it.        
	Later, the women blocked the Phulbani-Berhampur road near Tikabali bazaar demanding that the curfew be lift. The blockade was lifted following assurances from the project director of Kandhamal district rural development agency and the BDO to consider their demand. Relief camp residents also gheraoed revenue minister Manmohan Samal when he visited the camp. Slogans of minister, go back rendered the air.

	Jaipur, Aug. 10: At least five persons were feared dead and 135 devotees trapped in a Kota cave temple today after its stairs collapsed under a landslide.        
	Police said the incident occurred around 3.30pm at the 12th century temple, the Gepranath Mahadev Mandir, on the banks of the Chambal, 25km from Kota town.        
	Todays incident comes a week after the death of 150 pilgrims in a stampede sparked by landslide rumours at the hilltop Naina Devi temple in Himachal Pradesh.        
	The Kota landslide was triggered by rain that damaged the stairs going down into the cave and caused the railings to give way.        
	Kota superintendent of police Vishal Bansal said 33 women and 20 children were among the 135 devotees trapped.         
	The rocks outside were wet and slippery, so were the steps. Today being a Sunday, there was also a rush of the picnickers to the riverside spot.        
	Officials said two commandos of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary had slid down the cave to rescue those trapped. The army has also been called in. The shrine is at least 300 feet below the ground. Around 200 steps lead down to the Shiva idol.        
	One body had been brought out till late this evening. The rescue efforts were on. Two air force choppers have been called from Jodhpur.

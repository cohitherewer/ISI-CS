	Washington/Calcutta, Jan. 3: A Calcutta girl studying in a US university died hours after a rented mini-van bringing her and friends back from a New Year party in Chicago overturned on an icy road yesterday.
    
	Presidency College alumnus Sweety Mazumdar, 25, doing her PhD in geology at Ohios Bowling Green State University, was killed with fellow student Apsana Giri of Kathmandu, with whom she shared an apartment outside the campus.
    
	Five other students, including two from Bengal, suffered minor injuries as the vehicle overturned twice and landed on its roof on a slippery road amid strong winds in Indiana.
    
	Calcuttan Mridutpal Nag, 25, is doing his masters in applied statistics and Puran De, 22, of West Midnapores Bakhrabad his PhD in photochemicals.
    
	Rahul Mukherjee, 24, of Ranchi is a masters student of communications; Punes Nigel DSouza, 24, is pursuing a doctorate in biology and Mohammad Chowdhury, who was driving the van, is a 25-year-old physics student from Bangladesh. They were all treated at a nearby hospital.
    
	Except Chowdhury, all the other students were new to the US and had completed just about four months at the university.
    
	Both Sweety and biology student Apsana, 26, were thrown out of the vehicle when it hit the highways median before overturning. Police believe Sweety was thrown to the opposite side of the road where a passing vehicle may have ploughed into her. Apsana was pinned below the min-van and died on the spot. 
    
	Sweety was taken to a local hospital with the others and then transferred to a bigger facility, but she died at 5.25am (3.55pm Indian time), about five hours after the accident.
    
	At 2.45pm yesterday in Calcutta, Sweetys 14-year-old sister Pitty received a call from the Parkview Hospital in Indiana, which said Sweety had had a serious accident.
    
	The doctor who was going to operate on her spoke to us minutes before the surgery. He said Sweetys condition was critical. She had suffered excessive bleeding and serious leg injuries, Pitty said at the familys Kidderpore home tonight.
    
	At 5.45pm, the phone rang again to tell the Mazumdars that Sweety was dead.
    
	Sweety lived with father Pulin Mazumdar, a physician, mother Bijoli and Class VIII student Pitty at their 4/1 Nazir Lane home before leaving for Ohio last August.
    
	The family last spoke to her on January 1 when she called to wish everyone a happy new year.
    
	We all spoke to her. She seemed so happy. She had called us just before leaving for the excursion, Pitty said.
    
	The parents are in a state of shock. Pulin had had open-heart surgery last October.
    
	Sweetys Orkut profile says the girl with brown eyes, black hair and average build had a fondness for candlelight, dancing and intelligent people.
    
	Sweety had studied at St Thomas Girls School, graduated from Jogamaya Devi College and done her masters in geology from Presidency.
    
	She was a general science graduate but secured a first class in her masters and scored well in her GRE, one of her teachers at Presidency, Prabir Dasgupta, said.
    
	The family is surfing the internet for updates about the accident. The US university has promised to make arrangements to send the body back as soon as possible.
    
	The Assistant America Insurance is co-ordinating the matter from the US. We have also appealed to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee for help, said Ashok Bhattacharya, a cousin of Sweety.
    
	I have exams when school reopens. I dont know how Ill sit for them, but my sister used to tell me she wanted me to do well in life. I have to live up to her dreams, Pitty said.
    
	The university has sent a bus to bring the injured to the campus, where they will be temporarily housed although they live in apartments outside the campus.
    
	The state-assisted university, which charges every foreign undergraduate student $23,546 (Rs 9.3 lakh) a year towards fees, room and meals, has 20,684 students.
    
	Of them, 687 are foreigners. A large number are Bengalis from Bengal, the rest of eastern India or Bangladesh.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The BJPs chances of returning to power at the Centre might hinge on whether it can retain Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in this months polls.        
	Many leaders fear a poor performance in the Assembly elections will throw the party into a political abyss.        
	The niggling worries have emerged after the victories in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh last year and Karnataka this summer gave the party confidence to believe it was a frontrunner in the race for Delhi.        
	Most senior leaders feel the party is comfortable in Congress-ruled Delhi but its governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are precariously placed.        
	Internal assessments and professional pre-poll surveys have not given the leaders any encouraging feedback. Despite such worrying signals, the leaders expect the party to keep at least one of the three states.        
	Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh hold the key to the partys Lok Sabha prospects: the party now holds 56 of the 65 lower House seats from these states. In percentage terms, the tally is over 86 per cent, a feat leaders concede will be difficult to repeat in the next general election.        
	The problem is that the party hasnt added new areas of support in the past five years, relying heavily on traditional strongholds to generate gains in the future.         
	Some sections of the BJP fear a loss of 20 Lok Sabha seats (from the last time) from these states if the party fails to retain any of the three in the Assembly elections.        
	In the 2003 Assembly polls, the BJP had left the Congress far behind in vote percentage in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.         
	While the BJP polled 42.5 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress got 31.61 per cent. The difference was big in the number of seats won, too: BJP 173, Congress 38.        
	But the impressive numbers belie two factors  a powerful anti-incumbency wave against the Congress government and one in favour of Uma Bharti.         
	This time, anti-incumbency is haunting the BJP. Uma has become its bitter enemy, one who can almost nullify the BSP factor which primarily harms the Congress.        
	In Rajasthan last time, the BJP had won 120 seats, or 39.2 per cent of the votes, against the Congresss 56 seats, or 35.65 per cent of the votes. This time, however, many senior leaders and much of the RSS machinery are opposed to the leadership of chief minister Vasundhara Raje.         
	BJP insiders are worried the differences could harm their prospects, though the Congress, too, has failed to show a united house by not projecting a leader so far.        
	In Chhattisgarh, the Congress has traditionally been strong, with a leader like Ajit Jogi. Also, the difference in vote shares last time was only two percentage points. Anti-incumbency against the BJP regime under Raman Singh could close the gap this time.

	New Delhi, Aug. 10 (PTI): The home ministry is likely to advise the telecom department to direct all mobile phone operators to get two old customers as guarantors before issuing a SIM card to check use of cellphones in terror activities.        
	We want a mechanism where a common person can get a SIM card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met, said Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta.        
	The ministry discussed the issue with top civil and police officials of states at a meeting convened on Friday in the wake of the back-to-back serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad.        
	Mobile phones were used to trigger improvised explosive devices at the Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad in May 2007 as well as for passing messages to their handlers in Pakistan and Bangladesh, sources said.        
	Gupta said his ministry intended to have a focused discussion with the telecom department on SIM cards.         
	Various problems (on SIM cards) have been identified. We want to deal with them, he said.        
	The home ministry is likely to suggest that the department come out with a guideline that makes it mandatory for SIM card vendors to take instant photographs of new customers, sources said.         
	At Fridays meeting, the state officials also favoured strict guidelines for new cellphone connections.        
	The home ministry had earlier discussed with the telecommunication department the issue of developing a mechanism through which SIM cards could be issued without any kind of mismatch.        
	Gupta also cited a case where one person had been issued 50 SIM cards in three months.        
	There are also issues of pre-verification, post-verification and identification of a person when he goes to buy a SIM card, the home secretary said.

	Puzzle for varsity: single-pupil class    
	Some Osmania University classes have turned into regular ghost sessions  three teachers for a single student.    
	So low is the interest in the universitys Tamil postgraduate course that the professors, who only have one pupil to look forward to in class, have begun fearing for their jobs. Entrance tests to the course, which began recently, were scrapped since 19 of the 20 seats went abegging.    
	The poor response has also hit other subjects, such as Kannada, Persian and Marathi but the authorities have calmed layoff fears by insisting that there are no plans to abolish these courses. Only nine applied for the 35 seats in Kannada and 15 for the 50 seats in Persian.    
	We have been offering these courses over the past several years. Although the response is discouraging, we will not cancel them, said vice-chancellor Tirupathi Rao.    
	Some teachers suggested a syllabi tweak, in ways that make the courses more job-oriented, to draw more students. I have suggested a change in the content to attract more students, said P. Vellangiri who teaches Tamil.        
	Click-happy police stations    
	In four years, officers in one Tamil Nadu police station will click their way to the records of criminals in others.    
	More than 1,400 police stations in the state have broadband connections but the plan to put them on an information technology platform is part of a larger Rs 2,000-crore scheme to network such places across the country.    
	State police chief K.P. Jain said the job, to be completed in around four years, will require special software. The network developers havent been chosen but the department said it would enlist reputable companies.    
	The plan comes within months of an initiative, possibly a first in the country, to computerise prison records and ensure that fingerprinting of inmates and other methods of identification arent needed in several cases. (PTI)    
	On tap: school for water pros    
	In the pipeline: an institute to train people in dissolving water woes.    
	Plans have been firmed up to set up the National Water and Sanitation Institute in Ghaziabad, part of the national capital region where water problems arent exactly rare.    
	The institute will come up on a 14-acre plot, with French assistance, at an estimated cost of Rs 26 crore, a senior official in the Union urban development ministry said.    
	The initiative is aimed at meeting the shortage of skilled manpower in the areas of water supply and sanitation.    
	Postgraduate courses in public health and environmental engineering are now offered in 11 universities and institutes across the country but they havent produced enough water experts. They churn out 1,500 skilled hands every year against a requirement that is estimated to be more than 20,000.    
	We need a centre that imparts training in new technologies and regulations, the official said.     
	Water policies and their effects on government finances would also be evaluated at the institute.        
	Tech turn    
	The mouse could chew away all the paper at the MCD.    
	The civic body has set itself on a course that will end in complete computerisation for greater transparency and efficiency. An IT company will soon study the processes and suggest ways to bring about the transformation, which is expected to cost around Rs 80 lakh.    
	The MCD portal will be made more user-friendly, standing committee chairman Vijender Gupta said recently. Proposals will be ready by August. (UNI)

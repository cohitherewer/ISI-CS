          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Forty per cent of Delhis professionals are eager to vote, a survey by industry chamber Assocham has found.        
	Voter turnout in largely urban Delhi has slipped from 65 per cent in 1993 to 47 per cent in 2003, and would be even lower if it were not for the capitals many slums. Only 43 per cent had queued up in last years municipal polls.        
	But if the Assocham survey, covering 2,000 professionals and 2,500 other private and public sector employees, is anything to go by, the apathy appears to be wearing off.         
	The survey, conducted over two weeks, found that 70 per cent  1,750 out of 2,500  of non-professionals were waiting to cast their vote on November 29.         
	The 2,000 professionals surveyed by the Assocham Social Development Foundation included chartered accountants, cost accountants, company secretaries, doctors and management consultants. Of them, 800 said they would vote.        
	Not all might turn up at the polling booth of course, even if they want to, given that 20,000 weddings are lined up in Delhi on election day.         
	Assocham said the credit for politicising the professionals goes to the awareness campaigns seeking voter participation.         
	The survey reported that professionals who would earlier stay home on polling day because they did not think one vote made a difference now feel they can help bring in good governance and discourage corruption.         
	However, the majority of professionals surveyed  60 per cent  will still not vote because they dont believe elections will change anything.         
	They complained about the absence of role models in politics, Delhis poor infrastructure, shortage of office space in the capital, lack of job prospects and an action plan for sustained economic development. But they did not think voting would solve any of these problems.        
	The 30 per cent among the non-professionals who said they would not vote belonged to the middle and upper middle class.         
	They cribbed that Delhi has lost its pace of development in infrastructure and job prospects in comparison with Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad that are also part of the national capital region.         
	Security is also a serious concern. But again, they did not think voting would help.        
	The 70 per cent who said they would vote had a message for those who plan to abstain: Instead of simply blaming the system, we should exercise our right to choose the right leaders.        
	Enthused by the survey results, Assocham has decided to write to its members all over India to participate in elections and use their votes to transform Indias future.

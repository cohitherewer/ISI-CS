          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia at a ceremony in Delhi marking the UPAs four years in office on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: As the Left restated its opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Congress decided its roadmap would hinge on the outcome of the Karnataka elections.         
	Nobody in the party reacted. Everything after Sunday, when the results are out, a general secretary said.        
	Sources, however, said a win did not necessarily mean the government would go ahead with the deal disregarding the Lefts objections.         
	A decision on how far the government will go with the treaty cannot be taken in isolation. A political call is required because any decision will impact the fate of the government. We have to decide if we are ready to take the plunge and go for an election by the end of this year or have it in 2009 as per schedule, a Congress functionary said.        
	N. Gopalaswami, the chief election commissioner, said the panel would be ready to hold polls any time after August 2008 once the electoral map is redrawn in accordance with the Delimitation Commissions recommendations and the rolls are ready.        
	Congress sources said while they understood and appreciated how keen the government was to go ahead with the remaining steps to operationalise the deal, the party would have to keep the big picture in mind.         
	The aspects of this big picture remain unchanged from August last year, the functionary said.         
	The Congress was then in a quandary after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dared the Left to withdraw support if it had problems with the deal. Ultimately, Sonia Gandhi and her advisers concluded it was not worth forfeiting the government over a single issue and one that was unlikely to pay off in an election.        
	Sources said while a Karnataka victory would galvanise party workers who had gone into a shell after a string of defeats, it was probably not enough to take a big gamble.         
	We have a long way to go before strengthening the party in all the states, a source said.         
	The other factors that weighed with the Congress were its allies readiness to support an early election and the need to sew up more alliances, especially in Uttar Pradesh.

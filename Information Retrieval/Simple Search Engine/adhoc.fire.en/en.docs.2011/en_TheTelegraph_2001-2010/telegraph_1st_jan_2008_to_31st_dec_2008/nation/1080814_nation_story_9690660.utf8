          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Supreme Court will decide on the legality of parties doling out pre-poll freebies, such as TV sets, to voters at state expense.        
	Chennai resident S. Subramaniam Balaji filed a public interest petition contending that the free TVs were part of populist measures that did not improve peoples lives.         
	The court today issued notices to the Tamil Nadu government, the Election Commission and the DMK, whose government has given voters TVs worth Rs 2,500 crore after promising them in its manifesto for the 2006 Assembly polls.         
	Madras High Court had refused to admit the plea earlier. Balajis hopes were nearly dashed today when the apex court seemed initially reluctant to accept his petition.        
	The court relented after his lawyer Arvind Dattar convinced the judges that the TVs were a case of misplaced philanthropy.        
	TV is an educational tool. Now villagers can at least watch TV for the purpose of educating themselves, the bench said while expressing its initial reluctance.

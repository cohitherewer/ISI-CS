	New Delhi, July 24: The BJP today refused to rein in party workers who have been attacking homes of rebel MPs, and asked the victims to seek protection from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.         
	These MPs should either take shelter in police stations or 7 Race Course and 10 Janpath. It is the duty of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to protect them, BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudi told reporters when asked about the attacks on the MPs.         
	BJP activists today went on a rampage at the residence of expelled party MP Chandrabhan Singh who had defied the whip and abstained from the trust vote. About 100 people stormed into the North Avenue residence of the Lok Sabha member from Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, around 11am when Singh was in the house.         
	Shouting slogans in praise of BJP chief Rajnath Singh and the partys prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, the activists broke windowpanes and flowerpots, besides barging into the drawing room of the MPs official residence. The police intervened in time to prevent further damage. Nobody was injured.         
	Some other MPs who had voted in favour of the government or abstained faced the partys wrath yesterday.         
	Peoples anger can be understood. These MPs got elected with the support of party workers. They are now feeling betrayed. The MPs have committed lok droh (betrayal of people). The workers anger can manifest itself in any manner, the BJP spokesperson said at the party headquarters in Delhi today.        
	Asked if the BJP was justifying the attacks, Rudy said: The BJP is against any form of violence. But the workers are angry because they are feeling betrayed.         
	He abruptly ended the news conference to avoid further questions.         
	The first call for a conscience vote on the trust motion had, however, come from RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan. The BJP, too, benefited from turncoats and Congress MP Kuldip Bishnoi was present at L.K. Advanis dinner.

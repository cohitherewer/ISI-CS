          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 26: Every time police in Kandhamal district come across felled trees and large boulders blocking the roads, they know that fresh violence is in store.        
	District collector Krishan Kumar and superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, not able to clear off the roads, have been making an aerial survey of the situation in the strife-torn district by a helicopter to monitor if these road blockades were being used for further attacks.         
	Patrolling and troupe movement of police forces in the hilly terrain of the district is getting more difficult even as the state government deployed seven companies of additional central paramilitary force today. The new troupe would join the 3,000-odd central force already camping in the region. The state had yesterday sought 10 additional companies of paramilitary forces from the centre to curb the communal violence.        
	Chief minister Naveen Pattnaik is scheduled to visit Kandhamal tomorrow to take stock of the situation.        
	Prohibitory orders are still in force in the district and night curfew is imposed in most towns. The felling of trees and blocking the roads with boulders are a major hindrance in the operation, Kumar said, adding that the situation was tense but under control.        
	The decision to intensify the police arrangements came after two persons had been killed in rural Kandhamal last night The deceased, identified as Raghab Digal, was killed and several injured following a violent clash between two groups at Sisa Panga near the highly sensitive Raikia town. Another person named Amin Pradhan was hacked to death in Saliguda for not supporting the agitators. Violence was reported from Raikia, Tikabali and G. Udaygiri areas, too.        
	Meanwhile, the felling of trees continued at areas, including the Berhampur-Phulbani, Berhampur-Baliguda, Raikia-G. Udaygiri and Raikia-Papuria roads. The absence of the Orissa Disaster Rapid Action Force team has added to the woes. The force that had earlier been helping in clearing the road blockades in Kandhamnal district was diverted to flood-hit areas.         
	The felling of trees has been massive after the police firing on a mob at Raikia on Tuesday which killed a tribal. The deceased, B. Pradhan, along with 32 others clashed with the police protesting against the arrest of some tribals in connection with the communal riots. After the death of Pradhan, the tribals appear to be up in arms against the police.

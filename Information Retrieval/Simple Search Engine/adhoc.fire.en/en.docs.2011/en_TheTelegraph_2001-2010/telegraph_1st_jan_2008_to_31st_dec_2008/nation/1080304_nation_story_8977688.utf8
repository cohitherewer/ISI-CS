	Sheikhpora (Budgam), March 3: Rita Devi has at last got a home away from home.
    
	The young mother of three couldnt hold back her tears, though. But they were tears of happiness. After all these years, she could now look forward to some kind of a future for her kids.
    
	She isnt the only one who is dreaming.
    
	Several other displaced families have got a new home at the first exclusive Kashmiri Pandit colony in the Valley.
    
	For Rita, it has been a double bonus. Her home is barely miles from her Kathwari village where she spent the best years of her life.
    
	There was perfect harmony in my village and we didnt leave after militancy broke out. Even when some Pandits were killed in a nearby village in 1998, we never thought of leaving the Valley but shifted to Budgam, Rita said, breaking into tears at the sight of her new home. It is not far away from my village and I can meet my Muslim neighbours who, in my absence, took care of our property.
    
	Ritas family, along with 31 others, had taken refuge in migrant homes in Budgam after eight Pandits were killed by militants in 1998 at Sangrampora in the district.
    
	These internally displaced families continued to live in the Valley even after thousands of Pandits had migrated to Jammu and other parts of the country.
    
	Today, they shifted to Sheikhpora, their new home.
    
	Work on the 206-apartment colony had started in 2003 to resettle the migrant Pandits in safe zones. But as many Pandit families were still scared to return, the government decided to kick-start the process by settling the internally displaced people first, or those who hadnt left the Valley.
    
	We want to send a message to Kashmiri Pandit migrants that they are safe here and that this is the time for them to return, said Budgam district commissioner Farooq Renzu. 
    
	Over 50,000 families, including some Muslim families, had left the Valley after militancy broke out in the late eighties.
    
	Renzu said the government had received a lot of applications from Pandits looking to return. The flats are spacious and each should cost no less than Rs 20 lakh. They will have all facilities here. Plus, there is enough security and the place is close to Srinagar, he said.
    
	Several Pandit groups, however, said they wouldnt return unless they got an economic package and jobs for their children.
    
	Groups like Panun Kashmir, on the other hand, want nothing less than a homeland.
    
	Several hardline separatists, including Syed Ali Shah Geelani, have, off late, supported the return of Pandits, which is expected to convince many sceptics. 
    
	Kiran Devi, a housewife, feels it should. We feel safe here and so should the others. We have been living in Budgam for the past 10 years, where four to five families were huddled in one house. But we have a lot of space here, Kiran, who also got a new flat, said.
    
	The state government has also built a temple for the Pandits and there is plenty of space for the children to play cricket and other games. 
    
	The government has recently started work on a Rs 221-crore colony in Jagti, Jammu.

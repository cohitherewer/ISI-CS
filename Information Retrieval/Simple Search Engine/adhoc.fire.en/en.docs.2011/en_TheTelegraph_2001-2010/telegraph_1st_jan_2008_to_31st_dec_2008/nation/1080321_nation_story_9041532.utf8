	Patna, March 20: Patna High Court today admitted Bihar governments appeal challenging the acquittal of Union railway minister Lalu Prasad and former chief minister Rabri Devi by a Patna CBI court in the disproportionate assets case.        
	The court of Justice R.K. Dutta admitted the state governments appeal for hearing and sought documents from the special CBI court that had acquitted the couple in December 2006. The high court had reserved its order on the matter on February 18 after conclusion of arguments.        
	The state government had moved the high court on February 19 last year against the acquittal of former chief ministers in the disproportionate assets case by CBI judge Muni Lal Paswan on December 18, 2006.        
	Lalu was accused of amassing assets over Rs 46 lakh beyond his known sources of income during his tenure as Bihar chief minister between 1990 and 1996. His wife Rabri was made a co-accused in the case for abetting the offence.        
	Government counsel Surendra Singh, a senior Supreme Court lawyer, argued before the high court on February 24 this year that the CBI had erred in calculating the household expenses of Lalu and his wife and so the duos acquittal by the special CBI court stood challenged.        
	Senior criminal lawyer Ram Jethmalani pleaded the former chief ministers case contesting the Bihar governments competence to challenge the acquittal.         
	Jethmalani had gone on to even call it a political vendetta by the NDA government in the state.        
	Jethmalani had said even the informant in the case, CBI deputy superintendent of police R.K. Kharagwal, on whose statement the FIR was registered on August 18,1998, had questioned in the court why his name figured in the investigation.        
	The government counsel, however, had countered Jethmalanis plea saying the informant had submitted a confidential report to the then CBI SP, V.S. Kaumudi, that paved way for registration of the FIR.        
	Earlier, counsels for the CBI and Lalu-Rabri had argued the matter in the apex court during the hearing of the special leave petition filed by the duo.        
	The former chief ministers counsel argued that the CBI, that probed the fodder scam cases, or the Union government was alone competent to challenge the acquittal, not the Bihar government.        
	The Supreme Court, however, had not given any relief to the couple saying it could hear the SLP only after the state governments appeal was admitted.

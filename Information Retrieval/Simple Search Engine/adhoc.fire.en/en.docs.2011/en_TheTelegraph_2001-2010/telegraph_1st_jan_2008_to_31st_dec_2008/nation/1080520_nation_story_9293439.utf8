          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, May 19: The perfect alibi  of being dead  fell apart for a murder suspect because he had unmindfully switched his mobile on.        
	Domestic help Nikku was arrested today for the murder of his employer, Anuradha Sandhu, a day after he had appeared to turn up dead 50km away in Ropar, head and face smashed beyond recognition.        
	Anuradhas husband, a property dealer, was arrested late in the evening after Nikku told police that Baljinder Sandhu had paid him a huge sum to kill his 34-year-old wife, an officer said. He said the body found in Ropar was that of Sunil, a servant from the neighbourhood whom Nikku had taken on a motorbike ride, killed and dumped.        
	Baljinder had found himself a solid alibi, too: he was at a discotheque when the crime took place on Saturday night. When he returned home around 1am on Sunday, Anuradha, a mother of two children aged 8 and 11, was lying in bed with her throat slit.        
	Suspicion fell immediately on Nikku, the handsomely paid cook who also helped Anuradha with her boutique, and who was missing with his motorcycle.        
	But the young man in his early 20s was quickly cleared when Ropar police found the bike and a body (Sunils) with Nikkus PAN card and mobile phone. The small matter of the mangled face hardly bothered the sleuths.        
	Besides, the incident came two days after Noida police were caught with egg all over their face when a missing servant they had confidently accused of killing a schoolgirl turned up murdered.        
	But Nikku made a fatal mistake: he switched on one of his two other mobiles as he partied with the cash Baljinder had allegedly given him. The police, who knew all his phone numbers, traced him to Nalagarh in Himachal Pradesh.        
	Nikku had taken a friend, Ashok, along with him when he left for Ropar with Sunil after killing Anuradha, officers said. In Nalagarh, the duo went on a shopping spree. Ashok has been arrested, too.        
	The police suspect that Nikku had laced Anuradhas food with poison and later slit her throat, and Ashok had helped by holding her head.        
	The knife has been seized from the duo along with Rs 1.97 lakh in cash, some jewellery and $1,788.        
	Nikku and Ashok have been remanded in police custody for four days. Baljinder will be produced in court tomorrow.

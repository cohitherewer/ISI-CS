          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 1: Farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait today dared chief minister Mayavati to dump him in jail if she could as he sat ringed by police and guarded by supporters on his home turf,        
	The 73-year-old leader of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) has been under siege from security forces in his village Sisauli since Sunday night after Mayavati ordered his arrest for a caste slur made at a televised rally.         
	Clashes broke out after the police reached Sisauli, where they were greeted by stone-pelting farmers who had formed a human fence around their firebrand leader. The securitymen retaliated by firing teargas shells and rubber bullets. At least 24 people were injured.        
	I am sitting in my village and daring the police to come and arrest me, if they can, Tikait said this morning in the village in Muzaffarnagar, 400km from Lucknow.        
	It is not that I am not asking my workers to maintain peace. I have asked them to stay back. I will go out when the tension subsides and court arrest. The issue will be settled. But if the state administration does not listen, what can I do? Tikait asked.         
	By daring Mayavati to arrest him, Tikait is trying to resurrect the old Jat-Jatav enmity in western Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Mayavati is a Dalit from the Jatav caste group and has an invincible support base. Tikait is an icon for Jat caste farmers of the region, but has of late been struggling to keep the BKU intact. The Jats in western Uttar Pradesh are split between the Rashtriya Lok Dal, BKU and the BJP.        
	Administration sources said the government had instructed the Muzaffarnagar police to avoid any confrontation with Tikaits supporters. BSP insiders said Mayavati was aware of the impact Tikaits arrest could have on Jat voters. She would not obviously let an old lion like Tikait regain his past strength, said a BSP leader.        
	What had also unnerved the chief minister was Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs public support for Tikait. Mayavatis bete noire has threatened to hit the streets if Tikait is arrested.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The government passed bills one after another, like children rattle nursery rhymes, even as some MPs shouted slogans and others trooped to the well before the session of Parliament concluded today.        
	NDA members were in the well of the Lok Sabha protesting against A.R. Antulay; RJD members were shouting Sangh parivar murdabad and Left MPs, furious that the government was using the commotion to rush through bills, were tearing up papers which they then threw in front of the Speakers chair.         
	All the while, Congress members thumped desks as legislative business was being wrapped up. The Lok Sabha passed three bills within minutes.         
	One of them was the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, aimed at protecting intellectual property rights of farm products such as basmati rice.        
	The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill grants special judges dealing with corruption cases the power to attach properties illegally acquired by holders of public office. Under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, a fund will be set up for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes.        
	Three bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, too: the Appropriation (Railways) Bill, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill, and the Information Technology Bill.

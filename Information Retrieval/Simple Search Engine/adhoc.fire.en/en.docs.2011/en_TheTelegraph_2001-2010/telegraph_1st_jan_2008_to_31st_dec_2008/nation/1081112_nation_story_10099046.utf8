          AMIT ROY                               
	London, Nov. 11: Britain yesterday followed the outgoing American administration of George W. Bush by lifting the ban on export of sensitive nuclear technology to India but the prohibition order remains in force for any material it thinks could be diverted for making weapons.         
	Bill Rammell, a minister of state at the foreign office, informed the House of Commons last night: In line with our Nuclear Suppliers Group commitments, we will continue to refuse applications in respect of all items on the NSG trigger list and NSG dual-use list when they are destined for unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities, or when there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to such activities.         
	The reality is that the government wants a much closer relationship between the UK and Indian power generation sectors.         
	Before Tony Blair stepped down as Prime Minister, his government had taken the decision that Britains electricity needs of the future  as is also the case in India  could only be met by commissioning more nuclear reactors, especially as some of the older ones were nearing the end of their useful lives.         
	All coal mines in Britain (which inspired the classic movie, How Green Was My Valley) have long since shut. With the government wanting to take an international lead on green issues, building new coal fired stations is no longer an option.         
	Making a statement on the nuclear trade policy towards India, Rammell said the UK government had reviewed its policy towards nuclear-related exports to India.         
	The new policy would take effect immediately.         
	The ban on Pakistan remained despite heavy lobbying by Pakistanis that they should have parity with the Indians. Licensing policy towards Pakistan remains unchanged, Rammell said.         
	He said: Since March 2002, UK policy has been to refuse all licence applications for trigger list items to India. That policy has changed and we will now consider on a case-by-case basis licence applications for peaceful use of all items on the NSG trigger list and NSG dual-use list when they are destined for IAEA-safeguarded civil nuclear facilities in India.         
	He went on: We will continue to consider case by case all applications to export other items assessed as licensable, including those assessed as licensable under the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) end-use control.        
	Particular account would be taken of the risk of use in, or diversion to, unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities, or acts of nuclear terrorism; the risk of possible onward transfer of these items to other states for proliferation purposes, including the recipient states export control performance; and the potential utility of the items concerned for, and contribution that they would make to, such activities.         
	Rammell also pledged: We will continue to consider applications for exports that will contribute to the physical protection or security of military nuclear facilities or assets in India. Licences may be issued in exceptional cases, consistent with our obligations and commitments.         
	He explained the imperative to do more business for an economy in deep trouble: We will continue to encourage contacts between UK nuclear scientists, academics and those working in or with the UK nuclear industry with their Indian counterparts.         
	The US, for example, is licking its lips at the prospect of nuclear trade worth billions.         
	The exceptions, according to Rammell, would be where we consider that such contacts might be of assistance to the weapons-related aspects of its nuclear programme. Where such contacts involve the transfer of technology which require export licences we will continue to consider applications for such licences on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the provisions of UK export control legislation.         
	Both the Labour and Tory governments of the past decades have agreed that Britain should have nuclear weapons  but not India.

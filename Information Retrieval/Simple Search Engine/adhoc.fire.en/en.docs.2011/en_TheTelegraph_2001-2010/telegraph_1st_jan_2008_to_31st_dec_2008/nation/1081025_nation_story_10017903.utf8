	Patna, Oct. 24: The father of the railway job seeker allegedly killed by a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena mob in Mumbai filed a murder case against Raj Thackeray in a Bihar court today.        
	The petition sought criminal proceedings against Raj and three unnamed henchmen for murder and conspiracy in the court of the Bihar Sharief chief judicial magistrate (CJM), A.L. Shrivastava.        
	Bihar Sharief, 110km from Patna, is the headquarters of Nalanda, the home district of Pawan Mahto, 25, who was allegedly beaten up and thrown on the tracks at Andheri station on Sunday on his way to a railway recruitment exam centre.        
	Mumbai railway police say Pawan accidentally fell on the tracks while trying to catch a running train, but the dead youths relatives in Mumbai and fellow candidates accompanying him have challenged the version.        
	The petition by Pawans father Jagdish Prasad, a poor farmer, names three witnesses. He claims two of them had accompanied Pawan to Mumbai and saw MNS activists launch a brutal assault on him. and other candidates from Bihar. The third is an acquaintance who received the body from Mumbai police. The court will hear the petition on November 8.         
	Asked what a Bihar court could do about an incident that occurred in another state, Dinesh Kumar Singh, a Patna High Court lawyer, said: The CJM is empowered to take cognizance of the case and refer it to the police under his jurisdiction for investigation.        
	The MNS chief faces at least two other cases in Bihar. An advocate, Sudhir Kumar Ojha, has filed a murder and sedition case against him in Muzaffarpur. A railway exam candidate, Raj Kumar Chaudhary, has lodged an FIR in Vaishali accusing Raj of inciting a Mumbai mob that attacked him and broke his hand.        
	Besides, a non-bailable arrest warrant issued against Raj by a magistrates court in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, over his anti-migrant remarks in February has reached Mumbai police. The warrant, which asks the police to produce the MNS chief before the Jamshedpur court on November 17, and is yet to be served on Raj.

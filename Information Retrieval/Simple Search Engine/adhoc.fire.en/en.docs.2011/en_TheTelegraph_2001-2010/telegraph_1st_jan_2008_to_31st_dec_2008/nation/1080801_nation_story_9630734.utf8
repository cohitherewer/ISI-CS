          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI       
	New Delhi, July 31: The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights is considering assisting the prosecution of two Britons accused of paedophilia in Mumbai, and has asked the Centre to ensure they do not leave India.        
	Indias apex child rights panel has asked the foreign and home ministries to examine if the two accused can be legally stopped from leaving the country, commission sources said.         
	Duncan Grant and Allan Waters have been acquitted by Bombay High Court of charges of sodomising young boys at Mumbais Anchorage Shelter Home, run by Grant. They have been released from Nagpur Central Jail, where they had been imprisoned since 2006 after a trial court convicted them.        
	But within hours of their acquittal, Childline India, an NGO that works closely with the ministry of social justice and empowerment, appealed the verdict at the Supreme Court. The commission is worried that once the accused leave the country, they may be hard to track in future, even for apex court hearings.         
	Governments often have to resort to extradition treaties in such cases, and the accused can apply to a court in their country for exemption.        
	Grant set up Anchorage in Colaba in 1955, initially with 25 street children. Childline says Waters frequently visited the shelter. Foreign visitors were allowed to take the children out as guides to the city.

          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                          Who will be the boss?                                  
	Cuttack, July 17: This years Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) polls, to be held next month, promises not be an all Congress affair.         
	Congresss dominance in the OCA polls has continued unchallenged for more than a decade, as elections have been fought between rival Congress leaders rather than anybody from outside the party.         
	This time, persons outside the Congress, especially from the BJD, are expected to throw their hats into the ring for the OCA presidents post.        
	Speculation is rife that either BJD Rajya Sabha MP Pyari Mohan Mohapatra or BJD MLA and former sports minister Ranendra Pratap Swain could contest the OCA elections.         
	The present OCA secretary, Ashirbad Behera, said: A clear picture will emerge only after the nomination papers are filed on August 6. Things would be clearer by August 9, the last date for the withdrawal of nomination.         
	The elections are scheduled for August 17.         
	In the last OCA elections held in 2004, two Congress leaders (both editors of Oriya dailies and former MPs), Soumya Ranjan Patnaik and Ranjib Biswal, had battled for the presidents post. While Patnaik had made his second electoral outing, Ranjib piped him in his maiden attempt.         
	Patnaik had first contested in 1996, but was defeated by Congress leader and former minister Amar Pradhan. He had kept away from elections in 2000.         
	The list of authorised names received by the cricket association from the districts, clubs and educational institutions based in Cuttack indicates that Patnaik wont be in the fray this time as well.         
	The list, however, includes Pyarimohan Mohapatra from Union Sporting Club, Ranendra Pratap Swain from Rovers Club, Ranjib Biswal from Jayadurga Club and Ashirbad Behera as the secretary of Cuttack District Athletic Association.         
	Ranjibs elder brother and Congress Tirtol MLA Chiranjeeb Biswal and higher education minister Sameer Dey also figure in the list representing Town and Sunshine Club, respectively.         
	The list has triggered speculation over Pyarimohan Mohapatras entry into the fray for the presidents post even as Mohapatra has come out with a clarification.         
	Though he had intended to enter the fray, he had dropped the idea after re-thinking his commitment to his party, especially before the elections ahead.         
	OCA sources said Ranjib Biswal, on the other hand, would seek re-election for the presidents post, while Ashirbad Behera would do so for the secretarys post.         
	Behera was elected as the secretary the first time in 2000 and was elected uncontested in 2004.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 22: Shutters remained down in sweet shops across the state today as mark of protest against price rise of milk by the state-run Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (Omfed), which commands monopoly in procuring milk from farmers.        
	More than 10,000 sweet-sellers from across the state under the aegis of Utkal Mishthaan Byabasayee Samiti hit the streets demanding immediate withdrawal of the exorbitant price  Rs 24 a litre, compared to Rs 20 per litre before October 16.        
	The sweet-sellers have threatened to raise the price of sweet to Rs 50 per kg if their demands are not met.        
	Omfed hiked the price to make up an increase in the procurement price from farmers to Rs 15.80 from Rs 11.80 per litre. This is the third hike this year, said Bimbadhar Behera, the president of Utkal Mistanna Byabasai Samiti.        
	A delegation of sweet manufacturers met the governor and chief minister this evening to submit a memorandum requesting price hike rollback.

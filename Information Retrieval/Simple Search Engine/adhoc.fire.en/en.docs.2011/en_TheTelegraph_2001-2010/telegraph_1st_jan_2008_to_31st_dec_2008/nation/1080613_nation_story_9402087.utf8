          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 12: Two men died and over 30 persons were injured this morning when a high voltage live wire fell on a moving bus at Sheikhpura, around 170km from here.         
	The shocking incident took place around 9.15am at Girhinda Chowk near the district town when the 11,000volt wire fell on a private bus (BRIC P 6225) carrying over 60 passengers from Sheikhpura to Barbigha.         
	The cleaner of the bus, Sudhir (35), who was collecting fares from the 20 passengers on the bus roof, was the first to come in contact with the wire and was charred to death. Another passenger (yet to be identified), in his mid-30, was also electrocuted. Over 30 passengers, including seven children, suffered electric shocks. At least eight of them are stated to be in a critical state. Police said the injured were admitted to hospitals in Sheikhpura and Nalanda.         
	The critical ones were referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). Some have been undergoing treatment at private clinics in Sheikhpura.        
	The conductor of the bus, Ramavatar, said: As I boarded the bus after a brief break at Sheikhpura, I felt sudden shivers. Passengers, too, felt the same and started to scream.         
	The bus driver, he said, somehow managed to stop the bus. He escaped unhurt        
	Police arrived at the spot within 20 minutes and asked the electricity department officials to cut-off supply to Sheikhpura town.         
	Shailendra Kumar, a resident who witnessed the incident, told The Telegraph: The wire lay on the road for hours. Loose wires are a common sight here. With people travelling on bus roofs often, the chances of such incidents are common.

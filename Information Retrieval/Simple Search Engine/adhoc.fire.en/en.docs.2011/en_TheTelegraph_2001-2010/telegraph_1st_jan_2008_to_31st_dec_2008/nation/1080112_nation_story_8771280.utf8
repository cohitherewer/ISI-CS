	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: A fair maiden, a poisoned apple and a princely kiss  the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, by brothers Grimm, would soon come alive on Orissas stage  thanks to volunteers from Canada and Germany, along with the citys own Bakul Foundation. 
    
	Nichole Suhanek, Melanie Eidecker and Mellissa Cornacchia, are the three social work students of Dortmund University, who have put their talents together for a (slightly tampered) version of the popular fairy tale as a grand finale to a theatre workshop being organised by Bakul Foundation. 
    
	This is the first-ever theatre workshop for children here.
    
	With the show a few days away, preparations are on at a furious pace at an innocuous address in the dusty lane of Satyanagar. Nichole, has donned the directors hat for the musical, and is being assisted by Melanie and Mellissa  also doubling up as lyricists, trainers, art directors, prop and costume designers and musicians for the production.
    
	This show is about fun and laughter. The musical is going to be a real treat, promises Nichole. 
    
	Her actors are all ready and confident and the rest would be done by flamboyant and wacky costumes along with the music and dance, the director assures. 
    
	The workshop, which began on December 6, 2007, with 20 Bhubaneswar schoolchildren, focussed on basics of emoting. 
    
	We started with general exercises and then went on to expressions and finally a story. Then we taught them about props, how to make them and the costume selection, too, said Melanie.
    
	Its great to watch the kids in action. Nichole, Melanie and Mellisa also double up as energetic and warm friends for them. Despite not knowing our language, it is amazing how the three have managed to make this workshop a success, said Sujit Mahapatra, secretary of the foundation. 
    
	Its not about the performance only, but also about development. There were some shy kids, who outgrew all their shyness and that is the biggest achievement, he added.
    
	Well sing and look great in the costumes. We are looking forward for our day, said Anish Mishra, a little student of Class III of Loyola School. Anish would be the narrator for the musical. The significant seven dwarfs are to be played by Loyola and St Xaviers students.

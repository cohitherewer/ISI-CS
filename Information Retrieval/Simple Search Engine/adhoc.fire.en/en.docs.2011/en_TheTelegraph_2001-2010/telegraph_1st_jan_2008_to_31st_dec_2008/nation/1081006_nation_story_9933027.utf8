          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Agartala, Oct. 5: Tripura police today fished out a bomb from a plastic bag of rice, eggs and vegetables that was lying in a drain since last night.        
	The bomb was found in Radhanagar in north Agartala, where a blast last week had injured 20 people.        
	The police, alerted by locals, arrived with a bomb disposal squad that had experts from the Union home ministry, at the Radhamadhav temple near which the bag was found.         
	When they opened the bag and removed the rice, four eggs and vegetables, an aluminium container was found. Inside it were the explosives, a detonator, a cellphone with its SIM card and a battery.        
	A tribal youth in the area, Jagadish Debbarma, was arrested and is being questioned, but the police have not said why he was picked up. We may have found a real clue in the cellphone and SIM card. These will be sent for analysis, said K.V. Sreejesh, the superintendent of police (west).        
	The mobile, the police said, was attached to the explosives with an adhesive tape and could have been the trigger. It took four hours to defuse the bomb. If detonated, it could have caused major damage and loss of life. This bomb was similar to those used in Bangalore, Delhi and here earlier, said Major Karam Veer, who led the home ministry team.         
	All mobile service providers have been asked to furnish details of all connections given since April.         
	Assam firing kills 8        
	At least 33 people have died in violence over the weekend between tribal people and Bangladeshi settlers in Assam, police said.        
	Violence between the Bodo tribe and immigrants broke out on Friday in Udalguri district. On Sunday, eight people died in police firing.

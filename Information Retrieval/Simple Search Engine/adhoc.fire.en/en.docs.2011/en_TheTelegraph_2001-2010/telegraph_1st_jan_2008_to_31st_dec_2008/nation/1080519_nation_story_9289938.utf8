	Nawabpet (Kadappa), May 18: For some villagers, a new industry may be a magnet with its promise of jobs and prosperity. But Nawabpets 2,000 people want to leave en masse because a cement factory is coming up in the village, 400km south of Hyderabad.        
	The Dalmia group has bought 900 acres out of the 1,100 acres of fertile black soil where the villagers grew jowar, groundnut, lentils and paddy. The residents have now moved Andhra Pradesh High Court to try and get the company to buy the remaining 200 acres as well.        
	The entire village of Reddys, Muslims and Dalits wants to leave together and build a new life somewhere else, away from what had been the 200-odd families home for a century.        
	Once our land is gone whats the point in living amid water and smoke? Mahanandi Reddy, 65, told this correspondent.        
	Former sarpanch V. Siva Shankar Reddy, just back from his field on a motorbike, explained the details.        
	The factory is building a 2km boundary wall which, Reddy said, will block the floodwaters from the river Pennar on the other side of the low-lying village.        
	We will drown during the rains. Even last year, without the wall, we lived on rooftops for 10 days.        
	Also, once the 1,100-tonnes-a-day factory begins to belch out smoke and dust, life will become hell not only in Nawabpet but also in neighbouring villages.        
	When the villagers first realised there would be a wall and a pollution threat, they had tried to reoccupy their land but were driven away. Police cases were lodged against seven of them.        
	Now, we want to move to somewhere upstream. Let Nawabpet become a huge tank, Reddy said.        
	After the villagers moved court, company officials have verbally promised to consider buying the rest of the land, he added.        
	Well move to the outskirts of Duggenapalli village, 4km away, once our compensation is paid. There will be less smoke (from the factory) there. The government has some land there and well ask for it as housing plots.        
	The government is already involved: the villagers said the local revenue divisional officer, Ramachandra Reddy, and MLA Adinarayan Reddy had persuaded them to sell their land. The usual rehabilitation package for the displaced in the state includes housing plots plus a maximum of two acres of farmland.        
	Nawabpet is now waiting for the companys lawyers to arrive to cut a compensation deal. One, there must be jobs in the factory for the villagers even after they move to Duggenapalli. Two, the company must help with self-employment opportunities. Three, it must pay more for the land.        
	When the company bought our land two years ago, it offered us the market rate of Rs 1.87 lakh per acre. But since construction began, the price has risen to Rs 3-4 lakh. Well ask for at least Rs 2-3 lakh an acre, Reddy said.        
	A company official at the plant site, where a kiln and some other structures are already in place, said the Dalmia group was ready to help the villagers. He added that the lignite deposits in the area offered huge potential for expanding the factory.        
	Parimalama, 35, will leave with the rest but feels sentimental. She said the families had been living in the village since the early 1900s, and generations have been born and brought up there.        
	Nawabpet has a primary school and a self-help group with a corpus of Rs 2 lakh. Farming is the main occupation but some have taken up bidi-rolling on the side.        
	Drinking water has been a problem, though. We have to fetch water from Doodanapalli, 1.5km away, said Narayanamma, a water pot on her head.        
	Things will be a little worse at their new home. Duggenapalli is water-starved, too, and the women will have to walk 2.5km with the pots.

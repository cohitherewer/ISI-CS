The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lesson for Bollywood: keep it short
                                                                                                               Lesson for Bollywood: keep it short
          AMIT ROY                           Eva Green at the Bafta awards				                                 
	London, Feb. 11: Bollywood can learn a trick or two from last nights glittering Bafta awards, the British equivalent of the Oscars - the 80 th Oscars, incidentally, will take place in Los Angeles on February 24 now that the screen writers dispute looks like being settled.         
	The Orange British Academy Film Awards at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden began on time at 7.30pm, after allowing two hours for red carpet arrivals and media interviews. The introductions and acceptance speeches were all short and within two hours the whole show, presented by Jonathan Ross, was over. Then followed the gala banquet and the post awards party.         
	Lesson number one is Bollywood bores have to be kept off the stage. For example, at the IIFA awards last June in Sheffield, when Dharmendra could not be persuaded off stage, he began well enough. Then after he had invited Sholay co-star Amitabh Bachchan, the two greeted each other effusively, not having met for at least five minutes. This, too, was tolerable.         
	But then Dharmendra summoned his sons, Sunny and Bobby, who hugged their father and wept with joy. Then the boys invited several members of the cast and crew from their latest movie which they plugged mercilessly with the help of their father. By now, 40 minutes had passed.         
	Nothing like this would ever be allowed either at the Baftas or the Oscars. Last nights unexpected development was that the biggest British film for years, Atonement, based on the novel by Ian McEwan - the author was warmly received at the recent Jaipur literary festival - was nominated in 14 catogories, but two only two.         
	To be sure, one was for Best Film.         
	Atonements leading star, Keira Knightley, did not win Best Actress, and neither did Julie Christie, though hotly tipped for Away From Her. The award went to the French actress, Marion Cotillard, 32, for her portrayal of singer Edith Piaf in La Vie En Rose.         
	Cotillard raised a laugh when she said: You cant expect a French movie to be a success here or even in France.         
	The Best Actor award went to Daniel Day-Lewis, 50, who plays oil baron Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood.         
	What would give him street cred with his young children, joked Day-Lewis, would be his photograph alongside Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter films.         
	Shekhar Kapur did not come last night. Cate Blanchett, his leading lady in Elizabeth: The Golden Age did not win.         
	But the director later told The Telegraph: I knew Cate Blanchett would not win, though I sincerely think her performance was just so brilliant.         
	The film had three other nominations - production design, costume design, and make up amp; hair - but none won.         
	Sarah Gavron, director of Brick Lane, was nominated for the Carl Foreman Award that is given for special achievement by a British director, writer or producer for a first feature film, but did not win.         
	Although Bollywood makes more money at the UK box office than foreign films from any other territory, no Indian movie made it into the category, Film not in the English language. Rang De Basanti was nominated in 2007.         
	Last nights ceremony once again emphasised the intimate relationship between Hollywood and the British film industry, many of whose most talented actors, producers and technical experts find employment in America.         
	Among Americans who handed out prizes were Sylvester Stallone, Cuba Gooding Jnr, Harvey Keitel, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum.         
	Bafta, like the Oscars, would not work without the glamour quotient, provided by the likes of Bond girl Eva Green. A Swedish fashion model, actress and sex symbol, Victoria Silvstedt, sought desperately to upstage the other women by revealing her charms to the elements on a cold night.         
	Who wears what is also closely monitored. Cotillard chose Chanel.         
	Sienna Miller, who not so long ago visited Mumbai and shared the same umbrella with the Big B, looked stunning in a black backless Dior dress with jewel detail across her shoulder blades.         
	Knightley arrived in a tuxedo jacket, which she later removed to reveal a strapless, tiered Valentino couture gown in pale grey. Julie Christie wore an understated black belted jacket, patterned Sophia Kokosalaki trousers and skyscraper heels. Kate Hudson (daughter of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell) glittered in a silver and gold sheath dress by Dior.         
	Bafta really ought to have invited some Bollywood stars as well but didnt. Flying the flag for India was Lakshmi Mittal, who somehow manages to wangle invitations when others cant. With him were his wife, Usha, daughter, Vanisha, and son-in-law, Amit Bhatia. The men looked elegant in their black ties, the women brave in their furs.

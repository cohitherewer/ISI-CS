	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 27: Bursting a cracker or lighting a diya brings tears of joy to Shanti this Diwali.        
	Crackers, diyas and rangoli broke the silence of Shanti and 225-odd residents at Mission Asra. This place is the only platform in eastern India that offers shelter to mentally deranged women and provide them their basic needs.         
	Shanti doesnt know where she had come from. Yet her replies in Telugu hints that she might have hailed from some place in Andhra Pradesh. The 45-year-old woman does not remember anything like hundreds of her likes at the home. Sometimes, she blurts about her PhD and the next moment she talks of Ramoji Film City. But she did enjoy the fireworks and smiled like a child whenever a cracker went off.        
	Its good to see them enjoy and smile. We have a tough time controlling these patients. The hard work is worth it when we see them recover, said Mission Asra director Gobind Pattanaik.        
	Hundreds of mentally deranged women celebrated the festival of lights last evening bursting crackers and lighting diyas followed by a lavish dinner to mark the day. The celebration aims at lightening up their assumed lives with a new meaning. We celebrate most festivals for the inmates to ensure their readjustment with the society but Diwali has always been special, said Pattanaik.         
	It gives an opportunity for the inmates to meet the other members of society and forget their gloomy past, he added.        
	Orissa has over 5,000 people who find themselves in serious state of mentally ill health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Alliance to decide Congress tie-up: Mulayam
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Alliance to decide Congress tie-up: Mulayam
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mulayam                                  
	New Delhi, April 11: Mulayam Singh Yadav today said if he had to have an understanding with the Congress, now or in the future, the decision would be taken by the United National Progressive Alliance.        
	I will not do anything unilaterally, he said.        
	Asked about media reports of a thaw in Congress-Samajwadi Party relations, Mulayam told The Telegraph: There is no proposal from us or the Congress to have any understanding now or in the near future.        
	There have been no talks at any level. If Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to Amar Singh (after the death of the Samajwadi leaders father), it was a personal one. The press is giving all kinds of interpretations, though I dont know why.        
	Mulayam said his priorities were to strengthen his party in the election-bound states, keep the UNPA intact, fight Mayavati and combat the issues of the day, such as price rise, together with the Left.        
	On inflation, we are fighting the Congress. The Centre has not helped the farmers or consumers, he said.        
	Samajwadi sources said the Congress had become a liability and that the CPM was much more important to Mulayam despite lacking a base in the heartland.        
	The Congress blew hot and cold towards us, sometimes supporting us and sometimes being soft on the BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party), a Samajwadi source said.        
	The CPM stood by Mulayam through good and bad times. It is politically more astute than the Congress and understands the Samajwadis importance in the battle against communalism. It knows the Samajwadi alone halted the BJPs growth in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Mulayam was reminded that most UNPA leaders  N. Chandrababu Naidu (Telugu Desam Party), Om Prakash Chautala (Indian National Lok Dal) and Babulal Marandi (Jharkhand Vikas Morcha)  had broken away from the BJP or the NDA for personal or political reasons. Could they not return in the future?        
	There is no question of this, Mulayam replied. I will give an undertaking to the nation on their behalf that they will not go back to the BJP.        
	Asked specifically about Marandi, who has roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and once headed a BJP government in Jharkhand, he said: No, he wont return. He is an important and influential leader in Jharkhand today, much more so than Shibu Soren (of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha). Our endeavour will be to retain him, to not let him go.        
	Mulayam welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on the Other Backward Classes quota, even the exclusion of the creamy layer. He said his new slogan would be: Save reservation, increase reservation (for the OBCs).        
	The judgment will help us not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. But the volume of reservation needs to rise. This will require a constitutional amendment (since the apex court has capped total reservation at 50 per cent). We will fight for it.

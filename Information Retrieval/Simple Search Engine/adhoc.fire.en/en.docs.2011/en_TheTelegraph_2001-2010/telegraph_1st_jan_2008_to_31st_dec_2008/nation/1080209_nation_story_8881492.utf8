The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi? No thanks
                                                                                                            Modi? No thanks
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Narendra Modi, Uma Bharti: Demigod alert				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: No thanks, we dont want a Narendra Modi or an Uma Bharati.        
	That was the message from a Congress veteran warning his colleagues about the dangers of regional demigods.         
	Janardhan Dwivedi, the general secretary in charge of the organisation, wasnt referring to Modis anti-minority leanings but to the perception that the Gujarat chief minister threatened to become larger than the BJP.        
	On the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister (Uma Bharti), he pointed out how she was thrown out of the BJP when it became clear that she was getting far too big.        
	National parties like the BJP and the Congress shouldnt encourage the cult of regional demigods in states and undermine their own position at the Centre, Dwivedi said.        
	The observations could set off a debate in the Congress, where regional leaders have often admitted to feeling stifled by Delhi, not being allowed to do things the way they wanted and having to take the rap for poll debacles.         
	Is our leadership so insecure? asked a former Uttar Pradesh MLA. The leaders hope lay in Rahul Gandhi, who has promised to end the nomination culture from Delhi and the remote control from the party headquarters.        
	Some of Dwivedis colleagues agreed with his view that when the high command was invincible and the Congress ruled with an absolute majority, Delhi could afford to be indulgent towards regional leaders. An example was when Indira Gandhi denied P.V. Narasimha Rao a second term as Andhra Pradesh chief minister.        
	But with the Congress nowhere near reliving the halcyon decades of the 60s and 70s and its dependence increasing on a variety of regional formations, the last thing the party would want are individuals who fancy themselves as regional satraps, a Congress functionary said.         
	Look at the BJP, its central leaders are losing sleep worrying about Modi usurping their positions in Delhi, he added.         
	Sources said the Congress did not intend to name chief ministerial candidates in the Assembly elections this year. It would stick to the tried-and-tested line of allowing elected representatives to choose their leaders.        
	There is another reason why the Congress is wary of regional leaders.         
	There is nothing like loyalty anymore. Each individual is searching for his space and if he thinks he has amassed enough political capital, he uses it to bargain with another party or float his own, the leader said.

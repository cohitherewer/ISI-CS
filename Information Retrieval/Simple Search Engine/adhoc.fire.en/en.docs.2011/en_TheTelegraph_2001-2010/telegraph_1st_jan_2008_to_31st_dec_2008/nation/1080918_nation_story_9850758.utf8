          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Rajya Sabha MP and chairman of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector Arjun Kumar Sengupta has complimented Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for his pro-industry drive and advised Mamata Banerjee to ensure that Singur farmers get a livelihood instead of harping on reclaiming land.        
	If you return the land and dont get the industry, it wont help. The farmers will not be able to survive, he said.        
	Mamata should instead look for a method of compensating displaced farmers which will assure them of a livelihood that is far more important than getting their land back, he added.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph as an Independent MP and not on behalf of the Congress  although he is a member of the partys manifesto committee and the department of policy planning and co-ordination  Sengupta said allowing the rights of farmers to overrule all other programmes in Bengal would be counterproductive in the context of the Singur agitation.        
	The Tatas and the others will leave the state because there are several other states waiting with open arms to welcome industry. The whole question, therefore, is to protect the interests of small and marginal farmers and not politicise the issue, the economist said.        
	Sengupta has prepared a report on the small and marginal farmers, who, he added, were part of the unorganised sector. He is discussing it with the Union agriculture minister as well as the Bengal government and will be in Calcutta on Friday to take it up with the chief minister.        
	One of our findings was that such farmers have only 2.5 hectares of land which is not enough at all even if they have the back-up resources such as technology, marketing, credit, etc. The area is hardly viable. They need to go for non-farming occupations. The government must ensure that those who have lost their land should be given adequate training so that in future when small scale industries come up in the area, they should be equipped to get jobs, he said.        
	Sengupta said that instead of demanding the return if the acquired land, Mamata should focus on ensuring the farmers get proper training so that if and when the small-car factory comes up in Singur, they can put their skills to use.        
	He said he appreciated the Trinamul Congress leaders sentiments for the farmers, but she should also see that they get easy loans from banks so that subsidiary ancillary units can be set up around the main industry in which they can work.         
	Such loans can also help the farmers set up self-help groups, Sengupta said. This is the kind of compensation package that should be looked at, he stressed.        
	Sengupta said the price of acquired land should not be assessed at just the current market price but should include the value that will accrue over time because of the scale of economic growth.

	Hariharpur (Vaishali), Jan. 9: Indias Green Revolution may soon turn cauliflower-seed-like yellow if Vaishali farmer Bindeshwar Prasad Singh (67) could have his way.
    
	In 2002, the farmer won a silver medal from Varanasis Indian Vegetable Research Institute for adopting effective, uniquely organic multi-crop method of farming and reaping rich benefits in just 2.5acres  in which he produces cauliflower seeds, potato and maize throughout the year.
    
	The man with the Midas touch uses a pheromone trap  wherein insect-hormone in cotton wads is used to trap pests, but Singh improvised further and set up wooden perches around and in his field to invite birds to kill more pests. Beehives were encouraged around the field to help cross-pollination. A solution of ginger, neem and chilly was used for pest control.
    
	In Singhs field, cauliflower seeds are grown between July and mid March, potato between December and March and maize between January and May. 
    
	The field is minus crop only for one-and-a-half-months. All this is grown on loam soil. 
    
	His cost-effective cauliflower seeds are sold across Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra under exclusive Vaishali brand of Satya Beej or Amrit for its organic preparation. 
    
	Following suit, people in his village have also reaped rich benefits making Singhs case an example.

                                                                                                               Delhi doles out DA cheer to central staff
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 7: The cabinet today announced a fresh instalment of dearness allowance for central government employees and set aside funds so that interest subsidies for cheap loans to farmers can continue.        
	The DA hike, with retrospective effect from January 1 this year, will push up the salaries by 6 per cent. The effective DA for employees and pensioners now stands at 47 per cent, minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who briefed reporters after the cabinet meeting, said. The last hike, in September 2007, was from 35 per cent to 41 per cent.        
	Das Munshi said the combined impact on the exchequer because of dearness allowance to the serving employees  and dearness relief to pensioners  will be Rs 3,297.12 crore for January-December 2008.         
	The cost will be Rs 3,846.66 crore from January 2008 to March 2009. The hike will mean an extra burden of Rs 1,078 crore for the full year and Rs 1,257 crore till March 2009.        
	The pay packets could swell further with finance minister P. Chidambaram saying that the Sixth Pay Commission would submit its report by the end of this month.        
	The higher DA will put more cash in the hands of the employees and could spur demand for consumer goods, the demand for which has been weak in recent months.        
	Funds for farm loan        
	For farmers, the cabinet approved Rs 2,615 crore as interest subvention to ensure short-term crop loans at 7 per cent. The Centre pays banks 2 per cent. Those who borrow up to Rs 3 lakh will benefit, Das Munshi said. The allocation will help meet the promise in the budget that such loans to farmers will be given at 7 per cent.        
	The money set aside by the Centre will be released to PSU banks and Nabard, the agriculture finance institution, so that they can keep lending at concessional rates.        
	The interest subsidies will be in addition to the farm loan waiver announced in the budget. All farm loans given by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative credit institutions up to March 31, 2007, and overdue on December 31, 2007, will be covered by the waiver.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A passport to track you
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A passport to track you
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Travel trail                                  
	New Delhi, May 18: Your passport will soon carry not just your photograph but also your fingerprints. It will be tamper-proof and will allow authorities to track your movements, sources said.        
	The pilot launch of the e-passports will take place next month, with diplomats and government officials being issued the first batch. Ordinary citizens will get them from the middle of next year, foreign ministry sources said.        
	These passports will have thinner front and back pages. The back page will have a 64-kilobyte silicon chip and an embedded rectangular antenna. The chip will store the holders photograph and bio-metric information such as fingerprints, as well as details of the last 20 to 30 trips the holder has undertaken, including any movements near international borders.        
	The National Informatics Centre and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, were entrusted with the project, which has passed lab tests.        
	Passports now have only the facial record. The chip has enough storage space to carry fingerprints and other details. It can be tracked by the authorities, a source said.        
	Those involved in the project say the e-passports will help prevent misuse. Since the information is stored in a chip, it is impossible to tamper with, Rajat Moona of IIT Kanpurs computer science department told The Telegraph.        
	He said India would be the 46th country in the world to issue the e-passport, and added that the software was completely homegrown.        
	A team has already visited Washington and lab-tested the e-passport. The team included officials from the foreign ministry, National Informatics Centre, IIT Kanpur and the Indian Security Press, Nashik.        
	All the e-passports were scanned with multiple readers to check if they could be read without any glitches.        
	We found out that the chip could be read in four to five seconds. In some developed countries, e-passports take 10 to 12 seconds for the reader to read all the necessary information. That makes a huge difference considering the long queues before immigration counters at international airports, the source said.

	Cuttack, Aug. 1: Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP) in Orissa urged chief minister Naveen Patnaik to extend support for breastfeeding mothers since the practice is a key tool to reduce high infant mortality rate.        
	Access to healthcare system for pre-natal and post-natal health check-up and advice can only facilitate optimal infant feeding practices among women and educate them about the benefits and techniques of breastfeeding, said Bikash Das, the executive vice-president of CLAP, while marking the beginning of the World Breastfeeding Week today.        
	First observed in 1992, the week, which seeks to encourage exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a childs life, is now observed in more than 120 countries. This years theme is support for mothers with studies having shown that the number of month, which mothers breastfeed especially exclusively, is extended by education and support.        
	The practice can cut back on the number of deaths caused by acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea, as well as other infectious diseases. It also improves mothers health and strengthens the bond between mother and child. Latest studies have shown breastfeeding started within one hour of birth reduces the risk to life of the infant considerably. Scientific evidence indicate a 22 per cent fall in neo-natal deaths, Das added.        
	Observing the week, CLAP organised an awareness rally in Cuttack today. More than 400 women participated in the rally that marched through the main thoroughfares of the city to the collectorate and staged a public demonstration. A petition addressed to the chief minister was also submitted through the collector.        
	CLAPs petition demanded provisions and adequate budgetary allocation for protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding women during pregnancy, and childbirth.

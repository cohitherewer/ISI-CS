          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Advani and Rajnath Singh at the meeting on Monday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                          
	New Delhi, July 28: The BJP today decided not to co-operate with the Centre on economic reforms and said it would oppose all bills the illegitimate and immoral regime brings in to speed up its efforts.        
	The party, however, dismissed reports about the possibility of a no-confidence motion, saying it would fight the Congress-led government inside and outside Parliament.        
	After a meeting with allies at the residence of leader of Opposition L.K. Advani, party veteran Sushma Swaraj said they discussed the finance ministers proposal of pushing the reforms agenda.        
	He said the government will approach non-UPA parties. The majority view was that this government is illegitimate and immoral. They have survived on bought majority. There is no question of co-operating with it, she added.        
	The BJP leader said the National Democratic Alliance would oppose all bills pertaining to economic reforms as the Opposition combine believes the next government should now decide what the nations agenda should be.        
	We know most of the pending bills are also part of our agenda, Sushma said in response to a question. We support those bills. But we will pass them when we come to power after the election. This government does not deserve any support.        
	Asked if the BJP would oppose an ordinance for a federal law to deal with terrorism, Sushma said terrorism was a separate issue. We will decide on that when the government brings it. She also hinted at supporting the womens reservation bill as the party was committed to its passage.        
	The BJP leader rubbished reports about the possibility of bringing in a no-confidence motion against the Congress-led government. No-confidence motion will not be brought, she said, asked whether the Opposition combine  which last week suffered a bruising defeat in the Lok Sabha on the nuclear deal  was planning such a move in Parliaments monsoon session.        
	Advani, too, has claimed that he was not in the habit of destabilising governments, and bringing a no-confidence motion soon after the UPA government won the trust vote would, sources said, signal the BJPs desperation.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 29: Chief minister Nitish Kumar would soon lead an all-party delegation to the Centre to discuss issues related to the continuing power crisis and grain shortage in Bihar. 
    
	Participants of an all-party meet that Nitish had called today authorised the chief minister to lead the delegation. 
    
	All major parties, including the RJD, Congress, LJP and Left that attended the meet assured their representation in the group. 
    
	Bihar is too dependent on the Centre for power. This is because we have few power generating units of our own, Nitish said, adding: The Centre must ensure enough quota to us to meet its demands. 
    
	The only unit of Barauni Thermal Power Plant which has been synchronised barely produces 75MW per day. The NTPC is yet to repair the Kanti Thermal power plant. 
    
	In such a state, the chief minister said, his government had directed Bihar State Electricity Board to submit a report of the power received and supplied on everyday basis to ensure transparency. People and parties must know of the actual facts, he said. 
    
	Nitish again reminded those gathered of the Centres decision to enlist 65 lakh families in the BPL quota in Bihar, against an existing number of 1.13 crore in the state. The Union government supplies grain and kerosene oil according to its own list, which leaves half of the beneficiaries under the scheme high and dry. 
    
	So far the government plans to constitute an all-party committee in all the subdivisions to monitor the functioning of the public distribution system. Nitish stressed that he had sought appointments with Sharad Pawar and Sushil Kumar Shinde in the matter. 
    
	We will go together for the appointment, he said.

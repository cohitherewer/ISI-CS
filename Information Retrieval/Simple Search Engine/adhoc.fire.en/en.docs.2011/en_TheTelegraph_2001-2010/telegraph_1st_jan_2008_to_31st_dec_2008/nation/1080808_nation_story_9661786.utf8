          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug 7: The governments silence on when Parliament would sit next has prompted the Left to allege that efforts are on to do away with the monsoon session altogether.        
	The Manmohan Singh government is afraid of facing Parliament, the four Left parties today said in a joint statement released by the CPM.        
	They cited the Centres July 8 announcement that the monsoon session would be held from August 11 to September 5, and demanded that a Parliament session be called immediately.        
	According to the Left parties, the Prime Minister and the Congress leadership are looking to avoid a Parliament session till the Nuclear Suppliers Group stage of the nuclear deal is over. The government is afraid, they said, that if it loses its majority in Parliament before that, the nuclear deal would be jeopardised.        
	The Left said the Centre was betraying its contempt for Parliament and wilful disregard for democratic norms, and asserted that several issues awaited parliamentary debate and approval.        
	After the government won the July 22 trust vote, doubts had been raised generally whether Parliament would indeed be convened this month. Not calling a session appeared to make sense for the government, allowing it to escape embarrassment at the Oppositions hands, especially over the cash-for-votes scandal.        
	The Left said that after having manipulated a majority by foul means, the Centre was not confident about facing the House where its majority would still be in question.         
	Not having a monsoon session does not violate the Constitution, but does defy convention, CPM member Mohammad Salim said.        
	By convention, it starts in the last week of July and continues till early September. This time the Centre had said the session might have to wait till August 11 since a special session was being held on July 21-22, to be followed by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associations meeting in Kuala Lumpur from August 1 to 10.

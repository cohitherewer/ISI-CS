          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 21: The stalemate over admissions to the first-year BTech and MCA courses in private engineering colleges continued for the fourth day today with the government and management of private institutions failing to reach any settlement on the question of management quota in NRI seats.        
	Neither side has made any effort to break the impasse. The deadlock assumes significance as management of private colleges governed under Orissa governments JEE had stopped admission to first-year BTech and MCA courses. We have no other option but to boycott the counselling, as the state did not respond to our proposal for amendments in the admission and fee structure, said Binod Das, the association secretary.

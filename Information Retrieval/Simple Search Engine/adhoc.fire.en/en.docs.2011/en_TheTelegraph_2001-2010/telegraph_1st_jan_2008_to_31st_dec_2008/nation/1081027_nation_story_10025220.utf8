          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 26: The Centre will cut supplies to the extinction-threatened Shompen tribals of Great Nicobar to prod them out of inertia and help them survive.        
	The government will also stop repairing a forest road on the island to protect these indigenous people, one of the last surviving stone-age tribes whose numbers have fallen to about 200.        
	The Shompens earlier lived on wild animals, fruits, tubers, fish and honey and made their own clothes from tree bark. For the past 30 years, the Centre had been providing them with rice, fruits, clothes and other commodities.        
	The tribals had become idle and immobile because of dependence on government supplies. The (Union tribal welfare) ministry believes the Shompens need to resume their pursuit of an independent livelihood, said anthropologist V. Sahay.        
	He said the rainforests on the Great Nicobar provide sufficient resources for the Shompens traditional hunting-gathering lifestyle.        
	A ministry official said: The ministry has also adopted a resolution to stop interference in the Shompens lives. The only way to do this is to stop the reconstruction of the road that bisected the habitat of the Shompen tribals.        
	Repairs on the 43km road had begun after the 2004 tsunami, and outsiders were brought in for the job. From them, however, diseases spread among the Shompens who lacked immunity to these infections. In 2005, many tribals died of gastro-intestinal disease.        
	Now the ministry, under pressure from activists and anthropologists, has come up with the first draft policy for the Shompens welfare.                    
	The ministry will prepare identity cards for all the Shompens. We have decided to prepare photo I-cards for them. The Shompens are not hostile; they allow outsiders to enter their habitat, a ministry secretary said.        
	The Shompens are categorised as a primitive tribal group (PTG) along with four other tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands: the Jarawas, Andamanese, Onges and the Sentinelese.        
	In contrast with these other tribes, the Shompens have yellow-brown skin, straight hair, narrow eyes and a stocky frame.        
	Anthropologists say that till a few decades ago, the Shompens were the supreme rulers of their island. Down the years their land was occupied, their forests chopped down and they themselves were outnumbered by outsiders.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat                            
	New Delhi, June 7: Prakash Karat has accused chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami of being blinded by class prejudice in cracking down on posters while ignoring lavish spending by candidates.        
	The CPM general secretarys attack comes after Gopalaswami wrote a newspaper article saying steps taken to prevent posters and flags to be put up in public places and private houses have been welcomed by parties and candidates who have no money power.        
	Karat has hit back with an article titled Restriction on Election Campaign: Class Prejudice, which will appear in the next issue of Peoples Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece.        
	The CPM chief said Gopalaswami seems driven by good intentions but added that the way to hell is often paved with good intentions.        
	Has the EC nailed the candidates and the parties that use such illegal methods as distributing crores of rupees? he asked.        
	Regrettably, the truth is, the CEC is blinded by class prejudice. This makes him go after the poor activist who paints a satirical political cartoon on the walls of Kolkata while merely bemoaning the shameful and gross use of ill-gotten money.        
	The poll panel requires parties to take the permission of house owners before they paint their walls with poll graffiti or stick posters on them.        
	But Karat said: Parties like the CPI(M) consider an election not just an opportunity to get candidates elected but also as an occasion for a party to campaign politically to put across its views and policies. It seeks to do so by posturing, wall-writing, leafleting and widespread display of slogans and messages with a political content. The expenditure on such campaigning would be minimal compared to the lavish expenditure indulged in by certain parties and candidates.        
	He added: The net result of such gimmickry and bureaucratic steps is to discourage cheap electioneering while nothing is done to prevent rampant use of money.

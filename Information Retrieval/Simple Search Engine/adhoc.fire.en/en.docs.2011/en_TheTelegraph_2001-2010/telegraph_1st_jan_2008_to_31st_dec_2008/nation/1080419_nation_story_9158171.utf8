          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 18: The chief justices have agreed to increase working hours in their respective high courts to reduce the backlog of pending cases.         
	A resolution, passed at the end of their conference today, said the high courts would consider either extending working time to five and a half hours or increasing the number of working days.         
	High court judges would be requested to work during vacations on a voluntary basis and not to go on holidays on working days, it added.         
	It also recommended that that evening or morning courts should be set up, wherever feasible, and cases involving petty offences should be transferred to such courts. Only Gujarat has evening courts and Andhra Pradesh has morning courts.         
	The resolution also said the age of retirement of high court judges should be raised to 65 years. A high court judge now retires at 62 and a Supreme Court judge at 65.

	Bangalore/Ahmedabad, Sept. 16: Offer letters from Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, flaunted on IIM campuses as passports to a dream career, appear to have become mementoes of a missed fortune.        
	A pall of gloom hung over IIM Bangalore after Lehman Brothers announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection and the crisis-ridden Merrill Lynch declared it would be bought over by Bank of America.        
	As many as 22 plum job offers, seven of them for women, had come from the two institutions for placements in New York, London, Tokyo and Singapore. The Bangalore IIM, where 40 per cent of the students opt for finance, has been a big recruitment ground for investment banks.         
	It is not nice to start your career when the job you were dreaming of joining within months is no more there, said Sourav Mukherji, the chairman of placements.         
	He added that many of the students who had got the Lehman and Merrill offers last year had done summer jobs there. They had worked very hard to get there. Though we are sure the offers by Lehman stand cancelled, we hope Merrill, which has a bailout plan, will honour the placement commitments.         
	Mukherji said he would write to Merrill soon to find out the status of the offers.        
	But some students, like Prashant Paul (name changed), who was to join Lehman early next year, saw it coming. I had followed its (Lehmans) financials and when it suffered a $4billion loss the last quarter, I guessed the end was near. Now I have to look for other opportunities.         
	Another student admitted having bragged to his seniors about his Lehman offer. Now I cant show them my face.        
	The troubles go back to previous batches. The Bangalore campus has over 100 alumni in the two companies, which have been hiring since the 1990s.         
	Earlier, they picked up 10-15 students on average but the number went up in the past two years, Mukherji said.        
	A faculty member said teachers had spoken to the students with the offers and hoped their studies didnt get affected.        
	Mukherji held out hope, though, saying the students who lost out would go through placements again in March. The aftershocks have also reached IIM Ahmedabad, from where Lehman had been picking 10 to 15 students each year and was seen as one of the best pay masters.         
	Until last March, the investment bank had doled out average annual packages, Rs 80 lakh to 90 lakh. Now, it seems back to ground zero for the alumni at Lehman. We dont know what will happen to them, said a final-year student.        
	Saral Mukherjee, who heads the placement panel, said it was too early to assess the effects but stressed the collapses have brought into focus matters bigger than just job offers.        
	Nirmal Kumar, an IIM graduate who had last year opted out of placements to set up his own venture in his home state of Bihar, said the students would now have to look elsewhere. He warned the impact of Lehman and Merrill would be felt across several sectors, including banks.

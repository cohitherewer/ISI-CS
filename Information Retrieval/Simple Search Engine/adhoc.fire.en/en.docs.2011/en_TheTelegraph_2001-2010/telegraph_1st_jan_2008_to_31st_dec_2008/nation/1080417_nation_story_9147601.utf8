          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 16: Orissa police remained clueless about the whereabouts of Raj Acharya, the prime suspect in the murder of wunderkids coach Biranchi Das, 72 hours after the incident.         
	Though a special team, headed by additional police commissioner Y.B. Khurania, was constituted soon after the murder, and despite number of raids at possible hideouts of the prime accused, Raja, the notorious gangster remained elusive.         
	While talking to the media for the first time since the fatal incident, Biranchi Dass wife, Geetanjali Das, confessed today that she heard her husband plead Raja please, Raja please some minutes before he was murdered.         
	Geetanjali added that she feared for her and her sons life, as she had named the gangster in the FIR she lodged yesterday.         
	But the widow stressed that she had faith in the state police and was hopeful that the culprits would be caught soon.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who reviewed the probe progress yesterday, today sought a report from the director-general of police Gopal Chandra Nanda on the alleged nexus between the gangster Raja and a few police officers.         
	I have asked the DGP to submit a report shortly, he told the reporters today.         
	Yesterday Behera had admitted that such a nexus was a possibility and that the link was probably making it difficult for the force to track the gangster.         
	An officer was suspended after the police suspected that he had a hand in the murder of the coach.        
	Last evening, DGP Nanda had convened a meeting of senior Bhubaneswar and Cuttack officers and had constituted a special task force to probe into the sensitive case.         
	It was also decided in the meeting that seniors would be handling all guilty officers harshly.

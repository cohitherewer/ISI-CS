The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | France offers IIT help, govt wary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     France offers IIT help, govt wary
  - Japan betrayal shadow on foreign assistance for Rajasthan          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: France has offered assistance in setting up the planned Indian Institute of Technology in Rajasthan.        
	However, the human resource development ministry is wary of accepting French help, still smarting from Japans withdrawal of a reported offer of financial assistance to IIT Hyderabad.        
	In a letter, France has specifically mentioned that it wants to help set up the IIT in Rajasthan, officials said.        
	The letter talks of Frances desire for greater engagement in engineering and technology with India, and mentions that jointly setting up an IIT will be a significant step in that direction, an official said.        
	The UPA government had promised to increase the number of IITs from the current seven to 15.         
	Of the eight new IITs, six, including those for Rajasthan and Hyderabad, have started offering classes from this year but are operating from temporary campuses.        
	The Centre and the Rajasthan government are yet to arrive at a consensus on the location.        
	Japan first said in 2007 that it wanted to help start an IIT in Patna  one of the six institutes which have started classes  but later shifted its view to Hyderabad.         
	In a joint working group, Japan indicated it was willing to provide technical and financial assistance to start the Hyderabad institute.         
	However, Japan later said it was unwilling to provide financial assistance, and could only volunteer technical help, a few teachers and training programmes, in a turnaround the HRD ministry views as a betrayal.        
	The shadow of Japans decision hovers over the future of Frances offer to help, ministry officials said. The trust quotient has taken a beating. We do not feel confident we can rely on foreign help. What if we face a repeat of what happened with Japan? We are moving on Frances offer cautiously, a source said.        
	Discussions with France are at a preliminary stage and any joint group to formulate a blueprint for collaboration is yet to be formed, the source said.         
	Officials feel that the interest shown by the French and the Japanese could be stemming from a keenness to attract young Indian engineers from the institutes to work in their countries rather than the US.         
	Most top Indian engineers seeking jobs abroad move to the US today. Silicon Valley once benefited from Indias brain drain; today it acts like a magnet to lure engineers, a senior technical education official said.        
	The US and the UK also score over other European countries and Japan because Indians face less of a language barrier in English-speaking countries, the official added.        
	In the report of the joint panel with India, Japan had asked for classes in Japanese to be taught at the IIT in Hyderabad.        
	Japan and France were among the foreign countries which missed out half a century ago in assisting India set up IITs.         
	The then USSR (IIT Bombay), US (IIT Kanpur), Britain (IIT Delhi) and Germany (IIT Madras) helped set up the first set of the IITs in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

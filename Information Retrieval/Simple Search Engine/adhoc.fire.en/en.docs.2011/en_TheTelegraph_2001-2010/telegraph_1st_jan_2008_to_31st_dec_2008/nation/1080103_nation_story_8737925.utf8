	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Recommended by the Union cabinet, the decision to impose central rule in Nagaland is pending with President Pratibha Patil, reports our special correspondent.         
	Patil, now in Hyderabad and expected to return to Delhi on Sunday, is also believed to be consulting constitutional experts on the issue.         
	Home ministry sources said the file was sent to her late last night after the cabinet approved Presidents rule in Nagaland. The cabinet recommended dissolution of the Assembly, elections to which are due next month.         
	Normally, Rashtrapati Bhavan does not take so much time. The reason for the delay is not known. We are waiting for the file to come back so that we can issue a notification, a home ministry official said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 31: A 21-year-old woman was pulled off a motorbike and forced into a jeep before being beaten up by seven men because they were not given right of way.        
	The incident took place early today in the middle-class locality of Pritampura in north-west Delhi.         
	We have filed a case of kidnapping against the men, a police officer said, adding that a hunt was on for the culprits.         
	Reema (name changed), a call centre employee, was on her way home, riding pillion on colleague Abhishek Aggarwals bike, after a late-night party when a jeep came in their way.         
	The men in the jeep became angry when they were not allowed to overtake, the officer said.        
	 They passed obnoxious remarks suggesting that Abhishek was trying to show off because he was with a woman. When he retorted, they hit him, took away his keys and forced the woman into their jeep.         
	Shaken, Abhishek called the police at 2.55am.         
	The men drove around with Reema, slapped her several times and dumped her on the road.         
	She is bruised, so she must have been hit hard. Once she started shouting, they decided to get rid of her and left her on the road, a police source said.         
	Reema, who lives alone in a rented flat, reached home at 5am.        
	The police suspect the men may have been drunk but have not been able to get any details as both Abhishek and Reema are too traumatised to speak.        
	Our first concern was to get the woman back safely. We are still investigating the matter from all angles, an officer said, adding that the culprits were probably from a rural background.        
	The capitals roads have been sullied by growing instances of violence and lawlessness. There have been 12 cases of road rage in the past three months alone. In August last year, five boys allegedly bludgeoned a 35-year-old property dealer to death after their motorcycle hit his car at a busy intersection in south Delhi. They reportedly chased his car, attacked him with sticks and smashed his head with a stone.         
	The average number of challans for traffic violations in Delhi is 12,000 a day. In Mumbai, the number is almost half.

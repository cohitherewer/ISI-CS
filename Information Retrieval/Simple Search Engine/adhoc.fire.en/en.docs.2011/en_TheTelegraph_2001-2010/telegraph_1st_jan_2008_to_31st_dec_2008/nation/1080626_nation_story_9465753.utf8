          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, June 25: Sher Bhadur Singh once had hopes of making it big in politics. Now he wants permission to die.        
	The former student leader, in jail for the last 19 years without being convicted in any of the cases against him, has written to the President, the Prime Minister, the Uttar Pradesh governor and the chief minister to end his suffering.        
	Kill me or care, his message for mercy killing pleaded, less than a week after an Australian court convicted a woman of manslaughter in a case of euthanasia for the death of her Alzheimers-afflicted partner.        
	Singhs plea  from a dark, isolated corner of a Lucknow jail  is, however, not the first to have come out from within the four walls of an Uttar Pradesh prison.        
	Earlier this month, 97 life convicts in an Allahabad prison who have all completed 14 years behind bars, wrote to the President saying they would prefer euthanasia to spending more time in jail.        
	Singhs first run-in with the law was in 1985. Then a 24-year-old student leader, the resident of Gadhi Chunati village, in Lucknow, had got into a street fight over a public issue. The cases piled as he got into more street brawls. In four years, between 1985 and 1989, the number of cases against him mounted to 67. Since December 1989, he has been lodged in an isolated barrack of Lucknow Central Jail, generally meant for dreaded criminals.        
	Singh, who went to college but didnt complete his education, has also been branded a terror for the number of cases he was wanted in.        
	He certainly is not a dreaded criminal, says his brother Ranjit. An aspiring politician like him had to hit the streets and stage demonstrations, and thus ended up being on the wrong side of the law.        
	Police officers in Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow, however, say Singh, also known as Shera, wanted to prove himself a tiger of a politician and always resorted to violence. So the law caught up with him.        
	But the law hasnt done justice to Shera, says his lawyer Jai Kishan Arora. I can vouch he is not facing any murder case which requires his detention for 19 years.

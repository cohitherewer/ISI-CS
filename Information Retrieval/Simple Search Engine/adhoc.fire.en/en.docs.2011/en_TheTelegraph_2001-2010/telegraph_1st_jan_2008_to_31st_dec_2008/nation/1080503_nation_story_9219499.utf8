  - Cong plans to keep out non-Kannadiga stars to avoid controversy        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, May 2: Karnatakas spats with its neighbours may impact the Congresss campaign and deprive it of star campaigners like P. Chidambaram, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Vilasrao Deshmukh.         
	The fear is that their presence might rekindle the ethnic and linguistic issues that erupt every now and then between the Kannada-speaking residents and those from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra over territorial claims and river water sharing.        
	Although leaders like M. Veerappa Moily and B.K. Hari Prasad officially insisted that Karnataka was too cosmopolitan to brook parochialism, sources said a debate was on in the Congress on whether to use leaders like E.V.K.S. Elangovan (Tamil Nadu) and Ramesh Chennithala (Kerala) as observers or push them into the campaign.         
	As observers, they would stay away from the public eye.         
	Sources said their feedback from the Tamil, Telugu and Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka was that local functionaries were unprepared to cooperate with the non-Kannadigas from the Congress. Once the sentiment was conveyed to these leaders by their party colleagues, they themselves declined to campaign and agreed to backroom work.         
	However, for forms sake, Chidambaram and the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra may put in a couple of appearances and make sanitised speeches without reference to anything contentious.         
	In March, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu fought bitterly over the Hogenkal Integrated Drinking Water Project.         
	Protesting Karnatakas opposition, prominent Tamil Nadu film stars like Rajanikanth, Vijayakant and Sarath Kumar hit the streets and made provocative statements. The Congress  caught between its ally DMK and the compulsions of fighting an election in Karnataka  urged Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi to put the project on hold until a popular government was installed in Bangalore.         
	He agreed but was accused of a sellout by the Opposition.         
	Other sticking points are the Cauvery water dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the border spats arising out of Karnatakas claim over Kasargod in northern Kerala, which was part of South Kanara before the boundaries were redrawn, and the row with Maharashtra over Sholapur and Belgaum.         
	Deshmukh wanted to address the Marathi-speaking residents of Belgaum in Karnataka but was advised to avoid it. Even so, Karnataka accused him and Union home minister Shivraj Patil of taking sides.         
	In Andhra, a fringe group fighting for a Rayalseema state wants to scoop Bellary out of Karnataka and merge it with Andhra in the belief that this would permanently solve the war over the Tungabhadra waters.         
	Putting the regional- national question in perspective, a Congress source said: Ideally, we dont like any of this because we are pan-Indian. But regional aspirations, however narrow-minded they may be, cannot be disregarded. Our rank and file pressures us to play to the gallery.         
	Similar considerations prompted the BJP to not consider an understanding with the ADMK which has a presence in a few Tamil-speaking areas in Karnataka although party president Rajnath Singh wanted it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mystery over death of drug test volunteer
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND G.S. MUDUR                               
	Hyderabad/New Delhi, Dec. 9: A 24-year-old man without any apparent illness died in Hyderabad after participating in a study of a drug, designed to control blood pressure, in what police have registered as a suspicious death.        
	K. Surender was among a group of about 50 healthy volunteers who had taken part in a study conducted by GVK Biosciences, a contract research organisation, to monitor the behaviour of the drug felodipine in the body, police and officials said.        
	Felodipine is already available in the market from at least one drug-maker. GVK Biosciences was conducting a bio-equivalence study to establish that the same molecule from another manufacturer had the same effect on the body as the original drug, a GVK Biosciences spokesperson said.        
	We dont know why this man died. Were now waiting for the post-mortem report, she said.        
	The man had received one drug formulation on November 26, and was to get the second formulation on December 6. But when he returned, as scheduled a day before, he complained of chest pain and was rushed to a hospital where he died.        
	He did not receive the second formulation and he died more than eight days after he had received the first formulation. The medicine would have been completely flushed out from his body by then, the spokesperson said.        
	Hyderabad police said there were indications that Surender may have simultaneously participated in more than one drug study. Medical experts believe this would raise a question whether the death was the result of exposure to more than one drug.        
	Surenders family has claimed he had received Rs 150 per day to volunteer for the drug study, which would involve two stays of about three days of observation. A GVK Biosciences official declined to say how much each volunteer was paid.        
	GVK Biosciences also refused to reveal the name of the drug manufacturer whose product was being studied. Were bound by a confidentiality agreement and we cannot give the names of our customers or how much we pay volunteers, the spokesperson said.        
	Hyderabad west zone police officer C. Ravi Verma said the company had permission to conduct the studies on humans. The company also had facilities to observe patients for two to three days after the study.        
	It is not clear whether Surender died because of the drug given by this company or (a drug given) by some other company, Ravi Verma said. Based on a complaint by a senior executive of GVK Biosciences, the police have registered a case of suspicious death.        
	Forensic scientists are now studying the body to determine the cause of death. Police said Surender had not informed his parents that he had volunteered for a drug study. He had told them he worked in a laboratory.

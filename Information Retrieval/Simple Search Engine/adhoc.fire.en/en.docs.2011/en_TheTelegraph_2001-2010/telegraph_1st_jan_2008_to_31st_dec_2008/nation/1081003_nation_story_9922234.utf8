	Panipat, Oct. 2: Sonia Gandhi today asked people to remain united and thwart attempts by Indias enemies to destabilise the country.        
	The Congress president was here to address a social revolution rally and kick-start the Haryana governments Rs 2,300-crore Mahatma Gandhi Grameen Basti Yojana. Under the scheme, 100-square-yard plots will be handed over to the poor. Sonia today gave allotment letters to 328 families.        
	Beware of people who are killing others to threaten the unity of the country. Such people are enemies of society and we have to remain united to give a befitting reply to them, Sonia said, adding that the designs of terrorists would not succeed.              
	The UPA chairperson asked parties to desist from trying to gain political mileage out of terror attacks. This is what the enemies of the country want. The Opposition parties are politicising the issue of terrorism. The people must take inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi whose birth anniversary falls today and work for communal amity and unity, she added.        
	Regretting that there were such people who are trying to disintegrate the country to grind their political interests, Sonia urged the people to understand their intentions and demoralise them. Nothing is stronger than unity, she said.        
	Sonia then paid tribute to Gandhi, underlining the long struggle and sacrifices of Indias freedom fighters.        
	No other day could be appropriate to launch this scheme to benefit the poor sections of society, she said.        
	Panipat had almost been turned into a cantonment by the administration for Sonias visit. Delhi-bound traffic from Punjab was diverted from Karnal, while vehicles on their way to Punjab from Delhi had to take the Bahalgarh route in Sonepat to get to the national highway in Karnal.

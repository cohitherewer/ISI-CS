The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apex court keeps Gere on kiss tenterhooks
                                                                                                               Apex court keeps Gere on kiss tenterhooks
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Richard Gere and Shilpa Shetty at the AIDS awareness event in Delhi                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Supreme Court today gave a complainant two weeks to explain why it should not stay the arrest warrant against actors Richard Gere and Shilpa Shetty for a public peck.        
	The notice to lawyer Poonam Chand Bhandari, on whose petition a Jodhpur court had issued the non-bailable warrant, came on a plea by Gere to stay the arrest.        
	The apex court, however, refused an immediate stay despite pleas by Geres counsel Indira Jaisingh and Shilpas lawyer Anand Grover.        
	Gere had kissed Shilpa on her cheek at an AIDS awareness event in Delhi last year, prompting complaints of public obscenity to be filed in three courts. A court in Alwar, Rajasthan, put restrictions on the Americans Indian trips.        
	The third complaint was filed in Ghaziabad. The apex court had stayed proceedings in the cases following appeals by Shilpa, but the warrant is still out.        
	Gere, who plans a visit to India in March in connection with an AIDS awareness programme, sought permission from the apex court to enter and leave the country at his own will. He said the restriction came in the way of his philanthropy. He agreed to submit to Indian courts jurisdiction in the matter.        
	He said his work as head of the Gere Foundation brought him to India at least once a year. The foundation has started the Heroes Project in India to mobilise public and media support for the AIDS battle.        
	It was during an awareness programme for truck drivers that Gere had hugged and kissed Shilpa in a spoof on a scene from his movie Shall We Dance. Both actors have argued in court that they had no hand in the telecast of the peck.        
	No non-bailable warrants can be issued without issuing summons, Geres petition said. The complaints. are a complete abuse of the process of law, by which he (Gere) is only sought to be harassed and victimised because he is a well-known personality, by those who seek to use such form of litigation as a means of fulfilling their own agendas of gaining public and media attention.        
	The petition also asked that Gere be exempted from appearing in the courts personally in connection with any of the cases.

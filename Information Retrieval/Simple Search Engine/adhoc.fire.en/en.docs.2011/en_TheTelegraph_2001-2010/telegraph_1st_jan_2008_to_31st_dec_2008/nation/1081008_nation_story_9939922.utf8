	Cuttack, Oct. 7: Eastern Indias first museum show-casing the history of rice, its origin and journey from Asia to other parts of the world has come up at the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) here at Bidyadharpur.        
	The map showing the journey of rice from Asia to all over the world, is one of the main attractions at the museum.        
	Glow boards, diorama, live samples, miniatures, audio video presentations and computerised information kiosks at the Oryza Museum, as it has been named, tell the story of rice in English, Hindi and Oriya language as well.        
	Devoted to a single crop the museum is first of its kind in eastern India, said CRRI extension head N.C. Rath.         
	The museum was formally opened last week by Dr Mangala Rai, director general of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).        
	An official source said the centrally air-conditioned museum had come up over 2500 sqft area at a cost of Rs 40 lakh. It can accommodate 50 visitors at a time.        
	The exhibits on the story of rice were fascinating and those proving information on the pros and cons of farm research in easy to understand manner, were equally absorbing for visitors.        
	CRRI has been the focal point of farm research on rice in eastern India for decades now.         
	Exhibits on its activities and new technologies involving productivity, protection, improvement, biochemistry and transfer of technology are on display.         
	The museum has come up in a record time of two years. The project was mooted in 2006 by M.P. Pandey, then director of CRRI, who retired last week.         
	Meanwhile, T.K. Adhya has taken over the charge as the new director of the institute. He was previ- ously a principal scientist at the microbiology department of CRRI.

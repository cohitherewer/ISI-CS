	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Come February 1, you will be able to book train tickets 90 days in advance instead of the 60 days at present.
    
	The reason? Its budget time and railway minister Lalu Prasad wants the kitty to look as fat as possible.
    
	By allowing people travelling in May and June to pay for their tickets in February and March, the minister could add around Rs 1,000 crore to the balance sheet for this financial year. 
    
	This is Lalunomics at work. The minister, keen to show healthy figures for the third year in a row, has sent the message to all officers across the board  rake in as much money as possible before the fiscal year ends on March 31. 
    
	The advance-booking announcement was made through an internal commercial circular on January 10, but the scheme will be effective from February 1.
    
	The ministry has asked the Centre for Railway Information Systems, which manages the reservation software, to make the necessary changes. Instructions have also been issued to the various zonal railways about the boards desire that the above change may be given wide publicity well in advance of its implementation.
    
	Sources in the railway ministry said similar instructions were issued at the same time last year. It was only done for a month last year, starting from March 1, 2007, but in view of its success in raking in the money, this time it was decided to do it for two months, beginning February 1, 2008, a source said.
    
	The circular was withdrawn in July 2007, reverting to 60 days advance booking. 
    
	All these are ways and methods of adding to the revenue so that Lalu Prasad can again claim that he can get the money without increasing passenger fares. It seems AC II fares are all set to be reduced to counter competition from low-cost airlines, an official said.
    
	Increasing the advance reservation time has not been the only method adopted to get extra money. 
    
	Through various internal circulars, the railways have been increasing freight, wharfage and demurrage charges. 
    
	Ideally, all changes in freight and other charges should be done in the budget. Thats what the budget is for. Freight rate circulars and commercial circulars used to be issued only in emergencies. Lalu Prasad has made a habit of issuing these circulars. In 2007, as many as 93 commercial circulars were issued and, in 2006, there were 106 circulars. This is against 40 in 2004, and 30 in 2003, the official said.
    
	The demurrage charges of eight-wheeled wagons have been raised from Rs 50 to Rs 100 an hour and wharfage charges nearly doubled through circulars issued on January 17. Both changes are effective from February 1. 
    
	These measures are expected to get the railways an additional Rs 500-700 crore. This will surely make Lalu Prasads budget look healthier but it will not be an honest presentation of facts and figures, the official said.

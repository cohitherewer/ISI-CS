          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Mukherjee    
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Centre will use all laws available to clamp down on terrorism in illustrating a zero-tolerance policy, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today.         
	This can be the only response to last weeks blasts in New Delhi and the explosions in Ahmedabad and Bangalore earlier. A resolution counter-measure against terrorist organisations was possible and we propose to utilise all elements of the law, the external affairs minister said.         
	Mukherjee was speaking at the Field Marshal KM Cariappa Memorial Lecture, an annual event hosted by the Indian Army, this evening shortly before heading into a meeting of the Union cabinet called to discuss the governments response to the recent attacks.         
	While Mukherjee focused on the internal response to terrorism and on international cooperation against wanton killing of innocents, finance minister P. Chidambaram said home-grown terrorism was emerging as a major threat. The ministers were speaking on Emerging India  Security and Economic Perspectives.         
	Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the Centre was not being soft on terrorism, as alleged by the BJP.         
	Chidambaram said the terrorist threat was not only externally assisted. There was the danger of the Muslim community feeling alienated after the 2002 pogrom in Gujarat and, now, even the possibility that Christians will feel disaffected.         
	Out of the hopelessness and despair of the Muslim community and, if not addressed, from the Christian community, there can rise new threats, he said. Such dissatisfaction combined with a frustration over the lack of economic development would foment terrorism, the finance minister said.         
	I have referred to the threat of home-grown terrorism.... At the risk of being accused of economic reductionism, I think the common factor has to do with the frustration over gradualism (the slow pace of economic development, Chidambaram said and noted that South Asia was unstable with Pakistan implacably opposed to India.         
	Mukherjee said the dimensions of Indias security were changing with the economys greater integration to global capital. The danger of fourth-generation warfare  a combination of foreign-inspired attacks, cyber attacks, manipulation of stock markets and proliferation  was rising.

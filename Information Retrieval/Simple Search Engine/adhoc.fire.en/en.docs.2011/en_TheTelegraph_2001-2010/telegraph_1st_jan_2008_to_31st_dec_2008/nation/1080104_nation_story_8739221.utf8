     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 3: Patna Municipal Corporation has decided to start its long-awaited anti-encroachment drive from January 7. 
    
	The civic body has already cautioned Patna residents against tying their cows and buffaloes on roadsides and raising kiosks near the roads. Though it is incumbent on the corporation to remove encroachment and maintain cleanliness, chief minister Nitish Kumar has been receiving flak for not giving the capital the makeover it deserves. 
    
	The civic body has of late received complaints of encroachments from all over the city, especially from Raja Bazaar, Boring Road, Kankerbagh and Gandhi Maidan. The PMC commissioner Rana Awadesh Singh said: We are starting a phase-wise anti-encroachment drive to make the city clean and the traffic hassle-free. Though the corporation had been carrying out drives to remove stalls frequently, shopkeepers and vendors keep coming back after gap of three-four days  he said. 
    
	The drive, the commissioner added, would start from the sprawling Gandhi Maidan, where residents often leave cattle to graze. The civic body from now on would impose heavy fines on cattle owner if their animal is found grazing there. The drive would extend to Kadamkaun, one of the busiest residential and commercial areas in the capital. 
    
	On January 8, the corporation would take its drive to Kankerbagh to remove hoarding and banners, which have been put up without permission. The body would also remove temporary cowsheds from Kajipur area. On January 11, bulldozers would move on to posh Shastri Nagar where there are too many illegal cowsheds. On January 12, hoarding and banners would be removed from Nutan Rajdhani area. The PMC would then remove encroachments near Patna Museum area on January 14.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 14: The Supreme Court today upheld the right of every Indian to go anywhere, settle anywhere and work and do business of his choice in any part of India peacefully.        
	The order comes a month after violence erupted in Maharashtra after Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena demanded that north Indian migrant labourers leave the state.        
	Decrying the growing trend towards intolerance, the court said: These days, unfortunately, some people seem to be perpetually on a short fuse and are willing to protest, often violently, about anything... on the ground that a book or painting or film, etc. has hurt the sentiments of their community.         
	These are dangerous tendencies and must be curbed with an iron hand.         
	The court made the observation while upholding a decision by the Gujarat government to shut down municipal slaughter houses in Ahmedabad for nine days during Mhah Paryushan Parv, a Jain festival.         
	The Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat and other groups had contested the ban in the high court that ruled in their favour, prompting the Hinsa Virodhak Sangh to appeal in the apex court.         
	The Jamat said many people were non-vegetarians and their right to food of their choice was an integral part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, which could not be violated at the whims and fancies of the Jain community.

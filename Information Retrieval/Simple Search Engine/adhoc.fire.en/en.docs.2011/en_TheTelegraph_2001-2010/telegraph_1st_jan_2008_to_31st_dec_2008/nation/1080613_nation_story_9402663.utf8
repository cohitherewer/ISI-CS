          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, June 12: Working tirelessly in the heart of the Naxalite den for a week, Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) finally restored power supply in Bastar today.        
	The region had plunged into darkness after rebels bombed a power tower near Barsoor in Dantewada.         
	After eight days of blackout since June 5 morning, people of Bastar heaved a sigh of relief and celebrated after bulbs finally glowed today evening.        
	Though the administration managed to restore supply immediately for essential services through generators, people had to struggle for every drop of water, as pumps could not be operated without power.         
	The power supply was finally restored, thanks to the efforts of 160 workers and senior officials of the board. They worked round-the-clock to re-erect the tower, said CSEB chairman Rajib Ranjan.         
	The chairman personally supervised the entire operation.         
	Ranjan said it was a daunting task for the board and its employees. But officials and employees showed exemplary courage and completed the work within record time, Ranjan said.         
	The pocket near Barsoor, where rebels had blown up the tower, is completely under red control. Ranjan said that no civilian had entered the area in the past 21 years. Besides, inclement weather and dense forests made the work even tougher for the power board officials, the top official added.         
	While the team was moving through the area, the rebels had ambushed employees and fired at them. The security cover and presence of additional force paved way for the power board employees to complete the work on time.         
	The production in the National Mineral Development Corporation and Essars iron ore plant located in Dantewada was restored soon after power supply resumed in the area.

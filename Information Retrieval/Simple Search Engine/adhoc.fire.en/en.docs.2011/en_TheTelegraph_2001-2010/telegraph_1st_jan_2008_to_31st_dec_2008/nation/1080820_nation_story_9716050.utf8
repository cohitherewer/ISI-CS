          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, Aug. 19: The Chhattisgarh government has denied reports that villagers stripped their sarpanch after failing to get their wages.         
	After failing to receive their dues for working under the employment guarantee scheme, angry residents of Kodva village in Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh allegedly stripped their sarpanch and paraded him naked in the village on Saturday. But the sarpanch has not lodged a complaint with the police.         
	According to reports coming in from Sarguja, about 400km from the state capital, the villagers were struggling to get wages for work completed two years ago. Under the scheme, the village panchayat had executed a number of projects in the village.         
	The sarpanch was not staying in the village and whenever we approached him, he gave petty excuses, the villagers said, adding that they even brought the matter to the notice of the senior panchayat and district officials. But all efforts were in vain.         
	On Raksha Bandhan, when the sarpanch came to the village, he faced the ire of the villagers. The sarpanch, in an inebriated condition, allegedly abused the villagers and refused to give them their due wages. This angered the villagers even more and they first bashed him up before stripping and parading him naked in the village.         
	The Sarguja administration, however, gave a new twist to the case by stating that the sarpanch had stripped and walked through the lanes in an inebriated condition. Revenue officials said that the sarpanch removed his clothes as he was drunk. Moreover, the victim has not lodged any complaint, said Sarguja inspector-general of police B.S. Mandavi.

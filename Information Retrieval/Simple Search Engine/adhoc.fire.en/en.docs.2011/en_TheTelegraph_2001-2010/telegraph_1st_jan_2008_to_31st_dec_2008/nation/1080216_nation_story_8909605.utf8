The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India, Pakistan spread wings
                                                                                                               India, Pakistan spread wings
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 15 (PTI): Delhi and Islamabad today decided to more than double the number of weekly India-Pakistan flights and add another destination in each country.        
	The neighbours signed a memorandum of understanding to increase the number of flights from 12 to 28 every week for each side.         
	Chennai will be the new destination for Pakistans designated airlines and Islamabad for Indian flights. This will take the number of destinations in either country to three.        
	The deal will facilitate direct air connectivity between the two capitals, said a joint statement issued at the end of two-day talks between civil aviation officials.        
	The two sides agreed to designate three airlines each to operate the agreed services on the specified routes. Only one airline each now operates between India and Pakistan.        
	Both sides were satisfied that the new arrangement would further the objective of facilitating people-to-people contact and business and trade activities between the two countries, the statement said.        
	It described the talks as friendly and cordial, adding that the two countries recognised the need to review and update the air services agreement in the wake of recent developments in the aviation industry.         
	The two countries agreed to meet again within a year to review the capacity and frequency framework and additional destinations in each others territory, keeping in view the market demand.        
	The Indian delegation was led by the director-general of civil aviation, Kanu Gohain, and the Pakistan team by Major General Mir Haider Ali Khan, an additional secretary in the defence ministry.

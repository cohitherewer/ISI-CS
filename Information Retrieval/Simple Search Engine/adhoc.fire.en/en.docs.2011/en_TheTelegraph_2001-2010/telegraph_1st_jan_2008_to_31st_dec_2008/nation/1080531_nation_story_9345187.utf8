          OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          Gujjar protesters block railway tracks at Bayana in Bharatpur district on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Jaipur, May 30: Two persons were killed today and 15 injured when police fired on Gujjar protesters blocking a Sawai Madhopur highway, taking the toll in the eight-day agitation to over 40.        
	The police action came when the lawkeepers tried to save one of their colleagues injured during the clashes from being taken away and lynched by the protesters.         
	Sawai Madhopur superintendent of police Jose Mohan said a mob of 2,500 Gujjars had put up the blockades near Kushalipura Darra, on the road connecting Sawai Madhopur with Sheopur in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Head constable Daya Ram, who was rescued from the protesters, was shifted to Jaipurs Sawai Man Singh Hospital where his condition was improving.         
	The protesters killed were identified as Kanhaiya Lal and Radheyshyam.        
	In Delhi, Union home minister Shivraj Patil, reviewing the situation with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and home secretary Madhukar Gupta, discussed ways to defuse the crisis. The law ministry was also consulted.        
	As the flare-up showed little signs of waning, the railways cancelled several trains. The worst hit were passengers on the Mumbai-Delhi line, where several trains, including the August Kranti Rajdhani Express, remained cancelled. Others, including the main Rajdhani, were diverted.        
	Buses on some routes, including those to Delhi, were back, though services to Alwar and Tizara remained affected. Our Delhi-Jaipur and Delhi-Bharatpur services are normal, a state transport corporation official said.        
	Leaders of the National Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, spearheading the protests, met in Jaipur and formed a team of 10 that will participate in talks with the government after consulting their leader K.S. Bainsla, who has camped in Bharatpurs Bayana.         
	Samiti spokesperson Roop Singh said lawyers would be consulted before the talks on the demand for tribal status.         
	Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Mahendra Singh Tikait was detained at Rarah in Bharatpur while he was on his way to meet Bainsla.        
	Rajasthan High Court today sent a fresh contempt notice to Bainsla and sought a reply within three weeks. This follows the governments May 26 application urging the court to take action against the retired colonel.         
	Elsewhere, around 12 persons, including policemen, were injured when Gujjar protesters clashed with security personnel in Uttar Pradeshs Firozabad district.        
	In Haryana, where two deaths occurred in yesterdays firing on a Gujjar mob in Panipat, chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda appealed for calm and restraint.

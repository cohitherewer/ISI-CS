          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Hyderabad, July 24: Prakash Karat today said Somnath Chatterjee could remain Speaker if he wanted to, but it was the partys prerogative to decide whether he stayed a CPM member.        
	The CPM general secretary was asked at a news conference here about his pre-trust vote statement that it was up to Chatterjee to decide whether he should stay Speaker.        
	To continue or not as the Speaker is his decision. It is up to him. But whether he will remain as our party member, that we will decide, Karat explained a day after the CPM had expelled Chatterjee.        
	Spokespersons for the ruling alliance have said they want Chatterjee to stay on as Speaker.        
	Karat claimed: In fact, we did not want to do anything that could intervene in his functioning as a Speaker during the trust vote period (July 21-22).        
	But the CPM chief appeared to contradict himself by appearing to suggest in the same breath that Chatterjee should have stepped down the moment the party withdrew support to the government.        
	We withdrew support to the UPA on July 9, 2008, and sat in the Opposition benches. The central committee decided that no member of the party should remain Speaker of the Lok Sabha after the withdrawal of support. We asked Somnath Chatterjee to step down as there is no record of any Opposition member ever adorning the position of Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Karat, in Hyderabad to attend a state party meeting, said.        
	He did not agree; we had no option. It is not a happy thing and unfortunate that we had to take disciplinary action against a senior member like Somnath Chatterjee.        
	Karat, however, suggested Chatterjee could appeal against his expulsion, saying: In our party constitution, there are methods and measures by which any party member can appeal against any disciplinary action.        
	The CPM chief said the tapes a TV channel allegedly possesses, purportedly showing a Samajwadi Party leader offering three BJP members Rs 3 crore each to abstain from voting, should be made public.        
	The channel should air the tapes, he said, because it is a matter of serious public concern and interest over what actually transpired.        
	Whether these charges made by the three MPs are correct or not, there are prima facie grounds for proceeding in this matter. All these are major questions. So we have demanded that this tape should be immediately made public.        
	Referring to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs allegation that the Left wanted him to become like their bonded slave, Karat said: It is sad that the Prime Minister is saying such things now. But everyone knows about his functioning during the last four years.

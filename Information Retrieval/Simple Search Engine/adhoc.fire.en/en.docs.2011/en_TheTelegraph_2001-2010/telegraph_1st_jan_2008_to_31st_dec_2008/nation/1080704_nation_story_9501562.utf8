	New Delhi, July 3: The government has raised the minimum price at which onions can be exported to try and retain more of the crop in the domestic market and thus bring its price down.        
	The minimum export price has been hiked from $160 to $185 a tonne after the politically sensitive vegetables retail price rose by two-thirds in a month.        
	Rising onion prices had cost the BJP its state governments in Delhi and Rajasthan about 10 years ago. Delhi and Rajasthan are among the six states that go to the polls this winter when the price rise may well be a major political issue.        
	Onion prices have risen from Rs 6 a kg in Delhi to Rs 10 in the past one month. The government may consider a ban on onion export or another increase in the minimum export price if its price continues to rise.        
	Traders expect vegetable and fruit prices to rise by at least 30 per cent by the weekend because of the truckers strike.        
	The new onion crop will arrive in the market in mid-November. Till then the prices may rise; hence the need to take measures, an official said.        
	During April-June, onion exports had risen by almost 25 per cent to 310,000 tonnes, helped by growing demand from Pakistan and Bangladesh and a rupee depreciation. In 2007-08, India exported nearly a million tonnes of onions out of a crop of 7.45 million tonnes.        
	The government has banned the export of maize corn after maize prices rose by 40 per cent. The ban, effective from today, stays till October 15.

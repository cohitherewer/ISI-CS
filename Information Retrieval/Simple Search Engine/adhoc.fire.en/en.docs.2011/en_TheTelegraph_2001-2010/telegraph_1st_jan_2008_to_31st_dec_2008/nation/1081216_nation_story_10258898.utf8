The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vote hope for nobodys orphans in frozen Valley
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vote hope for nobodys orphans in frozen Valley

	Awoora (Kupwara), Dec. 15: For a brisk trekker it would take no more than four hours from here to get to what they call paar  the other side, the Kashmir that Pakistan holds.         
	Khizer Ahmed motions to the tall conifers, stripped bare under winters icy embrace, and to the mountains beyond freshly powdered by snow. Through there, he says, there are tracks and there are goatherds where there are no tracks, you started mid-morning and you were there early afternoon, thats what they say.         
	The youthful Khizer smilingly swears he never took that route, but many did. Militancy was once a popularly plied trade in Kupwara and, for many, profitable too; you had to trek across for apprenticeship and accreditation. Par woh zamana gaya, he says, militancy baith gayi, aur army ka pehra bhi sakht hai. (Those days are gone, militancy is on the wane and the army vigil is very strict.)         
	Thick clusters of khaki now plug the porous mountains, so thick Awoora has even lost access to the marble mines that lie there. There was money to be made from the mines  for owners and skilled cutters and unskilled workmen  but the gun shot those opportunities to death and Awoora lies plunged in a cold hole of insufficiencies.         
	The militants profited while they could, and many of them lead prosperous lives in town, complains Haji Rasool Shah, a community elder. But theyve left us all on the dump, naa idhar ke rahe, naa udhar ke.        
	Shah is, in fact, an articulate interpreter of the many reasons why Awoora and its neighbourhood defied the boycott call so vehemently and took the vote percentage in the militant-separatist stronghold of Kupwara above 60 per cent.         
	Why not? he asks angrily, his snowy saucepan beard bristling. His gnarled workers hands are gripped tight around his kangri, the portable Kashmiri hotpot, but the empty sleeves of his rancid cloak have begun to swing theatrically to his rage. Why should we not have voted? he asks. Whatever may come of it, it is a right we have!         
	A crowd has gathered around the irate old man in the muddy, dung-laden village square; as if inspired by the presence of an audience, he launches into what becomes an extempore thesis on the befuddling voter turnout across the Valley.         
	What has come our way all these years other than misery? Look at us, look at our children, not enough to wear even in this damned cold, not enough to eat. No jobs for our sons, no schools for their children. Everyone gave up on us, militancy ruled here, nobody came, nothing happened. We became nobodys orphans. I am old enough to know politicians often dont deliver on promises, but at least they have come out to make them, thats good enough for a re-start. Anything that comes out of this will be better than nothing.         
	Were it not so unbelievably pretty  and so unremittingly cold  these clusters of habitation could have been Bihar at its worst. There is nothing that afflicts Bihar that does not afflict this far-flung patch of Kashmir, no curse that has befallen Bihar that has not settled here.         
	Poverty, disease, ignorance, the rank absence of governance and all its attendant absences  the absence of roads, of schools, of hospitals, of power, of water, of basic human dignity. Women must bear the chill to keep their shame and venture out in the wild to finish their ablutions by dark. And children, but God has blessed them with angelic armour, even in nakedness, their dignity isnt so easily snatched.         
	Awoora is not what you would expect from a story out of Kashmir; Awoora is more typically a heartland story, a story cynically and routinely forsaken for the quotidian. Awoora remains one of those many melting pots that stew and bubble over but forever remain drowned in the high-decibel rhetoric over the international dispute called Kashmir.         
	And yet, here it is, just an hour on the pitted track from the dainty district town of Kupwara, embroiled in a myriad crises, few of which have much to do with what is known to us as the Kashmir problem.         
	In the depths of Awooras wooded villages, the stock phrase-book of a Kashmir despatch can suddenly begin to sound banal and irrelevant: azaadi, self-determination, UN resolutions, diplomacy, Track II diplomacy, brinkmanship, one-upmanship, unilateral offers, bilateral talks, trilateral negotiations, conditions, pre-conditions, all of them begin to suddenly ring false and farcical.         
	What meaning could they have for Asghar Lone, a subsistence farmer, whose essential worry today is that he hasnt been able to accumulate enough firewood to last him the big freeze that is coming?         
	What good could they do to Fauzia Mir, whose cows died at the onset of winter, leaving her no prospect other than to beg for milk all season, forget the thought of the money the milk from her cows would have earned her.         
	What relevance do they have for Sarwar Leharvi, whose mud-house has crumbled to one side and who must now scurry around all day trying to gather enough timber to pull a wall and secure the holes against the wind?         
	Ah, he says, shivering in his tattered pheran. For the moment just give us electricity and a job and that will be enough.

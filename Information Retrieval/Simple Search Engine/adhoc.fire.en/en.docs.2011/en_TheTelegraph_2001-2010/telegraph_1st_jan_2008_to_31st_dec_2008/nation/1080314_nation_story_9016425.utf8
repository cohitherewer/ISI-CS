                                                                                                               Quit scar on CMC annual budget
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 13: Cuttack Municipal Corporations (CMC) general council passed the annual budget of Rs 159.34 crore on Tuesday with majority, while finance committee chairperson tendered resignation after raising contentious issues related to expenditure-income pattern of the budget.         
	The budget discussion ran barely for a day, after which it was approved in the evening by a voice vote.         
	The chairperson of the finance committee, Saraswati Barik, tendered her resignation and objected to violation of norms while preparing the budget and projected expenditure pattern.         
	Barik said: Utilisation of funds during the last fiscal was shown as Rs 172 crore, which was Rs 1.72 crore in excess to the budgetary provision.        
	Moreover, CMC officers had not taken the finance committee into confidence while preparing the budget, alleged Barik, a BJP corporator.        
	As many as 18 corporators from different parties took part in the discussion and expressed their opinion.         
	Mayor Nibedita Pradhan concluded the discussion by presenting it as a surplus budget with the expenditure pegged at Rs 159.34 crore against receipts for 2008-09 projected at Rs 160.93 crore, while carrying forward Rs 7.17 crore from the last fiscal.        
	There should be no opposition to the budget as opinions of all corporators had been sought after placing the budget estimates before the council. Not a single objection was received during the 11 days interlude, Pradhan asserted.

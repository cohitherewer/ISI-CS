The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab in IIT push for Bengal college
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pranab in IIT push for Bengal college
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     Mukherjee, Singh: Power push                                   
	New Delhi, June 21: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee has asked the human resource development ministry to upgrade a Birbhum-based private aided engineering college to an IIT.         
	Mukherjee is a member of the board of governors of the eight-year-old Birbhum Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) in Suri, which also has Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee as its president. Some HRD officials are wondering whether the institute is trying to use its star power to win itself an IIT tag.         
	But the chairman of the BIET board of governors has said the institute is seeking IIT status purely on merit. No private engineering college has ever been made an IIT.         
	We believe BIET has the credentials to be upgraded to IIT status, professor Ramaranjan Mukherjee, the chairman of the institutes board of governors, said, adding that the current administration of the BIET was ready to hand over the reins of the institute to the Centre.         
	The institute is run by a society  the Indian Centre for Advancement of Research and Education, Birbhum  registered in 1999. Pranab Mukherjee, Chatterjee and Ramaranjan Mukherjee are founding members of the society.         
	In a letter dated June 3, 2008  a day before he left for China on an official visit  the foreign minister asked HRD minister Arjun Singh to consider the Birbhum institute for conversion into an IIT. The letter  a copy is with The Telegraph  bore the stamp of Pranab Mukherjees office of minister of external affairs.         
	Citing the HRD ministrys plans to start new IITs during the 11th Five Year Plan, the minister wrote that the institute was equipped to handle the tag of one of Indias biggest education brands.         
	Although the foreign ministers Lok Sabha constituency Jangipur is in Murshidabad district, he was born in Mirati village, Birbhum. Chatterjee is a Lok Sabha MP from Bolpur in Birbhum.         
	Without going into the merits of the case, the fact that the institute is using the ministers name suggests an attempt to use the star power it has at its disposal, a senior HRD ministry official said.         
	Institute sources said an earlier request from Ramaranjan Mukherjee to the HRD ministry went unheeded.         
	The HRD ministry had announced plans to start eight new IITs, in addition to the existing seven, by 2012. Locations for the new IITs have been earmarked  Bengal is not listed as a recipient.         
	At the time the Centre was deciding on the states for the new IITs, Bengal was told it would not receive another IIT as it already had one in Kharagpur. But that argument no longer holds, with the HRD ministry planning to upgrade Banaras Hindu Universitys IT wing (BHU-IT) to an IIT, giving Uttar Pradesh its second IIT after Kanpur.         
	We have a large campus and adequate infrastructure for an IIT. We also have a very good placement record. Among all of West Bengals private engineering colleges, we rank second, Ramaranjan Mukherjee said over phone.         
	Arjun, while drafting a response to a demand from President Pratibha Patil for an all-girls IIT, had indicated that he was not averse to starting more IITs than just the eight announced.         
	The Birbhum institute, on its website, says it receives funding from the Bengal government, the Birbhum zilla parishad, the state power development corporation and from the MP local area development scheme.

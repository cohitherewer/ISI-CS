          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 16: Upbeat over its victory in the Laxmipur Assembly seat bypoll, the Congress today demanded the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik in view of the negative verdict against his government.         
	Congress managed to retain the seat reserved for ST by a slender margin of 484 votes despite the frantic efforts of the ruling BJD to win it. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had himself campaigned for his party candidate for three days.         
	While Congress candidate Purna Chandra Majhi polled 41,070 votes, his nearest rival, Bibhisan Majhi (BJD), secured 40,586 votes, according to information available from the chief electoral officers office.         
	This is a clear verdict against the government misrule and corruption, said Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee president Jaydev Jena. To prove his point, Jena pointed to the margin and the win that they snatched after six elections in the Kashipur block.         
	Naveen, however, accepted the verdict gracefully. He stressed that the Laxmipur results would have no impact on the general elections.         
	My government will continue to work for the state, he said.         
	Patnaik also thanked voters for the support and thanked party workers for working hard.         
	We would have won the bypoll by more than 20,000 margin had the ruling BJD not resorted to electoral malpractice, claimed Jena.         
	He alleged that the chief minister, along with 12 ministers and 48 ruling BJD legislators, campaigned for the bypoll and tried to misuse the official machinery to influence voters.        
	Citing an instance, Jena claimed that a tribal family in Tikiri were paid three Rs 1,000 notes by BJD leaders. The family that had not seen so much money before and handed one of the notes to a grocery shop owner for rice. That was when the gift came into the forefront, he alleged.

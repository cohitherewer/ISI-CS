     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The government is thinking of tweaking bilateral pacts with Canada, America, the UK and Australia to involve them in efforts to help women ditched by NRI husbands.
    
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury today said she was consulting external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee to formalise a plan that could be presented to these countries.
    
	The US, the UK, Canada and Australia have the largest concentrations of NRI populations. 
    
	I plan to write to Pranabda to ask him to hold consultations on the matter with all concerned parties, Chowdhury said, clarifying that she was not seeking fresh treaties with these countries but just changes in existing arrangements. 
    
	Chowdhury also said her department was planning to ask the home and law ministries to make punishment for sexual harassment stricter under the Indian Penal Code. 
    
	The Telegraph was the first to report, on January 11, that Chowdhurys ministry was looking to bring changes in the IPC sections on harassment of women to improve implementation of the law. 
    
	We want to add more teeth to the law against sexual harassment. We cannot allow guilty men to get away easily, Chowdhury said.

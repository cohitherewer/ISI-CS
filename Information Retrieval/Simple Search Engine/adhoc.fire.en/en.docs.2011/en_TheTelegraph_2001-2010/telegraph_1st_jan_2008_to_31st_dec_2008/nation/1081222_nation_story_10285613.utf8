	Lucknow, Dec. 21: Discovered, phantom schools.        
	The Uttar Pradesh education department on Thursday ordered a probe into a large number of primary schools that exist on paper but have no physical presence anywhere in the state.        
	The order followed a survey that revealed there were as many as 143 such phantom schools sanctioned by the state government in one district alone  Etah in the west.        
	District magistrate Gaurav Dayal said he had verified through his staff that none of these schools existed though they were on official records since 1999.        
	We have been receiving allegations of the existence of fake primary schools in the district. I just wanted to go for a case verification. We have detected 143 fake schools, he said.        
	Dayal said the findings of the survey had been sent to the primary education directorate. A general probe has now been ordered.         
	He added that he had withdrawn government approval for all the 143 schools.        
	An Etah-based education department source said officers fanned out across the district during the survey and found that the 143 schools neither had a building at the address they were supposed to be nor any student, teacher or other staff.        
	Primary schools in Uttar Pradesh are run either directly by the state or by trusts or individuals. Those run by trusts or individuals have to apply with documents detailing student strength, number of staff and period of operation for government sanction, which entitles them to funds for midday meals and scholarships for poor and meritorious students.        
	The meal scheme, under which lunch is provided to students till Class VIII, covers an estimated 150,000 schools in the state.        
	We fear that some unscrupulous people might have been drawing government money on the strength of these schools which did not exist, said Mohammad Omar, a senior officer in the education department. It is difficult to guess how much money might have been drained.        
	An education department source said a school trust that applies for approval has to deposit Rs 32,000 with the state. The education directorate then orders an inspection, normally carried out by district education officers who report back to the department.               
	All these procedures might have been followed. But some manipulations might have been made to get sanction for these schools, said an education officer.        
	About 3,500 private primary schools were granted sanction during the past five years.

	Teenage swimmer eyes global splash    
	A teenage swimming prodigy aims to create a splash abroad by crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and the English Channel.    
	Aakanksha Mishra, who turned 16 recently and became old enough to swim the Channel, plans to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar, from Spain to north Africa and back, a feat not many Asian swimmers have achieved.    
	The Strait is considered tougher despite being only 21km long as it is shark-infested and has very strong currents that make it difficult to swim through, the 16-year-old says.     
	Aakanksha has had a taste of the long haul back home, having swum 70km from Alibaug to Mumbai.    
	The teenager, who took up long-distance swimming in the fifth standard, has been practising between three to four hours daily.     
	This January, when Mumbai saw one of its coldest spells in years, she practised for two to three hours in the Arabian Sea to get used to the frigid waters of the Channel. She is being coached by Arjuna award winner Aarti Pradhan.         
	New front in cancer battle    
	Andhra Pradesh has opened a new flank in the battle against cervical cancer, which affects women in large numbers.    
	An immunisation programme, the first of its kind in the country, to protect adolescent girls from the malaise has been launched with the help of the World Health Organisation.    
	The drive aims to protect teenage girls against the human papillomavirus, seen as one of the major causes of the cancer.     
	The new vaccines, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, are being offered with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Health workers have fanned out into the Ranga Reddy district, near Hyderabad, and the citys slums to screen women. Around 12,000 girls are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase.    
	Tech leap for transport corp    
	The Andhra Pradesh State Road Corporation is poised to break another digital barrier with Internet reservation.    
	The corporation, recognised by the Guinness World Records as the worlds largest road transport company, has geared up to offer bus tickets at the click of a mouse as part of a larger plan to raise revenues and battle private operators.    
	The new frontier in passenger service has been crossed at a time when it turned in a profit of Rs 139 crore in 2007-08, a long way from the accumulated losses of over Rs 3,000 crore that had once pushed the firm towards collapse.    
	Now anyone can book tickets online, much like railway tickets, says managing director Dinesh Reddy. The corporation has expanded its fleet of air-conditioned buses in Hyderabad and brought in over 150 Volvos for long-haul routes to attract premium passengers.     
	The corporations technology push has been spurred by competition from private bus operators, who carry 35 per cent of all passengers. Several state ministers run buses.         
	New ground    
	The Metro raced ahead with work on its second phase last week, boring a 1,450 metre-long tunnel in a south Delhi locality.    
	Lieutenant governor Tejinder Khanna, who presided over a programme at the site, lauded the corporation for its achievements under the leadership of E. Sreedharan.    
	The tunnel dug up was between Hauz Khas and Malviya Nagar. A Metro official pointed out that machines used in this phase would be such that people are not disturbed. Even surface dislocations would be minimised.    
	MUMBAI: If you are keen on psychotherapy, a visit to Heart to Heart Centre could prove rewarding. The institute, on Ambedkar Road in Byculla (East), is organising a part-time certificate course in counselling along with sensitivity training till June 11. Time: 5.30 to 7.30pm.

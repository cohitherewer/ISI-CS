	Cuttack, Jan. 3: The dawn-to-dusk bandh, called by Cuttack shopkeepers and vendors against the entry of Reliance, evoked a near-total response in the city today. 
    
	Wholesale markets and major markets at Balubazaar Binodbihari, Nuabazaar, Deula Sahi, Malgodown and Chatra Bazaar remained shut following the bandh call by city unit of Orissa Street Vendors Federation and supported by the Federation of All Orissa Traders Association and Chhatra Bazaar Byabasayi Sangh. 
    
	Rallies were also held in front of the collectorate. The rally was presided over by Subash Singh, the federations city unit president. 
    
	Rally speakers sought a review of the government decision on Reliance and demanded the inclusion of the industries under a Regulating Act restricting its wholesale units to 10km of the city.
    
	A delegation tried to meet Collector Sujata Kartikeyan, but failed.

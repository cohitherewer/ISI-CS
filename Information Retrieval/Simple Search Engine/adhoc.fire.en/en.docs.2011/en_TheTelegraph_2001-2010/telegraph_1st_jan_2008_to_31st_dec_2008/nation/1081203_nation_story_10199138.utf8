	Patna, Dec. 2: Home is where rozi-roti (job) is, says Laxman of Bhagalpur.        
	He was among the many who boarded the Mumbai-bound Dadar Express on November 27, the day when NSG commandos were desperately trying to free the financial capital from the terrorists. Mumbai is my second home for it has given me my livelihood. Nothing can prevent me from going my home, he said.        
	Ratnesh, who works in a private factory in Mumbai and was waiting for a Mumbai-bound train at Patna railway station the following day, said: Maut ke dar se koi apna ghar aur kaam nahin chhorta (One does not leave his home and work because of fear of death).         
	Be the Mumbai-bound Lokmanya Tilak Express, Bhagalpur-Patna-Dadar Express or Patna-Kurla Express  tickets are hard to get. One will have to wait at least till December 15 or 17 to get confirmed tickets in sleeper, AC-II and AC-III classes. Only 15 tickets for Mumbai were cancelled on November 27 and 28, said a reservation clerk.

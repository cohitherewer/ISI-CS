   OUR CORRESPONDENT 
   
	Patna, Jan. 1: Four jawans of the Special Auxiliary Police (SAP) were killed and a policeman was injured in a suspected Naxalite attack at Bariyar in Munger today. 
 
	The incident took place around 2pm near Rishikund, a hot water spring considered holy by residents, near Lohchi Paharpur village under Ratanpur station, some 175km from Patna. 
 
	The four were attacked while they were returning from the spot after conducting a security check. 
 
	Twenty-five Maoists fired indiscriminately at the police jeep killing the four instantly and injuring the policeman, who was admitted to Munger hospital. 
 
	Munger superintendent of police Shalin said: We had provided security at all picnic spots. Some unidentified people carried out a surprise attack on our forces. 
 
	The identities of the jawans have not been revealed so far. The injured policeman has been identified as Suraj Pratap Singh, posted at Bariyarpur. 
 
	Shalin, however, denies that lack of preparedness led to the attack.

          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, May 5: The UPA-Left panel on the nuclear deal will, among other issues, focus on the draft IAEA safeguards agreement in the context of fuel supply assurance when it meets tomorrow.        
	Left sources said their representatives would like to hear from the government whether the fuel supply assurance was binding. Our basic issue is how can the IAEA, which is a watchdog, assure us fuel supply. They can only say the 123 Agreement takes care of it, said a Left leader.        
	The explanation will make us change our larger point of opposition to the deal that the 123 Agreement is not anchored on the (US domestic) Hyde Act.         
	Government sources said the text of the safeguards agreement might be given to the Left if they insisted on it. The government has already sent a note to the Left parties in response to the clarifications they had sought about the safeguards agreement. But Left sources said they were not convinced.         
	Another issue the Left would raise is whether the right to take corrective measures would adversely affect indigenous reactors that are not receiving imported fuel.

	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 14: A super-speciality diabetes hospital and research centre set up here in collaboration with Sweden-based Karolinska Institute, was dedicated to nation on World Diabetes Day today.        
	Set up at an initial cost of Rs 15 crore over 2 acres, the hospital and research centre will have a well-equipped 100 bed-hospital and a large outpatient block to manage 1,000 patients every day, said Alok Kanungo, the founder of the first-of-its-kind hospital in eastern India.        
	Karolinska Institute, which decides Nobel Prize in medicine, has joined hands to extend all technical support for advance research and training, said C.B. Sanjeevi, the head of diabetes research at Karolinska Institute.        
	Stephen Johnson, science attach in the Swedish embassy in New Delhi, said India and Sweden had signed a bipartite agreement in 2005 for partnering in science and technology. We can support this kind of collaborative effort, he said.        
	Kanungo, who has been recognised by US-based National Institute of Health as its principal investigator for advanced diabetes research in children, said diabetes has been spreading like wildfire, especially in India. Our country now is the diabetes hub of the world with more than 42 million people affected by the disease, he said.        
	Stating that Orissa is not untouched by this phenomenon, Kanungo said at least 10,000 type I diabetic children and 30 lakh type II diabetics are present in the state. The way the disease is growing, it may become unmanageable, he said, stressing on the urgent need to check its growth.        
	Cuttack Diabetes Research Foundation, headed by him, has come forward to set up the hospital and research centre.        
	The disease needs to be diagnosed as early as possible so that an individual can lead a productive life devoid of suffering and disability with early initiation of treatment, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik, while inaugurating the hospital.

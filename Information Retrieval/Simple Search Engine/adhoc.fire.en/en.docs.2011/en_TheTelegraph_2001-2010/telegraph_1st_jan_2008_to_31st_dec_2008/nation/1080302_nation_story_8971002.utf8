          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 1: A PIL was today filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for farmers announced in yesterdays budget.         
	Advocate M.L. Sharma alleged in his petition that the waiver was discriminatory as it was restricted to only 4 crore of the countrys 74 crore farmers. It left out the landless and marginal farmers and those who had taken loans from private moneylenders or commercial banks.         
	The PIL lists the Reserve Bank of India, the finance ministry, minister P. Chidambaram and the Securities and Exchange Board of India as parties.        
	The RBI had said no bank had any outstanding agricultural debt till February 29, 2008, Sharma argued.         
	Moreover, the petition alleged, the sum of Rs 60,000 crore had been arbitrarily fixed without any data collected on the exact amount of farmers loans.         
	It shows that it is only a political eyewash to withdraw hard-earned public money from the treasury in the name of farmers, it said.         
	The PIL urged the apex court to ask the authorities to explain the basis on which the amount had been arrived at.

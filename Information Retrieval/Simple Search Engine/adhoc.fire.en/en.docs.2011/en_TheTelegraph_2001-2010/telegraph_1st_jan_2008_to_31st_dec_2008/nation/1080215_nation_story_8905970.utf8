          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 14: Valentines Day couples made merry in Mumbai as the outsider controversy kept the moral police distracted, but Raj Thackeray was sainik enough to rebuff the special V-Day message that came to him.        
	It was a bouquet of roses from Patnas Love Guru, Batuknath Chaudhary, 54. The Hindi professor (now suspended) was caught by his wife and police with his student and lover Julie while the entire drama was beamed live on TV.        
	I heard Raj wanted to shoo away north Indians. So, Ive come to Mumbai to meet him, said Batuknath, who now counsels lovers. I am willing to learn Maharashtrian culture and the Marathi language. My only condition is that whatever Raj has to say to us, he should say with love.        
	Rajs guards took the bouquet but shooed him away.        
	Young couples, however, felt slightly grateful. I dont want to sound insensitive, but Im glad that all the politicians are busy. I went to an Archies shop and bought cards with no fear of getting beaten up, said Ajay Saxena, 23.         
	But the Shiv Sena had to put up a show after Bal Thackeray blasted the rotten alien culture of celebrating V-Day in party mouthpiece Saamna.        
	TV channels, informed beforehand, waited before colleges to watch local goons arrive and burn cards they had brought with them.

	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Indias National Security Guards would have found themselves in unfamiliar theatres of operation while trying to rescue hostages from the two Mumbai luxury hotels and a residential building, counter-terrorism experts said.         
	And live television coverage of commando activities, at times portraying their minute-by-minute movements, could have further handicapped security forces, said a British sociologist whose research is focused on media coverage of terrorism.         
	Armed with sophisticated weapons and backed by superior training, the elite NSG, or Black Cat, commandos prepare through the year for hostage-rescue operations, but hotels werent really on the list of vulnerable sites, a former top NSG officer said.         
	As part of routine training exercises, the NSG studies layouts of a number of sites including airports and aircraft, Parliament, railway stations, and even the Taj Mahal.         
	But hotels had so far not been considered vulnerable places, Ashish Kumar Mitra, former director-general of the NSG, told The Telegraph.         
	This would have influenced the pace of action, he said.

	As a bunch of NSG commandos slithered down ropes this morning from a helicopter to reach the rooftop of Nariman House, one of the three sites under siege by the terrorist gunmen, television cameras captured their moves on the rooftop.         
	The terrorists could have had a greater sense of whats going on around them, said Andrew Hoskins, associate professor at the University of Warwick in the UK, who has studied how real-time coverage can influence the course of such events.         
	Television has the potential to shape such events. The coverage feeds into the incident. It can transform the dynamics of such terrorism-related events, especially while it is still happening, Hoskins said.         
	The live images of commandos trying to approach the buildings under siege could have alerted terrorists  either directly through television channels or through alerts issued by any collaborators in touch via mobile phones, a counter-terrorism expert said.         
	For commandos, it would have made the job harder, the expert said.         
	Such an operation is likely to have been slow primarily because of the fear of harming any of the hostages or the hotel guests trapped inside.         
	The NSG commandos were in a building they were not very familiar with, and would have had to distinguish between hostages and the terrorist gunmen who were also in plain clothes before deciding to shoot at anyone.         
	One security analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, said India should have raised its level of alertness after a truck with explosives detonated in front of the Marriott hotel in Islamabad in September this year.         
	Clearly, foreigners were the targets at the Marriott, the analyst said. Someone should have thought about increasing security at luxury hotels in India.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, Sept. 14: Members of Western Orissa Contractors Association and All Odisha Contractors Association have threatened to cease work if the government does not stop its step-motherly treatment towards them.        
	Contractors of the two associations have been complaining of the price rise of material, such as brick, cement, iron rod and bitumen. We incur a loss of Rs 3 lakh in the construction of a kilometre-stretch of metal road due to the rise in the price of bitumen, said Anup Babu, the Odisha association co-ordinator. The only way left for us is to cease work, Babu said.         
	The members alleged that in Orissa, contractors pay heavy taxes while purchasing materials. Add to that the government deducts 4 per cent extra as value added tax (VAT) from the bill  2 per cent more than the rest of the country.        
	The idea of the corrupt contractor is a myth. Most of us are knee-deep in debt and our homes are mortgaged because we take risks for a better society, said Prabhat Das, the president of the All Odisha Contractors Association.         
	Without contractors development projects cant be imagined. We are the ones who suffer a bad reputation and we are the ones who suffer from price rise and inflation. And the government hardly seems bothered regarding our needs, said Jagdip Bansal, the convener of Western Odisha Contractors Association.         
	If the project quality is weak, blame the officers. Audit assessment of property of a junior engineer or that of a special-class of contractors will reveal the truth, said a contractor on condition of anonymity.

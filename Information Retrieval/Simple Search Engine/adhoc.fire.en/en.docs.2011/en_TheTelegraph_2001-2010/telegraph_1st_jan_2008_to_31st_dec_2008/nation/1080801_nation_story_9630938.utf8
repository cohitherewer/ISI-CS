          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, July 31: Land price in most parts of the state would go up from tomorrow.        
	A hike of 10 to 15 per cent of the official value of land in most of the urban and rural areas would be implemented with the government empowering deputy commissioners and district registrars concerned to execute the same.        
	While many districts are through with new valuation of land rates  both in terms of area and category, many others, including Ranchi, are still to follow it.         
	However, the rate of registration that includes stamp duty and court fee, would remain unchanged at maximum 5 per cent. One per cent is existing court fee while the stamp duty is 4 per cent. But with increase in the valuation of land, the prospective buyers of property would have to shell out more to get their properties registered in the court of district sub-registrar.        
	A hike of 10 to 15 per cent would be imposed from tomorrow. District authorities were informed to effect the same, said Sudhir Prasad, the inspector-general (registration).        
	An exhaustive list of districts that would effect new rates from August was not available but sources said that East Singhbhum is going to implement the new rates from tomorrow while Ranchi is yet to prepare a proposal at the level of circle offices and deputy collector (land revenue).        
	Prospective buyers of property were apprehensive that new land valuation rates would be implemented from August 1. But Ranchi deputy commissioner Avinash Kumar said a proposal by circle offices and deputy collector (land revenue) concerned is yet to come for his consideration.        
	Sources said action might be initiated against erring deputy commissioners who fail to implement the new rates from August 1.         
	Earlier, the value of land was decided by individual districts any time of the year. But now the department has decided to effect new rates once a year on August 1, said D.K. Toppo, the deputy secretary in registration department.

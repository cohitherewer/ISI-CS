	New Delhi, Dec. 8 (PTI): The poll results this time were delayed compared to previous elections because of random checks of electronic voting machines introduced by the Election Commission.        
	Counting in EVMs does not take more than four hours for an Assembly seat. But in many Delhi seats, it took six hours. The poll observer randomly checks two EVMs after each round of counting, returning officer Bhupinder Singh said.

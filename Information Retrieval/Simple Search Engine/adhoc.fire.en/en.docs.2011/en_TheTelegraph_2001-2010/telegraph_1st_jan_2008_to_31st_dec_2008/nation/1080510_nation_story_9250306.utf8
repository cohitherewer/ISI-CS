	Bhubaneswar, May 9: The state government has decided to involve self-help groups (SHG) run by women in managing mid-day meal programmes in primary schools.         
	On the womens empowerment front, Orissa has topped the list of states in the eastern region. It has been able to form over 3.30 lakh SHGs mobilising more than 35 lakh members as a part of Mission Shakti, revealed a review undertaken by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today.         
	The chief minister directed the officials of Mission Shakti to expedite the formation of a federation for the SHGs to strengthen them and hold district conventions for better co-ordination. He also laid stress on involving members in the midday meal programme, malaria eradication, nutrition, sanitation and reduction of infant as well as maternal deaths.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 14: Mamata Banerjee today said she would participate in the July 22 confidence motion and vote keeping in mind the interest of the people of Bengal.        
	Mine will be a crucial decision since one or two votes are considered crucial, she said at her Kalighat home.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief said she would leave for Delhi after July 21, when she is to address an Esplanade rally to mark the death of 13 Youth Congress activists in police firing in 1993.        
	Party sources confirmed Mamata would not abstain from voting. We have been told she will leave either on July 21 night or the next morning, a Trinamul leader said.        
	Mamata had earlier said she hadnt decided whether to participate. A close Mamata aide said Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh had called her with a request to vote for the government but denied knowledge about senior Congress leaders contacting her from Delhi.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Policemen and a bomb disposal squad check explosives seized from a car in Surat on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Ahmedabad, July 27: A failed plan in Surat has put investigators on an inter-state trail of vehicles suspected to have been used in the Ahmedabad explosions.        
	Surat police today seized two cars with RDX and detonators packed in separate bags  the bombs were yet to be made.         
	Sources said the seized vehicles bore fake numbers from Vadodara but their authentic registration had been traced to Maharashtra. Both vehicles were CNG-run WagonR cars.         
	A connection between Surat and Ahmedabad lies here. It was a CNG-run WagonR that was reduced to mangled steel outside Civil Hospital last evening, killing many people. The car seized by Surat police with a can of RDX is also a CNG-run WagonR. The car has enough boot space to carry gas cylinders similar to those found at the Civil Hospital today.         
	Investigators believe that the vehicle in Ahmedabad, which also bore a fake registration plate from Vadodara, was from Maharashtra and bought by the same people who got the vehicles to Surat.        
	At least two people have been arrested, police sources said.        
	Soon after the Surat seizure, Gujarat police alerted their Maharashtra counterparts. They are now fully involved, an official said.        
	Till now, it was only the anti-terrorist squad of Maharashtra police that was cooperating with Gujarat police.        
	Gujarat police are now realising their mistake in not attending the review meeting the home ministry convened last week. State officials could then have exchanged information with both Karnataka and Maharashtra, although it is not clear whether the two states had any intelligence on the impending attacks.        
	A link with the Bangalore explosions was also thrown up this morning.        
	When bomb-defusing experts from the CRPF and local police were sifting through the remains of the WagonR car outside Civil Hospital, they found 18 unexploded electrical detonators.         
	Such multiple detonators were found in Bangalore also, and the bomb in a block of concrete found there was also a new thing, the director of the National Security Guard (NSG) and the national bomb data centre, J.K. Dutt, told The Telegraph over phone.        
	Although the concrete bomb was not found in Ahmedabad, the police can now be on the lookout for such objects, the investigators said.        
	Other sources said Gujarat police should have learnt from the experience of Rajasthan and taken into the account the possibility of hospitals being attacked.        
	Militants had planned an attack on a hospital in Jaipur also during the serial blasts in May, but Rajasthan police had defused the bomb outside the facility then.

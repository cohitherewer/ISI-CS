	Mumbai, Oct. 12: Amitabh Bachchan is responding well to treatment and may be back home by Wednesday, Lilavati Hospital doctors said today.        
	Blood tests and abdominal scan reports have not shown abnormalities and there may not be any need for surgery, the doctors said a day after Bachchan was admitted with abdominal pain. He turned 66 yesterday.        
	This afternoon, Lilavatis vice-president Narendra Trivedi issued a bulletin, saying: Amitabh Bachchan had a restful night. The doctors attending on him are pleased with his recovery. The tests do not suggest any abnormality. Under the circumstances, medicines have worked. Within a few days, he should go home.        
	Wife Jaya stayed overnight in suite No. 1101 with the actor. This morning, Abhishek arrived and was informed about the line of treatment and the medication being given to his father. Actor-director Tinnu Anand also spent a few hours in the hospital.         
	Bachchan had some food today, the doctors said.         
	A hospital spokesperson brushed off queries on the exact nature of Bachchans ailment, stressing he was recovering well. How does it matter what the medical condition is when doctors are satisfied with the progress and he has responded well to the treatment?         
	Later, he hinted the information on the ailment was not being disclosed to maintain confidentiality. However, hospital sources said the actor was being treated for suspected bowel dysfunction.        
	We have already performed ECG and 2D Echo to assess his heart condition. While ECG has been found to be normal, diastolic dysfunction has been detected in 2D Echo, a source said.        
	The actor was initially put up in the more expensive 1106, in which his late mother Teji Bachchan had been admitted until her death, but he asked for a change, the source added. A day in suite No. 1106 costs Rs 12,500 and in No. 1101 Rs 8,500, sources said.        
	Bachchan has been suffering from abdominal complications since 1982 after an intestinal injury sustained on the sets of Manmohan Desais Coolie. In 2005, he had to undergo an abdominal surgery.         
	The actor has at least three films in various stages of production  Leena Yadavs Teen Patti, Sujoy Ghoshs Alladin, and Shoojit Sircars Shoe Bite.

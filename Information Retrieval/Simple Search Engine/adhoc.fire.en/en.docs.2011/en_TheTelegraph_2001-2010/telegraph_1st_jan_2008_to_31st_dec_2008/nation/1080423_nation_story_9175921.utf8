The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi snubs US on Iran
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi snubs US on Iran
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Ahmadinejad                                   
	New Delhi, April 22: India today told America it didnt need any guidance on dealings with Iran after a senior state department official hoped Delhi would ask Tehran to be more responsible during President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads visit next week.        
	A terse statement by the foreign ministry spokesman said India and Iran were ancient civilisations whose relations spanned centuries.        
	Both nations, the ministry statement added, were perfectly capable of managing all aspects of their relationship with the appropriate degree of care and attention.        
	The sharp reaction  bound to gladden the Left which had seen red when Delhi voted with the West on Irans controversial nuclear programme nearly three years ago  followed comments by state department deputy spokesman Tom Casey on what Washington hoped Delhi would tell Tehran.        
	Casey, who was asked if the Bush administration had sent a message to Delhi about Ahmadinejads visit, said the US expected India to tell the Iranian leader to suspend his countrys uranium enrichment activities in line with the demands of the UN Security Council.        
	Washington, he added, would also encourage Delhi to ask Tehran to become a more responsible actor on the world stage by ending its rather unhelpful activities regarding support for terrorism, including organisations like the Hezbollah and the Hamas, and with respect to Iraq.        
	Casey, however, didnt elaborate on the Iraq link.        
	We would hope that the Indian government, or any government that was engaging with the Iranians, including with President Ahmadinejad, would call on him to meet the requirements that the Security Council and the international community have placed on him in terms of suspending their uranium enrichment activities and complying with other requirements regarding their nuclear programme, the American official said.         
	The Indian foreign ministry responded by saying neither country needed any guidance on the future conduct of bilateral relations as both countries believe engagement and dialogue alone lead to peace.        
	It is important that the genius of each nation living in a particular region is respected and allowed to flower to meet the expectations of enriching relations with neighbours, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said.         
	The situation in the region has always drawn the attention of both the nations and it can be seen perfectly well that these have been managed through continuous dialogue and exchange of delegations at various levels, the foreign ministry statement added.        
	Sources said the government had to come out with such a statement to ward off criticism that America was dictating the Congress-led coalitions foreign policy.        
	Who are they (the US) to tell us? They may have an opinion but they cannot direct India to do something, bristled CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.        
	Casey, however, said it was up to India to decide how to manage bilateral ties with Iran.

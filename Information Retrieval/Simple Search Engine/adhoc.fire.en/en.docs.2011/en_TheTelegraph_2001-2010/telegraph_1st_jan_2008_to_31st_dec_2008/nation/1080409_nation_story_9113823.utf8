          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 8: India today loosened its purse strings for bolstering its presence in Africa.         
	Delhi hopes that by doubling aid and allowing preferential treatment in trade for the African continent, it will leave an imprint where China enjoys the first-mover advantage. Beijing held a similar conclave in 2006, the year India conceived this summit.         
	India wishes to see the 21st century as the century of Asia and Africa with the people of the two continents working together to promote inclusive globalisation, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today at the inauguration of the first India-Africa Forum Summit.         
	He announced to the audience  among them five presidents, including South Africas Thabo Mbeki, and senior leaders from nine other African countries and the African Union Commission chairman Alfa Oumar Konare  a slew of measures aimed at economic development in the continent.         
	The Prime Minister said the credit to Africa would be increased to $5.4 billion in the next five years from $2.15 billion in the preceding five years. Between 2003-04 and 2008-09, we have extended lines of credit amounting to $2.15 billion. Over the next five years, we will more than double this amount and offer additional lines of credit amounting to $5.4 billion, both bilaterally and to the regional economic communities of Africa, Singh said in his speech in English that was later made available in French and Urdu.         
	Singh also announced a duty-free tariff preference scheme for least developed countries. Under this scheme, India shall unilaterally provide preferential market access for exports from all 50 least developed countries, 34 of which are in Africa.         
	The products covered in the plan include aluminium and copper ore, cotton, cocoa, readymade garments, non-industrial diamonds and cashew nuts.         
	He said the initiative was being announced as India recognised the crucial importance of market access in ensuring the development dimension of international trade.         
	The Prime Minister said India would enhance aid to the Africa budget of the foreign ministry for implementing projects in critical areas, focusing on human resource development and capacity building. Over the next five to six years, we propose to undertake projects against grants in excess of $500 million, he said.         
	No one understands better than India and Africa the imperative need for global institutions to reflect current realities and to build a more equitable global economy and polity, Singh said, in what seemed to be a reminder on Delhis ambitions for a seat in an expanded UN Security Council.         
	Our enemy is common. We both have poverty and underdevelopment, he said, echoing concerns raised by African Union commissions chairman Konare.

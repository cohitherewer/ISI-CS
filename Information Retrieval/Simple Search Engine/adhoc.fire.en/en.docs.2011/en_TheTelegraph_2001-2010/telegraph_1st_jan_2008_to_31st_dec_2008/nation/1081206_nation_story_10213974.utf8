                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Russia joins call for world to act

	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The Russian President by his side, Manmohan Singh today continued to try and ratchet up global pressure on Pakistan, asking the world to recognise that the territory of the neighbouring country was used to launch the Mumbai attack.        
	A joint Indo-Russian statement later asked all states (countries) to co-operate actively in bringing those behind the horror to justice.        
	Asked what Delhi planned to do, the Prime Minister referred to the demarche Pakistan had been handed to act against 20 of Indias most wanted fugitives, suspected to be hiding in Pakistan.        
	We will wait for the outcome, he said.        
	At the joint news conference with Dmitry Medvedev, the first head of state to visit India after the Mumbai attack, Singh said: I have impressed upon all the world leaders who called me that people of India feel a sense of hurt and anger as never seen before due to the Mumbai terror strikes. We expect the international community to recognise that terrorism anywhere and everywhere constitutes a threat to world peace.        
	He said without naming Pakistan: We expect the world community to recognise  and other countries have come to the same conclusion  that the territory of the neighbouring country has been used for perpetrating this crime.        
	To a questioner, he replied: Its the obligation of all countries concerned that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to book.        
	The joint statement echoed this: Both sides call upon all states to co-operate actively with and provide support and assistance to the Indian authorities in their efforts to find and bring the perpetrators, organisers, sponsors, patrons or those in any way connected to these barbaric acts to justice in India in accordance with the obligations under international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions on fighting terrorism.        
	Singh appreciated Medvedevs expression of solidarity with India. We both agreed that these attacks represent a threat to all open and pluralistic societies, he said.        
	Delhi and Moscow signed a civil nuclear deal under which the Russians will build four additional nuclear reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu.        
	The agreement marks a new milestone in the history of our co-operation in the field of nuclear energy, Singh said.        
	Accords were signed on the sale of 80 helicopters to India and co-operation in areas including space exploration, financial markets and tourism.        
	Medvedev, on his first India visit, hoped the arms pact would be extended for the next 10 years. Our prime task is to move from buy-sell to joint production and development in missile and aircraft development, he said.        
	Some issues remain, but not many, Medvedev said. We have agreed that we will keep these issues under joint control and fully co-operate with each other.

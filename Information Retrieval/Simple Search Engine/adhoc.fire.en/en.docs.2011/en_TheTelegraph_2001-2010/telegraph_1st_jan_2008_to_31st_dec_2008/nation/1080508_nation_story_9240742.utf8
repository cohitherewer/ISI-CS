The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Medical test before probe for gangster
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Medical test before probe for gangster

	Bhubaneswar, May 7: When Raja Acharya was escorted out of Biju Patnaik Airport around 10.30am this morning, all eyes were on him.        
	But, all that people could see were a pair of alert eyes peeping from a half-masked face and an arrogant gait.        
	Two days after his Goa arrest the key accused in the Biranchi Das murder was brought to the state capital by Orissa police amid tight security usually reserved for VIPs.         
	The airport was teeming with people and platoons of police  both in uniform and in civil clothes. Surrounded by police from all sides, Raja was spotted sporting a glossy pink shirt with a bag hanging from his back. Raja obliged the waiting media and added to the airport drama by shouting two names  Priyabrata Pattnaik and Leslie  before being pushed into a van.         
	In no time the van made rounds of different police stations apparently to confuse the media before it arrived at the assistant commissioners (ACP) office in the Infocity-I.        
	After the arrival, like in case of any VIP, the place was cordoned off with two platoons of police, while all traffic movement was halted in the area.         
	Reports state that the gangster would be medically examined before being produced at the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court here. We will be applying for a 10-day remand at the court and afterwards begin interrogation, said ACP Suresh Mohapatra.         
	Mohapatra headed the five-member escort team that went to Panaji to bring Raja on a five-day transit remand. By the time Orissa police had reached Panaji Raja had already been sent to judicial custody. Our team had to submit a petition before the local court seeking Rajas remand, said Mohapatra         
	Raja is likely to go through a narco-analysis test and brain mapping as the police suspect that the gangster has been attempting to confuse the investigation by bringing in prominent names, including that of former police commissioner Binay Behera.         
	The interrogation that would commence from the evening, in all likelihood, would make things stormier in the state.        
	The demand for a CBI probe into the murder of Biranchi Das gathered fresh impetus when a PIL for it was filed in Orissa High Court. Earlier, former inspector-general of police Anadi Sahu had demanded a CBI probe alleging that the Orissa police were delaying action and were being shackled by the presence of bureaucrats in the case. Sahu, a former Lok Sabha MP from Cuttack, is now an NCP leader. The Congress had also demanded a CBI probe.         
	Manas Ranjan Sahoo (28) of Patla in Dhenkanal filed the PIL, which is yet to be taken up for hearing.        
	Cop shifted        
	Inspector-general of police (crime branch) B.K. Sharma was appointed the police commissioner for Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, replacing Binay Behera.         
	Behera will be the inspector-general (technical) in place of S. Panwar, who replaced Sharma as the IG (crime branch). Sharma will now interrogate Raja Acharya.

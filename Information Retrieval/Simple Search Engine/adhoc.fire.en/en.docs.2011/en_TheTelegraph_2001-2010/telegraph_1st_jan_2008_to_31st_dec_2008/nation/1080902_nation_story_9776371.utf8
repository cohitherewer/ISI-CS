          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Women walk through a market in Jammu that re-opened on Monday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 1: Ram Sahai faces a tough task as Jammu returns to normality after a two-month agitation. The head of the Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry must bring trade and industry back on rails and, more important, rebuild the bridges with Kashmir.        
	Jammu, paralysed for 40 days, bounced back to normality today with traffic on the roads, students headed for schools and employees for their offices, and shoppers queuing outside stores.        
	Schools and colleges will hold extra classes, and city authorities have made cleaning the piled-up garbage and removing the barricades their top priorities.        
	However, behind the continuing celebrations of the victory lies a palpable sense of unease. Sahai puts the agitation bill at Rs 10,380 crore. Our industry lost Rs 4,500 crore, tourism and related sectors Rs 3,000 crore, trade Rs 1,150 crore, agriculture Rs 980 crore and transport Rs 750 crore, he said.        
	Anil Suri, the president of the Federation of Industry, said it would take about a month to bring industry back on rails. Many skilled workers have left the state and they need to come back. We could not keep our export commitments, and our image has to be restored, he said.        
	One concern shared by Sahai, Suri and many others is about repairing relations with Kashmir, where curfew stayed in place for the ninth consecutive day and protests were held at some places.        
	I shall visit Kashmir to meet my friends there, Sahai said. It is my priority to revive our relations with Kashmir.        
	Kashmiri traders are boycotting products from Jammu. Since Kashmir has no industries, it relies heavily on imports from Jammu and other states. Since Kashmir is a good market for MNCs, we are approaching them to do business directly with the Valley, said Mubeen Shah, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	We plan to create industries based on local raw material and boost our agricultural production. We also want the LoC opened for trade.        
	Trade union leader Jan Muhammad Koul said: Unless we have an alternative, such as the opening of the Muzaffarabad road, a boycott will not work.        
	Hurriyat leader freed        
	The government today freed Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani as a goodwill gesture ahead of Ramazan. Officials said Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik would be released soon.

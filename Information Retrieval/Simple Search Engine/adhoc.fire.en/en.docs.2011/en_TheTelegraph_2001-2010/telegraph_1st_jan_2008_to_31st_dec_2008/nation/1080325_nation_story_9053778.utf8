	Calcutta, March 24: A Nigerian who bought mobile phones worth Rs 1 lakh three days ago and again turned up to look for a new model at another city store today was arrested for using someone elses credit card.        
	Richard Davis, 27, who also identified himself as Christopher during interrogation at Bhowanipore police station, went to an Elgin Road mobile store with another person three days ago and ran up a bill of around Rs 1 lakh.         
	He paid using a credit card. But the bank informed the store later that the card did not belong to the buyer and the store owner lodged a complaint, said a police officer.         
	Daviss luck ran out this afternoon when he went looking for another hi-tech device at a Wood Street mobile store.         
	The store did not have the model. But not to lose a premium customer, it called up its Elgin Road associate for the set. The shop owner also said he needed the handset fast as a foreigner was waiting for it, said the officer.         
	Last weeks fraud fresh in his mind, the Elgin Road shop owner asked for the customers description. From the deatils of the height, build and looks he was given, he was sure that it was Davis.         
	He called up the police and a team from Shakespeare Sarani police station arrived at the Wood Street store.         
	Davis neither had a passport nor any document to prove his tourist status.         
	The police confirmed with the Elgin Road store that it was indeed the same Richard Davis who had purchased handsets with a credit card that did not belong to him.        
	We have arrested him and started a case. Security Control has been told to get details about his stay in Calcutta, a senior Bhowanipore police officer said.        
	He says he is a Nigerian and his passport says he is from Pretoria in South Africa. We are questioning him, the officer added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: A cellphone-based application of technology for generation of data for disaster management developed by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) was launched here today.        
	NRSC is using this unique device for the first time in the country for creating a database of relief shelters, hospitals and supply godowns in Puri district on a pilot basis.         
	On completion of this project, it will be replicated in about 300 multi-hazard-prone districts by the National Disaster Management Authority for creating such database.        
	Launching the project at a state-level function organised here to observe Orissa Disaster Preparedness Day and National Day for Disaster Reduction on the occasion of the ninth anniversary of 1999 supercyclone, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the instrument, designed by the Indian Space Research Organisation, is a combination of a medium resolution camera, a geostationary positioning system, a palm-top computer and a cellphone.         
	By this simple instrument, information from the field with photographs and geographic co-ordinates can be collected and sent to a central server through the available cellphone network which can be used on geographic information system platform for an online decision support system.        
	NRSC group director G. Behera said the device could be used to know the exact location of relief shelters, hospitals and supply godowns along with data on the capacity and facilities available there, which is essential for effective disaster management.        
	The NRSC, in collaboration with the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority, Sophitorium Institute of Technology  a local technical education institute  and Life Skills, has taken up the pilot project in Puri district, said Behera.        
	This model collaboration of using the capability of a local educational institution in partnership with the state government would keep the cost of database low and would provide a real-life learning exercise to the students, he said, adding that the cost of the pilot project was around Rs 3 lakh.        
	Naveen announced that 50 shelter homes would be built in flood-prone areas, for which Rs 23 crore had been sanctioned from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund. Officials had been instructed to complete construction of these school-cum-flood shelters before the next monsoon, he said.

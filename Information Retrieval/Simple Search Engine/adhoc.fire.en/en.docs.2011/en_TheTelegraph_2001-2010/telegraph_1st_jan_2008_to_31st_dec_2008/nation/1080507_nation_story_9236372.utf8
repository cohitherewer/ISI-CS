	New Delhi, May 6: The womens reservation bill, introduced today in the Rajya Sabha a decade after it died a violent death in the Lok Sabha, is still at the mercy of men.        
	Its the male MPs, many of whom openly opposed the bill or secretly blocked its re-tabling, who will now decide its fate when the legislation goes to a parliamentary standing committee for scrutiny.        
	There isnt a single woman on the standing committee on law and justice. The 31-member body has 24 men and seven vacancies.        
	The implication is not that these men will gang up to strangle the bill, which reserves a third of seats in Parliament and state legislatures for women. But the panels composition shows how thin womens representation in parliamentary functioning is.        
	The reason cannot be that only legal experts are allowed on the committee  after all, it boasts such illustrious members as Sadhu Yadav along with the veteran lawyer Ram Jethmalani.        
	Sadhu has no lesser a role to play than Jethmalani, though. He represents Lalu Prasad  not as his brother-in-law but as the flag-bearer of the Rashtriya Janata Dal chiefs opposition to the bill.        
	Lalu Prasad, whose championship of womens causes has been restricted to elevating wife Rabri Devi as Bihar chief minister, has vowed to block the bill unless it includes an Other Backward Classes sub-quota.        
	Women MPs fear the committee might delay the bill further. The BJPs Sushma Swaraj argued against the legislation being sent to the panel, citing that a joint parliamentary committee had already studied it.        
	She met the Prime Minister in the Rajya Sabha chairpersons chamber today and requested him to ensure that the bill was passed in the monsoon session. Manmohan Singh took credit for the bill being tabled in the budget session but said the timing would now depend on the standing committee.        
	Having a few women on the committee might have speeded up the proceedings.         
	If the bill isnt passed in the monsoon session, the women would be unlikely to get the reservation in the next general election.        
	Besides, a broad political consensus is a must for the bills passage. A Constitution amendment bill cannot be pushed through amid din; it cannot even be taken up for consideration unless two-thirds of all the MPs are present.        
	Its now up to the government to bring around parties like the RJD, Janata Dal (United) and the Samajwadi Party before the monsoon session.        
	The one good thing is that a bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha, unlike one tabled in the Lok Sabha, does not lapse.        
	The standing committee is headed by the Congresss E.M.S. Natchiappan. Its members from the Lok Sabha are: Raj Babbar, Shafiqur Rehman, N.S.V. Chitthan, Chhatar Singh Darbar, N.Y. Hanumanthappa, S.K. Kharventha, C. Krishnan, A. Krishnaswamy, Shailendra Kumar, Dahya V. Patel, Harin Pathak, Varkala Radhakrishnan, M. Ramadoss, Vishvendra Singh, Bhupendrasinh Solanki and Sadhu Yadav.        
	The Rajya Sabha members, apart from Natchiappan, are: Tariq Anwar, Bal Apte, Virendra Bhatia, Ram Jethmalani, Radhakant Nayak, Tarlochan Singh and Abhisek Singhvi.

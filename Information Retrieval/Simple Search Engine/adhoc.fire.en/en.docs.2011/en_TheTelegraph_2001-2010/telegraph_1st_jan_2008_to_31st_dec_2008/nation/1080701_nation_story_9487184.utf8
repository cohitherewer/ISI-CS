                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Madarsa blame game after PMO stick
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Hit by Delay                                  
	New Delhi, June 30: Arjun Singhs ministry has begun a blame game with the Planning Commission after a rap from the Prime Ministers Office for persistent delay over a madarsa upgrade scheme.        
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry has accused the plan panel of sitting for 10 months on the scheme, which looks to computerise madarsas and include science, math and vocational courses in their curriculum.        
	Plan panel officials, however, blame the delay on the ministry, saying it had sent a poor proposal that required repeated clarifications.        
	The Prime Ministers Office had sent a stinging letter on June 25 asking the ministry to explain the delay within five days.         
	An official said the ministrys response seeks to explain that the Planning Commission, and not us, are to blame for this embarrassing delay.        
	The ministrys letter cites a 10-month period, from August 2007 till earlier this month, when the scheme was being examined by the plan panel.        
	We have pointed out that the Planning Commission has been sitting on the scheme. If they had cleared the scheme earlier, we might have implemented the programme by now, the ministry official said.        
	The ministry itself is to blame for the time we took to clear the plan, a commission official alleged.        
	If we took time, it was because the ministry submitted a poor proposal, which needed repeated clarifications.        
	With the plan panel having given its go-ahead to the Rs 45.45-crore scheme  the clearance arrived before the June 25 rap  the ministry has told the PMO it would try and obtain finance ministry approval by July 10.        
	We hope to present the scheme before the cabinet by the end of July, the official said. Once it is cleared by the cabinet, the scheme can be launched.        
	The UPA government had pledged a large-scale madarsa modernisation in its common minimum programme when it came to power in 2004. It has become more urgent after the Sachar committee highlighted the backwardness among Muslims.        
	Sources said a PMO letter seeking an explanation from a ministry rarely sets a deadline for response. A notice period as short as five days is particularly rare, they said.        
	One reason for the hurry, however, could be the uncertainty over the governments survival because of the nuclear deal standoff.        
	The principal secretary to the Prime Minister is extremely unhappy with the delay in the scheme, the PMO said.

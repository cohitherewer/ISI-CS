The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wanted: hangman to execute
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wanted: hangman to execute
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, May 27: The Bhagalpur central jail is preparing to carry out the death sentence of Prajeet Kumar Singh for murdering his neighbours three children in 1998, but lack of a hangman has become its headache.         
	We have already received the black warrant for Prajeets execution. An execution should be carried out within the 28th day of the issuance of a black warrant. The Bettiah court issued the warrant on May 16, said a prison authority. Prajeet hails from Indragachhi village under Sangrampur police station in East Champaran.         
	The Bettiah sessions court awarded him death for killing his neighbours children with a sharp knife on April 18, 1998.         
	Patna High Court and Supreme Court upheld the sentence.         
	Though the Dhananjoy Chatterjee death sentence (2004) is still alive in peoples mind, Bhagalpur would be witnessing an execution after 13 years.         
	Suresh Bahri was the last man hanged there in 1995 for killing his wife and children and then drinking whisky mixed with his childrens blood in Ranchi.         
	Jagua Dom, then a jail sweeper, had carried out the execution. Ironically, Jagua, who passed away, performed the act after consuming liquor.         
	One can not carry out such an act in a normal state of mind. You need to get drunk, said Jaguas nephew, Karu. Chacha became withdrawn after Bahris execution, he added.Prison sources said Jaguas family, that traditionally cremates bodies on Barari ghat in Bhagalpur, is reluctant to get involved in the present execution.         
	The prison superintendent, Umakant Sharan, denied that Nata Mallik, who hanged Dhananjoy Chatterjee would be involved in this execution, but admitted that the prison had no regular hangman.         
	Probably, we will try to persuade Jagua Doms relatives to help us out, he added.         
	Inspector-general (prisons) Sandip Paundrik said Prajeet is being kept in a special cell where he is being served special food.         
	He is being kept in isolation as rules state, he said.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, April 7: The government has begun to provide district-wise information on the rural job scheme on its website to clear the cloud of corruption charges hanging over its head.        
	The move, which comes days after the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was extended to all districts, is aimed at maintaining transparency.         
	Ministers can now view the progress reports of their states online, monitor implementation of the scheme and address grievances.         
	The page, a click away from the rural job scheme website www.nrega.nic.in, provides information on the number of employment cards issued in a state, the number of women employed, the progress made and how funds have been used. It also provides a district-wise monthly progress report.         
	This detailed information will give ministers a chance to review the work that has been under way in their states. It will also be a step towards eradicating corruption at the district level, a source said.        
	Ministers are supposed to meet district-level leaders every quarter and discuss the schemes progress but unfortunately, that rarely happens.         
	While announcing the extension of the scheme, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had confessed that his ministry had received over 165 complaints about its non-implementation.        
	Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Karnataka are among the best performing states while Bengal and Bihar are at the other end of the spectrum.

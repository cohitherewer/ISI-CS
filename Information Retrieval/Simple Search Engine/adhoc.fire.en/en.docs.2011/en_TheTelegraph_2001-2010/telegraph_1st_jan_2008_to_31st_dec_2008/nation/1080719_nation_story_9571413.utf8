          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi interacts with villagers at Amravati in Vidarbha on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Bangalore, July 18: Janata Dal (Secular) chief H.D. Deve Gowda today kept his trust-vote cards close to his chest as he confirmed he would meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with his wish list tomorrow.        
	Only after meeting Manmohanji can I reveal anything, Gowda said after being authorised by his partys legislative committee to take a call on which side his three MPs would vote during the July 22 floor test.        
	Dal (S) sources said Gowda would be going to Delhi with a personal agenda aimed at curbing the growing influence of some Karnataka BJP MLAs who are mining barons.        
	We are planning to impress upon the PM to come up with a national mining policy, a source said.        
	The mining barons had a hand in the Dal (S) rout in the recent Assembly polls and also managed to whisk away two Dal (S) and two Congress MLAs, all of whom joined the BJP a fortnight ago.        
	The source said Gowda might also bargain for a ministerial berth for a party nominee. There are whispers he might even work for a tie-up with the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The plan is to reduce the BJPs influence and together with the Congress wrest as many seats as possible in the 28 Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka, the source said.        
	Although the Dal (S) has three MPs, Gowda effectively has control over two votes only  those of Chamaraj Nagar legislator M. Shivanna and his own. Gowda was elected to Parliament from Hassan.        
	Kozhikode parliamentarian M.P. Veerendra Kumar is unlikely to toe Gowdas line, having rebelled against him in 2006 for aligning with the BJP in Karnataka.        
	Gowda said he was against the nuke deal because he was not consulted on it despite being a former Prime Minister.

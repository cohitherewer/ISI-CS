	Patna, July 3: The Bihar government, in collaboration with the Union human resource development ministry, today launched a special scheme called Hunar, comprising free development courses for Muslim girls.         
	The Union HRD minister, Arjun Singh, formally inaugurated the programme in New Delhi today.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who launched the same programme in Patna yesterday, was also present for the New Delhi function.         
	For now, the skill-development scheme would be implemented through madarsas, maqtabs, Darul-Uloom and other educational centres.         
	Eventually, as many as 12,000 girls would be selected from Bihar, to be trained for the first phase in seven courses  gram sakhi training, jute production, tailoring, course in early childhood care, education and basic technology and beauty culture.         
	National Institute of Open Schooling (Nios) has created the blueprint for this scheme and has agreed to provide concessions, including free food and boarding for girls at the centres.         
	A significant aspect of this scheme is that norms for accreditation and approval for Traditional Educationally Backward Institutions (Tebi) which include madarsas and maqtabs would be relaxed for this scheme at some level.         
	Nios would be handpicking madrasas and maqtabs across the state, which would serve as training bases in later stages.         
	The Union ministry will also extend the facility for on-line admissions for the vocational courses that is slated to start from the current academic session.         
	Hunar has caught the attention of girls and students fast, taking even the officials assigned to implement it by surprise. The Bihar government brought out a notice in newspapers regarding the scheme a week ago and promptly received 1,300 applications.         
	The chief minister told The Telegraph from New Delhi that 12,000 girls would be the scheme beneficiaries in the first phase.         
	But our target for the second phase will be to enrol 50,000 girls. The scheme has a strong potential to equip Muslim girls to become self reliant, which would be a revolution of sort, he said.

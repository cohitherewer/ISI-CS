     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Centre will come out with an ordinance in a day or two to exclude problem states from the delimitation exercise before it notifies the process of redrawing Assembly and parliamentary constituencies across the country, sources said.
    
	Assam, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur are the problem states where politicians cutting across party lines have opposed recasting constituencies on the basis of the 2001 census. 
    
	Keen to go ahead with the exercise in the rest of the country, the Centre has decided to arm itself with powers not to notify delimitation in certain states. 
    
	For procedural reasons, the ordinance will not name the problem states but a political understanding has been arrived at between the UPA and the Opposition that it would cover the five states that had opposed delimitation during meetings with the Prime Minister, and the home and foreign ministers and other leaders.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, April 9: A pornographic CD featuring a police constable and a nurse has landed them behind bars.         
	Gulal Ahmad Najar and nurse Khalida were today arrested along with several computer operators who had been circulating the CD.        
	The Forum Against Social Evils, a non-government organisation, moved a court on March 31 seeking the arrest of those involved in making and circulating the CD. The court directed the state polices crime branch to investigate.         
	Senior superintendent of police Abdul Gaffar Malik said the constable had met the nurse when he was posted in Kulgam. Khalida, who is married, moved into a house with Najar, posing as his wife.         
	During investigations, we found that the police constable and the nurse had recorded their intercourse on his mobile phone, the SSP said.         
	Najar later decided to sell off his phone to a computer operator as he was facing a financial crunch, Malik said. But before doing that, he urged the computer operator to make a CD of the clipping.        
	The computer operator passed on copies of the CD to two of his colleagues, which they copied again and distributed to some other people, an officer said.        
	Najar and Khalida are likely to face charges under the immoral activities act.

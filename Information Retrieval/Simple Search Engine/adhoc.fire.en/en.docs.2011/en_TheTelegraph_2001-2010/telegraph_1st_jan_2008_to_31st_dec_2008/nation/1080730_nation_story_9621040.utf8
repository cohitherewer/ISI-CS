          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 29: The Centre is rushing to raise the status of the chairperson of the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions to that of a cabinet minister, the second upgrade of a minority panel chief in two months.        
	The rank hike is being speeded up to complete the process before a slew of Assembly elections in which the commissions work is likely to be showcased by the UPA, officials told The Telegraph.        
	A human resource development (HRD) ministry proposal for the upgrade has been accepted by all other ministries, the sources said. A note is likely to be placed before the cabinet this week.        
	A rise in rank leads to increased perks and a change in ceremonial treatment on public occasions.         
	Justice (retired) M.S.A. Siddiqui, the minority education commission chairperson, is a former Delhi High Court judge. He now enjoys the rank of a minister of state (MoS).        
	Other commission members enjoy the rank of secretaries to the government. Their rank will now be raised to that of an MoS.        
	In May, the Centre had upgraded the rank of Mohammed Shafi Qureishi, chairperson of the National Commission of Minorities, to that of a cabinet minister.         
	The government set up the minority education commission, promised in the common minimum programme, in 2004 as the apex body in charge of minority education in the country.        
	Leaders of minority communities had petitioned Sonia Gandhi to institute the commission to safeguard the rights of minorities in the field of education. The commission has supervisory powers over all minority education institutions.        
	Earlier this year, the Centre had amended the NCMEI Act  which till then did not cover universities  to bring institutions like Aligarh Muslim University within the commissions ambit.        
	The commission is a crucial component of the common minimum programme and has been successful, so it is natural that it will be showcased before the elections, an HRD ministry official said.        
	It is equally crucial to ensure that the commission members are happy.        
	Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Mizoram all go to the polls later this year.

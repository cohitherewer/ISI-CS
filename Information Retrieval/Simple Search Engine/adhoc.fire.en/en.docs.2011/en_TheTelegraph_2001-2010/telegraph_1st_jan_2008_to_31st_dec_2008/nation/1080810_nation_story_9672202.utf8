                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Delhi or state query for Soren 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: The process of a limited cabinet shuffle is expected to be set in motion once Sonia Gandhi returns from Beijing tomorrow.        
	The Congress chief is expected to meet Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren with a request that he should make up his mind whether he wants to be a central minister or chief minister in Ranchi.        
	But the Congress sounded iffy on inducting the Samajwadi Party, the other ally waiting in the wings.        
	On our part, we are fine with Soren taking up either position, said a Congress leader, adding that the incumbent Jharkhand chief minister, Madhu Koda, had been spoken to and persuaded to give up his post if Soren wanted it.        
	Its a bit of a problem but the final assessment is that Koda will not create trouble and, if the transition happens, it will be smooth. After that its the new chief ministers call, he will have to keep the coalition together. But we are committed to redeeming the promise we made to the JMM before the trust vote, the leader said.        
	About the Samajwadi Partys induction into the government, a source, however, said: Theres nothing on the table so far. As for the alliance, negotiations have yet to start.        
	Sources said the party had not taken too kindly to Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singhs loud hints about wanting to come in and his veiled warning regarding their envisaged alliance.        
	In an interview to a TV channel, Amar said he was being pressured by his party workers to join the government. Party workers want us to join. If I were to decide, I would not join, he said.        
	Amar claimed the Congress had no future in Uttar Pradesh without his party and hinted he would inherit the UPAs anti-incumbency if the two fought the elections jointly. I have to accept Sonia and Manmohan Singhs leadership. The Samajwadi Party will inherit the UPAs anti-incumbency, he said.        
	Congress sources made it clear that the four top ministries  home, external affairs, finance and defence  were non-negotiable and dismissed the speculation that Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav was tipped to replace A.K. Antony as defence minister, a post he held in the United Front government.        
	They also sounded unsure if the Congress would readily part with economic portfolios like petroleum and natural gas, and power the Samajwadis are reportedly eyeing.        
	Sources also rejected Amars cost-benefit analysis, saying a Samajwadi-Congress tie-up would be mutually beneficial and neither would have to carry the baggage offloaded by the other.        
	It will instantly consolidate Muslim votes. If Amar Singh is talking of anti-incumbency, we will also have to clinically assess how our traditional Brahmin voters will respond to a partnership with Mulayam. After all, the Brahmins switched lock, stock and barrel to the BSP in the Assembly elections because they saw Mayavati as the only force capable of defeating Mulayam. Their antipathy towards Mulayam is so deep, said a source.        
	Sources ruled out the possibility of C. Rangarajan joining the cabinet. Manmohan Singhs confidant had yesterday quit as chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          The fashion show in progress. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                        
	Lucknow, March 20: The rustle of frilly dresses, memsaabs in cane chairs and rabbits scuttling across the bungalow lawns  such a party would have earned a member of the Rajs steel frame a pat on the back.        
	But if Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat Anis Ansari was expecting a jolly good show, old chap from his bosses for the garden party he threw last evening, he was disappointed.        
	Chief minister Mayavati called an emergency meeting last night and summarily transferred the IAS officer, the states agriculture production commissioner. He has been served with a show-cause notice and may be suspended, sources said.        
	Ansari and his wife Asma Hussain had invited the wives and children of bureaucrats and rich businessmen, promising to recreate the feel of 19th-century England on their lawns, complete with nostalgic band music.        
	The atmosphere was to be evocative of scenes portrayed in the novels of British authors like William Makepeace Thackeray (the writer of Vanity Fair), a guest said.        
	The government, however, says the show was meant to advertise clothes created by Asma, a freelance designer who works with several companies.         
	Ansari violated the service conduct rules by using a government bungalow for commercial activity on behalf of his wife, chief secretary P.K. Mishra said. He has been attached to the appointments department and given a week to explain his actions.        
	Asma had got a makeshift ramp erected on the lawns, on which a posse of young local models showed off a spring collection of dresses designed by her.        
	The mostly chikan-embroidered salwar-kameezes, saris and lehengas were not quite the gowns and skirts that would have made the Victorian ambience pucca, but in other ways the Ansaris tried their best.        
	They arranged for cane furniture, released a friends pet rabbits on the lawns and hired a band to play music that was supposedly popular among the 19th-century English upper classes.        
	If the couple didnt mind the TV cameras and microphones spoiling the Victorian setting, by late night they had ample reason to regret inviting the news channels.        
	The party and ramp show were beamed across the city all evening and Mayavati, watching TV at her residence, was left furious, government sources said.        
	By midnight, chief secretary Mishra, cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar and other officials had driven to her residence and decided to remove Ansari.        
	The transferred bureaucrat refused comment, saying merely: I will soon send my reply to the government.        
	Sources close to him said Ansari might argue that nothing was sold at the party, so hosting it didnt amount to commercial activity.        
	Whats wrong with a show that was so creative and entertained senior IAS officers wives? Isnt hospitality a part of our culture? the wife of a bureaucrat asked.

     SUJAN DUTTA
               
	On board Air India 1, Jan. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said he had sought support from China for the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal when it came up for a waiver at the Nuclear Suppliers Group but added that I cannot say I have got an assurance.
    
	Singhs candour does not immediately extend to all the issues he touched upon during his visit. Every visit of a Prime Minister to China  P.V. Narasimha Raos, Atal Bihari Vajpayees and now Singhs  has been benchmarked against Rajiv Gandhis visit in 1988.
    
	The outcome of that visit was encapsulated by the foreign office in the phrase pathbreaking. For Singhs visit, the catchphrase is incremental. 
    
	His team claims it has improved on the past but is not quite near a breakthrough.
    
	Singh himself used the word incremental about his visit but he found enough reason to be optimistic. 
    
	The Prime Minister was speaking on board his special flight from Beijing to New Delhi after a three-day visit, on the last day of which he met President Hu Jintao and the chairman of the National Peoples Congress, Wu Bangguo. He continued his meetings with Premier Wen Jiabao from whom, he has said, he has greatly benefited.
    
	The visit touched upon all issues, including boundary disputes, trade issues and a strategy for the region. Such a wide engagement is designed to have a fallout on domestic politics, in the short term on the Lefts attitude to the Indo-US nuclear deal. 
    
	I had a good discussion with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on the need to promote cooperation between our atomic energy establishments. I have invited China to send its chief of the atomic energy authority. They said they will consider, the Prime Minister said.
    
	Later, answering questions, he said: There are ongoing discussions with the IAEA (a round is scheduled tomorrow in Vienna). If the IAEA approves, the whole matter will go to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (of which China is a member). We requested China for support. Both Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao said they will support civilian nuclear cooperation with India consistent with their non-proliferation obligations.
    
	Asked if this translated into support at the NSG, he said: I cannot say I have a definite assurance. But my feeling is I dont think China will be an obstacle today.
    
	Asked if he was going to brief the Left on the outcome of his China visit, the Prime Minister shot back: I always do.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: Higher education monitor UGC today said North Bengal University was acting against rules when it rejected the minority status certificate the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions had granted Kalimpongs Cluny Womens College.        
	Indias laws dont allow a state government or its universities to refuse to accept minority status granted by the Centre, the UGC said. The matter came up at a hearing at the commission on a complaint by the college, which has been denied minority status by NBU despite an NCMEI certificate.        
	NBU says it wasnt consulted before the college applied for the status. The UGC said it would inquire into the case, whose outcome is crucial as its the first time a university has refused to accept a minority certificate from the NCMEI.

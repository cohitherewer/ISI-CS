	Patna, March 25 (PTI): Beautician Shahnaz Hussain today asked the Bihar chief minister to order a CBI probe into the death of her son, who allegedly fell from his in- laws apartment in Patna on January 6.        
	My son was not suffering from depression nor was he an alcoholic. He was a deeply religious person. I have requested the chief minister to entrust the case to the CBI, she said after meeting Nitish Kumar.        
	Sameer, 34, was with his father-in-law Mahfooz Ahmed before he fell from the third-floor balcony of his flat.

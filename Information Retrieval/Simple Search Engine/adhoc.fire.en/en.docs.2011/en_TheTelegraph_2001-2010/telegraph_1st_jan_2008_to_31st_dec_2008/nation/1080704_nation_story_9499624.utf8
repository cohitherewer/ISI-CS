	Bhubaneswar, July 3: A boy who lost both his legs and an arm after being pushed off a running train by a ticket examiner last evening, was referred to Ispat General Hospital after his condition deteriorated in the morning.        
	Today the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, announced a relief package of Rs 1 lakh for Shankar Singh from the chief ministers relief fund.        
	Shankar, 12, was pushed off the running train by an unidentified travelling ticket examiner (TTE) following an argument over a Rs 50 note. The teen had found the note while sweeping a compartment in the Mumbai-Howrah Geetanjali Express.        
	The boy was intercepted by a TTE, who claimed the money to be his. However, Shankar refused to hand over the note that he had found. As the argument continued, a furious TTE allegedly slapped the boy and pushed him off the train         
	Rajesh, the victims friend and a witness, said the train had just started off the Rourkela station and had gathered speed when Shankar was pushed out of the train by the TTE. He was rushed to a hospital from where the administration shifted him to Ispat General Hospital, a multi-speciality health care utility, today.         
	Till yesterday the boy was in a state of shock and could not speak as he kept losing his consciousness. However, when his condition improved around noon, he had given a statement to the police.        
	Shankar has lost a lot of blood and his right hand and legs had to be amputated. His condition deteriorated today and doctors said he was in a critical state, said Narendra Tripathy, a leader in the Jana Kalyan Sangathan.        
	The Sanghathan had gheraoed a police station yesterday demanding the immediate arrest of the TTE.         
	However, no one has been arrested so far. The TTE is yet to be identified, as the train is on its way to Howrah. We will start investigations as soon as the train returns, said Rourkela police station officer in charge Arjun Kumar Sahu.         
	Today boys from Shankars slum visited him. Shankar lived with his grandfather in the slum.

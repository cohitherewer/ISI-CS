          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 21: Visibly upset with the defection of his two party MPs, especially Ramswarup Prasad, to the UPA camp before the trust vote, chief minister Ntish Kumar today described the ruling UPA as the United Poachers Association.         
	I have never seen such a MP hunt in the past, said Nitish Kumar, ruling out action against his party MPs shifting side. They (MPs) have already cast their dice. How will action help? he asked.         
	I am not accustomed to the language of poaching as I have never played the game. I understand rules and language of the polls and peoples mandate, said Nitish.        
	On if the UPA government would survive the trust vote, Nitish Kumar said that results hardly make a difference, as the elections would take place within seven to eight months if the government stays. If the government falls, the polls will take place earlier. But the UPA is left with no other option but to face polls, he added.         
	Nitish, while talking to the media today, was critical of the Centre for having ignored Bihar. We will go to the polls highlighting UPAs neglect of Bihar and inflation, he added.         
	The chief minister also described the N-deal as over emphasised.         
	We can generate enough electricity from ethanol and we have sufficient sugarcane to produce ethanol. But the Centre would not allow companies opening sugar factories in the state to produce ethanol, he said.

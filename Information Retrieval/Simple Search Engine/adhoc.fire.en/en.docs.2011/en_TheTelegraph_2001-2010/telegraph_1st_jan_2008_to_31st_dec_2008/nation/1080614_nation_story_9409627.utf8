	Thiruvanathapuram, June 13: Engineer Remo Peter wants a DNA test to prove Kaiser is his dog.        
	The fawn Labrador is at the centre of a tug of war between Remo, 23, and his uncle, who claims the dog as his own.        
	If the engineer has the receipt to show he had bought Kaiser for Rs 3,000 at a pet shop in Kochi two years ago, his uncle has the vets bills to support his claim.        
	The dog is now with Remo.        
	The youth says he had moved into his uncles house in Thiruvananthapuram with Kaiser more than a year ago when he landed a job at Technopark. But when he shifted to another house nearer his office, his uncle, whom Remo does not want to name, refused to let him take the pet.         
	So, on May 3, Remo just walked into his house and took Kaiser away.        
	His uncle, who works in the Gulf but is visiting his wife and children here, filed a police complaint last Tuesday demanding the dogs custody.        
	The police summoned uncle and nephew and tried to find an amicable solution, but both stood their ground.         
	Finally, circle inspector C.V. Biju suggested a way out: let the dog decide. Kaiser could be brought to the police station and set free in the presence of the two men, he said. Which dog would not wag its tail and approach its master?         
	Remo readily agreed but his uncle insisted there was no need for the test because the dog was his.         
	It was then that the engineer asked for a test to match Kaisers DNA with that of Rocky. Remo says Rocky, a dog in Kochi, is his pets father.        
	Im pretty confident my uncle will now back off because Ive the proof of the original purchase and the DNA test would endorse my claim, said Remo.         
	The police are yet to decide on the request.

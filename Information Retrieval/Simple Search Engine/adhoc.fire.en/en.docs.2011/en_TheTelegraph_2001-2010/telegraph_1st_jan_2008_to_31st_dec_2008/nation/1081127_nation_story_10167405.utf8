                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           BJP stalls House, budget in place
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 26: Much to the embarrassment of the Naveen Patnaik government, ruling NDA partner BJP today stalled proceedings in the Assembly over the Kandhamal issue.        
	Angry saffron party MLAs stormed the well and shouted slogans, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House twice for more than an hour and finally for the day.         
	Yesterday, BJP legislators had boycotted the customary joint legislature party meeting of the ruling coalition over the issue.        
	This gave an opportunity to Congress to demand the resignation of Naveen citing constitutional crisis.         
	The House witnessed uproars as soon as the question hour began. Ruling BJP members threatened to paralyse the proceedings if the matter was not taken up for discussion and their demand was not met. Speaker Kishore Mohanty appealed to the agitating members to go back to their seats and participate in the question-answer programme.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty also repeated the appeal assuring that the government was ready to discuss the matter if a motion to this effect was brought in proper forum. However, the BJP members did not relent. Rather, some of them like Pratap Sarangi, Rabi Narayan Naik, Mohammed Rafique and Baidhar Mallick stood on the Assembly secretarys table and raised slogans.        
	Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik also demanded immediate resignation of the chief minister. A constitutional crisis has arisen as a partner of the coalition government has revolted, he said. BJP legislature party leader B.B. Harichandan alleged that the government had failed to arrest the killers of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati. Under these circumstances, the chief minister has lost his moral right to continue in power and should resign immediately, he demanded.        
	The supplementary budget was presented amid the pandemonium, following which the House was adjourned for the day.In fact, it was the biggest ever supplementary budget of Rs 7587.69 crore presented for this current fiscal to woo various sections ahead of the general elections.        
	Finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei said the size of this years supplementary budget was the biggest since independence and double of last years.         
	While an allocation of Rs 7587.69 crore has been made in this budget, it was Rs 3737.73 crore in 2007-08 and Rs 3654.23 crore in 2006-07, he said.        
	Our government has made additional allocation of funds keeping the hopes and aspirations of people, Ghadei said after presenting the budget. As the Assembly election is due early next year, the government had allocated a major chunk of funds to appease vocal sections, like government employees, teachers, farmers, tribal and Dalit students.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dalai goof-up in nuclear deal haste
                                                                                                               Dalai goof-up in nuclear deal haste
          K.P. NAYAR                           Pelosi with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Washington, March 22: India allowed Nancy Pelosi, second in the line of succession to the US presidency, to travel to Dharamsala and meet the Dalai Lama in the misplaced expectation that the gesture would wipe off some of the bad blood caused by the stymied nuclear deal during foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees visit here from Sunday.        
	But the effort to bend over backwards to the point of risking Indias historically calibrated Tibet policy has cut no ice with the Bush administration.        
	White House spokesperson Gordon Johndroe told reporters who contacted him during the long Good Friday weekend that the Bush administration had no comment on Pelosis meeting with the Dalai Lama, instead of praising the Indian gesture that South Block had hoped for.        
	State department officials who are garrulous in private about such issues are stupefied that the Manmohan Singh government has allowed the US to fire at China from Indias shoulders in total defiance of their own expectations to clear Mukherjees pathway in Washington.        
	Indias questionable decision to allow the Speaker of the US House of Representatives to criticise China on Indian soil in the company of the Tibetan political leader whom Beijing views as a threat to its territorial integrity is in sharp contrast to the White Houses own policy of discretion.        
	Mukherjee, who will meet George W. Bush on Monday afternoon for 30 minutes, will find the US President paying no more than lip service to the Tibetan cause.        
	Bush has refused to cancel his visit to Beijing for the Olympics, saying: I am going to the Olympics (because) I view the Olympics as a sporting event and not as a political platform.        
	The President needs China to restrain North Koreas nuclear programme and because Beijings investments in US treasury bonds are vital in the looming financial crisis here.         
	A senior South Block official, who seriously doubted the wisdom of Indias new activism on Tibet, told The Telegraph that no one told Mukherjee before Pelosi met him or in the run-up to his trip to Washington that Bush has so far remained totally silent on the Chinese crackdown in Tibet.        
	The official regretted that in the ill-considered haste to shore up support in the US Congress for ratification of the 123 Agreement to operationalise the nuclear deal, Mukherjee was also not briefed that Pelosi was a maverick who has no qualms about putting US strategic objectives at risk for electoral gains.        
	Five months ago, her unwavering pursuit of a congressional resolution to hold Turkey accountable for a genocide of Armenians nearly a century ago prompted Ankara to recall its ambassador to Washington and threaten to cut off the use of its military bases that send supplies to US troops in Iraq.        
	All because her home state of California is home to the largest number of politically active Armenians who constitute a vote bank for five Democratic members of the US House of Representatives from that state.        
	While Bush is silent on Tibet, the three candidates in the fray to succeed him next year have used the freedom of electioneering to outdo one another in professing support for human rights for Tibetans and exploiting the fears and suspicions among American voters about China.         
	Even so, Republican John McCain has been restrained: he did not discuss Tibet at all during his 45-minute meeting today with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris, but did not miss an opportunity at a news conference later to roundly criticise China.        
	As such, by allowing Pelosi to travel to Dharamsala for a photo opportunity with the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, India may have unwittingly waded into US electoral waters.         
	Pelosi is certain to make the most of the photo opportunity she had with the Dalai Lama both for her own re-election and in support of the eventual Democratic nominee to be the next US President.

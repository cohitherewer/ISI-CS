	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Congress spokesperson and Union minister Shakeel Ahmed spoke out against Prakash Karat today in remarks that have not gone down well with his party.        
	We dont know what situation will arise then, but going by what Karat said, he does not mind if communal forces benefit from it. He is about to commit another historical blunder in a string of blunders the Left has committed, Ahmed said, in response to the CPM general secretary yesterday discounting the possibility of an alliance with the Congress after the next elections.         
	In 1977, they supported a government which had Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani as senior ministers.         
	Ahmed also made an oblique comparison between Karat and Harkishen Singh Surjeet, who passed away today. He said Surjeet was blessed with the ability of resolving all problems through dialogue, the basis of coalition management. Asked if this was to be read as a remark against Surjeets successor, he smiled.        
	The Congress had not reacted to Karats interview when it was telecast yesterday. Such matters are too sensitive for knee-jerk reactions and require deliberations at the highest level and a firm political line, the party said.        
	Ahmed was advised not to speak on the interview for this reason and also because of Surjeets death. He was told to give a condolence message, that was the appropriate thing to do. Instead, he drew a comparison with Karat and that amounted to waving the red flag before the comrades, a Congress functionary said.         
	I dont know what prompted him to say all this, a general secretary said.        
	A section of the Congress feels that for four years, the Left gave the government a stability and legitimacy which the Amar Singhs of the world will not.         
	From Day One, we knew their world view was different from ours and there were fundamental contradictions. Then came an irretrievable parting, but our task is not to make it permanent or even long-lasting. We are not in politics to sit out in the Opposition for another long spell. We cannot risk an irreparable breach with the Left, a leader said.        
	For the moment, the Congress is watching how Karats line, reverting to equidistance from the BJP and the Congress, will go down with the CPM and its allies.         
	Three fault lines are manifest in present-day politics: religion, caste and economics. We believe that if religion is the polarising line in 2009, Karat will be under pressure from his party to support a secular configuration, a Congress secretary said.

	Srinagar, March 2: Nirmal Kaur had given up hope of meeting husband Subedar Assa Singh, presumed missing in Pakistani jails for the past 37 years. But Kashmir Singhs return has given her a reason to smile.         
	Assa was a junior commissioned officer of 5 Sikh Regiment and reported dead during the 1971 Indo-Pak war in the Chamb Jorian area of Jammu.        
	But a few months later, I heard a radio news bulletin which said that my husband is alive in some Pakistani jail, Kaur recalled.         
	The family said an Indian prisoner, Bogal Ram, released a few years ago, confirmed that Assa was in a Lahore jail.         
	Since then, the family has been tirelessly searching for him. Kaur travelled to Pakistan last year along with over a dozen others looking for their relatives after President Pervez Musharraf offered them help.         
	I could not find my husband in Pakistan. Although they invited us and took us to several jails, we were not allowed to go inside and were kept outside. I was dejected, but if Kashmir Singh is returning home after 35 years, why cant my husband? asked Kaur.         
	Kashmir, who was arrested on spying charges in 1973, was found recently by Pakistans caretaker human rights minister Ansar Burney during a visit to Lahore Central Jail. The Indian, who was pardoned by Musharraf, is expected to return on Monday.        
	Assas son, Harcharan Singh, said nobody could trace any relative despite visiting more than a dozen prisons in Pakistan.         
	Harcharan is now planning to seek help from Kashmir. When my mother and others visited Pakistan last year, they got little help from the Pakistan government, said Harcharan, an employee of the Survey of India.         
	Perhaps Kashmir Singh may have some clue about my father. We are awaiting his return.         
	Assa has two sons and five daughters. The youngest, a daughter, was born three months after his disappearance. All of them are now married.        
	We have missed him on every occasion. He could not join our marriages, but we pray he is with us during marriage of his grandchildren, prayed Harcharan.         
	There are five others from Jammu, including Sepoy Jagdish Raj and Havaldar Krishan Lal, who are presumed missing in Pakistani jails and their tale is no different.

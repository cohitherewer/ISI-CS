          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Bike companies have moved the Supreme Court against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order banning sale of motorcycles in the state unless they had handgrips for the pillion in the middle rather than the rear.        
	The manufacturers won a reprieve after an apex court bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan stayed the order yesterday.        
	Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the bike makers  including Bajaj Auto and Hero Honda, two of the countrys largest bike manufacturers  said a grip in the middle would make the pillion susceptible to groin injury whenever a rider brakes hard.        
	World over the handgrip for the pillion rider is provided at the back (above the tail light). Even in scooters, the earlier middle grip is now gone, Rohatgi said. The high court it seems is yet to outgrow that feature.        
	He also questioned the courts powers to pass such an order and said it was up to automobile experts to decide the positioning of the grip.        
	The apex court then issued notices to all the parties in the case and fixed December 19 for the next hearing.        
	This is not the first time that a high court has intervened in matters concerning those riding pillion. On August 24, Kerala High Court urged the Centre and states to consider a ban on wearing saris while riding pillion. It said saris could be risky while riding pillion as they could get entangled in the wheels.        
	The court also suggested that the pillion straddle the back seat rather than perch on one side, making it difficult for the rider to maintain balance.        
	Manufacturers later installed sari-guards for women.        
	A petition is also pending in Bombay High Court. The PIL followed a newspaper report that said there had been a rise in the number of bike accidents in the state. The petitioner, Gyan Prakash, 60, said manufacturers were putting lives at risk by not providing adequate safety features.

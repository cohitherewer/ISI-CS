	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Mohammed Ajmal Mohammed Amin Kasab, 21, and the other gunmen who attacked Mumbai were trained in drug use to endure intense commando operations, intelligence sources said.        
	During the 60-hour siege in Mumbai, the endurance levels of the terrorists had left police aghast. But drug paraphernalia, including syringes, found at the scene of the attacks offered an explanation.         
	We found injections containing traces of cocaine and LSD left behind by the terrorists and later found drugs in their blood, said a Mumbai police officer.         
	Use of drugs is the latest ammunition for terrorists.         
	Preparation for a suicide mission includes training in how to keep the mind and body alert, said a terror expert.         
	Trainees in terror camps are required to sprint 100 metres in 12 to 15 seconds (the world record is 9.69 seconds, set by Usain Bolt at the Beijing Olympics), run 10km with a half-hour break and march 4km carrying a weight of 20kg, according to intelligence agencies. Their endurance is further raised with drugs, injected under medical supervision.         
	These terror camps impart training similar to that our own commandos undergo. They are trained to stay awake a minimum of a week. This regimented life includes reduced diet and medicinal inputs. In the case of terrorists, this could also mean taking controlled drugs to enhance performance and withstand pressure from interrogators, former Intelligence Bureau joint director Maloy Dhar said.         
	One terrorists shot down at the Taj had grievous bullet wounds in his thigh, but he fought on for at least six hours even as he bled profusely, a senior official said. A fresh spray of bullets killed him.         
	But this isnt the first time Indian investigators have come across training in drugs.         
	Rakesh Maria, joint commissioner of police, Mumbai, had earlier said Indian Mujahideen members caught in connection with blasts around the country were using drugs to cheat narco tests. Sources said they were using ketamine, propofol, sodium pentothal and fortwin regularly.        
	Sodium pentathol is an important component of narco tests. It slows down the heart rate, lowers blood pressure and inhibits brain and spinal cord activity. Rigorous training and measured and continuous usage of sodium pentothal can nullify the effect of narco-analysis.         
	For example, if a new user uses heroin, it will have an effect on him, but once he becomes an addict, he would need something extra to have the same effect. Similarly, if their bodies are conditioned to taking in a certain kind of drug, then inducing the same drug and hoping it will have an effect is hopeless, said Dr Yusuf Merchant, a drugs expert.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 29: Peace slowly returned to Kandhamal today, as the district administration and the Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti, a tribal body, worked hand in hand trying to restore normality.        
	No incidents of violence was reported from the district today, Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar told The Telegraph today. He also denied reports of a crude bomb blast in a relief camp last night.         
	A peace committee meeting was held at the district headquarters today and was attended by representatives from all communities, NGOs and senior officials. Meanwhile, a samiti team, headed by secretary Lambodar Kanhar, moved across the district appealing to members of his (Kandha) community to restore peace. Kanhar assured that there would be no repeat of the violence, since the government had announced a good package for Kandhamal.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced a special package including verification of caste certificates on a war-footing, settlement of land disputes by camp courts, establishment of a dedicated court at Phulbani to deal with revenue cases and recruitment of 500 tribal youths as special policemen for Kandhamal.

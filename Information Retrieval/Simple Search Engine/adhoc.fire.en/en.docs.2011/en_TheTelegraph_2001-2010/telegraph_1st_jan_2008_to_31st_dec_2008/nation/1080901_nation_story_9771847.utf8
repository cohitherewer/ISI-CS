	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Supreme Court has set in motion a probe into the Mayavati governments charge of misconduct against a suspended chief information commissioner.        
	The apex court has issued notices to commissioner M.A. Khan, a former Allahabad High Court judge. The Uttar Pradesh governor had suspended him on July 9 on the states recommendation, and referred the matter to the Chief Justice of India.         
	The Mayavati regime had accused Khan, appointed by the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, of serious misconduct and irregularities in appointments to the commission.        
	Under Section 17 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, a governor can remove an information commissioner for misbehaviour or incapacity if the Supreme Court, in an inquiry made on the governors reference, finds the charges to be true. But until the probe is over, he can be barred from entering office.         
	Khan is the first state information commissioner facing a Supreme Court probe for alleged misconduct.        
	His suspension followed a series of run-ins with the Mayavati government. Khan had made adverse observations against the government and summoned senior officials, such as the chief secretary and the cabinet secretary, for explanations.         
	Khan has dismissed all the charges against him as politically motivated.

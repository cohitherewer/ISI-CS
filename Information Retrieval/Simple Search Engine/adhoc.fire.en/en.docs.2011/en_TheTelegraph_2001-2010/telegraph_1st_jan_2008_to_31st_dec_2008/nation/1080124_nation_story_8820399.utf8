               Pramod Mahajan
              
	Mumbai, Jan. 23 (PTI): Praveen Mahajan suspected elder brother Pramod was being blackmailed by his late secretary Vivek Moitra.
    
	The disclosure came in an appeal Praveen filed in the high court against the life term handed to him last month for killing his brother.
    
	The revelation sheds light on what Praveen could have told the trial court during his in-camera testimony as the motive for the BJP leaders murder. Part of that closed-door deposition dealt with the sequence of events at Pramods Worli residence before Praveen shot him.
    
	Praveen has said in the appeal that he went to the apartment on April 22, 2006, to persuade his brother to resist Moitras attempts to blackmail him any further.
    
	The appeal does not specify how Moitra, who died from an overdose of cocaine at Pramods Delhi home less than a month after the BJP leaders death, persisted with the blackmail. In all probability, he (Moitra) was blackmailing Pramod, is all that Praveen says in the appeal.
    
	At the flat, Praveen asked how Moitra knew about Pramods relationship with one Alaknanda, but the BJP leader did not respond, the appeal says. This prompted Praveen to say that Pramod was a fit candidate for blackmail.
    
	Pramod then made certain remarks about Praveens wife Sarangi, after which Praveen decided to leave, the petition says. As he prepared to walk out, Praveen picked up a pistol, lying on the teapoy (ornamental stand), prompting Pramod to grab the weapon out of fear, the appeal says, adding that the shots were fired accidentally in the ensuing scuffle. 
    
	The petition also says the testimonies of Pramods wife Rekha and brother-in-law Gopinath Munde were tutored.

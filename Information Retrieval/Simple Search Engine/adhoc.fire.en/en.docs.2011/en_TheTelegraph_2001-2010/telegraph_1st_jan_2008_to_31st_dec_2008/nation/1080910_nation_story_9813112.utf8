                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aarushi case: CBI gropes in darkness
  - No chargesheet now, delay to lead to release of suspects        OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Rajesh Talwar, Aarushi                                       
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The CBI has admitted that after four months of investigation, it does not have the evidence to file a chargesheet in the Aarushi Talwar murder case.         
	The investigation of this case will continue. The CBI will file its report under Section 173 Criminal Procedure Code only on conclusion of investigation, deputy inspector-general Neeraja Gotru told a news conference here today.        
	The delay will pave the way for the release of Krishna and Raj Kumar, under arrest for the double murder of Aarushi and household help Hemraj at the Talwars Noida home in May.         
	An accused has the right to bail if the chargesheet is not filed within 90 days of arrest.        
	For Krishna, a compounder who assisted Aarushis dentist father Rajesh Talwar, the 90-day period ends on September 13. Raj Kumar, a domestic help at the home of the Talwars family friends Anita and Praful Durrani, will have to wait till September 27.        
	Vijay Mandal, a domestic help who worked for the Talwars neighbours, has already been granted bail.        
	Gotru said the CBI had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information that would help trace the murder weapon and the mobile phones of the victims.         
	A letter rogatory has been sent to Nepal seeking assistance in locating some witnesses and mobile phones of the deceased, she said.        
	Sources said the CBIs case against the trio was based on scientific tests conducted on them, the evidence from which is not admissible in court.         
	Without the murder weapon and the cellphones, it would be difficult for the agency to make any headway.         
	At this point, the CBI can neither nail any of the accused nor give anyone a clean chit, the sources added.        
	This means the investigators will have to re-examine the sequence of events and all the characters involved, including Rajesh Talwar who was released on bail after the CBI said it had no evidence against him.         
	Aarushis parents said today: We hope and pray the CBI is able to get the evidence to ensure Aarushi gets justice.        
	The teenager was found with her throat slit at her Noida home on May 16. Police initially accused Hemraj of the murder, but had egg on their face when his body was found a day later on the terrace. Rajesh was arrested a week later.        
	The CBI took over the case on May 31. On July 11, CBI joint-director Arun Kumar gave a clean chit to Rajesh and named Krishna, Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal as accused.        
	Mandal, granted bail on September 4, has accused the agency of forcing him to turn approver against the other two who he claims he doesnt even know.

	Patna, Nov. 7: Seven persons trying to immolate themselves before Patna High Court in protest against the verdict acquitting JD(U) MP Prabhunath Singh in a 13-year-old murder case were arrested today.        
	A fast-track court had acquitted the Maharajganj MP on October 24 in connection with the murders of Daroga Rai and Rajendra Rai, two brothers and sons of Lalmuni Devi. It was the mother who has been fighting the case against the MP for the alleged murder of her sons.         
	The two brothers were killed in front of a polling station at Baniapur in Maharajganj Lok Sabha constituency during the 1995 Lok Sabha elections.        
	Angered by the verdict that she found unjust, Lalmuni had, a few days before, threatened to immolate herself before the high court today.        
	But, it was her surviving son, Kishori Rai, 40, and six other family members who turned up near the high court with match boxes and kerosene. However, a police patrol party, led by officer-in-charge of Kotwali police station Mundrika Prasad Yadav caught hold of Kishori Rai and the six family members before any damage could be done.        
	We have lodged a case of self-immolation and abatement against Rai and his family members. We have remanded the seven to judicial custody, said Mundrika Singh Yadav. He complimented an alert police team for keeping a strict surveillance on Lalmuni Devi. The senior woman was kept under police vigil the whole day today.        
	Patna fast-track court judge Manmohan Choudhary had acquitted Prabhunath Singh in the double murders citing lack of evidence as the reason.        
	Singh, who is also known as the Maharajganj don, faces several other cases related to murder, extortion and kidnapping.         
	At that time of the two deaths, eyewitness account had stated that Prabhunath Singh and his henchmen had allegedly shot Daroga Rai and Rajendra Rai at a point-blank range in front of a Baniapur polling station.        
	The elder son, Daroga Rai, had died on the spot, while the younger Rajendra Rai had breathed his last at a nearby government hospital.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     IIT council chairman cries foul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Prime Ministers top scientific adviser has accused the government of ignoring his concerns as chairman of the standing committee of the IIT council while starting six IITs this year.        
	The Telegraph had first reported on April 30 C.N.R. Raos unhappiness with the governments expansion plans as he feared the move would dilute the value of Indias top engineering school brand.         
	The government started the IITs at a time the seven older ones faced a shortage of faculty and resources.        
	I feel powerless as the standing committee chairman. My concerns have not been addressed. The post of chairman appears insignificant, Rao said today over phone from Bangalore.        
	Rao had first recorded his apprehensions over the expansion plan for the IITs at a meeting of the panel this February.        
	The committee recommends that the pace of expansion of the IITs be moderated to preserve the brand, the minutes of that meeting said.         
	Today, Rao said his position remained unchanged. Asked if he was contemplating resigning from the committee, Rao said: I cannot say if I will quit or not, but if I do, I will resign without telling anyone.

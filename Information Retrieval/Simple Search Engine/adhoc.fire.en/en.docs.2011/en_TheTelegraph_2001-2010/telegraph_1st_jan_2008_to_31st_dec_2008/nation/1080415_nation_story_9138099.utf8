	Bhubaneswar, April 14: A pall of gloom descended on the Judo Association Hall today as thousands of mourners bid their favourite coach good bye.         
	The association was created by Biranchi Das over 20 years and it was here that he groomed over 500 talents, including wunderkid Budhia Singh, who was absent from the proceedings today.         
	The visitors today included politicians and dignitaries besides the general public. I do not know what to do now. (Biranchi) Sir had fed and sheltered me for six years now. He was a father figure, said Jitu Behera, a judo student.         
	The enthusiastic coach was the only hope for hundreds of deprived youths, who he trained, groomed and gave shelter to. Many among Biranchis 500 young boys and girls, such as Laxman Majhi, Amar Kumar Nayak, Basant Ghadei, Bibun Dalei and Babina Mallick, had found national fame in their sports.        
	Due to his untimely demise, the fate of 200 students associated with the association has been left in the lurch.         
	Biranchis wife, Gitanjali Panda, who is a SAI coach, was not in a condition to address the media. I am not a in stable condition. I dont wish to live, she said as she wept. We lost a man who introduced judo in the state, It is a great loss to Orissa, said Hara Patnaik, a judo trainer.         
	Budhia may have been far from the association hall, but he too was mourning his coach privately. I am shocked to know that Sir is no more, he said. He refused to comment on the torture allegations earlier levelled by him and his mother, saying that everyone should just forget it.        
	Sir was like a father to me and Ill always remember him, Budhia said. his mother Sukanti Singh reportedly did not allow him to pay visit for security reasons, but deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Thakur said: We never received any threats regarding Budhia.         
	Its a sad day for us. Of course, he had groomed Budhia, Sukanti rued. Till early afternoon, she had told media persons that she wished to attend the last rites, but did not have the money to.         
	Biranchis body was brought to the judo hall from the Capital Hospital after the post-mortem and was kept there till the evening. His body was then carried to his residence at Laxmisagar amid slogans of Biranchi Das amar rahe and finally to Swargwadwar.         
	The rites were performed by his brother, Susanta Das.

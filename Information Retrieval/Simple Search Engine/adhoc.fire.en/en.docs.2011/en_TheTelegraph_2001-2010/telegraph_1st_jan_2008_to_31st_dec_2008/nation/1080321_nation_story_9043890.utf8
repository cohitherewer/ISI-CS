The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | TN struts waiver gains
                                                                                                               TN struts waiver gains
          M.R. VENKATESH                              
	Chennai, March 20: Tamil Nadu today said the farm loan waivers granted by the DMK government after it came to power in May 2006 had lifted the states food production for two successive years.        
	The announcement came as finance minister K. Anbazhagan presented the state budget less than three weeks after the Centre promised to write off Rs 60,000 crore in loan waivers to small and marginal farmers across the country.        
	After the Rs 7,000-crore waiver by the DMK government  of loans from state cooperative banks  food production rose from 61.46 lakh tonnes in 2005-2006 to 82.63 lakh tonnes in 2006-07, Anbazhagan said.         
	He added that the fallout was evident in 2007-08 too despite floods, with the food production estimated to cross one crore tonnes.        
	Over the past two years, the state government has paid back Rs 3,304 crore to cooperative institutions, mostly in cash. This years state budget has allocated a further Rs 1,150 crore towards helping these banks balance their sheets.        
	Also, the interest on farm loans from cooperative banks has been reduced from 9 per cent to 5 per cent, Anbazhagan said.        
	The waiver has allowed distressed farmers to access fresh credit, finance secretary K. Gnanadesikan later told reporters. He said the states share in the Centres loan write-offs would soon be known.        
	Anbazhagans tax-free budget, which left an overall deficit of Rs 2.19 crore, slashed the value-added tax (VAT) on various commodities.        
	The DMK government had last year granted full VAT exemption on mangalsutras made of up to 8 grams of gold. This year, it extended the exemption to similar items symbolic of wedlock, such as the karukumani (black beads) used by Muslims and the Cross used by Christians at weddings.        
	Anbazhagan also exempted cable TV operators from entertainment tax from April 1, and promised to waive the arrears of Rs 16 crore they collectively owe the government.

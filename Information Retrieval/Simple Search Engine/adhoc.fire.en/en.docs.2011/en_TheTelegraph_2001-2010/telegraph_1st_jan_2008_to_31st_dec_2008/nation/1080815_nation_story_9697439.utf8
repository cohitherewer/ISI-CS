          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: A CRPF officer in Srinagar has had his name removed from an Independence Day honours list over alleged excesses by his force and recalled to Delhi.        
	Until early this evening, inspector-general S.K. Jains name figured on the list of those to be given the Presidents medal for distinguished service. Hours later, the home ministry removed it amid speculation the move was prompted by Jammu and Kashmir Governor N.N. Vohras call yesterday to remove him from Srinagar.        
	Jains exclusion from the awards list was probably aimed at sparing the Centre embarrassment.        
	Vohra is said to be upset with unverified complaints that CRPF personnel entered houses and assaulted people.         
	Ministry sources insisted Jain, who was in charge of Srinagar and its vicinity, had been recalled to Delhi for deliberations, not transferred or removed. The IPS officer of the Manipur-Tripura cadre said he didnt know if his name was off the honours list. I dont know if the list is out if the name is not included, it is their prerogative, he said, but refused to comment on the allegations swirling around in Srinagar.        
	The CRPF denied the charges. No one has entered houses. The windowpanes of three houses broke during stone pelting, which wasnt done by us. We havent entered any mosque or misbehaved. If specific allegations are found, we are open to an inquiry, a spokesperson said.        
	Union home minister Shivraj Patil has been under fire over the violence that has continued unabated over the past few weeks in the state.         
	The apparent snub to Jain left colleagues fuming. This is a hit below the belt and against the principles of natural justice. There has not even been an inquiry. How can you tarnish his entire record? asked a senior IPS officer, referring to Jains 21 years of unblemished service.        
	A senior CRPF official hinted that the force wouldnt accept the treatment meted out to Jain and it was up to the Jammu and Kashmir government to prove the alleged intrusions and assault in Srinagar last evening.

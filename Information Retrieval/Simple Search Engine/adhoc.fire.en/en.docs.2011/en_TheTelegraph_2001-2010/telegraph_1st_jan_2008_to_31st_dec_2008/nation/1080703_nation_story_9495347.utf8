	Patna, July 2: Unidentified persons hacked Patna Municipal Corporation secretary Manjar Alam and his wife to death before dawns break at their Haroon Nagar Colony residence today.        
	Saba Kausar, sleeping in an adjoining room, found the bodies of her parents Alam (59) and mother Kausar Zaman when she got up this morning.         
	City superintendent of police Anwar Hussein said that on Sabas information, the police reached Alams home under Phulwarisharief police station area to find the bodies with multiple injury caused by sharp-edged weapons. Alam was a Bihar Administrative Service officer.        
	The couple were living with Saba, their youngest daughter. Two of their daughters are married and living separate. Anwar, quoting Saba, said that she had come to know about the incident after opening the door of her parents bedroom bolted from outside.        
	Anwar said that the almirah in the bedroom had been broken open and some valuables were apparently missing. But the assailants might have done it to give the impression of loot and robbery to mislead investigation, Anwar said, adding: Prima facie, it appears to be a case of cold-blooded murder. The police said that a team of forensic experts was engaged to assist in investigation.         
	It appears an insiders job. A person with whom the family had some dealings, somebody known to the family, senior superintendent of police Amit Kumar told PTI.

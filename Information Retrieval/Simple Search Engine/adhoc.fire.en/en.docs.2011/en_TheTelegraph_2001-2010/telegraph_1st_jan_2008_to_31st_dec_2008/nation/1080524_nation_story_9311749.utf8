          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 23: Its almost a month since 31-year-old CRPF jawan Sarat Padhi went missing.         
	Since then, Sarats wife, 26-year-old Bijaylaxmi Padhi, has been running from pillar to post seeking help to trace her missing husband. Today, she knocked on the Raj Bhavan doors asking for some sort of help from Governor M.C. Bhandare.        
	The jawan working under 121 Battalion of the CRPF at Diphu in Assam went missing while travelling on a train on April 26, 2008. His family in Balipatna was informed of the incident by a CRPF commandant over phone.         
	His commanding officer, Pankaj Pokhraj, called me up and informed that Sarat had gone missing from Bhagalpur station, where he had alighted to get water, she said.        
	Sarat had been working under the central paramilitary forces for the past eight years and was posted as an assistant to the commanding officer of the 121 Battalion, Pankaj Pokhraj, at Diphu in Assam.         
	On April 26, Sarat was travelling on a train with two drivers, a sepoy and Pokhraj.

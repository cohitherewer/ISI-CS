          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The cabinet today cleared a four-fold hike in medical bonus that working women in India are entitled to under the maternity benefit act, paving the way for the reintroduction in Parliament of proposed amendments to the law.         
	If accepted by Parliament, the amendments will make women eligible for a medical bonus of Rs 1,000 instead of the current sum of Rs 250, that is if the employers do not provide for both pre-natal and post-natal care free of cost.         
	Under the amended law, the Union government will also have the power to increase the sum further, every three years, up to a maximum ceiling of Rs 20,000.         
	The act applies to all organisations not covered by the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948.         
	Labour minister Oscar Fernandes had introduced the amendments to the maternity benefit act in May 2007.         
	The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2007, was then sent to a parliamentary standing committee for its opinion.         
	After the House panel submitted its report, the proposed amendments returned to the cabinets table for approval.         
	Now, the amendments will be reintroduced in Parliament for clearance.

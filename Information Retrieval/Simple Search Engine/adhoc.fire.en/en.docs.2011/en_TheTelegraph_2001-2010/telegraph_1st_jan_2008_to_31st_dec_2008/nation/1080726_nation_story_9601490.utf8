          OUR BUREAU                           Bangalores Madiwala bus stand where a bomb blast killed a woman on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	Calcutta, July 25: The blasts that shook Bangalore also triggered minor tremors in Bengal.        
	Calcuttans who have family members working in Bangalore spent anxious moments, while Sector V techies calculated the blasts possible impact on their business and worried if the Salt Lake IT hub was prepared to cope with a terror attack.        
	My heart skipped a beat as soon as I heard about the blasts. I tried to get in touch with all my relatives in Bangalore but couldnt get through to anyone, said Sikha Aich, 50, whose son Shamik works with a bank in Bangalore.        
	All the phone lines were jammed. I spent a harrowing half an hour till I got through to my son who assured me he was fine.        
	As with Aich, the jammed lines were a torment for many other Calcuttans who spent hours trying to contact relatives in Bangalore, whose IT offices recruit heavily from the Bengal capital.        
	My wife Sheela received a call from our grandson Nilarya around 5pm, saying there had been a bomb blast behind his school. The line got disconnected and we remained worried till they reached home and called again, said Panchkari Mukherjee, 77, of Salt Lake. His daughter Sucharita lives in Bangalores Diamond District.        
	Although the blasts took place far away from the Karnataka capitals IT hub, it left Sector V deeply worried.        
	It will definitely have an impact on the image and working of the sector in the short run, said a senior official in a leading IT company that employees over 5,000 people in Bangalore. The industry is already reeling under the effects of the US economic slowdown, rupee appreciation and stagnant spending on the sector.        
	Some preferred to focus on what might happen if terrorists struck Sector V.        
	This is the right time to think of disaster management systems and security drills, said Kalyan Kar, managing director, Acclaris.        
	S.A. Ahmed, chairman of the fledgling Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, said an e-surveillance system would soon be launched across 10 points in Sector V, workplace for some 50,000 people.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          The Bodh Gaya Temple      
	Gaya, March 6: A foreign donor has come forward with a proposal to finance the renovation of the sanctum sanctorium in the Bodhi Temple.         
	The donor prefers to remain anonymous. According to Gaya district magistrate-cum-chairman of the temple management committee, Jitendra Srivastava, the proposed plan has been discussed with representatives of Bodh Gaya-based monasteries. The monasteries have reportedly given the go-ahead to the committee.         
	According to the proposal, the wall behind the Buddha image, in the sanctum, would be covered with carved teak panels. A gilded leaf would also be installed in the sanctum and the place would be decorated with gold and silver items.         
	When quizzed about the cost, Srivastava said it was still to be worked out, but the donor has made it clear that money was not going to be a problem. Srivastava has also said that the state governments formal approval would be obtained before the plan execution starts.

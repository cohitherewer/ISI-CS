          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Centre has upgraded promotion prospects for defence forces officers and one hopes to see brigadiers in their early 40s and 36-year-old group captains commanding the skies.        
	A total of 1,896 upgraded posts will be created following cabinet approval to the Ajay Vikram Singh committee report today. Of these, the army will have 1051, the navy 342 and the air force 503.        
	While not creating any new posts, the government has also approved the defence ministry proposal to cut flab at the middle level.        
	There will be a reduction in the regular cadre and corresponding increase in support cadre consisting of short service commissioned officers and re-employed officers. To have a better, flab-less hierarchy, the reduction will be at the level of lieutenant colonels where there is stagnation.        
	At the top, 20 more lieutenant generals will be added to the 60-odd existing posts of three-star generals in the army. Four vice-admirals will be added to the navy and six air marshals to the air force.        
	This is being seen as a major step towards improving career mobility besides achieving combat-effectiveness by bringing down the age profile of commanding officers.        
	This will be a great motivator for everybody in the armed forces, the air force chief, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, told reporters.        
	The difference will be felt most at the middle level where the present age of a lieutenant colonel is around 41 years. With the changes, an army major can be a lieutenant colonel at 35 years, sources said.        
	It would also mean the commanding officer in the Siachen heights will be a young brigadier in his early forties instead of one reaching his 50th year. In the air force, there will be young group captains (equivalent to colonels) who will be commanding at 36 years.        
	Apparently, A.K. Antony worked for two years at getting the services to agree on the report. Sources said the army wanted a bigger share of the upgraded posts proportional to its size.

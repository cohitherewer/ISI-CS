	Bhubaneswar, June 23: In south Orissa, young medical professionals are ensuring that the state gets to say Hello Doctor 24X7 and receives a quick response.        
	Devendra Tiwari, Smruti Ranjan Pattnaik and Lalit Ranjan Manick  all doctors of MKCG Medical College and Hospital  have come up with a project plan (Hello Doctor 24X7) that aims to take medical help to every doorstep in Orissa through mobile phone.        
	Their vision is of a help line, which once established, would be linking homes in most villages, towns and cities to a group of doctors, enabling quicker help in emergencies.        
	Their plan recently made into the final of India Innovation Pioneers Challenge 2007-08, a DST-Intel technology business plan competition held in partnership with Indo-US Science and Technology Forum.         
	The eclinic should bridge the gap between modern healthcare facility in urban and rural areas, said Tiwari.        
	The project would focus on providing tele-medicine services to people at home, starting specialised referral units in small towns, providing specialised services at affordable cost and outsourcing of tele-radiology, tele-pathology and medical information.         
	According to a FICCI study, tele-medicine will be an industry worth Rs 2,000 crore by 2012.         
	The healthcare Knowledge Processing and Outsourcing (KPO) industry will grow into a giant of $22.8 billion industry. The market has remained mostly unexplored within India and there is a huge potential in foreign countries, said Manick.        
	Mobile phones have entered every section in India, including rural areas. The number of persons using the Internet at home in urban areas is also increasing.         
	Our team will be presenting the project to a experts jury from the industry and academia on July 18, said Smruti Ranjan.

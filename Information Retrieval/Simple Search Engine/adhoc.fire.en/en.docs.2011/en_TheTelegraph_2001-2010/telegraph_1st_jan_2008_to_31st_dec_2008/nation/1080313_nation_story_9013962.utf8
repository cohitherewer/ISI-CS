The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Son looks beyond trial shift
                                                                                                               Son looks beyond trial shift
          OUR BUREAU                          Himanshu                                  
	Bhopal, March 12: The Supreme Court today transferred the H.S. Sabharwal case from Ujjain to Nagpur, but the slain professors son is not satisfied.        
	In an open letter to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Himanshu Sabharwal has asked for a CBI probe into Sabharwals murder while supervising student union elections in Ujjains Madhav College on August 26, 2006.        
	Five members of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the BJPs student wing, face murder charges. All 54 witnesses had turned hostile in the Ujjain trial court.        
	Himanshu had sought the transfer of the case outside the state, alleging a cover-up in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh.        
	The Supreme Court, which had last week indicated that it would transfer the case out of Madhya Pradesh, formalised the decision through a detailed order today.         
	The court said the state has a definite role to play in protecting the witnesses, to start with at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, who have political patronage and could wield muscle and money power, to avert a trial getting tainted and derailed and truth becoming a casualty.        
	The bench also directed that the public prosecutor be changed.        
	In his letter, Himanshu has threatened to go on a fast unto death from March 20 if a CBI probe was not ordered.        
	He termed todays directive a moral and token victory but added: It has not sanctioned retrial or a CBI probe.        
	According to him, merely transferring the case out of Madhya Pradesh would not have much impact. If a judge in Nagpur is going to take a view on the same evidence  or rather the lack of it  the purpose of taking the case out of the state may be defeated.        
	In his letter to the chief minister, Himanshu has listed the incidents he believes were aimed at weakening the trial.        
	In his first reaction to Sabharwals death, Chauhan had called it a hadsa (accident)        
	Policemen on duty who were witness to the murder turned hostile but the state government did not take any disciplinary action        
	Two police officers who had been suspended for failing to prevent the political science professors murder were later promoted        
	The chief minister had visited prime accused Vimal Tomar in an Indore hospital.

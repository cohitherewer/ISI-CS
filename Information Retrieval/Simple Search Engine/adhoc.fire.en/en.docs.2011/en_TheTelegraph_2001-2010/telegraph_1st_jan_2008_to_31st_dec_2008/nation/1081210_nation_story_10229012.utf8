          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 9: Justice PK Patra Commission, probing the Ganjam hooch deaths in 2006, has failed to find any political-bureaucratic nexus leading to the tragedy.        
	No specific evidence of political-bureaucratic nexus was found by the commission, said a senior official of the state excise department.        
	The probe report, along with an action-taken report, was placed before the cabinet today prior to being tabled in the Assembly during the current session. The major terms of reference for the probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act were whether there was any nexus between the politicians and bureaucracy and the circumstances leading to the hooch tragedy which had claimed 19 lives.        
	The hooch tragedy had taken place in two phases in 2006  first at Rambha between March 16 and 22 and second at Golabandha between April 22 and 24. While 13 people were killed at Rambha, six more died in at Golabandha.        
	Incidentally, both the tragedies had taken place in Ganjam district, chief minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.        
	The Opposition had pointed fingers at the chief ministers office and energy minister Surya Narayan Patro  both of whom belong to Ganjam. They had alleged that Naveens office and the excise department had adopted soft attitude towards the district excise officials despite recommendation by the administration to take action against them.         
	Having found himself in a tizzy, Naveen had asked then excise minister Kalindi Charan Behera to step down owning moral responsibility.        
	Although the Patra Commission took almost two years to complete its probe, it, however, mentioned in its 92-page report that no specific evidence of political-bureaucratic nexus was found.        
	The commission seems to be satisfied with the disciplinary actions taken by the government. Five criminal cases had been registered and 14 excise officials, including the district excise superintendent and one police inspector, had been suspended.

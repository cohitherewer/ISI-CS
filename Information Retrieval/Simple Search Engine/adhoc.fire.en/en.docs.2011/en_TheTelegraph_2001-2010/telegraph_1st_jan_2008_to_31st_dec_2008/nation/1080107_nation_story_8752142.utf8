       caretaker and role model?

	London, Jan. 6 (PTI): Benazir Bhuttos husband today said he would be a Sonia Gandhi to his Pakistan Peoples Party, minus the parliament seat.
    
	Asif Ali Zardari also blamed President Pervez Musharraf for Bhuttos killing without naming him. He said his wife was so certain the government was bugging her house that she would summon her closest aides to the garden to tell them about the next days programme.
    
	If our party wins next months elections, I will not take a cabinet post but will act like Sonia Gandhi, as an advisory figure without a seat in the parliament, Zardari told a British newspaper.
    
	After Bhuttos assassination on December 27, her 19-year-old son Bilawal was made party chairman but the real power was left in the hands of his father, appointed party co-chairman.
    
	Zardari had fears about the election being held at all. We dont have any faith that there will be elections. They might make another huge incident. Anyone could be a target.
    
	The polls, earlier scheduled for January 8, have been put off till February 18 after the assassination and the riots that followed.
    
	Zardari said that the night before the murder, he had begged his wife over the phone to stop holding rallies and let him take her place.
    
	She had just addressed this public meeting in Peshawar where they had caught this suicide bomber, Zardari said. I told her, for Gods sake be careful, but she said, What can I do? I have to go and meet my people.
    
	I pleaded with her: You stay home and Ill go do the rallies. Youre the mother.
    
	Zardari said that Bhuttos will naming him her successor, read out at the party meeting where Bilawal was anointed, was only her political will.
    
	Theres this (other) handwritten document in which she even says who to give her clothes and shoes to, which servant to give what to, the trust she wanted set up and how it should be run.
    
	Zardari did not know it existed. The day her remains came to Naudero (Bhuttos ancestral home in Sindh) a person came from Dubai and said, I have this document that madam left with me.
    
	Zardari admitted there were corruption allegations against him. But he said he had spent several years in jail on charges that could never be proved and insisted he was the victim of a long-term smear campaign. The day I got engaged to her was when they planned this move.
    
	Asked if he denied ever taking kickbacks on government contracts, Zardari retorted: Why should I do it? If one was to do that then one would stay with them because then there wouldnt be any inquisitions or accountability processes. They were always offering me deals. If money was what I was interested in, all I had to do was say: thank you Bibi (Bhutto), Im off. And I could have had whatever I wanted.
    
	Zardari has no doubt who he thinks is behind his wifes assassination.
    
	He referred to an email she sent to Mark Siegel, a US lobbyist, which pointed the finger directly at Musharraf.
    
	Weve taken that as her last message. She talks about it from her grave and its up to the world to listen.

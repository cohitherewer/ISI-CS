          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Famous pupil: Manmohan Singh studied in Panjab University                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The Centre has decided against pressing for central status to Panjab University after the Prime Ministers Office signalled a stop to efforts that may gain the government support among teachers but trigger a backlash from students.        
	Government officials said they had begun looking for sites for a central university in Punjab instead of pushing for central status to the institution that is Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs alma mater.         
	It became hard, politically, for the PMO to push for central status to Panjab University, an official said.         
	The decision to pull back represents a shift in mood at the Centre, which has engaged in a silent battle with Punjab for several months after varsity faculty members petitioned Singh seeking New Delhis control over the university.         
	Teachers would have benefited from the move because the retirement age for faculty members of central universities is 65. The age of superannuation is lower in states. Pension and other benefits are also higher for central university teachers as compared to counterparts in state universities.         
	Singh completed his undergraduate studies from the university in 1952 and his postgraduation in 1954.         
	The petitions coincided with a period when the Centre had announced that under the 11th five-year plan it would ensure a central university in each state. Punjab does not have a central university and the government examined possibilities to convert Panjab University into one.         
	But the government now finds itself snowed under a barrage of petitions and political arguments against converting the institution into a central university, the sources said. Many of these petitions claim to represent views of students and their parents.         
	As a central university, the institution would have to implement national quotas for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes that state universities do not need to implement.        
	The governments attempts to enforce the OBC quota in Panjab University this year saw opposition from sections of the state government, which argued that seats available for Punjabi students would come down. Central universities also cannot offer benefits to students from a particular state.         
	The state government, which initially accepted the proposal for a change in status, withdrew its acceptance in early September. Perceptions that students from the state would oppose the change in status were key to Punjabs decision, state government officials said.        
	That argument appears to have hit home with the central political leadership, too, now. That alone can explain why we are no longer expected to push for central status to Panjab University, an official said.

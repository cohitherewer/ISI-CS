The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Freezing in Slovak, minus promised aid
                                                                                                               Freezing in Slovak, minus promised aid
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Shubhadeep                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: In the sub-zero temperatures of a Bratislava suburb, Shubhadeep Roychoudhary squeezes time from research on animal sperm to teach English to Slovak schoolchildren in a desperate attempt to make ends meet.         
	Yet, towards the end of the month, he sometimes skips meals - because the Indian government has failed to deliver the promised stipend for his stay in the Slovak Republic during his postgraduate studies.         
	He is a doctoral fellow at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, 90km outside Bratislava.        
	M. Mahesh, a scholar in biotechnology at the Slovak Agricultural Research Centre in Bratislava, shares his plight.         
	The only two Indian students in the former Soviet satellite are now running between their laboratories and the embassy in Bratislava, trying to understand why the stipend has suddenly dried up.         
	It is minus 3C today afternoon, but the temperature drops to minus 20. We gain warmth by thinking of India. But the country seems to have forgotten us, Roychoudhary said on Wednesday.         
	The battle for survival started almost immediately after they landed in the Slovak Republic in 2004, on a monthly scholarship from its government worth 5,000 Slovak Koruny (SKK) - equivalent to Rs 8,760. The amount appeared enough from India - postgraduate scholars here get Rs 8,000 a month.         
	But the entry of the republic into the European Union saw inflation rates rise steeply. In 2004, the country had 7.5 per cent inflation, almost double Indias rate.        
	A cheap, single-room flat, where I now live, costs around SKK 5,000. It became impossible, Roychoudhary told The Telegraph over the phone.         
	The two students came from different places - Roychoudhary is from Silchar, Assam, while Mahesh is from Karnataka - but circumstances have turned them into close friends, they said.         
	International students across universities in the Slovak Republic complained against what they called the discriminatory policy of the government there, according to officials at the Indian embassy.         
	Slovak postgraduate students were getting SKK 15,000 a month despite the fact that they had homes here. Following the students complaint, the government here raised the monthly scholarship to SKK 6,000, a senior official, handling education at the embassy, said.         
	By then though, the cost of living had risen further. In 2006, Bratislava was ranked the 31st most expensive city in the world - it was 48th the previous year - in the Mercer cost-of-living index.         
	It was then that the two landed at the doorstep of the embassy, recalled the official.         
	The embassy forwarded their request for financial assistance to the human resource development ministry, which had selected them for the scholarship in 2004. The ministry agreed to a yearly stipend of SKK 30,000 (Rs 52,500).         
	Along with the money came a promise that the stipend would continue till we completed our PhDs. But after one year - mid 2007 - it has stopped. Now, I have been assured by the embassy again. I am waiting, Roychoudhary said.         
	Back at the HRD headquarters in Shastri Bhavan, officials admitted that the plea of the two students had not been a priority.         
	According to the scheme under which the students were promised 30,000 SKK, we have to review the stipend each year. That review takes time, conceded an official. It may take a few more months.

	New Delhi, May 28: A spur  of-the-moment experiment by   a Goa-educated doctor in Scot
  land has helped scientists dis  cover a novel property of bre  ast cancer tissues that might   improve diagnosis and treat  ment of the disease.   
	 Cancer surgeon Jayant   Sharad Vaidya and his colleagues at the University of   Dundee have found that when   resected breast tissues are exposed to heat, malignant tu  mours within them remain   cooler than normal tissues.   
	 The temperatures of the   tumours remained 12 deg;C to   20 deg;C below the temperatures   of normal tissues, the scientists have reported in the International Journal of Surgery.   
	 ldquo;The tumours respond dif  ferently to heat. Understanding why this happens may give  us fresh clues about the nature   of cancer itself, rdquo; Vaidya told   The Telegraph over the   phone.  
	 ldquo;The response of tumours   to heat has never been studied   until now. This observation   op-ens a new door that may   lead to better diagnosis and   treatment, rdquo; said Vaidya, who   had studied at the Goa Medical   College and the Tata Memori  al Centre, Mumbai.				   
	Standard methods of dete-  c-ting breast cancer include ph-  y-sical examination, mammog  raphy and magnetic resona-n-  ce imaging. Each of these uses   a unique property that differ  entiates the tumour from the   surrounding healthy tissues.							   
	A physical exam looks for   typical hard features of tumo-  urs. A mammography relies   on X-rays, and magnetic reso  nance imaging is based on  how tissues interact with mag  netic fields.   
	 ldquo;But none of them is per  fect, rdquo; Colin Purdie, a consult  ant pathologist and team   member at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee told The Telegraph. The different response  to heat shown by the tumours   suggests that doctors may be   able to look for tumours using   an entirely new property, Purdie said.  
	 Vaidya said the experime-  nt was the result of an almost   impulsive decision to observe   what happens when freshly-  resected breast tissues are ex  posed to heat.  
	 ldquo;We have a medical techno-  logy lab. They were testing a   new thermal imaging instru  ment, and I had resected brea-  st tissues. I wondered what  would happen if I exposed it to   a hot air gun, rdquo; Vaidya said.																								   
	The scientists subsequent  ly exposed six specimens of   breast cancer to heat and fou-  nd that in every specimen the   tumour warmed less than the  surrounding healthy tissues.   
	The differential heat respo-  nse of tumours might emerge   a tool to help surgeons trying   to remove tumours from bre-  ast tissues mdash; a delicate pro-  cess aimed at removing all the   malignant foci, while conserv  ing as much healthy breast tis  sue as possible.   
	 ldquo;Identifying the margins   of tumours is important, rdquo;   Purdie said.  
	 But the doctors caution   that their observations would   need to be validated through a   larger number of samples,   and a method to apply this  technique to living patients   has yet to be developed.							   
	Healthy tissues and tu  mours at normal tempera  tures show no difference when   examined through a thermal   imaging camera. They re  spond differently only when   excess heat is applied.							   
	In patients, doctors are un  likely to expose breast tissues   to significant differences in   temperatures. But sensitive   thermal imaging equipment   may be able to detect decimal   point differences of tempera  tures when tissues are heated   to just one or two degrees, Vaidya said.

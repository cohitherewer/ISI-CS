	New Delhi, May 8: The Supreme Court today asked the Centre if it would consider an alignment for the Sethusamudram ship canal skirting the Ram Setu, instead of cutting through the structure.           A bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, made the suggestion at the end of a daylong hearing on the case.                   
	Gurgaon (PTI): A court has cancelled the arms licence of actress Soha Ali Khan on the ground that she had not attained the age of 21 when she applied for it. Sohas father and former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi had allegedly used the rifle to shoot a black buck.                  
	Nashik (PTI): The army plans to use mobile jammers near the Punjab border to avert spying through mobile towers erected by Pakistan. General Thamburaj of the southern command said some Pakistan-erected towers near the border were meant to eavesdrop on India.                  
	Sirsa (PTI): A person in Haryana allegedly set his estranged friends wife on fire following a tiff over money matters.

The neighbours took Meenakshi to hospital.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): Two persons were injured and two cars damaged by a low-intensity blast in a gas-run car in south Delhi, police said. The blast near Lado Sarai traffic signal was probably caused by a leak. It occurred around 10pm on Wednesday and affected traffic on the route.                  
	 Jammu (PTI): The summer heat caused a fire on Trikuta hills, the cave shrine of Vaishnodevi in Jammu and Kashmir, on Wednesday night but it did not affect the pilgrims route, official sources said on Thursday.

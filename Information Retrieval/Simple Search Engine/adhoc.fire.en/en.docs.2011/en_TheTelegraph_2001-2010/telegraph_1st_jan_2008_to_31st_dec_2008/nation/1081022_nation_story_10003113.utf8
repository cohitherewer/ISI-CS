										      Guest Column -Gerson Da Cunha                                    
	As a TV ch-annel said last night, Raj Thackeray has been arrested, gagged and grounded. He cools his heels in a Kalyan lock-up  this is a township just beyond the municipal limits of Mumbai  with time to reflect and giving us time to do the same.        
	Raj Thackeray is part Bollywood, part old fashioned Shiv Sena, the party founded by his uncle from which he split. He is Bollywood because he has a perpetual eye on himself, an aspirant super star, and on box office, the political cash register. Old fashioned Shiv Sena stands for bringing the city to a standstill to make a political point and common-or-garden blackmail/extortion. He hoped that the citys Marathi millions would rise with a single blast of the tutari (a Maratha musical instrument) in his favour. The blackmail bit is squeezing political strength from a feeble state government at sixes and seventeens. On a day when the battle went gloriously for India at Mohali (Shame! Less space on the front pages), it went less well for Raj in Mumbai.        
	As news of his arrest spread far and swiftly, some of the city stayed indoors rather than risk broken windscreens and endless rasta rokos on the suburban trains. But it was not enough really to matter. The stock exchange, where the grubby heart of Mumbai lies, palpitated as prices rose. It was not business as usual, but Rajs Maha Nirman Sena was revealed for what it is, a party with an undersized following, making its points purely with the lumpen and lawlessness, not a groundswell of peoples will. Late at night, the only real trouble spot was indeed Kalyan, where Thackeray has been jailed.        
	The state government, too, has come out of it badly. For months, it has dithered about what to do with Raj as he prospered. It is common knowledge that, on the one hand, this whole business is an intra-Thackeray matter, with Raj determined to show up his more subtle, more mannerly cousin Uddhav. On the other, the state government was naively hoping that the rivalry would split the Maharashtrian vote, particularly in the city. Hence, tolerance of Rajs outrageous actions and utterances.        
	Government performance was shown up in a single afternoon because police were simply allowed to do their job. The police brought mobs and situations under control, though outnumbered. A determined police force, at last, ensured that Mumbai did not go up in flames, as the MNS had threatened.        
	It is shameful that we live in a city run by people who need a tough call from Delhi to do their simple duty by the citizens for whom they are responsible. Rajs doings in Mumbai were recently dubbed terrorism by a bench of Bombay High Court. In which case, what seems to be happening is state-sponsored terrorism.        
	What else is it, when the chief minister and deputy chief minister, also home minister, stand around with creases on the forehead, yes, but hands in the pocket? The uncertainty that overhangs the city when Thackeray chooses to raise a fist is something for which those leaders are singularly responsible. The enemy of the people is not young Thackeray but the state.        
	To make an elderly point, some of us have lamented as Bombay became Mumbai and turned from a world-class city into a provincial suburb of the new-rich. Worse, the cause is a good thing: democracy. But ours is a democracy that has spawned a self-serving polity of persons looting the till.        
	However, there is hope. Chandrayaan will be launched early tomorrow, an initiative born in the mind of someone called Sarabhai who lived here when the city was pioneering everything new and good in our land.

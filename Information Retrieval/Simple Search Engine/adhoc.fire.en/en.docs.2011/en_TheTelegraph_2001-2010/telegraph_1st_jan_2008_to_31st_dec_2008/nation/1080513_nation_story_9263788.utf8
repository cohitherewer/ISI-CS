                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun rush to cry alls well

	May 12: A beleaguered Arjun Singh today insisted that he had not fallen out with Sonia Gandhi in an effort to retrieve lost ground following a clamour for his scalp from within the Congress.         
	The human resource development minister said he shouldnt be treated like a terrorist after talk in party circles that some leaders wanted Sonia to discipline him.        
	Arjun also clarified that he was no sycophant. Only conviction guides my direction. What my conviction is the world knows, he said in a series of television interviews today.         
	Late at night, Arjun attended a Congress core committee meeting at the Prime Ministers residence. Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Ahmad Patel were among those present and sources said price rise and the Karnataka elections were discussed without fiery exchanges.        
	Earlier in the day, Arjun said he had not felt even for a moment that his relationship with Sonia had strained. I never felt it for a moment. Thats all I can say, he told a private news channel.         
	He also said he had exchanged pleasant words with the Congress chief at a convocation on Saturday. You dont exchange courtesies and give it to the press, he said.         
	Asked whether Sonia had asked him a few months ago to give up the HRD ministry, Arjun said it was a canard. She never spoke to me about it, he said. Never.        
	He said though off-the-record briefings  the practice of speaking to journalists on the condition of anonymity  had got institutionalised in the Congress, he was neither bothered nor interested to know who all are doing it.         
	Throughout 2005, when Uma Bharti was suspended and then expelled from the BJP, the sanyasin had repeatedly accused some BJP leaders like Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley of planting stories against her through off-the-record briefings.         
	Asked whether he felt slighted after serving the Congress for many years, Arjun said: I have gone through all these things, perhaps in a slightly more worse scenario. But he added that it would not shake him from his path and belief.        
	AICC spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, asked whether the Arjun controversy was a closed chapter, said: Arjun has said the chapter is closed, so it is also closed for us. And all other questions should be addressed to him. He has opened the book and he has closed it.         
	On Arjuns charge that there was no internal democracy in the Congress, Singhvi said: The Congress party has too much democracy and too much discussion. We are accused of too much multi-layered discussion. So any charge of lack of democracy cannot but be baseless.        
	He also contradicted the claim that Arjun had reservations about the Emergency. We do not recollect him ever coming out in opposition to the Emergency in the last 30 years, he said.         
	The sources said the Arjun issue might figure in the next Congress Working Committee meeting.         
	Although the meeting date has not been announced, a section of AICC functionaries feel Arjuns indiscretions should be discussed at the partys highest decision-making body.        
	Going by the head count, Arjun is virtually isolated in the 24-member CWC.        
	But then he is known for being a lone ranger. Throughout the Narasimha Rao era  1991-96, though Arjun left the party in 1995  he participated in dozens of meetings only to see his colleagues launch scathing attacks on him.

	With the best and luxurious hospitality, the newly elected legislators would move under strict vigilance of party cadre. Besides the main political parties  the Congress and BJP  Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which might gain third position, will also put security ring of party workers around the elected legislators.

	In the 90-member House, psephologists have not ruled out the possibility of a hung Assembly. In such a situation, political parties would pull all strings to break the legislators of opposition party to meet the required number. We have asked all our candidates to reach Raipur by Saturday night, the BJP leader said. The parties have prepared small groups of workers who would escort the new legislators and keep them under the circle in isolation.

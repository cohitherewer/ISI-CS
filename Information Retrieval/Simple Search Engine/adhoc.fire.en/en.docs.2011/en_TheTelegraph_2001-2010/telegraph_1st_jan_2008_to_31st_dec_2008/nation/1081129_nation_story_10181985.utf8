          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 28: Calcutta High Court today ruled that candidates who did not have BEd degrees could sit for the Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) examinations.        
	This ruling will enable nearly four lakh students to take part in the exams which they could not have done if the court had ruled otherwise.        
	A petition, filed in the court recently, said that according to the National Council for Teachers Education Act, 1993, only candidates with BEd degrees could be appointed as teachers in state-aided secondary and higher secondary schools. It had challenged the states decision not to follow this rule.         
	There are 15,000 vacant schoolteachers posts across Bengal. The state government, which was in a dilemma on how to fill these vacancies, was relieved after todays ruling.         
	The court upheld the state governments decision to appoint teachers without BEd degrees through the SSC exams and said the National Council for Teachers Education had no authority to fix the minimum qualification of school teachers.         
	The bench comprised Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S. Banerjee .

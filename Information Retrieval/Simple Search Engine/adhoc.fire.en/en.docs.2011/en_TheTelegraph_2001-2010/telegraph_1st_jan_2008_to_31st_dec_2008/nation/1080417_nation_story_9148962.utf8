          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 16: Calcutta police have demanded Rs 30 lakh for every IPL match to be played at Eden Gardens, six times the fee the force usually charges the cricket association.        
	The charge for heavy police arrangement has been spelt out in a letter the force sent to Red Chillies Entertainment, owned by Shah Rukh Khan.        
	We have intimated them about the charge. It has also been made clear why we are charging the amount from them, Vineet Goyal, DC, headquarters, told The Telegraph. We do not see any point of dispute.        
	However, a spokesperson for Red Chillies Entertainment said: We have got the proposal from Calcutta police, but we havent reacted as we think it is not our responsibility.        
	According to him, the affiliated units of the BCCI, such as the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), are supposed to organise the home matches of their respective teams, in this case, Kolkata Knight Riders, supported by the ABP Group.But the custodians of Eden Gardens have passed the buck to us, the spokesperson added.        
	But CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said: Red Chillies Entertainment has to pay the entire amount. Why should we pay? We are not organising the match.         
	He added that no agreement had been reached with the BCCI that the staging associations would have to bear such expenses.        
	In Bangalore, where the first IPL match will be played on Friday, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials said they had no role in the matter.         
	 The KSCA stadium has been taken over by Vijay Mallya, the owner of the Bangalore IPL team. Entertainment, ticketing, transport and security have been outsourced to an event management company.        
	However, BNS Reddy, DCP, central Bangalore, said the police are willing to provide security at Rs 2 lakh a match. Not many police personnel are needed. Its only a league match and we will not need strong security cover.        
	According to Calcutta police, 5,000 policemen will be deployed for each match. It will include everything, right from escorting players from their hotels to playground, deploying policemen in and around the stadium and security arrangement at the hotels where cricketers will be staying, a senior official said.        
	Calcutta police provide the same service for all international matches played in Eden Gardens. For those matches, organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), the police charge Rs 5 lakh a day.         
	Explaining why the fee this time is six times more, the official said: The concept of organising the matches is fully commercial. Red Chillies is going to do business here and there will be a number of entertainment events inside the stadium. For this, we will have to provide a different type of security arrangement.

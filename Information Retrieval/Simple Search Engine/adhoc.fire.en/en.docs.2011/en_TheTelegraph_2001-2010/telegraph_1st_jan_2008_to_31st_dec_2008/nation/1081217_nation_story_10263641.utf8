The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dec 25 bandh on, defying govt order
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dec 25 bandh on, defying govt order
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Will Kandhamal burn again?                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: Sangh Parivar outfits are keen to observe a statewide bandh on Christmas despite a ban to stave off further communal clashes triggered by the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati in Kandhamal on August 23.        
	The Naveen Patnaik government also does not want to take any chances, as the district witnessed a spate of violence last year after churches were torched on Christmas.        
	However, the Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Shraddhanjali Samiti, a Sangh Parivar outfit, is not convinced even as four persons were arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder. Come what may, we will go ahead with our decision to observe the bandh on December 25 as the government has failed to fulfil our demands within the deadline, said samiti president Ratnakar Chaini, adding that no real conspirators of the crime had been arrested so far. No government action will deter us from going ahead with our plan as there is tremendous popular support to the bandh call, he said.        
	Last night, the chief minister had announced that no bandh would be allowed on Christmas and warned that the government would come down heavily on anyone who tries to create any trouble.         
	The shocking and tragic incidents of communal violence that took place in December last year and in August this year should never be repeated, Naveen said while replying to a debate in the Assembly on the Kandhamal violence.        
	Samiti secretary Laxmikanta Dash alleged that Naveen was trying to sacrifice the respect of the state, wilting under pressure from foreign countries and the central government.         
	Naveen is desperate to protect only his chair, Dash said, admitting that they had the support of Sangh Parivar for the bandh.        
	However, coalition partner BJP is tightlipped over the matter. BJP legislature party leader and industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan declined to comment.

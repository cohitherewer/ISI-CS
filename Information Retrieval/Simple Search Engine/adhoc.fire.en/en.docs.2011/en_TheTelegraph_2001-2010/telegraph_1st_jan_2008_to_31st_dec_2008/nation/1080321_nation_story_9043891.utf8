	Dharamsala, March 20: The organisers of the march to Tibet have hinted at a softening of their stand after the Dalai Lamas appeal to them yesterday to call the programme off.        
	Personally, I think the directive of His Holiness the Dalai Lama should be followed, Chime Youngdung, president of the National Democratic Party of Tibet, one of the five organisations behind the march, said today.        
	But the decision on the march will be announced officially following consultations among the five organisations through a news conference, probably tomorrow.        
	Sources said the youth leaders were gradually dropping their opposition to the Dalai Lamas middle way approach, and that the five NGOs were likely to start following the government-in-exiles directions.        
	Sources said the calls for total independence were now likely to stop and the march to Tibet called off. This, analysts believe, can cool tensions in Lhasa and elsewhere in Tibet.        
	Over the past few weeks, young Tibetans had been demanding independence and declining to guarantee a non-violent protest. The Dalai Lama, on the other hand, had stuck to his call for meaningful autonomy and said he would resign as temporal head of the Tibetans if the protest turned violent.        
	But the chances of the youth cooperating with the government-in-exile seemed to brighten yesterday as reports said the Chinese Premier had spoken to the British Prime Minister about possible talks with the monk.        
	The Dalai Lama today told reporters at his home that he did not mind going to Beijing, but unless the Chinese offered something concrete, his visit would only end up raising his peoples expectations.        
	He, however, said he was keen to meet Chinas leaders, President Hu Jintao in particular, after the protests subsided in Tibet.        
	If concrete indications come from China, I will be happy to meet the Chinese leaders, Hu Jintao in particular. Although it is not practical to go to Beijing at this moment, I am ready to go after the crisis (ends), he said.        
	He, however, added that he feared more bloodshed with Chinese forces having entered almost all the regions of Tibet.        
	The movements of Chinese troops have worried me. I fear a lot of casualties from the Chinese crackdown, he said. Tomorrow, the Dalai Lama is to meet the Speaker of the US House of Representatives at his residence. Nancy Pelosi is expected in Dharamsala in the morning.

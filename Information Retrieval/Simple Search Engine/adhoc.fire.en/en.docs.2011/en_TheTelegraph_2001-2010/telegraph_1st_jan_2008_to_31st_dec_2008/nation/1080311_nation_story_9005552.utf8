The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Info watchdog trips on its own rules
                                                                                                               Info watchdog trips on its own rules
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 10: Indias information watchdog has apparently not replied to an application seeking details of its work for over a year.         
	The question being asked is whether the Central Information Commission, the upholder of the Right to Information Act, would punish itself for allegedly violating the transparency law.         
	Forced to answer the question for the first time, the commission has opted for introspection and self-reprimand, but steered clear of punishing its officers. It has ordered an internal inquiry, sources said.         
	The commission has said it did not receive the application, so it was not guilty of any violation.         
	But the appellant, Secunderabad-based M.K. Shaji, has shown the commission documents from the local post office stating that the application was delivered at the commission headquarters in New Delhi.         
	Since he did not receive a reply, Shaji wrote again. This appeal also did not get him a response.         
	Under the act, appellants first seek information from the government authority. If they are not satisfied with the response, they file the first appeal with a designated senior official  the appellate authority  in the department.         
	The appellant, if dissatisfied, can turn to the commission on his second appeal.         
	In this case, the initial application, the first and the second appeals should have come to the commission itself, officials said. The commission is the final arbiter in the implementation of the act.         
	It is clear that there has been a mix-up. The postal department says it delivered the application, but our register does not show any entry. It is certainly the most embarrassing situation we have faced, a senior official said.         
	In the only previous instance when an application has asked for information related to the commission, an appellant sought details on the appointment of information commissioners.         
	When the government did not respond, the appellant came to the commission. But since the alleged violator of the law was the government, the commission did not have to pass orders in the case.         
	This case identifies a distinct failure in the registry of this commission since the letters clearly indicate that the application and the first appeal were actually delivered, chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah said in his order closing the case.         
	Shaji first wrote to the panel on November 22, 2006, asking for the number of complaints received since the act came into force in late 2005.

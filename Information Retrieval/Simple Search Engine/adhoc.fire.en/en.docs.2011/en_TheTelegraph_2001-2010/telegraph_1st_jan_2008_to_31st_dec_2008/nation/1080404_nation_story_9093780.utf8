          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Lawyers intensify strike. Picture by Deepak Kumar    
	Patna, April 3: The indefinite strike called by lawyers in the state spilled on to the streets today as hundreds of lawyers and advocates in black robes disrupted traffic and burnt tyres.         
	Their action warranted police intervention. The force detained 100 of them in a local police station.         
	The lawyers of Patna High Court and subsidiary courts have been agitating against a proposed court fee hike.         
	Lawyers today poured into the busy Bailey Road blocking traffic for hours and shouting slogans against the government.         
	We detained around 100 lawyers in the police station and released them later, said an officer of the Pirbahore police station, where the lawyers were detained.         
	Court proceedings across the state continued to be affected for the fourth day today.         
	We are not going to resume work unless the government withdraws the hike, said Rana Pratap Singh, the president of Patna High Court Bar Association.         
	The co-ordination committee of three lawyers association yesterday had resolved to continue with the stir.         
	Singh said the co-ordination committee has invited representatives of 122 Bar associations from Bihars districts to attend a meeting to discuss the future course of agitation in Patna on April 7.         
	The lawyers of the subordinate courts at Danapur, Patna city, Patna district collectorate, Chapra, Siwan, Kishenganj, Purnia, Barh and Masaurhi have already gone on an indefinite strike to protest against the issue.        
	The court fee has been hiked on the recommendation of the Shetty Commission and the government has, so far, not pondered on the matter properly, rued an official of the law department.        
	Hundreds of Patna lawyers blocked the busy Ashok Rajpath near Pirbahore police station for more than two hours, again disrupting traffic.

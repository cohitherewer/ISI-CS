The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal pragmatists in politburo
                                                                                                               Bengal pragmatists in politburo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Coimbatore, April 3: If the changes involving Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet marked the end of an era in the CPM, the inclusion of Nirupam Sen, the Bengal industries minister, and Mohammad Amin, the Citu general secretary, suggested the continuity of pragmatism.        
	Apart from the Bengal duo, Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan is another new face in the politburo, which now has 15 members. The outgoing politburo had 17 berths  although the effective strength was 14 because of death and illness  leaving open the possibility of future additions.        
	The choice of Sen, considered Bengals industrialisation ideologue, has the hallmark of endorsement by the central leadership. The Bengal unit had suggested the names of Sen and Shyamal Chakraborty, indicating that general secretary Prakash Karat should take the final decision.        
	Soon after his inclusion in the partys highest policy-making body, Sen said: I dont consider it a personal achievement but a recognition of our collective effort to practise our ideology creatively in a changed situation. We have to be realistic, he said.        
	Sen said he would have to strike a balance between his role as industries minister and politburo member. We have to strike a balance between the partys policies at the national level, the needs of mass movements in states, our partys growth where we are weak and the constraints and limitations of Left Front governments. My responsibility has increased, he added.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: I am happy that he (Sen) has been inducted.        
	Citu leader Amin has been included as the successor to Chittabrata Mazumder. His elevation conforms to the practice of placing workers among the leadership along with revolutionary intellectuals.        
	I worked in Baranagar Jute Mill for five years and know the work of bidi workers, he recalled.        
	But unlike Mazumder, a former labour minister and a jute mill worker himself, the low-profile Amin is not known as a hardliner. We stand for the right to strike. But it should be the last resort and we have to be careful about calling strikes at the drop of a hat, he said.        
	Amin refused to be identified as the politburos minority face  a conclusion many drew as the party is increasingly trying to develop its base among Muslims.         
	Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty did not secure a berth in the new central committee, leaving party watchers to await the composition of the more influential state secretariat to see whether he would make the cut on the back of Jyoti Basus support.        
	Housing minister Gautam Deb and fellow members of the state secretariat, Madan Ghosh and Mridul De, were inducted into the 87-member committee. Former Bengal minister Kanti Biswas and serving minister Rekha Goswami were elected to the central control commission, the CPMs disciplinary body.        
	On Jyoti Basu, the leadership said it tried hard to dissuade the patriarch from leaving the politburo. We wanted him to continue but had to relieve him on health grounds, Bhattacharjee said.        
	He sent a letter requesting the party to release him from regular responsibilities. He has been asking for retirement for long and we have so far resisted. This time, too, we didnt accept all his wishes and he would continue in the central committee, said Bengal party secretary Biman Bose.         
	Bose, not always known to be close to Basu, said the veterans absence would create a gap. But Citu president M.K. Pandhe said: We will try to fill the gap. We will always seek his guidance and opinion. Some meetings of the politburo will be held in Calcutta to facilitate Jyotibabus presence.

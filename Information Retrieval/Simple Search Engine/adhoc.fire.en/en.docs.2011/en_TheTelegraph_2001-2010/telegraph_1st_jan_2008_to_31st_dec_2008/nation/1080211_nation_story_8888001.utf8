The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul eager, too much for some
                                                                                                            Rahul eager, too much for some
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN      
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Congress Lok Sabha MPs drafted for organisational work with Rahul Gandhi last September apparently dont share his enthusiasm for their jobs.        
	Some of them have conveyed to Sonia Gandhis aides that when she next shuffled the organisation, they would want to relinquish their responsibilities as general secretaries and secretaries.        
	Reason: these MPs think that unlike Rahul - whos to the manor born and will, therefore, have no problem keeping the Amethi Lok Sabha seat in his family borough in the next election - they will have to slog to get re-elected.        
	Almost all these MPs - Kishore Chandra Deo, Aruna Kumar Vundavalli and Ajay Maken (general secretaries) and Jitin Prasada, Madhu Goud Yashki, Parvez Hashmi, Priya Dutt, Sanjay Bapna and Siddharth Patel (secretaries) - were tasked to mind one or more states far removed from their home state.        
	In the Congress, this is a recipe for trouble. It is easier to run the country as the Prime Minister than look after a state as a Congress general secretary or secretary. P.V. Narasimha Rao could run the country but not the party, said a Lok Sabha MP-cum-general secretary saddled with managing two troublesome states.        
	Rahul has the added privilege of not being in charge of any state but two frontal organisations - the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India. Members of the two wings, who work like foot soldiers when drafted for election duty or a party event, are not really accountable for any setback except when the NSUI loses a campus poll.        
	Deo, an MP from Andhra Pradesh, was asked to look after Bihar and co-ordinate party programmes. Sources said while he had no problem with the latter, the soft-spoken Deo of royal lineage was a babe in the woods in the hurly-burly of Bihar politics where the Congress has been out on a limb for several years.        
	As a Lok Sabha MP, my constituents expect me to be with them when Parliament is not in session. But as a general secretary, my leaders expect me to be in my assigned states, said one member.        
	Rahul wasnt the only reason, though, for inducting the Lok Sabha MPs for organisational work. A source said the leaders believed - a little mistakenly - that having won an election, they would have a better feel of ground realities and be more adept at reconciling rival factions.        
	Thats what we are doing all the time - settling fights, pacifying egos, seeing that nobody leaves the party. But in the end we will not get the credit for any of this, said a general secretary.        
	One of them admitted that their word counted for little or nothing with the high command when it came to the crunch.        
	Maken, who minds Jharkhand, had advised the leaders that the Congress pull out of the Madhu Koda-led coalition because it had gained nothing and was about to lose everything. But the leaders in their wisdom decided otherwise, said a source.        
	In the debate on who was worthier of running the Congress organisation - the Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha MPs - it looked as though those from the House of the people were ready to yield space to their counterparts from the council of states. They have more time because they dont have a constituency to look after, a source said.

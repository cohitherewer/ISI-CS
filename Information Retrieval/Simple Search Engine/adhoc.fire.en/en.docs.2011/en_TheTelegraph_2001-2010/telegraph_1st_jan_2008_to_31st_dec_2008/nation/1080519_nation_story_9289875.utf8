	New Delhi, May 18: Terrorism and Jammu and Kashmir are set to dominate the agenda when external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee visits Pakistan on May 21.        
	Mukherjee, in his first visit to Pakistan after a new government came to power there, is expected meet the entire range of leaders, including President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari.        
	The ministerial level review of the fourth round of the composite dialogue will be held on May 21 between Mukherjee and his Pakistan counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi. The foreign ministers review meeting will be preceded by the meeting between the foreign secretaries on May 20.         
	The cross-border infiltration and the Jaipur blasts are bound to figure in the talks.        
	Although India would take up all the aspects on terrorism, it has been restrained by not blaming Pakistan for the blasts.         
	We will take up all issues related to terrorism. Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism, and the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is just one example, said a government source ahead of the talks.         
	The talks may see the joint anti-terror mechanism get better direction in terms of more intelligence sharing and mutual co-operation in addressing the issue. But sources here said because its a new government in Islamabad, it would be better to go with an open mind.

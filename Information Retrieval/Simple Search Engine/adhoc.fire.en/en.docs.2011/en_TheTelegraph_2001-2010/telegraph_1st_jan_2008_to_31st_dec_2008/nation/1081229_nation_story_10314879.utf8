                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian acrobatics on Israel air strikes
  - Delhi mulls fresh statement to factor in disproportionate use of force          JAYANTH JACOB                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The word condemn was missing and cross-border provocation figured prominently. But government sources and former diplomats today insisted that not too much should be read into Indias official reaction last night to Israels Gaza strikes.        
	The air raids  retaliation for rocket attacks by militant group Hamas that rules Gaza  have come at a time many Indians have been urging strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan in response to the Mumbai carnage. Tel Avivs action has so far killed about 290 Palestinians in two days.        
	While India is aware of the immediate cross-border provocations resulting from rocket attacks (on Israel) it urges an immediate end to the use of force against Palestinian civilians, the foreign ministry said yesterday.        
	A ministry official today said the mention of cross-border provocations was a statement of fact, and the Centre had now noted the disproportionate use of force by Israel and would issue another statement. We react to an evolving situation in due course, the official added.        
	Rajendra Abhyankar, former secretary in the foreign ministry and West Asia expert felt Delhi should raise the disproportionate force angle in its own interests.        
	That, he said, would highlight how much leeway Israel was being allowed at a time world powers are advising us to practise restraint in the wake of the Mumbai attacks.        
	However, Abhyankar too said one statement could not be seen as a shift in Delhis West Asia policy, implying that thoughts of Pakistan and not Palestine  may have driven its content.        
	Indias support to the Palestinian cause is non-negotiable, he said, but tacitly acknowledged Delhis new interests and compulsions by adding: But then Israel has been supportive to us, especially in supplying key defence equipment. The (Indian) statement does look like a please-all one.        
	The same awareness led the Congress to attempt a balancing act. The party spewed the strongest condemnation of a disproportionate use of brute force by Israel that was most deplorable and unacceptable to the civilised world.        
	Sources said the Congress was pushed to issue this statement on a Sunday because the government had certain compulsions and could not afford to unambiguously flay Israel.        
	Certainly not after the Mumbai terror strikes, which killed several Israeli citizens, a party official said. Yet, with a general election just months away, the Congress could not ignore the Muslim sentiment either.        
	The Congress statement reaffirmed the partys solidarity with the Palestinians and their cause.

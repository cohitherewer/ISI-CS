     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 6: The Union government order mandating all citizens living in and leaving from New Delhi to carry identity proofs after January 15 has received flak from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
    
	Nitish Kumar has described the move, described as a step to unmask terrorists, an infringement on the Constitutional rights of the people to freely move out and earn their livelihood in any part of the country. 
    
	In a particularly strong-worded letter to the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, today the Bihar CM said: While the Constitution accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, people of India are free to move around the country, migrate or settle down in any part and to establish or do jobs. 
    
	The Lieutenant-Governor and the Police Commissioner of New Delhi, through an executive order, has made it mandatory for all people to carry identity cards with photo proof and a driving license (to be validated by New Delhi if issued any where else), while in New Delhi from January 15. 
    
	The insistence on photo identity cards, that too issued by the government, or by semi-government or by private institutions would hit the poor, the illiterate, the migrant and the daily wage-earners the most, the letter says. 
    
	It adds: In the name of security we can not play with the citizens liberty, their rights and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
    
	The chief minister has also raised questions on the intelligence and police failures in New Delhi. 
    
	I suspect that the failure of the police and the intelligence agencies are being covered up in the name of security and there is an attempt to turn New Delhi into a police state. 
    
	While suggesting the Prime Minister not to trample on the rights of the people, Nitish Kumar also warns: We need not look far, but to our neighbours to understand what happens when the civil and political wings get influenced by the uniformed cadre and smart salutes. 
    
	Let us not tread into such dangerous areas without assessing repercussion and fall outs. 
    
	The chief minister has also addressed New Delhis treatment of the people of Bihar through the letter. 
    
	Our national capital reflects the confluence of many cultures. No one can claim exclusive jurisdiction over New Delhi. The contribution of Bihar towards the development of Delhi cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, I noted that of late there has been growing tendency among higher-ups to ridicule Biharis. 
    
	The Motor Vehicle Act states that licences issued from any competent authority across India are valid for the whole nation. The new plan to revalidate licences in New Delhi was described as obnoxious and abhorrent and one, which would cause harassment to those who, go to the capital. 
    
	With all due respect, even electoral photo identity cards are yet to be issued. We do not wish to oppose any move if it is taken up simultaneously in all the parts of the country. But this present exercise, meant only for New Delhi, smells of discrimination.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Feb. 10: The BSF today arrested three Pakistani soldiers when they crossed the international border in Jammus RS Pora sector.         
	Border Security Force sources identified the soldiers as Amjad, Nasir and Shahid from 19 Punjab based in Sialkot.         
	They were challenged after our men spotted them in our area. We have taken them into custody, K. Srinivasan, deputy inspector-general at the BSFs Delhi headquarters, said.         
	BSF sources said the soldiers were being interrogated by the forces officers and other agencies. We do not know why they crossed over to our side. It will be clear by tomorrow morning, an officer said.         
	While the army is in charge of the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, the BSF mans the 200km international border in Jammu. The BSFs counterpart on the other side of the border is the Pakistani Rangers.         
	BSF sources said the arrest of Pakistani soldiers was rare. Todays arrest was the first since the 2004 ceasefire on the Jammu and Kashmir border, they added.         
	In the early nineties, there were reports of Pakistani army incursions into the Indian side.         
	An officer said the BSF was verifying how the Pakistani soldiers reached the border area, which is guarded by the Rangers.         
	They might be engaged in some sort of field exercise, he said.         
	About a year ago, the BSF had raised an alarm that Pakistani Rangers had set up bunkers very close to the international border in violation of agreements between the two countries.         
	The Indian home ministry later took the matter up with its counterpart in Islamabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Basanti blitz through Gabbarland
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A Basanti blitz through Gabbarland
          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          Mamtha Hegde Nichani campaigns in Ramanagaram. Bangalore News Photos                                  
	Ramanagaram, May 9: In the early 80s, the shy teenager would carry lunch every day for her father, Karnataka chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde. A quarter of a decade on, she is ready to carry his legacy.        
	Mamtha Hegde Nichani is contesting from Ramanagaram against another former chief minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, who also happens to be the son of her fathers biggest rival, H.D. Deve Gowda.        
	Mamtha, the Congresss surprise candidate, is fighting to keep the family name intact in this predominantly rural constituency with a large Muslim population, 45km from Bangalore.        
	As chief minister, Kumaraswamy had nurtured this constituency and carved out a separate Ramanagaram district from Bangalore Rural. He is campaigning on the strength of his agenda of providing water, sanitation, roads and a huge DLF city.        
	The spunky Mamtha is countering that with smart one-liners. After all, the hills ringing Ramanagaram are where Sholay was shot three decades ago.        
	A Basanti is trying to make her presence felt in a field dominated by Gabbars, says Mohammed Saifulla, an Urdu teacher, half-jokingly.        
	Mamtha, who is in her early 40s, knows she looks the part in her cotton salwar-kameez  in contrast to most women politicians in the state who prefer to be wrapped in six yards of silk  and with her gift of the gab.        
	I have no money power, no muscle power, only will power, she says.        
	Women come out and straightaway connect with her. Your father was a very nice man. Why are you standing on a Congress ticket? an old woman demands.        
	My father started his career with the Congress and so am I, she replies without hesitation.        
	But she admits that its strange to see the former Janata Party and Janata Dal stalwarts face in the company of Congress leaders on the partys banners.        
	Hegde has been a rare Indian politician in not leaving behind a ready-to-take-over dynasty. His son Bharath joined the BJP in 2004 but failed to make an impression.        
	Mamtha says: My father died in January 2004 and the polls were held in May. Although I was inclined to join the Congress, I opted out as it would have been awkward if Bharath and me both asked for votes in my fathers name for two different parties.        
	She travels in cars and auto-rickshaws and on foot and is not averse to walking into filthy neighbourhoods.        
	People dont have basic sanitation here. Im going to change all that, she says breezily as she speaks to women and pats their children.        
	Mamtha admits she has not been able to travel the length and breadth of the constituency. But I have received a lot of positive response, especially from the women. I am here for the long haul; Im not fighting just this election.        
	Asked if her knowledge of the local language and the region is a bit jaded, she shoots back: Im not here to teach anyone Kannada or make long speeches. Im here to work for the people.        
	Mamtha has been running Hegdes apolitical forum, the Rashtriya Nava Nirman Vedike, for many years. The Vedike is into charity and organises camps. Mamtha also has her own business, a travel agency in Bangalore, and is most comfortable in a pair of jeans.        
	Jeans may be new to the Indian woman politicians wardrobe, but will her genes carry the day?        
	Wait till May 25 (when the results will be announced), she smiles and dives into a crowd of voters.

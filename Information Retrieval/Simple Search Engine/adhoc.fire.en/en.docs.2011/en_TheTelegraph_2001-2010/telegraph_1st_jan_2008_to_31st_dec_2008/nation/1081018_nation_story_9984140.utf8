          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 17: Orissa High Court has sought a DNA report of the unidentified body found in Jharkhand in June last year.         
	The state police had presumed the body to be that of Rashmi Ranjan Mohapatra, the Keonjhar-based businessman kidnapped from Bhubaneswar and taken to Jharkhand for ransom 17 months ago.        
	The court issued the order while hearing a habeas corpus petition. Satyabhama Mohapatra (32), the missing businessmans wife, and her brother Dilip Kumar Behera (29) had filed the petition. The two-judge bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice B.N. Mohapatra on Thursday ordered the state to submit the DNA report after the latter claimed that samples had been sent for a DNA test, the petitioners counsel Ashok Mohapatra said today.        
	The state government has time till November 3 to submit the DNA report in the high court that could lift the veil of mystery shrouding the fate of Rashmi Ranjan. The Keonjhar-based businessman was kidnapped from Jaganath Vihar in Bhubaneswar on the intervening night of May 26 and 27, 2007. His family had allegedly paid ransom to the abductors for his release, but Rashmi Ranjan did not return. Later, Behera lodged an FIR at the Sahidnagar police station in Bhubaneswar.         
	On June 4, 2007, two bodies were found near Ranchi, which police claimed to be that of the businessman and his driver. While the drivers body was identified by his family members, Rashmi Ranjans relatives said the other body was not his. Ransom calls kept coming to Rashmi Ranjans home even after the bodies were found, but no calls were received after June 5, 2007. The petitioners have also sought a CBI probe into the case alleging slipshod manner of investigation by the state police.

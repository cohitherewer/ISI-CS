          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: Uncertainty looms large over Orissa, as despite daylong talks the state government and doctors failed to reach an understanding over the latters cease work threat.         
	Over 2,800 government doctors had submitted their mass resignation recently to protest against the dismissal of three colleagues, who had allegedly cut of the palms of five victims of Kalinga Nagar firing, while conducting an autopsy. The doctors threatened to cease work from tomorrow if the dismissal of the three doctors were not withdrawn.        
	Director of health services Sukadev Sethi was busy all day talking to doctors, health minister and department officials to resolve the deadlock, fearing a total disruption of health services in the state.         
	Sources said a meeting was scheduled to be held between the chief minister and office-bearers of Orissa Medical Service Association (Omsa) this evening that was postponed due to a prior engagement of the chief minister.         
	Last evening, the government had invoked the Essential Service Maintenance Act, prohibiting any strike in health sector for the next six months, after talks between the doctors and health minister Sanatan Bisi failed. However, Bisi had assured that Omsa office-bearers were not keen on the cease work decision.

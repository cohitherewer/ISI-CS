          NISITH DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The Centre has finalised a financial scheme to help victims of terrorism and communal violence.        
	The scheme will benefit the wounded and relatives of those killed in the serial blasts in Rajasthan and recurring attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, both states scheduled to go to polls later this year.        
	Financial security to family members of those killed and health cards to those incapacitated are part of the scheme. The scheme will be implemented with effect from April 1, this year, which will enable relatives of the victims of the Jaipur blasts in May to make use of the scheme.         
	The scheme does not cover victims of Naxalite violence and children of militants killed in encounters with security forces, sources said.         
	Under the scheme, Rs 3 lakh will be given to family members in the event of death or permanent incapacitation of the breadwinner of a family.         
	The principal amount will be put in a fixed deposit account, joint or single, in the name of the family members in a nationalised bank with a minimum lock-in period of three years. If the family has only minor children, the lock-in will be till the eldest child becomes a major.         
	The families will be eligible for the scheme even if they have received other forms of assistance such as ex-gratia.        
	 The health cards for the incapacitated will entitle them to free medical treatment.        
	A committee, chaired by the district magistrate or the collector, will identify and verify the beneficiaries within a month of receipt of claim for assistance.

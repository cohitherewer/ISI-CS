          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 19: A tiger carcass was found in Dudhwa National Park this morning, fuelling fears that poachers are still on the prowl in the reserve along the border with Nepal.        
	Park officials said the carcass was at least 15 days old with most parts, that are sold separately at high prices, missing. They suspect poachers might have poisoned the two-year-old tiger, about six feet long, and removed its organs.        
	The body was rotting. Perhaps its smell alerted farmers who drew our attention. We have sent the carcass for post-mortem, said north Lakhimpur-Kheri range divisional forest officer K.K. Singh after a visit to the spot today.        
	The body was found near a small canal within the 1,093sqkm park. Wildlife experts said it was unlikely the tiger died from a fall as it had crossed over to the other side.        
	Forest officer Singh wouldnt say, however, that poachers were behind the tigers death. We are yet to know specifically if it was poisoned. Its teeth and testicles (which are often removed by poachers) are intact. Part of its skin was missing but that may be from decomposition. Nothing is ruled out. We have decided to test the waters in the canal where the carcass was found.         
	Bhupendra Singh, a wildlife expert and researcher in Lakhimpur-Kheri district, where the park is located, suspected poachers. We have seen similar deaths before. The carcass is usually abandoned in some remote corner of the park after removing its body parts.         
	Poachers on the prowl in the region smuggle tiger skin and organs to Nepal, from where they are sent to China, a key market, Bhupendra said. He added that at least six tigers had been killed in the park since 2004.        
	A police officer in Lakhimpur-Kheri echoed the expert. Tiger bones have been in great demand in China and the poachers smuggle tiger parts to China via Nepal.        
	On January 12 this year, the carcass of a boneless tiger was found but park officials had struggled to determine exactly how the animal died because the discovery was made eight days after its death.         
	Lakhimpur-Kheri shares a porous border of over 56km with Nepal that poachers use to cross over easily, police said. But some wildlife experts point a finger at forest officers, saying they pass off suspected poaching cases as natural deaths to escape responsibility.        
	The park, which had 175 tigers till March this year and is known for its grasslands, marshes and lakes, has also suffered because of human encroachment in recent years.               
	This March, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to relocate 1,500 villagers in the park to save the tiger.

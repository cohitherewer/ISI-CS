	Mums the word on driving licence     
	The hand that rocks the cradle can now rule the road.     
	The Delhi government has decided to allow people to put their mothers name on their driving licence.     
	All motor licensing officers are directed to accept forms where the name of the mother is mentioned by the applicant, says the transport department order, the first of its kind in the country.     
	The directive has come nine years after a Supreme Court ruling that both the mother and father be treated as the natural guardians of a child. The apex court had said that a person could use his or her mothers name instead of the fathers on documents.    
	But despite the ruling, the mother continued to be missing from driving licences and other documents like pan card and ration card.    
	In our patriarchal society, the mother is not given due recognition. We should shun such practices immediately said Vijay Singhvi, who had petitioned the transport department seeking an amendment to the rules.

	Power thieves robbed    
	Three of the capitals residents who tampered with their power meters to steal electricity were in turn robbed of Rs 90,000 by two cons.    
	In January, a team from the power distribution company BSES found that the power meters of Mahesh Mishra, Vikram and Ramesh had been tampered with.     
	The next day, two persons  who identified themselves as Vinod Kumar and Sanjay Anand  came. The duo said they were BSES officials and that cases had been filed against the three.     
	Seeing them scared, they offered to settle the matter if each paid Rs 30,000.     
	The trio parted with the cash only to discover that the duo were masquerading as BSES officials.

	Beer in full flow    
	If you see Hyderabad swarming with beer-bellied men and women, blame the government.    
	The YSR regime is letting the liquor flow to fill up its coffers.     
	It proposes to raise Rs 10,000 crore from liquor sales this year. Till December 2007, Rs 6,100 crore had been collected.     
	The prohibition and excise department has given licences to over 1,200 bars and clubs and also auctioned out 3,200 new liquor outlets to 7,500 bars and 13,000 off shops across the state.     
	The government is planning to produce more beer to meet the ballooning demand during summer.     
	Last year, the government had earned an excise of Rs 127 crore from the sale of beer alone, and this year it is looking to more than double it to Rs 300 crore.         
	Aam sermon    
	MPs are known to be keen on beacon lights for their cars to flash their power. But one of them begs to differ.    
	Former defence minister George Fernandes has argued against a Rajya Sabha committee recommendation that MPs be allowed to use red beacons.    
	n a letter to the committees chairman last month, Fernandes said: During their campaigns, the candidates (say) that after becoming MPs, they will look after the problems of those who do not have a voice  the aam aadmi.    
	Once in Parliament, not only is the aam aadmi forgotten, but they look for every opportunity that will enable them to live a comfortable life.    
	Now it is to be seen if the letter will signal the red light for the beacons the MPs are eyeing.

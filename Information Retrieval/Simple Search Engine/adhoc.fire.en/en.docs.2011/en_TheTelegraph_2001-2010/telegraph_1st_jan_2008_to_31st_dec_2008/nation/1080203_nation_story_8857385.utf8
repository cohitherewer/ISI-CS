	Karnal (Haryana), Feb. 2 (PTI): A tyre stuffed with explosives blew up as Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singhs motorcade was passing through a highway. Singh escaped unhurt.
    
	Sitting in a truck parked on the road, unidentified persons threw the tyre at a car in the convoy of the Dera head, who is at loggerheads with the Sikh clergy.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 25: Work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is going to be stopped in 10 districts of Orissa, due to a delay in the release of Centre funds.
    
	Panchayati raj minister Raghunath Mohanty conceded that the state has been repeatedly writing to the Centre urging for an early release of funds. But, the Centre is yet to respond, as a result of which the works under NREGS is going to be stopped in 10 districts. 
    
	Mohanty expressed his surprise today over the fact that Orissa had to suffer from fund delay despite the fact that the state was one of few leading states in terms of funds utilisation. 
    
	According to NREGS norm, districts that have spent more than 60 per cent of allocated funds are entitled for the next round of funds. 
    
	Strangely, even though the above 10 districts qualify, they are yet to receive the next rounds of funds. 
    
	Currently, NREGS is being implemented in 24 districts. Initially, the central-sponsored scheme was launched in 19 district, which was subsequently extended to another five. The state was also adjudged as one of the best in terms of expenditure. 
    
	However, a New Delhi-based NGO, Centre for Environment and Food Security, had alleged misappropriation of NREGS funds to the Rs 500 crore in six backward districts of Orissa, following which the Centre had ordered a probe by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
    
	The survey report, covering 100 villages in six districts of Orissas KBK region, had alleged that wage employment was not being provided to job seekers and payment was not being made to labourers even after the project was over.
    
	Meanwhile, the government has entrusted a Hyderabad-based National Institute of Rural Development to conduct a survey to verify the veracity of allegation and study the impact of implementation of the scheme.
    
	Today, while reviewing the progress of the scheme, chief minister Naveen Patnaik stressed on transparency in execution.

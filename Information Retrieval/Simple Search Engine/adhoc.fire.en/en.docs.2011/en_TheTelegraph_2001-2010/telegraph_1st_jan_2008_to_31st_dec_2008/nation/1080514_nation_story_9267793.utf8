          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                      
	Mumbai, May 13: Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi has asked the players of the Rajasthan Royals team to stay put where they are till further instructions following the blasts in Jaipur today.         
	Captain Shane Warne and six teammates  Shane Watson, Graeme Smith, Swapnil Ansodkar, Taruvar Kohle, N. Patel and Ravindra Jadeja  are currently holidaying in Goa.         
	The cricketers landed at Dabolim airport yesterday and checked into Fort Aguada Beach Resort, built on the ramparts of a 16th-century Portuguese fortress in north Goa.         
	The players had initially planned to stay in Goa for four days before flying back to Jaipur on Friday.         
	The team is scheduled to play the Bangalore Royal Challengers in Jaipur on Saturday.        
	We are keenly watching the situation and are in touch with police. We have not come to any decision about Saturdays match yet. We will meet and take a call on this as things develop a bit more. It all depends on how much time it takes for normality to return to Jaipur, Modi said.        
	Officials of Emerging Media, the owner of Rajasthan Royals, went into a huddle with Modi and other IPL officials soon after reports of the blasts came in.         
	With Australia cancelling its Pakistan tour in March after blasts in Lahore, all eyes are on the Aussie players in the IPL.         
	One of the cricketers playing for Rajasthan Royals said the players had been instructed not to talk to the media by their franchise owner.         
	We were at the poolside bar when someone told us about the blasts. We went to check out the news on the telly. It has obviously shaken us. We spoke to Fraser (Castellino, the CEO of the Rajasthan Royals team), Greg Chappell and Lalit. They asked us to stay put here, the player said.        
	They are discussing the matter with others tomorrow before taking a decision. It is not just about us, security issues concern all players.

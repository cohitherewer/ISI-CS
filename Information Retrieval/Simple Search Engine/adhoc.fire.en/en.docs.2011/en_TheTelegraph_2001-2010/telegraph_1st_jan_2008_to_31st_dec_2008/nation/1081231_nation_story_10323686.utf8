          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           National Conference president Omar Abdullahs wife Payal in Srinagar on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, Dec. 30: Gupkar Road, one of Srinagars finest addresses, is witnessing a role reversal between two political families that live 200 metres apart.         
	The bungalow at 7 Gupkar, the Abdullah family home, is humming like it hasnt in six years.         
	Till 2002, Gupkar Road was closed to traffic because the Abdullahs lived there. For security reasons, only residents had use of the road that runs along Dal Lake in the heart of Srinagar.        
	But one of Mufti Mohammed Sayeeds first acts as chief minister was to throw it open to everyone  a message that the Abdullah era had ended.         
	Three years later, Mufti himself moved there, 200 metres from Farooq Abdullahs house. Fair View, a notorious interrogation centre, was converted into a palatial bungalow for the Peoples Democratic Party leader.         
	Today, just a handful of gloomy party supporters had turned up at the house where Muftis daughter and PDP president Mehbooba tried to put up a brave face.         
	I wish him (Omar Abdullah) good luck. People have suffered a lot and I hope he will apply some balm on their wounds, she said, after news came that the Congress had agreed to support the junior Abdullah as chief minister.

	Omar lives at 1 Gupkar, not far from his fathers house. A convoy of cars had lined up outside the bungalow today with supporters from all over the Valley coming down to wish the would-be chief minister luck.         
	Jubilant supporters burst crackers inside the compound. Omars wife Payal and their sons Zahir and Zamir, students of Sanskriti School in Delhi, watched from a distance. It is time for us to celebrate, said Muneer Ahmad Khan, who had come all the way from Ganderbal, Omars constituency, to celebrate.         
	Farooq was euphoric that the Congress had agreed to an alliance with his National Conference. I am happy two secular parties have come together. I will be the party president now and try to rejuvenate the party in the areas where we are weak. I wish Omar good luck and hope he will perform well to provide succour to the people, the father said.         
	Mehbooba, whose party had walked out of a coalition with the Congress some months ago, sounded disappointed. We being part of the UPA, the Congress should have consulted us just for courtesys sake. Courtesy cannot be forced. I am happy that Jammu and Kashmir has finally got a democratically elected government, she said.        
	Till minutes before Omar declared in Delhi that he would be the chief minister, the PDP was still expecting the Congress to go with them. Mufti said he expected the Congress to consult him.         
	The Congress and the National Conference somewhere hit a common ground and joined hands. We have a political agenda that believes in self-rule, dual currency and demilitarisation. Maybe this did not gel with the Congress, which has a national outlook, said Mehbooba, whose party has been accused of soft separatism.        
	On the road outside, National Conference supporters were rejoicing. It was painful for us to see Mufti passing this road with a huge caravan, said one of Omars aides. Our time has come again.

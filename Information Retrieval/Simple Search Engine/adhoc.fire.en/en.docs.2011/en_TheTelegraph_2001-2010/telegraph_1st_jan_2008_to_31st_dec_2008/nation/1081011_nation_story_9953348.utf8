          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, Oct. 10: Three persons died in communal clashes triggered by an alleged attack on a Dussehra procession last evening in the Madhya Pradesh town of Burhanpur.        
	Late tonight, shoot-at-sight orders were issued to check the violence, state police chief S.K. Raut said, adding the violence had continued in spite of a curfew. The police action came after members of both communities torched houses and shops and fought pitched battles in the town, on the border with Maharashtra. Madhya Pradesh elections are expected in two months.        
	The trouble began when a procession was allegedly pelted with stones last evening. Prohibitory orders helped bring the situation under control a few hours later. This afternoon, the violence flared up as houses of a particular community were torched after shops belonging to another were damaged.         
	Andhra clashes        
	Three persons were killed and 25 others, including eight policemen, injured in communal clashes during an immersion procession for a Durga idol at Bhainsa in Andhras Adilabad, according to PTI. The trouble began when gulal (colour) fell on a place of worship of another community during the procession.

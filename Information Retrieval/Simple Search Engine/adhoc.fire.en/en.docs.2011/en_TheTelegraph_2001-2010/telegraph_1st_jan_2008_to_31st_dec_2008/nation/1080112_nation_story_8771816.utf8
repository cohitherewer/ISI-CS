     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today visited Brahmanigaon, where the recent communal clashes started on Christmas eve last year.
    
	Though the chief minister had earlier visited the strife-torn Khandhamal twice in the past fortnight, Brahmanigaon was overlooked. 
    
	His first visit to the clash sites was restricted to a brief 20-minutes review at a district headquarters, while the second was accompanying Union minister Shivraj Patil to Barakhama. Patil had drawn flak from parties for visiting only one village and skipping Brahmanigaon. Naveen had washed his hands off the matter stating that the Union home ministry had arranged the visit.
    
	Sources said Naveens visit today was to appease the Hindus, who had felt slighted by the Congress-led UPA. A proposed visit of a team comprising members of the Opposition parties tomorrow might have prompted Naveen to visit as a pre-emptive measure. 
    
	On return to the capital in the afternoon today, the chief minister told reporters that the ongoing relief activities were satisfactory. He appealed to all parties to ensure peace and communal harmony and not to make any inflammatory speeches during their visit. Earlier, a fact-finding Opposition team, led by OPCC president Jaydev Jena, and another Congress team led by former chief minister Hemananda Biswal, were prevented by the administration from entering the troubled district on the plea that their visit would affect peace. Chief secretary, Ajit Tripathy today told reporters that the restriction was lifted today as districts had reported no untoward incidents since December 27. 
    
	So far, 90 peace committees had been formed which have held 105 meetings to facilitate communal harmony. As many as 145 persons allegedly involved in the violence have been arrested and 119 criminal cases instituted.

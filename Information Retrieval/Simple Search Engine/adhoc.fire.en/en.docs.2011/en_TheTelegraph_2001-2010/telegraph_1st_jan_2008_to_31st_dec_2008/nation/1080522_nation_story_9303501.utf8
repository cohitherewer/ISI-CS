	New Delhi, May 21: The Election Commission has recommended that an office of profit case against Amar Singh be dropped, sources said.         
	The good news for Amar came a day before the United Progressive Alliance completes four years in office. The Samajwadi Party general secretary has been invited to a party on this occasion at the Prime Ministers residence after having been left out in the cold for some time.The poll panels recommendation, sent to the law ministry, will be forwarded to the President.         
	Earlier, the panel had sent Amar a notice on an Uttar Pradesh lawyers petition seeking his disqualification as Rajya Sabha MP on the ground that he was chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council  an office of profit.        
	Amar has been cosying up to the leadership of the rul- ing Congress in an attempt to bring the two parties closer after prolonged animosity. Threatened by Mayavati, the Samajwadis and the Congress are trying to come together in Uttar Pradesh.         
	The Congress is also eyeing the Samajwadi Party as a potential ally at the Centre as it faces stiff opposition from the Left parties on the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	As the Samajwadis inch closer to the Congress, Mayavatis BSP, which offers outside support to the UPA, is moving away. Mayavati has told her MPs to boycott the celebrations tomorrow as the Centre has not granted her state a Rs 80,000-crore package.         
	BSP national treasurer and Rajya Sabha MP Ambeth Rajan today confirmed his party would miss the annual event that they have attended since the UPA came to power.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Artist Krishen Khanna holds the book on Husains work. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Indias national academy of art has nominated artist Maqbool Fida Husain to its executive board, its chairman announced today, at a time the government faces allegations of remaining silent on the harassment of the controversial legend.        
	Husain, exiled in Qatar, has accepted the nomination, Ashok Vajpayei, chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi, said at the release of a book marketed as the first overview of the artists work in 40 years.         
	Written by K. Bikram Singh, the book journeys Husains life from his birth in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, through his education in Indore and his association with the Progressive Artists Group, popularly considered pioneers of Indias post-Independence art. The book is named after the painter.         
	At the release, Singh repeatedly referred to the controversies that have plagued Husain since the mid-1990s, and have now forced the artist into exile.         
	I must reveal that I had a difficult time writing the book as several private collectors of Husains works refused to share them despite a letter from Husain authorising me to view them, Singh said.         
	Under current law, artists hold the copyright to their work even if a collector has purchased that work.         
	The book contains insights into the maestros style of work. Usually, Husain is an artist who works in a hurry relying on his instinct and skill without carefully making preparatory drawings for a painting, the book says in a chapter titled Search for a Personal Expression.         
	A separate chapter  My Subject is Woman  details Husains fascination with the feminine art form.         
	In I am a Believer, the book talks of Husains contribution to presenting the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, and Hanuman on canvas. Husain has peen pilloried by Hindu right-wing groups for allegedly denigrating Hindu gods and goddesses in his paintings.         
	Husains friend and contemporary, artist Krishen Khanna, recalled their association since 1950, when Khanna joined the Mumbai-based Progressive Artists Group.         
	In those days, the group would discuss every new painting that came out. Prices were never discussed, he reminisced.

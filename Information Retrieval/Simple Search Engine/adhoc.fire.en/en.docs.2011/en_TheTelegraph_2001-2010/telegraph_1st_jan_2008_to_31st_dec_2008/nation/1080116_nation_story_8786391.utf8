	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: Actress Anu Chaudhry and her businessman husband Sandeep Mishra have jointly filed for divorce mdash; 22 months after their arranged marriage.
 
	The reason, as their petition states, is due to a difference of opinion and temperament making marriage difficult. The divorce petition has been reportedly signed by both mdash; in the court of district session judge of Khurda. The matter will be up for hearing sometime next year.
 
	The marriage, which was solemnised on March 12, 2006, apparently ran into trouble within a few months and since then the duo have been living separately. Advocate Prashant Routray, counsel to both Anu and Sandeep, said there were no problems between the two. But differences were making it impossible for them to live together.

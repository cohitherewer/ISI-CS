                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Smart light plan under spotlight     
	Get ready to see Mumbai in new light.    
	Roads in a stretch of the city will soon bask in the glow of the power-saving smart lights that can adjust their brightness.    
	Such illumination systems are in place in Bangalore, where they have yielded good results and big savings for the civic body.    
	The technology ensures the bulbs are dimmed between midnight and dawn, when traffic shrinks to a speck, to save power.    
	The system runs automatically and the lights are fitted with voltage-control devices.    
	By the end of this year, over 5,000 streetlights in a 10sqkm area, which will cover stretches near Haji Ali, Worli and Prabhadevi in central Mumbai, will be fitted with the system as part of a pilot project.     
	If the initial plan, expected to cost Rs 2 crore, is successful, the new lights will be installed in all areas.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai forks out Rs 90 crore as the power bill for streetlights every year, an amount it hopes to cut down sharply.        
	Larder plunder at AIIMS    
	Patients at AIIMS, the countrys pre-eminent hospital, wouldnt have much appetite but some insiders are more than making up for the loss in their diet.    
	Eight employees in its main kitchen were suspended after some of them were shown on a channel hiding food items and later taking them home.    
	Milk packets, bread and processed food were stashed away and carried home at the end of the days work. Six of those against whom action was taken are staffers, the other two members of private agencies working on contract. A committee has been set up to carry out an investigation.    
	The revelations have come as another smudge on the image of the institute, which had long been caught up in a never-ending face-off between director P. Venugopal and Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss.    
	Down to earth on plot prices    
	A harsh ground reality has begun to hit Hyderabads land prices.    
	At the heart of the slide are government-organised auctions where bids for land had gone through the roof. The auctions, part of the Y.S.R. Reddy regimes money-spinning initiatives to pay for the massive irrigation and housing schemes for the poor, are now being blamed for the spurt in prices.    
	Large real estate companies, many of them from outside Andhra, that had once scooped up large chunks of government land are now fighting shy of such auctions. This, local businessmen complain, is choking investment in fresh projects.    
	Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, Andhra Pradesh Housing Board and AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation have sold plots at rates as high as Rs 15 crore per acre since 2004. Now, they arent finding takers even for some of the prime land.    
	But some optimists believe the lean phase will blow over. Land is a constant. Prices will bounce back soon, said a revenue department official.        
	Cave-in alert    
	A survey of houses in the capital will be kicked off soon to prevent cave-ins ahead of monsoon. The exercise will focus on the dangerous buildings that should be demolished as well as those in need of repairs.    
	A committee of civic body BMC took the decision last week to start the drill in its 12 zones. Around 54 houses were declared dangerous till June 2007, five of which were demolished. Later, 12 were found to be on shaky ground, while 195 had to be repaired.     
	MUMBAI: This Friday evening (June 13), you can try and unwind with Mohan Pyare, a Marathi play directed by Priyadarshan Jadhav. The venue is Vishnudas Bhave Hall in Navi Mumbais Vashi. It is opposite the bus depot. Time: 8.30pm. Call 27669100 and 27662320 for details.

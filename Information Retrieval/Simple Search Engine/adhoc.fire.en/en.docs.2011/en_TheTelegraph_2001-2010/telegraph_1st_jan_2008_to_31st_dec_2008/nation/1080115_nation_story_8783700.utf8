	Chennai, Jan. 14: Jayalalithaa today treated Narendra Modi to a lunch of 45 dishes at her home, but there was no official hint of a possible BJP-ADMK alliance beyond glowing smiles from the leaders.
    
	Modi and the BJPs Tamil Nadu minder, Ravi Shankar Prasad, emerged from the two-hour meeting with shining faces. Prasad stopped for a couple of minutes to speak to the media but the Gujarat chief minister walked straight to their bullet-proof white Ambassador.
    
	It was a good, friendly lunch, Prasad said. She was a very generous host.
    
	Asked if this was the first step towards another tie-up with a now-on-now-off ally, he avoided answering but acknowledged that politics was discussed. We discussed a whole range of contemporary issues, he said.
    
	Jayalalithaa had received her guests at the main door of her home in a deep pink sari. Modi handed her a bouquet and the leaders exchanged gifts. The former Tamil Nadu chief minister gave Modi a golden silk shawl and he handed her a small bag of prasad from Keralas Guruvayur temple, to whom Jayalalithaa had donated an elephant years ago.
    
	After they had all posed for pictures, Modi wished the photographers a happy Pongal with a wave of the hand and was led inside.
    
	The lunch, initially scheduled for an hour, was extended by another hour. Prasad didnt say whether the large menu or politics was responsible but confirmed that 45 dishes were served. It was an extraordinary lunch, he said.
    
	The food, ordered from Taj, included sakkara Pongal (sweet rice), aappam from Chettinad and poli (a circular sweet the size of a small uthappam), sources said. Fruits were served for dessert.
    
	Jayalalithaa had cut off her ties with the BJP after the NDAs defeat in the 2004 general election, which saw her party routed in Tamil Nadu.
    
	The ADMK and the BJP have recently been speaking on the same lines on issues like terrorism and the Ram setu. Jayalalithaa had written to Modi to congratulate him immediately after the Gujarat poll results were declared.
    
	Prasad, however, has been insisting that the matter of an alliance is for the central leadership to decide.
    
	Gujarat secret
    
	Modi today gave much of the credit for his win in the Gujarat polls to women voters, Tamil Nadu BJP chief Ela Ganesan said. 
    
	The chief minister told party colleagues in Chennai that the BJP had organised 27 mahila sammelans (womens gatherings), in the run-up to the polls. This raised the womens turnout by three per cent.

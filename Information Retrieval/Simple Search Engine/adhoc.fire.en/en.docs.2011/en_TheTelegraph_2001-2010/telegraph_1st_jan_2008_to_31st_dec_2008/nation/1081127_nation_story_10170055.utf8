                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     EC oil-price notice to Deora
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Panel whip                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: The poll panel today issued a notice to Murli Deora for saying petrol and diesel prices would be cut after the current round of Assembly elections ends on December 24.        
	The notice followed a complaint from the BJP to chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami that the petroleum ministers comments yesterday amounted to violation of the model code of conduct.        
	Deora, on his part, accused the BJP of adopting an anti-people stand at a time international crude prices had fallen from a peak of $145 a barrel to below $50. This shows that the BJP has lost the poll. All along they have been demanding a price cut, and now they accuse us of violation of election code when we have only said that we would review the prices.        
	Deora said a revision in fuel prices was under consideration and a decision would be taken in the due course.        
	Revision does not necessarily mean a cut in prices, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey clarified. We will have to wait on which products a reduction will be effected, by how much and when.        
	Pandey said on kerosene and LPG, state-run oil companies were still facing under-recoveries  the notional difference between the market-determined price oil companies would have liked to sell at and the subsidised rate at which they are selling.        
	It is true that margins on petrol and diesel have turned positive but there are still huge under-recoveries on kerosene and LPG, he told a conference.        
	He said while public sector oil companies like IOC, BPCL and HPCL were making profits of Rs 8.17 and 65 paise on every litre of petrol and diesel, respectively, they were losing Rs 21.54 per litre on kerosene and Rs 330.28 on every domestic LPG cylinder.        
	The three companies posted a net loss of Rs 14,431 crore in the first half of the current fiscal.        
	The petroleum secretary said the ministry would approach the cabinet next month for an appropriate decision on reviewing petrol and diesel prices.        
	Pandeys comment came weeks after the Prime Minister ruled out reviewing auto fuel prices till losses on domestic LPG cylinders and kerosene were wiped out.        
	Asked about Singhs observation, Deora said he had nothing to say. Situations keep changing every day.

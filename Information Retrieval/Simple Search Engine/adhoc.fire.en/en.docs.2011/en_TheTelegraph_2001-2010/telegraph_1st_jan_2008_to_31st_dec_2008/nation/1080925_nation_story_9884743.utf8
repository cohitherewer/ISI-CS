          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          A student of Jalandhars DAV College gifts Rahul Gandhi a rose on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Rahul Gandhis call for a strong terror law has effectively silenced the Congresss nay-sayers who argued that this would alienate minorities and be suicidal in an election year.        
	When Pota (Prevention of Terrorism Act) was in operation, our Parliament got attacked. We almost lost members of our Parliament. We almost lost our PM, our home minister. When Pota was in operation, we had Kandahar (hijack), Rahul told a news conference in Jalandhar.         
	In Kandahar, the (BJP) government gave in to the demands of terrorism. Those gentlemen who were responsible for the terrorist act carried out further terrorist acts. With regard to whether there should be a strong terror law, there should be one, but Pota is a failed law, the Amethi MP said.         
	Congress leaders saw Rahuls statement as an answer to the BJPs campaign about the ruling party being soft on terror. It also hit the BJP where it hurts most, sources said, pointing out that the very mention of Kandahar sent L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh scurrying for cover.        
	Just as Rahuls whole-hearted support for the Indo-US nuclear deal had rallied the Congress around what was viewed as Manmohan Singhs agenda, his call for a tough terror law is expected to push home minister Shivraj Patil and law minister Hansraj Bhardwaj to come up with a legislation before Parliament sits on October 17.        
	Senior ministers such as Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had earlier argued that the existing law  the Prevention of Unlawful Activities Act  was adequate to handle terrorism. His view was endorsed by some cabinet colleagues.        
	Today, they agreed that it was time for the government and the political establishment to send a tough message that India was one in fighting terror, otherwise not only will there be more attacks, the country might disintegrate.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had on Tuesday said he had asked a group of officials to study the report of the Administrative Reforms Commission, headed by M, Veerappa Moily, which proposed a new law.        
	Moily has recommended stringent bail provisions, allowing a longer detention period and making confessions before police admissible in a court of law. For a safeguard, he suggested setting up a committee to review custodial detentions within 30 days of the arrests.

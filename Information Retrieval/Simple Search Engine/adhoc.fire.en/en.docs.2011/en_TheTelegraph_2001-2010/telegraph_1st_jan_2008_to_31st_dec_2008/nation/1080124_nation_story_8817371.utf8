             Orissa High Court
                 
	Cuttack, Jan. 23: With Orissa High Court revoking its verdict on the legality of the prevailing state entry tax, the future of the levy hangs in balance eight years after it was started.
    
	The Orissa Entry Tax Act-1999, was promulgated in the state on September 20, 1999, as a substitute for Octroi Tax. The state governments current annual entry tax collection is over Rs 450 crore. 
    
	But a legal question regarding the constitutional validity of the levy has remained unresolved and has been shuttling between the high court and the Supreme Court.
    
	The Supreme Court had remitted seven special leave petitions to Orissa High Court in 2006 with a specific direction to deal afresh with the basic issue, as to whether the levy was compensatory or not.
    
	With the high court giving its ruling on the basic issue, decks have been cleared for the Supreme Court to give the final verdict on the constitutional validity, said Bibek Mohanti, counsel for Indian Rare Earths Limited and Tata Sponge Iron Limited while talking to The Telegraph today. The validity of the act was initially challenged in the high court by National Aluminum Company Ltd, Indian, Indian Rare Earths Limited, Tata Sponge Iron Limited and Paradeep Phosphate Ltd  among others. 
    
	In its 2002 verdict on the petitions, the high court had ruled that the government had competence to enforce the act, as the levy is compensatory in nature. The judgment however, had clarified that unless the entry of scheduled goods for the purpose of consumption, use or sale into local area of the state are satisfied, the provisions of the Orissa Entry Tax Act, 1999 shall not be attracted. 
    
	The verdict had then further clarified  The goods which enter into local areas for the purpose of transit will not be subject to entry tax.
    
	The petitioners on their part filed Special Leave Petitions against the judgment in the Supreme Court.
    
	A two judge bench of Justices I.M. Quddusi and A.K. Samantaray recently observed that the provision for the realisation of the tax is not compensatory in nature as the state has failed to show that the Orissa Entry Tax is reimbursement and recompense for the quantifiable and measurable benefits provided to the trades people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 6-day stamp strike hits legal affairs
                                                                                                               6-day stamp strike hits legal affairs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 8: The strike by stamp vendors in Orissa entered the sixth day today.         
	They are demanding increase in the stamp vendors limit to sell non-judicial stamp papers for execution of sale deeds or mortgage deed.        
	At present, stamp vendors are allowed to buy stamp papers up to Rs 50,000. We have been requesting the state government to allow us to purchase non-judicial stamp papers up to Rs 2 lakh, said Nimai Charan Singh, the spokesperson for the Orissa Stamp Vendors Union.        
	The union had joined the strike in response to a statewide call given by the Orissa Stamp Vendors Federation.         
	There are nearly 6,000 stamp vendors across Orissa. Of them, 50-odd vendors are based in Cuttack, and about 100 in Bhubaneswar. Stamp vendors in these two cities account for a combined purchase of over Rs 40 lakh per day.         
	The strike had virtually paralysed execution of sale deeds and other transactions across the state. We had no option but to go for the strike over the demand for increase in the purchase limit for stamp vendors as the government had not directed the treasury offices after giving assurances to raise it to Rs 2 lakh, over a year ago, Singh said.        
	Finance minister Prafulla Ghadei and revenue minister Manmohan Samal had called representatives of the federation today for a discussion.

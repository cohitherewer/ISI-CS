	Chagala, a close aide of Raja, had named Patnaik as a conspirator in the murder. Patnaik, who was a part of a trust set up for the wunderkid, Budhia Singh, also admitted that he had met the slain coach the day before the murder.         
	Patnaik admitted that he had met Raja Acharya on one or two occasions at the Bhubaneswar Club.         
	He also conceded that he had intervened in the Leslie Tripathy issue.        
	The IAS official, who has denied all other allegations, drove down to the police commisionerate in the afternoon today and recorded his statement before police commissioner B.K. Behera and additional commissioner Y.B. Khurania.         
	The latter is heading a special investigative team probing into the murder.        
	Sources in the commissioners office said the bureaucrat was interrogated for more than two hours. Though they did not divulge details, official sources said Patnaik was quizzed on the statements made by Chagala, who had claimed that the bureaucrat had paid Rs 2 lakh to Raja Acharya to kill the coach.        
	Earlier, Acharya, in a video, had said that Patnaik and a few others, including album actress Leslie Tripathy, were threatening him.         
	Incidentally, Patnaik happens to be the president of the Judo Association, founded by coach Biranchi Das.         
	A special team, meanwhile, left for Kendrapada and conducted raids to nab the prime suspect, Raja, who has been evading arrest since the murder of Biranchi.         
	Residences and hideouts of dreaded gangsters like Hyder, Tito and Suleman were raided. Police forces were deployed in front of the residence of senior BJP leader and former minister, Ved Prakash Agrawal.         
	Policemen in civilian clothes also kept vigil in possible hideouts.         
	All roads leading to Kendrapada were sealed and vehicles were checked, but the police failed to make any breakthrough.         
	Meanwhile, accused Akshay Behera alias Chagala and Tukuna were forwarded to the SDJM court today after their five-day transit remand was over. The duo were sent to Jharpada special jail. Chagala will reportedly face the narco-analysis test tomorrow.         
	Chagala was yesterday taken to the Judo Association Hall, the murder site, for spot identification tests.

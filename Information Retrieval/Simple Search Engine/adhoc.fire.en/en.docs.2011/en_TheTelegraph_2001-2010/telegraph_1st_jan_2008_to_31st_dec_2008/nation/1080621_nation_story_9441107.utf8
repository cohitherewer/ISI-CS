          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 20: The Left threat to Manmohan Singh government kept Union minister Sharad Pawar in New Delhi, but his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) launched its poll campaign in Bihar today.         
	Pawar saheb had to stay back in New Delhi because of a personal request from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after a Left threat on the nuclear deal issue, said the NCP general secretary and Bihar in-charge, Chhagan Bhujbal, at the party workers meet.         
	Though there have been no official announcement about the Lok Sabha polls, the NCP virtually blew the poll whistle by announcing: The party will contest on all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar if it fails to strike an alliance.         
	Pawar has asked workers to get into the poll mode.         
	The NCP made it a point to disassociate itself from Raj Thackeray and Bal Thackeray after it started campaigns against the people of Bihar and in the Hindi heartland.         
	Maharastra sabhi deshwasiyon ke liye hai (Maharastra is for all the Indian nationals), said the NCP leader.        
	The Maharastra government has refused to take Thackerays anti-Bihar rhetoric, even the people of Maharastra have rejected Raj Thackerays campaign.         
	The NCP MP from Bihar, Tariq Anwar, said: The migrants from Bihar have now begun to return to factories and business establishments in Maharastra which had suffered due to the absence of workers from the Hindi heartland.

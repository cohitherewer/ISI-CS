                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Candidates held hostage, by cops
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, May 26: Eight Independent candidates for the May 29 bypolls were held hostage for over 12 hours by police who feared they might protest before the chief minister as he toured their constituency.        
	Policemen shoved the five men and three women into a jeep on Saturday and drove it from village to village, away from Y.S.R. Reddys route, till one of the women collapsed from the heat. The policemen then dropped the eight hostages at a hospital and fled.        
	The eight are among 12 farmers contesting the Jedcherla Assembly seat to highlight government injustice.         
	Some 25 farmers have committed suicide in and around Jedcherla, about 100km southwest of Hyderabad, after being allegedly forced to sell their land at low prices for a special economic zone (SEZ).        
	The government says it paid Rs 15,000-20,000 an acre for the dry land, but in Maharashtras Nagpur, similar land fetched farmers Rs 3.5 lakh an acre.        
	These 12 candidates had seized the media spotlight by campaigning on bullock carts and walking from village to village, asking people not to vote for the ruling Congress. They had angered the Mahboobnagar district administration by handing memorandums to every political leader they came across, and had one ready for chief minister Reddy when he came touring on May 24.        
	But a police swoop on their meeting at the Kaveramma village market put paid to that plan.         
	The candidates were rounded up and moved from village to village through the day, keeping them away from their supporters as well as the chief ministers motorcade.        
	We didnt know what was happening. The police told us we were being taken to meet the chief minister, G. Satyamma, who fell unconscious and was put on a drip in hospital, told The Telegraph.        
	Its a shame that the district administration has no explanation and that no action has yet been taken on our complaints to the state human rights commission and the election commission, said Madhu Kagula, convener of the Polepally SEZ Agitation United Front.

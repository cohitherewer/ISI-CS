The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vote for hope buries Amarnath anger
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vote for hope buries Amarnath anger

	Baltal (Ganderbal) Nov. 23: Buried under a thick carpet of snow lies a barren stretch that stoked a thousand fires across the Valley some months ago.        
	A few kilometres away, in Nilgranth village, stands a polling booth. Voters in hordes anxiously await their turn, the boycott call by separatists drowned in the expectant buzz.        
	Nilgranth is the nearest booth from the snow-covered tract in Baltal, the root of the Amarnath row that triggered the events leading to the current separatist upswing.        
	Most villagers in Nilgranth claim the land used to be theirs till the government snatched it and gave it away to the Amarnath shrine board.        
	But like the barren plot, their anger at the allotment  and the frenzy for freedom it stoked  seems to have frozen in the winter for now.        
	Six constituencies in Ganderbal and Rajouri districts voted today in the second phase of the state polls. The turnout, 65.09 per cent, mirrored the high voter count of the first phase in Bandipore on November 17. The turnout from the two districts in 2002 was 43.55 per cent.        
	The Ganderbal constituency saw the days lowest turnout, 35.21 per cent, but even this was a rise of more than 10 per cent from the last polls. The numbers should be a relief to the two heavyweights locked in battle here.        
	National Conference president Omar Abdullah, who suffered a humiliating defeat in 2002 in Ganderbal, is hoping to revive his fortunes in a constituency his grandfather Sheikh Abdullah and father Farooq won several times.        
	Omar had lost to Qazi Afzal of the Peoples Democratic Party, who as forest minister had sanctioned the Amarnath land handover.         
	The anger of the people has evaporated by now, said Muhammad Hussain, a local resident.        
	Omar spent the day in Nilgranth, more than 100km from Srinagar, getting a minute-by-minute update. I was always upbeat, he said.         
	Haji Muhammad Ali, a Nilgranth resident, sees the polls as an opportunity for the villagers to improve their lot. If we can get a representative of our choice, he can change our lives, said the 60-year-old.        
	Nilgranths enthusiasm is shared by Sarbal, the last village in Kashmir on the Srinagar-Leh road. The freezing temperatures force people from these two Ganderbal villages to migrate in November every year. Today, they were back home in busloads to vote.        
	The separatists did try to dissuade people from voting, but the villagers were in no mood to listen.         
	Yes, I am going to vote and I will, Rifat Ara told an anti-poll mob outside the Duderhama booth. Yes, we want aazadi but we also want development.

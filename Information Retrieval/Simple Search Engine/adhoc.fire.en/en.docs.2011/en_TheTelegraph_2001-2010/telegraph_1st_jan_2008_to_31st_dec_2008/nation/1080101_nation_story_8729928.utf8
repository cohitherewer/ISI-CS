	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 31: Its New Year again and Governor Murlidhar Chandrakant Bhandare has something special to offer to public. 
    
	This New Years day the award-winning garden around the Raj Bhavan here would be thrown open to public. The building and the ornamental garden dotting it are on a hillock  Bhalu Mundia  1,100 ft above sea level. 
    
	The garden would be open for public for a month between 3pm and 5pm.
    
	The hilly terrain of 50 acres has been terraced into sections and on the top of the hillock stands the main building. A part of the land is occupied by forest and horticultural species, including coconut, cashew, mango and other fruit-bearing plants. 
    
	The Raj Bhavan garden has been winning prizes at flower shows for several years. This year we won the first prize at the flower show and the garden show organised by the Plant Lovers Association here, said Basant Kumar Padhi, the Raj Bhavan horticulturist. 
    
	The garden comprises lush green lawn, a rosarium and a flowerbed with a wide variety of seasonal flowers. The medicine garden is another attraction. 
    
	We have marigold, salvia, and aster among the 40 varieties of flowers. The governor wishes schoolchildren visit the garden in hordes, Padhi said.
    
	An in-house nursery meets the major requirements of the garden. Besides the circular lawn in front of the main building, decorative plants on either side of the lawn add to the beauty of the garden. The visitors can also see the deer parks, flower house and ayurvedic garden.
    
	A major attraction for visitors would be the two deer parks of an acre each. Both the parks house around 80 deer, including spotted deer and black buck, besides some animals from Nandankanan zoo. 
    
	An officer at the governors secretariat said the Raj Bhavan gardens would be open for public for the first time this New Years day. Security factor keeps the area out of public gaze during the rest of the year. While visiting the garden, do not carry cameras, binoculars or electronic devices used to take pictures, though. The schoolchildren coming to the garden have been directed through a notification to come with authentic identifications from their respective schools.

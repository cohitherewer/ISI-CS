          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Chatterjee: August deadline                                  
	New Delhi, July 26: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to probe the alleged cash-for-vote scandal.         
	The committee will submit its report on August 11, when Parliament meets for the monsoon session, Lok Sabha secretary-general P.D.T. Achary said.         
	Headed by senior Congress MP Kishore Chandra Deo, the committee includes members from the ruling combine and the Opposition  Vijay Kumar Malhotra (BJP), Mohammad Salim (CPM), Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party), Devendra Prasad Yadav (RJD), Rajesh Verma (BSP) and C. Kuppusamy (DMK).         
	The BJPs Ashok Argal, Faggan Singh Kulaste and Mahesh Bhagora, who had brought wads of notes to the Lok Sabha on July 22 and alleged that they were bribed by the Samajwadi Party to abstain in favour of the UPA during the confidence vote, petitioned the Speaker yesterday for an inquiry. The trio had claimed they were offered crores.        
	Although a House committee report is not binding, Parliament rarely rejects its recommendations.         
	The BJPs Malhotra said the party and the NDA would soon decide on participation in the committee.

	Bhubaneswar/Sambalpur, May 19: Fifty thousand workers of the Congress, including veteran leaders, were arrested today while participating in a state-wide civil disobedience movement to protest against the alleged deterioration in the law and order system in the state.         
	Nearly 50,000 Congress workers, including leaders, were arrested across Orissa during the Jail Bharo Andolan, said the president of Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee, Jayadev Jena.         
	Prominent among those arrested include Union minister of state for rural development Chandra Sekhar Sahu, Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik, former chief minister Hemananda Biswal, former Union ministers Srikant Jena and Bhakta Charan Das and former chairperson of National Commission for Women Jayanti Patnaik.         
	Braving the heat, more than 1.5 lakh party workers participated in the agitation, Jena said, adding that AICC and PCC observers were both present to support the agitation.         
	In the state capital, hundreds of workers staged a demonstration in front of the additional district magistrates office demanding immediate resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	Jena said Naveen, who holds the home portfolio, had lost his moral right to continue in power in view of the increasing lawlessness in the state. People, especially women, feel insecure under the BJD-BJP regime, he fumed.         
	Leader of the Opposition and former chief minister J.B. Patnaik said the states people were disgusted with the BJD-BJP misrule and would throw it out of power during the coming polls.         
	Listing the failures of the state government in maintaining the law and order and containing the spurt in crime, Congress leaders gave reference of the Biranchi Das murder. Also, the recent allegations of the police-criminal nexus, sexual harassment slur on the former Speaker of the Orissa Assembly, clashes in Khandhamal and rebel attacks on police in Nayagarh found mention in the Congress leaders speeches.         
	No major untoward incidents were reported from any part of the state, said a senior police officer, during the agitation. However, party workers in Nawrangpur staged a road blockade to protest alleged police excesses. Police resorted to lathicharge while the party workers were picketing in front of collectors office at Nawarangpur, alleged Jena.        
	Thousands of activists of Sambalpur and districts of western Orissa also took out protest marches against the failed Naveen coalition government. Party activists of western Orissa also courted arrest at Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Bargarh and Deogarh. The main rally was held in front of the office of the Sambalpur collector. Under the Naveen rule everything is forged or duplicate or adulterated, roared Sriballav Panigrahi, a former MP. When a states former Speaker is involved in a sex scandal and a local MLA submits a false affidavit and smuggles rice meant for BPL families, how can the government claim that they fight corruption? asked Rajesh Sukla, an AICC member.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: CBI special director M.L. Sharma has gone on indefinite leave a day after being passed over for the post of director, apparently under political pressure.        
	Sources said a deeply disappointed Sharma applied for leave late last evening, soon after the government announced the name of Himachal Pradesh director- general of police (DGP) Ashwani Kumar as the new CBI chief.        
	Sharma, a 1972 batch Rajasthan cadre IPS officer, had been the senior-most on the short-list of three candidates. He had been the favourite, having spent more than two decades in the CBI.        
	Sources said the 59-year-old, due to retire in April 2009, was contemplating premature retirement. Efforts were on, however, to placate him.        
	Sharma has been offered other postings, such as secretary (internal security) in the home ministry and information commissioner in the Central Information Commission, the sources said.         
	The current secretary (internal security), M.L. Kumawat, is tipped to become the BSF director-general by the end of next month.        
	Sharma has not accepted any of these offers, the sources added.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Yechury
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: The CPM today accused America of trying to use India to encircle China.
    
	A resolution passed at the ongoing state conference here of the partys Bengal unit said Delhi had become a part of Washingtons Asian strategy.
    
	It said an effort was on to create a quadrangle of the US, Australia, Japan and India with the aim to expand Nato in Asia.
    
	The US wants to use India to encircle China. Its becoming increasingly clear that the government of India is succumbing to that pressure, the resolution added, demanding an independent foreign and nuclear policy.
    
	The CPM, which had denied that its opposition to the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal had anything to do with China, said the Congress-led government at the Centre had entered the race to become Americas junior partner.
    
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury backed the contention, saying increasing military ties had proved the Lefts charge that the nuclear deal was part of this strategic alliance with the US, which also planned to use India against Iran.
    
	But he said the party had succeeded in stalling the Logistics Support Agreement with the US that was aimed at increasing co-operation in military training. 
    
	The agreement would also allow Indian and US military aircraft, ships and equipment to be refuelled and replenished in either country through a barter system.
    
	Yechury said the Left would not let the Centre go ahead with the nuclear agreement unless its representatives on the UPA-Left panel on the deal clears it.
    
	The Rajya Sabha MP said his party was in no mood to withdraw the outside support it offers to the central coalition but added that it was in talks with other outfits for a third alternative based on anti-communal and pro-people economic policies. 
    
	The process is on. Let us see where we can take it, he said. The assertion came three days after CPM general secretary Prakash Karats call for such an alternative outside the Congress and the BJP.
    
	Speaking at a CPM-organised seminar on the problems and prospects of India democracy, both Yechury and Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee criticised judicial activism.
    
	In a democracy, every institution works within its limits. But the judiciary is asserting power beyond its jurisdiction. This is worrisome, Chatterjee, a CPM veteran, said.
    
	Now judges are deciding where cows can graze or where Delhis monkeys should be sent to.

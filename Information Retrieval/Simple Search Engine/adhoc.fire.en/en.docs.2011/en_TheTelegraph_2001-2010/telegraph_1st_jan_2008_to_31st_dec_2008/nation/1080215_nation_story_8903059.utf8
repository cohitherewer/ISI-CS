          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 14: A woman was murdered allegedly for her infidelity. The body of the victim was spotted last night near a petrol pump.        
	The deceased, identified as Basanti, was a resident of Bayababa Math slum and a mother of three.         
	The womans 43-year-old husband, Narasingha Jena, is suspected to be behind the murder.         
	He allegedly dumped the body of the woman near Unit IX area before burning it beyond recognition. The body has been sent for post-mortem.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that Jena first killed his wife and thereafter attempted to burn her body.         
	Jena, an auto-rickshaw driver, married Basanti nine years ago and the couple have three children - two sons and a daughter.         
	He had let out a portion of his house to one Balakrishna some time back and Basanti allegedly developed an illicit relationship with him.         
	Jena was unaware of his wifes infidelity till yesterday. Last night Jena is believed to have caught the duo red-handed and murdered his wife in a fit of rage. The accused is missing after the incident. Balakrishna, too, has fled and is untraceable.

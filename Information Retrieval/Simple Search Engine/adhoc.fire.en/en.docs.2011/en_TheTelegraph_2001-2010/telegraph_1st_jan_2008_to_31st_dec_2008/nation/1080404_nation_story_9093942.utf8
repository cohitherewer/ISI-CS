	Kanpur, April 3: A 2,600-year-old city buried under a mound will be transplanted to make way for a highway extension project off Kanpur.        
	Some 155 labourers and 12 archaeologists are digging up the 6,000sqm Jajmau mound on Kanpurs outskirts which contains remnants of buildings and other relics dating from the sixth century BC to AD 1700.        
	When the job is complete  the state archaeology department hasnt fixed a deadline  the excavated walls and rooms will be rebuilt elsewhere from their components exactly as they were found.        
	Every stone and brick wall will be placed in the same order to retain the original design. The state government has already earmarked land in Kanpur for the transplant, said an official of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which is building the bridge.        
	The salvage operation involves drawing a precise layout, grating and excavation, the researcher said. Every stage is being photographed and videographed. The relics will be dismantled part by part and numbered, a research worker at the site said. Once transplanted, it will be an open museum.        
	The mound will then be replaced by the concrete slabs of an approach road to a bridge being built on the Ganga to extend NH 28, which connects this industrial city with Lucknow.        
	Some of the pits at Jajmau have thrown up earthen pottery, busts and utensils. A month ago, one pit revealed a living room, kitchen and a bathroom.        
	The mound was first excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1957-58 and some finds taken to the state museum in Lucknow. The second phase began last year after the NHAI decided to build the bridge in 2006.        
	Jajmau has been linked to Siddhapuri, an ancient town that was said to have been the capital of the mythical ruler Yayati, P.K. Singh, deputy director, state archaeology department, said.        
	The site has temples to Siddhanath and Siddha Devi as well as a crumbling mausoleum to Sufi saint Makhdoom Shah Ala-ul Haq, built by Feroze Shah Tughlaq in 1358, and a mosque erected by Kulich Khan in 1679.        
	Jajmau, however, lost its glory long ago. Small leather units and tanneries now ring the mound, and the air is thick with the odour from these units. The Ganga has shrunk to a nullah here, its waters bluish from the discharge.        
	The inspiration for the transplant came from the Nagarjuna Konda project, 160km from Hyderabad. In the 1960s, the ASI had removed a complete Buddhist stupa in Nagarjuna Konda before the site was submerged by the reservoir of a dam.        
	The ASI has undertaken a similar transplant to save 15th-century Shiva and Vishnu temples in Bilaspur, submerged by the Govind Sagar in Himachal Pradesh in 2004.        
	The Jajmau project is being monitored by a committee made up of eminent historians and officials from the state archaeology department and the NHAI.

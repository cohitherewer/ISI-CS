          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 31: The Cuttack Chamber of Commerce is demanding inclusion of more banking areas with the Cuttack clearing house that covers the city and its suburban zones.        
	Citing the plummeting volume of transaction of bank cheques and drafts Cuttack Chamber of Commerce general secretary B.K. Mohanty, said the clearing house equipped with magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) technology, which is meant to speed up the transaction process, would operate to its full capacity if and when adjoining towns avail the facility.        
	The Cuttack Chamber of Commerce had already submitted a memorandum regarding this to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) a few days ago.        
	We learn this clearing house is remaining under-utilised as only 1,200 to 1,500 instruments (cheques and demand drafts) are being cleared daily. If more banking areas are attached to it for clearance it can run to its full capacity of handling 25,000 instruments a day, the Cuttack Chamber of Commerce general secretary said in the memorandum addressed to Reserve Bank of India.        
	Mohanty suggested inclusion of banks operating in Choudwar, Charbatia, Athagarh, Banki, Salipur, Chandikhole, Chatia, Tangi, Barchana, Niali, Adaspur, Mahanga and Nischintkoili.         
	The clearing house used manual clearing of cheques and drafts till January 13 this year.         
	Then representatives from banks assembled at the at the State Bank of Indias main branch in the city and exchanged cheques and arrived at settlement figures.         
	On an average, 5,000 to 8,000 cheques and demand drafts to the tune of Rs 15 to Rs 20 crore were handled in a day.         
	But there had been an evident fall in daily handling of cheques and demand drafts since the installation of the state-of-the-art MICR technology at the clearinghouse.        
	MICR is designed and developed by Unicis  a USA concern  to sort out 600 documents per minute.         
	In fact, the RBI regional director G. Jagamohan Rao during inauguration of the MICR technology at the clearinghouse had assured that banks in adjoining towns such as Tangi, Choudwar, Charbatia, Salipur, Mahanga, Chatia and Chandikhole would soon avail the process, said Mohanty.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cease work                                  
	Cuttack, July 14: The battle against the licensing raj in Orissa intensified further today with traders deciding to shut retail markets to intensify their agitation.         
	Four days after stopping procuring essential commodities from outside, the Federation of All Orissa Traders Association has decided to close all retail markets across the state from July 19 for an indefinite period of time.         
	All traders, small, medium and big, will keep their shutters down from July 19, the associations general secretary B.K. Mohanty told The Telegraph today.         
	If that fails to move the government, the traders will take siege of the state secretariat in Bhubaneswar and go on an indefinite dharna till the withdrawal of the system, Mohanty warned.        
	The association that represents nearly 2.5 lakh traders has demanded withdrawal of the Orissa Foodstuff (Licensing and Storage) Control Order, 2008, notified by the food supplies and consumer welfare department.         
	For over two moths now the federation has strongly opposed the reintroduction of what they have labelled as the licensing raj, as it mandates them to obtain licences to maintain stock.         
	The traders have not applied for licences so far. They feel the licensing system should not be reintroduced in the larger interest of people who depend on stocks imported from other states.         
	The idea of the reintroduction of the licensing system was put forth by the UPA government at the Centre to deal with spiralling prices, but Orissa traders believe that the measure would boomerang in the state.         
	Orissa stands on a different footing than other states, as it is primarily a consuming state. The system would only hamper the free flow of essential commodities from outside and lead to scarcity. The state consumers will eventually, have to bear the brunt, said a spokesperson of the association.         
	Initially, we tried to caution the government by submitting a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik on May 7. But the civil supplies and consumer welfare department went ahead with the system from June 20, Mohanty rued.         
	The NDA had abolished the licence system in 2002 to put an end to corrupt practice perpetrated by officials. Reintroduction would only revive it, the traders apprehend.

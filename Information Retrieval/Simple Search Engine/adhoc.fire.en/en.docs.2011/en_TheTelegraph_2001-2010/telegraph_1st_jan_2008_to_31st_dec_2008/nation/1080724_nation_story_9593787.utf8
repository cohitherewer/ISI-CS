The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In south, poacher BJP turns prey 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In south, poacher BJP turns prey

	Bangalore, July 23: In just two months, the hunters have become the hunted in a state that has historically bailed out the Congress in a crisis.         
	Weeks after installing the partys first government in the south by poaching two MLAs each from the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular), the BJP was left licking its wounds as four of its Lok Sabha members either cross-voted or remained absent during yesterdays trust vote.        
	The aftershocks of the cross-vote were felt in the state today as irate BJP youth wing activists attacked Bangalore North MP H.T. Sanglianas office and tore down his cutouts. The MPs larger-than-life image as a maverick cop  he is a former director-general of police and city police commissioner  is the lore of two films.        
	State Congress chief Mallikarjun M. Kharge made it clear it was payback time. If their intentions are not good, the results will also not be good. They are now suffering after they poached our MLAs.        
	Kharge insisted no money changed hands. All the MPs who voted for the UPA followed their conscience, he said.        
	If the UPA cruised through the trust vote convincingly, it has much to thank Karnataka for, as the Congress has over the decades. It was from Chikmagalur that Indira Gandhi won a famous election victory in 1978, after the Rae Bareli defeat a year earlier, which set her on the path to the Lok Sabha triumph of 1980.         
	Of the BJPs 16 MPs from Karnataka, four defied the party whip. Sangliana and Manjunath Kunnur (Dharwad South) voted in favour of the UPA, while Udupi MP Manorama Madhavraj, a former member of the Congress glam brigade, pressed the abstention button. The fourth, D.C. Srikantappa from Chikmagalur, simply did not turn up, citing ill-health.         
	Sangliana, a Mizo police officer from the Karnataka cadre, was reportedly unhappy with the raw deal meted out to minorities, particularly Christians, in the state.        
	There were a number of attacks on prayer houses in Bangalore, Mangalore and elsewhere. No action was taken to rein in the right-wing elements, was his frequent complaint at news conferences.         
	Manorama had been allegedly marginalised by the state leadership, while Kunnur was unhappy that Basavaraj Bommai, a recent BJP convert from the Janata Dal (Secular) camp, was made a minister in the B.S. Yeddyurappa cabinet.         
	An upset BJP has expelled all those who cross-voted or abstained/absented and said suitable action would be taken against Srikantappa.

                                                                                                               MLAs break House gavel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 13: Congress legislators went on the rampage in the Bengal Assembly today, breaking the gavel and running off with the mace as a bewildered deputy Speaker watched from his chair.        
	The trouble began around 12.15 this afternoon, during mention hour, when Congress MLA Manoj Chakraborty wanted to know why the government was sitting idle while the inspector in-charge of Behrampore police station and a sub-inspector were allegedly threatening to kill him.         
	He urged deputy Speaker Bhaktipada Ghosh  filling in for Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim who was away  to ask the chief minister to make a statement.         
	Before Ghosh could answer, Manas Bhunia butted in with a supplementary question on police highhandedness in Behrampore. The deputy Speaker told Bhunia that supplementary questions would not be entertained during mention hour. He added that the MLAs should have placed a notice earlier demanding Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees statement.        
	At this, all hell broke loose. The Congress leaders crowded around Ghosh, shouting slogans.        
	In the melee, one of the MLAs broke the gavel while Chakraborty gave his desk-thumping hands a rest and grabbed the mace. He was racing to the well with it when a securitywoman stopped him and put the mace back in its place.         
	The 20 minutes of mayhem were reminiscent of a similar scene in November 2006, when Trinamul Congress MLAs had smashed furniture and wrenched out microphones after Mamata Banerjee was denied entry into Sin gur.        
	When a stunned Halim returned to the House, he threatened to deduct the price of the gavel from the MLAs salaries.

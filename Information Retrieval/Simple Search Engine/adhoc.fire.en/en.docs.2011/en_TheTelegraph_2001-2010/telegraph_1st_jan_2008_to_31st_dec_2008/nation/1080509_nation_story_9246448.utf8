          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chittoor, May 8: M.K. Azhagiri, the elder son of Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, was today acquitted in the Kiruttinan murder case, five years after the senior DMK leader was stabbed to death.        
	Twelve other accused were also acquitted. District and sessions court judge P. Durga Prasad said: They are not found guilty of the charges, that included criminal conspiracy and murder.        
	On May 20, 2003, when T. Kiruttinan was returning home after a morning walk in Madurai he was stabbed to death.                     
	The murder happened during the fiercest phase of rivalry between supporters of Azhagiri and Karunanidhis younger son M.K. Stalin.        
	Azhagiri, who was arrested the day after the murder, was charged with conspiracy to eliminate the party veteran.        
	Kiruttinan, a DMK parliamentarian since the late 1960s and a former state highways minister, was a Stalin loyalist.        
	As a senior partyman, he had demanded elections in some of the partys district units when Azhagiri wanted to fill the posts with his handpicked men.         
	In August 2007, the Supreme Court transferred the case from Madurai in Tamil Nadu to a court in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, after two prosecution witnesses told the apex court that they had been threatened.         
	Till late this evening, the judge did not clarify why the accused were acquitted. He was busy checking the 40-page judgment for typographical errors. But sources said that during the trial, not a single witness spoke for the prosecutions case.        
	Azhagiri blamed the previous ADMK government of Jayalalithaa for foisting a false case on him. Truth and fairness will always triumph, he said, before driving straight to meet his father in Chennai.

	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Aspirants to Indias top law schools will have to take just one entrance test starting this year, ending decades of cross-country travel students were forced to undertake in their quest for admission. 
    
	The University Grants Commission today cleared the way for the first Combined Law Admission Test, the new gateway to admissions at Indias seven National Law Universities (NLUs).
    
	Till now, these universities had their own entrance exams and aspiring candidates had to travel to take the tests.
    
	At a meeting with directors of the law universities today, the UGC decided on May 11 as the date for the common exam. Students can appear for the test at 13 centres across the country (see chart).
    
	The admission notification, officials said, would appear in major national dailies by the end of the month. 
    
	UGC officials said the commission had consulted the Indian institutes of technology, the Indian institutes of management and medical entrance boards before deciding on the common exam. 
    
	The Combined Admission Test and the IIT Joint Entrance Exam are models we wanted to study. Officials from the institutes were involved in the discussions preceding this decision, UGC vice-chairman Mool Chand Sharma said. 
    
	The decision on the common test came in the wake of a PIL in the Supreme Court that complained about hardships students had to face because of multiple exams.
    
	The problem, Sharma said, was compounded by the high cost of the prospectus  over Rs 1,000 at each of the seven varsities. The main purpose behind the common test is to reduce hardships, he said, adding the move could lead to several side benefits. 
    
	I think this will help in building a fraternal group among the varsities. It is time they thought together and worked together, he said.
    
	The common test could be a precursor to a slew of reforms in legal education the UGC has in mind. 
    
	UGC officials want the law schools to develop a strategy under which professors at one institute can seek transfer to another varsity, as is the case with the IITs. 
    
	UGC officials will hold a meeting tomorrow with the Bar Council of India to urge it to review legal curriculum more frequently. The curriculum has been unchanged for years. This is unacceptable.

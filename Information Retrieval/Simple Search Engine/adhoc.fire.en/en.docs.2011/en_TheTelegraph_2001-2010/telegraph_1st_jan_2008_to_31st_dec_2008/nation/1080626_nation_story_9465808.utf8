	Lords, June 25: The electronic board at Lords was lit up tonight as Kapil Dev led his men on to the hallowed turf: MCC welcomes Indian Cricket Team Winners of the 1983 Cricket World Cup.        
	It was not so much what they said but the fact they were here, 25 years to the day since India did what had been thought impossible  lift the Cricket World Cup on June 25, 1983.         
	As on the day, the shadows were lengthening across Lords as the members of the victorious Indian team walked out to the middle just before 7.30pm.        
	This was the bewitching hour when history was made and the last West Indian wicket had fallen. Today, the players made their way to the balcony and held aloft the cup as Kapil had done as a 24-year-old captain.        
	He and the senior players were repeatedly asked the same questions: had he ever thought India would win? What had he felt when India won? What was the turning point of the match? What had it done for Indian cricket?        
	Todays Kapil was a suave man, gently and diplomatically answering each question.        
	The greatest moment was when the cup was held aloft. Victory had brought a sense of self-belief among Indians  it was one of the most important moments in our country.        
	It also helped Pakistan and later Sri Lanka to win the World Cup, for they realised if India could win the cup so could they.        
	Kapil was flanked by his players, among them Man of the Match Mohinder Amarnath. It was a special moment to be back where it had all happened.        
	We are delighted to be back at Lords, said Kapil. As a team, we feel much closer.        
	Sunil Gavaskar said he was at Lords last year attending a meeting when he realised the possibility of holding a dinner on June 25, 2008. At that time, I did not know if the Long Room was free, he said.        
	It was.        
	Tonight, champagne flowed at a big celebration dinner.        
	But the champagne Kapil remembered was from 25 years ago. It came from the West Indian dressing room, he recalled with a smile.

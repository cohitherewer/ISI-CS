          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 10: Two persons were arrested and cases were lodged against 66 in connection with the mob attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar at Filki village in Nalanda on February 8.         
	Mahesh Yadav and Bhola Yadav, both from Bhagwanpur in Nalanda, have been arrested.        
	Principal home secretary Afzal Amanullah today reached Nalanda to probe into the incident, which the government has taken up as an indication of a security lapse. We are sure to bring the culprit to the fore and get him punished, Amanullah said.         
	The mob had attacked Nitish Kumar with mud clods to protest the inadequate compensation granted for 446 acres that the government has acquired to build an international university in Nalanda. The CM had visited the site with former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who has been appointed as the proposed university visitor.         
	Nitish subsequently described the attack as an engineered one, rather than a manifestation of genuine popular protest.         
	The people had given the land for the university happily. And the government has paid adequately, he had said, adding: The attack was out of the blue. The administration also had not seen any signs of protest before this visit.         
	The state administration has named 16 persons as accused: Besides, it has lodged cases against 50 unidentified people.        
	Meanwhile, Nitish has directed the administration to pay compensation to farmers who are yet to receive them.

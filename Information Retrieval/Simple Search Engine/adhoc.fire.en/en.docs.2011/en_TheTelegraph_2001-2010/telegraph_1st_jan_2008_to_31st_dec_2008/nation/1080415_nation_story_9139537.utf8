                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Olympic torch commandos under watch
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, April 14: A Tibetan-dominated Indian commando force that sacrificed lives in the Bangladesh and Kargil wars is under surveillance ahead of the Olympic torch relay.        
	New Delhi suspects that the loyalty of the Special Frontier Force (SFF), made up mostly of Tibetan exiles, may be put under strain by the personnels latent love for their homeland.        
	The elite SFF, also known as 22 Establishment, is one of Indias half-a-dozen special forces alongside the Garud and Para Commandos. It was created on November 14, 1962, to conduct covert operations behind Chinese lines in the event of a conflict, and its men and women commandos are expert paratroopers trained in jungle and mountain warfare.        
	The force has been under watch for at least the past fortnight and personnels interaction with other Tibetans has been controlled, sources said.        
	SFF personnel are under watch at their centre in Chakrata (near Dehra Dun) just like Sikh officers were after Operation Blue Star, an armed forces source who has seen the SFF operate during training said today.        
	His comments came on a day a team of Chinese commandos arrived in Delhi. On April 17, these Chinese commandos will form the inner security ring around the torch with National Security Guard commandos expected to be in the second ring. A dress rehearsal will be conducted tomorrow.        
	A former Intelligence Bureau director found it intolerable that the government, while kow-towing to the Chinese, should suspect a force that laid down Tibetan lives for India.        
	The SFF, which works under direct supervision of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is shrouded in official secrecy but its achievements are unanimously acknowledged.        
	Over 30 SFF men and women are believed to have been killed in the 1971 war, when the force had three columns in Bangladesh under the stewardship of Major General Sujan Singh Uban.        
	No one is certain how many of its commandos died while clearing the way to Tiger Hill during the Kargil conflict.        
	The personnel live in secrecy even after retirement. The only visible ones, perhaps, are the blazer-clad men and traditionally dressed women commandos who protect the Dalai Lama.        
	A Tibetan couple, who were in the SFF and had fought the Pakistani army in 1971, said they wanted to keep their anonymity.        
	I am very sorry son, I cannot talk to you, the wife  one of Indias first women paratroopers  told The Telegraph in Delhi, where the couple are now settled.        
	The Dalai Lamas office and the Tibetan government-in-exiles security department said they were not competent to speak on the issue.        
	The SFF is headed by an inspector-general, working under the supervision of the director-general, security, RAW, who reports directly to the spy agencys director.

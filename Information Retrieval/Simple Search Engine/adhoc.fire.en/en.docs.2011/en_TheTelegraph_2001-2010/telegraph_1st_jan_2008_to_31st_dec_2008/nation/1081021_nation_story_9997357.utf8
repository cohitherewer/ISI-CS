          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Yasin Malik                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Security concerns are only part of the reason why the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls have been stretched over an unprecedented six-week schedule; avoiding focused international media attention and minimising street protests appear to have dictated the scattered calendar as well.        
	Violence and low turnouts are widely expected in the Valley. Although the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party are both likely to participate, the Hurriyat factions have called for a boycott that may find enough supporters to undermine the credibility of the elections.        
	The pro-azaadi sentiment, unleashed by the Amarnath movement, is still rife, observers believe, and enthusiasm for elections could be low.        
	It isnt clear how actively the Hurriyat plans to organise its boycott call; in the last Assembly elections of 2002, it had issued a boycott diktat but did not take to the streets to oppose those seeking to vote.        
	And some Hurriyat parties, like the Peoples Conference of Sajjad Lone, had put up Independent candidates in its Kupwara-Handwara stronghold. The Valley had registered 29 per cent polling.        
	Sources in the Hurriyat indicate that this winter they could be bolder with their protests keeping in view the renewed azaadi call that has been ringing since the Amarnath agitation began.        
	One senior Hurriyat leader, Yasin Malik, has demanded, for instance, that Kashmiris be allowed to openly campaign for a poll boycott as this too amounts to the exercise of democratic rights.        
	However, the geographic and sequential contiguity of the polls has been so broken that it will not only discourage widespread protests, but will also work against cogent coverage of elections.        
	The Valley seats  a mere 47  will go to the polls in bits and pieces, making it tough to convey a broader sense of how Kashmir voted, or did not. Officials also believe it may become difficult for forces inimical to elections in the Valley to sustain protests over one-and-a-half months of winter.        
	On most polling days, only one Valley district will cast votes. And when two Valley areas go to polls, as in the fourth phase, districts as far removed as Budgam (near Srinagar) and Baramulla (near the LoC in north Kashmir) have been picked; it will be tough to club both into a single days work.        
	Officials wont admit to a media strategy behind the scheduling, but its clear the government wants to minimise adverse reportage by the foreign media and international observer groups.        
	Kashmir gets huge international attention, especially at election time, and it is mostly adverse. It isnt a bad idea at all for the government that big-picture stories from the election are being discouraged, said one state government official. Most of the coverage is done by media and observer groups that come from outside; with this schedule, sustained coverage will be difficult to manage.        
	In the past, the Valley has usually gone to the polls in one, at best two, chunks, encouraging saturation media coverage. The experience of the government, at both the state and central levels, appears to have been that such an arrangement facilitates concentrated monitoring by media and human rights groups, which have often projected poll boycotts and alleged high-handedness of security forces to scoff at the entire process in the Valley.

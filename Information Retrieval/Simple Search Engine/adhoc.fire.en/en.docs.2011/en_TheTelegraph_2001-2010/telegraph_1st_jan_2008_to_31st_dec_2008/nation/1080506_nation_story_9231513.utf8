          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 5: The Supreme Court today refused to quash a case against six doctors of Apollo Hospitals for allegedly tampering with records of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajans son Rahul and aide Bibek Moitra.        
	On June 2, 2006, Rahul and Bibek were hospitalised after a suspected drug overdose, a month after Mahajans death.         
	Bibek was declared dead on arrival in Apollo and Rahul was admitted in the ICU.         
	The hospital claimed Rahul had been admitted following complaints of low blood pressure and respiratory problems and his urine and blood tests showed no trace of drugs. But a forensic test later revealed traces of heroin and cocaine in Rahuls blood stream.         
	Following the forensic test, police filed a chargesheet in October 2006 against some Apollo doctors and top hospital officials for trying to hush up the case. The trial is on in a Delhi lower court.         
	A two-judge bench of the apex court today rejected a plea by the doctors  Mukul Pandey, Ali M. Ganai, Awdesh Bansal, Abha Gupta and Anupam Sibbal  to have the FIR against them quashed.         
	Along with the doctors, six management officials will now face trial for withholding information from public servants (the police), destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy.         
	The police chargesheet said hospital registers were tampered with at the instance of Apollo deputy general manager Rajji Chandru and another Mahajan aide, Sudhanshu Mittal, to conceal the time when the two were admitted.

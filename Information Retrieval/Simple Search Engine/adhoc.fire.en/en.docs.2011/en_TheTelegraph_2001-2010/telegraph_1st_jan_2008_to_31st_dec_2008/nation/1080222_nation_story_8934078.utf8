          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Feb. 21: A 40-year-old woman was allegedly raped by two police guards of the Haryana governor and an accomplice near the Raj Bhavan late last night.        
	The mother of five was dragged off an auto-rickshaw and attacked in the citys most high-security zone  home to the Punjab and Haryana Raj Bhavans and guarded by the police of Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab.        
	Haryana Armed Police commando Vijendra and constable Dinesh were arrested after the womans colleagues from a catering agency demonstrated in front of governor A.R. Kidwais residence early this morning. The police are looking for the third accused, a guest of Dinesh, believed to be from Rohtak.        
	The complainant, a cook, was returning home to Mohali with a companion around 2.30-3am from a function at Rock Garden when the accused stopped her auto.        
	Her complaint says she was dragged into the policemens quarters and raped. Later, she was dropped in Mohali, 10km away.        
	The womans companion says he, too, was dragged inside the police quarters while the auto driver was beaten up and locked inside the lavatory. But the companion managed to escape and inform the womans colleagues.        
	We have booked three persons on the charge of rape. The victim has been sent for a medical examination. We are waiting for the report, Sector 3 station house officer Ram Gopal said.        
	The two policemen have denied the accusations. They claim that their guest, in drunken enthusiasm, had stopped the auto on the pretext of a security check  and thats all that happened.

	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Shivraj Patil came under fire in the Rajya Sabha today for his failure to stem the violence against non-Marathis in Maharashtra, but pleaded that the Union home ministry had sent four advisories to the state government.        
	The issue came up during zero hour after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists went on the rampage following their leader Raj Thackerays arrest.        
	MPs, many of them from Bihar, cut across party lines to slam Patil and Maharashtras Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government for failing to nip Rajs anti-migrant programmes in the bud when they took a violent turn in February.        
	The guns you have are not for hanging in a room, Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) told Patil.        
	A Union home ministry official said the four advisories, sent since Sunday, included two messages on Monday. The Maharashtra government has been asked to see that no untoward incident takes place and law and order is maintained, a ministry spokesperson said about the advisory sent today.        
	However, MPs starting from Brinda Karat of the CPM, Yashwant Sinha of the BJP to Digvijay Singh of the Dal (United) targeted Patil.        
	Digvijay asked the minister to use Articles 355 (advisory) and 356 (dismissal) against the state government. He said Patil had no right to stay in the House for even a second.        
	Patil said he did not believe that the Maharashtra government would not act against the law-breakers. This failed to pacify Opposition MPs, who walked out before the House was adjourned for an hour.        
	Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi had criticised the violence but appeared to defend it in the same breath by asking the government to look into its root cause. He said Marathis were not getting selected in railway board exams.        
	Lalu Prasad took him on, saying success in competitive exams was based on merit. He accused the Sena of luring the youth away from studies.         
	Some MPs alleged Joshi was inciting Maharashtrians.

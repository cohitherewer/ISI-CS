          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug 15: You might have noticed men carrying 9mm Uzi submachine guns, ammunition strapped to the waist just below their bullet-proof vests, lurking at the Red Fort yesterday as the Prime Minister spoke.        
	They were commandos handpicked to form the SPGs crack team that will be on duty whenever threat perception is high. The Special Protection Group guards the Prime Minister, former Prime Ministers and their families. The crack team was on duty on Independence Day.        
	They will be used when required and not everyone is given those uniforms. You cannot have the Prime Minister surrounded by people in combat dress in a democracy, a senior SPG official said.         
	These special commandos will be positioned in the outer perimeter security of VVIPs and will be used on special occasions or when intelligence inputs indicate that threat perception for a VVIP is specifically high, sources said.         
	After the recent terror attacks across the country, the cabinet secretariat urgently decided to beef up security for the governments top brass.         
	The SPG draws its manpower from the National Security Guard, which trains commandos for VIP security and anti-hijacking operations. The new, visible force was also drawn from the NSG but given additional and specific training at the NSG academy, and later within the SPG. The role of personnel in the inner security ring is to ensure that in case of a shootout, the VVIPs life is protected even if the commandos have to sacrifice their own.         
	Our objective was to have commandos who can function in the worst-case scenario and ensure no harm would come to the protectee, a source said.        
	Other than the ammunition strapped to their waist, the commandos have additional power available from a 9mm pistol and an embedded knife to kill at close quarters. The bullet-proof vests were designed in the US and modified to suit Indian conditions.

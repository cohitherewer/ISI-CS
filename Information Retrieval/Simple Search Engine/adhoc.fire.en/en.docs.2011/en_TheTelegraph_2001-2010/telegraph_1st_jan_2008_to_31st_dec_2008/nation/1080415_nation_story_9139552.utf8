  - Lights, camera, sound but no action        SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani                                        
	New Delhi, April 14: The BJP, which rode to power on the strength of road shows and street protests, seems to have turned into an armchair organisation content with news conferences and book releases.        
	Its serial threats over the past six months to hold nation-wide agitations, on issues such as price rise and terrorism, have proved hollow, the thunder limited mainly to media statements.        
	The party was supposed to be in the thick of a weeklong agitation on inflation from April 7 to 14, but all that has taken place are half-hearted token protests.        
	Instead, the headlines the BJP has made in recent weeks have stemmed from L.K. Advanis controversial autobiography and interviews that deflected attention from price rise and the nuclear deal.        
	Some in the BJP, which once prided itself on its machinery for organising street protests, believe that the leadership has lost focus. Strategy-making, they say, has gone into the hands of apolitical intellectuals who think communication and media management can be substitutes for direct political action.        
	The BJP leadership had swung into poll preparations early this year but failed to sustain the momentum. The plan to flog internal security and minority appeasement into big political issues fell flat when the Suraksha Sankalp rallies were abruptly called off following an increased threat perception to Advani.        
	The party vowed to resume the programme but its recent action plan, announced after a meeting of general secretaries, does not mention these issues.        
	Instead, the BJP shifted its focus to 1857, trying to snatch a slice of the freedom movement cake from the Congress. The dhuli kalash programme to distribute soil collected from the martyrs birthplaces among its state leaders was far more impressive than any demonstration on the price rise.        
	But that programme was more cultural than political, showing that the ageing BJP leadership had lost the ability to whip up anger against the government like it used to do a decade ago.        
	The IC 814 hijack controversy, revived by Advanis book, has forced the party to dilute its emphasis on terror. Advanis claim that he did not know that Jaswant Singh was to accompany the freed militants to Kandahar showed the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in poor light and the Congress exploited the unease within the BJP.        
	After having declared that terrorism was the main issue, the BJP became so defensive that its spokespersons accused the Congress of talking about Kandahar to divert attention from the real issue of price rise.        
	Now the party seems more interested in projecting Advani as a liberal and secular leader. As part of the project, it has launched a website on his autobiography with a lot of publicity.

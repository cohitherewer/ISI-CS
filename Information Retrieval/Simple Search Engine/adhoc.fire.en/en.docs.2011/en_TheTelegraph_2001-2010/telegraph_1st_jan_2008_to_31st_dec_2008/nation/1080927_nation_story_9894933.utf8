          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 26: Rapping the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) for dumping garbage everywhere in the city, Orissa High Court has ordered for an immediate end to the temporary dumping yards.        
	While giving a seven-day time limit yesterday, the court also warned that violation of the order after the deadline may result in arrest of BMC officials and criminal proceedings there of.        
	The corporation disposes more than 400 tonnes of garbage per day through seven dumping yards located within the city.         
	But the court has been pressing for single-point garbage dumping in the twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack for more than six months now.         
	We are unable to understand as to why the BMC has taken the orders of this court so lightly, the high court said while directing the civic body to lift all solid waste from the temporary dumping yards to Bhuasuni and complete the process within a week.        
	Some 61.41 acres at Bhuasuni in Khurda districts Bhubaneswar tehsil had been identified for a dumping yard.         
	The Khurda collector had handed over land to the civic body in February.         
	The court had fixed March 15 as the deadline for erecting a boundary wall around the allocated land and dumping of garbage thereof. But the order had not been complied.        
	The court said the construction of the boundary wall should start immediately and be completed within three months.         
	Even in course of the construction of the boundary wall, the solid waste collected from the area covered by the BMC should be dumped only at Bhuasuni and not at any other place, the division bench of Justices L.K. Mohapatra and Indrajeet Mohanty clarified.        
	BMC counsel B.K. Das had informed the court that an estimated Rs 2.5 crore was required for construction of an approach road and boundary wall of the dumping yard at Bhuasuni.        
	The court, however, directed the BMC to go ahead with the work from its own funds.

          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The US has sent out its third advisory in a week to citizens travelling in India, this time warning them to be watchful during Diwali as terrorist attacks could occur anytime.        
	The first two advisories, issued on October 21 and October 23, had warned Americans to be vigilant in connection with the attacks on rail examinees in Maharashtra and the subsequent train disruptions in Bihar.        
	The serial advisories  the India Diwali warning was issued on October 24  appear to suggest the US is not much bothered by Indias protests against foreign governments issuing travel alerts to citizens in India.        
	The Diwali advisory has termed the festival the most important holiday when markets and transportation centres teem with shoppers and travellers, and urged Americans to consider the level of security present when visiting public places.        
	It has reminded Americans that recent terror attacks in India targeted crowded urban areas such as malls, trains, train stations, cinemas, mosques and restaurants and mostly took place in the evening.        
	Terrorist attacks, however, can occur anytime and anywhere. Although foreigners have not been specific targets the risk of being a victim is ever present. You are reminded to be vigilant at all times, it warned.        
	The first advisory on the Mumbai Riots had alerted Americans about Raj Thackerays arrest and reports of vandalism and violence by small roaming groups of rioters in Mumbais suburbs and nearby Pune and Nashik.        
	Although these disturbances are not directed at U.S. citizens, they are indiscriminate American citizens should avoid large crowds if possible and exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations, it said.        
	The second advisory on India Train Riots, issued in Calcutta, had warned Americans to minimise travel and maintain a low profile till the train disruptions ended.        
	Tourism minister Ambika Soni had recently urged foreign countries to exercise restraint as such advisories would sway tourists to India.

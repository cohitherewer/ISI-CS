	New Delhi, April 11: India is asserting its unique position on Tibet with China ahead of the Olympic torchs arrival on April 17.        
	Sources said India today conveyed to Beijing that there was no plan to ban any protest. Delhi also clarified that it had not wanted its envoy to join a guided tour of diplomats to Lhasa, arranged by China last month after the clashes.        
	A perception had gained ground that Beijing had snubbed India by not inviting its envoy. The sources said India chose not to send its ambassador in Beijing, Nirupama Rao, to the Tibetan capital as it was a guided tour.        
	At the same time, India has maintained that Tibet was an autonomous region of China and Indian territory could not be used for anti-Beijing political activities. Delhi also promised fool-proof security for the Olympic torch relay.        
	On Chinas query whether India has banned protests of Tibetan refugees against the backdrop of reports that Bengal did not allow a demonstration, the sources said India conveyed that being a democracy, the country could not take such decisions.        
	But it was also pointed out that law and order was a state subject under the Indian federal system.        
	Calcutta police have decided not to allow Tibetans to organise rallies or meetings in public places in the city, adds a staff reporter. This is an administrative decision taken by the city police department and the state government. Keeping an eye on the present scenario, we have taken the decision, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	Sources claimed that fears of adverse reaction among the Chinese people in the city prompted the decision. But the CPM has been supporting China on Tibet.

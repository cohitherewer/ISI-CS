	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 20: Normal life was paralysed in Orissa today during the daylong strike called by seven trade unions, including Citu and unions under the CPM wing.         
	The strike was called to press for a seven-point charter of demands, including checking the price rise, scrapping the Indo-US nuclear deal and strengthening the public distribution system (PDS).        
	Though no untoward incident was reported, some 500 activists were arrested from several parts of the state.         
	In Bhubaneswar, most vehicles kept off the road, shutters were downed, markets, business and finance institutions were closed. Capitals traffic was non-existent with buses, trucks and autorickshaws deciding not to ply.         
	Schools, colleges and other educational institutions, however, remained open.         
	Train services were badly hit, as many of them were cancelled, re-scheduled and short terminated. The Howrah-Chennai Coromandal Express, scheduled to leave Howrah for Chennai, and Jajpur-Keonjhar Road-Kharagpur Passenger were cancelled from both directions.         
	The Hyderabad-Howrah East Coast Express and the Sambalpur-Howrah Ispat Express were been short-terminated. Puri-New Delhi Purushottam Express was re-scheduled. Trains from Calcutta all ran late.         
	Employees of All India Airport Authority also went on protest today.         
	However, that did not affect any flight services, claimed airport authorities. We have our own contingency plans for such situations, explained Sanjay Jain, the director of the Biju Patnaik Airport.         
	Security arrangements were made in order to prevent any untoward incident during the strike, as Left Front activists and trade unions burned tyres at places in Bhubaneswar and blocked whatever traffic was on the road. Barricades were erected, besides picketing was conducted at places in a bid to make the bandh effective.         
	Cuttack, too, felt the bandh impact, as trade union members of Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) held protests.         
	In Rourkela buses and trucks were off the road and most offices were closed. Work, however, continued at the Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) as employees had managed to enter the plant early in the morning. In Berhampur, most offices and schools remained closed. Meanwhile, Left workers staged blockades at places in Sambalpur affecting traffic.

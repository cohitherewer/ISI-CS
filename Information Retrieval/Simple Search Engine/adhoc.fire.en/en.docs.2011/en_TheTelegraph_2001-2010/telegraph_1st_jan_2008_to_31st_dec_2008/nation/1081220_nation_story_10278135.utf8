          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay may have made himself loudly heard with his comments on the Mumbai terror strikes, but not the same can be said about his ministry. So the government thinks.        
	The minority ministry yesterday received an order from the higher echelons to highlight its initiatives in a more loud manner through new advertisements.        
	The ministry is already running a series of ads on its various scholarship schemes, including the merit-cum-means, pre-matric and post-matric scholarships for minority students. But the Centre and the Congress apparently want more colour in the campaign.        
	The images in the ongoing ads are devoid of religious symbols like the skullcap and the burqa.        
	It was a conscious decision to shun religious symbols, and we received appreciation from various quarters that saw the campaign as quite progressive, minority secretary M.N. Prasad said.        
	However, some in the government and the Congress appear to think the sanitised campaign has failed to strike a chord among the minorities.        
	We havent been asked to pull out the advertisement, but it has been made clear that there needs to be much more colour and punch, a ministry official said. He added that the ministry had not decided whether to revise the existing ads or create new ones.        
	He said the ministry had also been asked about the possibility of getting the ads aired on private TV channels. So far, they have been shown only on Doordarshan.        
	The timing of the order has puzzled some ministry officials. We dont know whether the demand has any connection with our ministers outburst in Parliament, an official said.        
	Antulay had said on Wednesday he wasnt sure if Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karkare, shot dead during the Mumbai attacks, was a victim of terrorism or of terrorism and something. He had underlined how Karkare had unearthed non-Muslims role in terror during the Malegaon blast probe.        
	The minister has been pilloried for the remarks and the Centre has promised a statement on the sensitive subject.        
	At the last inter-ministerial meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had expressed displeasure because the initiatives of the minority ministry had failed to make an impact on the public mind, sources said.        
	The Prime Minister was quite upset that the government had not got the deserved goodwill for initiating so many minority-friendly measures, a minority ministry official said.        
	Pressure is mounting on the ministry to speed up the implementation of various schemes. Right now, it has been asked to focus on the Rs 100-crore scheme for minority-concentration districts (MCDs).        
	The ministry has identified 90 backward districts with very low socio-economic indicators and amenities, and will prepare and implement area or problem-specific special development plans in these districts.

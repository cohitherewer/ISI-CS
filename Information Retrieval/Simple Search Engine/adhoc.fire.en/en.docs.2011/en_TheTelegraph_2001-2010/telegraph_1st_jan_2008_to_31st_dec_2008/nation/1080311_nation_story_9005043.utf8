The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi revokes religion law
                                                                                                               Modi revokes religion law
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, March 10: The BJP-led Gujarat government today withdrew a controversial amendment that made state permission necessary for conversions but allowed people to switch sects within the same faith.        
	The move to repeal the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006  which clubbed Jains and Buddhists with Hindus and was panned by critics as a ploy to strengthen pan-Hindu solidarity  came after governor N.K. Sharma returned it saying the amendment violated the Constitution.        
	The original 2003 act, which makes state permission mandatory for any conversion, however, remains in force.        
	The repeal came a day after chief minister Narendra Modi told Pakistani human rights activist Asma Jahangir there was complete religious freedom in Gujarat and that the minorities were safe in the state.        
	The UN special representative on freedom of religion had met Modi in Gandhinagar after interactions with a number of non-government organisations and rights workers.        
	The controversial amendment had defined a convert as a person who had renounced his religion for another but did not include one who had renounced his denomination and adopted another of the same religion.        
	Jainism and Buddhism were described as denominations of Hinduism in the same way as Shias and Sunnis were Muslims or Protestants and Catholics were Christians.        
	With Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism put in the same group, it meant the hardest hit were Dalits who had either converted to Buddhism or were planning to.        
	The basic purpose, some analysts had said, seemed to be to discourage Dalits from converting.        
	Under the amendment, which also clarified the meaning of forced conversion, a person did not need to seek permission for converting from one sect to another of the same religion. So a Hindu could easily convert to Buddhism, but had to take the district collectors permission for embracing Christianity or Islam.        
	The amendment, however, excluded Sikhs from its purview.        
	Rights activists said the repeal had come at a time Modi was being projected as a future Prime Minister. They said the chief minister was just trying to hoodwink people and shore up his image to make him nationally acceptable.        
	The Congress and Modis opponents were not satisfied with the repeal.        
	We want the original bill to be withdrawn as it violates the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion, said rights activist Fr Cedric Prakash.

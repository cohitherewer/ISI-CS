The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No kirpan, no Pope date

	New York, March 7: Representatives of Americas Sikh community are refusing to meet the Pope during his visit to the US next month after the Secret Service denied them permission to wear their ceremonial daggers.        
	The carrying of the kirpan is one of the five articles of faith required of all baptised Sikhs, but that has cut no ice with the American department assigned to protect the Pope.         
	Sikhs had been invited to join other religious leaders to meet the pontiff in Washington on April 17 to express a shared commitment to peace.         
	The US branch of the World Sikh Council refused to comply with the Secret Service demand, pointing out that Sikhs were allowed to wear the kirpan when they met Pope John Paul II in the Vatican.         
	The kirpan represents the Sikh commitment to resist oppression and injustice and is to be carried only in a defensive posture and never to initiate confrontation, said Anahat Kaur, the secretary general of the World Sikh Council America Region.        
	Kaur added: We cannot undermine the rights and freedoms of religion in the name of security.

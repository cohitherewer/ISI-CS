The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM constitution lesson for Somnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CPM constitution lesson for Somnath
  - Fuming at Speaker for putting Parliament first, party takes harshest action        MANINI CHATTERJEE                                               Chatterjee in Parliament 
  on Bal Gangadhar Tilak rsquo;s birth anniversary on Wednesday. (PTI)    
	New Delhi, July 23: As part of a well-crafted strategy decided in advance, the CPM leadership let Somnath Chatterjee revel in the glory of holding the high constitutional position of Speaker of the Lok Sabha during the two-day historic trust vote debate only to strike back by holding high its own party constitution and summarily expelling him from the party today.        
	Chatterjee invited summary expulsion  the harshest disciplinary action that can be taken against an erring party member  because of his prolonged defiance of the party line that brought great embarrassment to the CPM when it was in the midst of a crucial political battle against the government.         
	The formal politburo statement merely said: This action has been taken under article XIX, clause 13 of the party constitution for seriously compromising the position of the party.        
	The writing was on the wall when the partys central committee discussed the issue last weekend and left it to the politburo to take an appropriate decision.         
	The central committee decision  that Chatterjee should quit his post and vote with the rest of his comrades against the trust vote  was informally conveyed to the Speaker, although the partys top leadership was well aware that Chatterjee was not about to do any such thing.        
	The central committee also decided not to take any action against Chatterjee before the trust vote because it did not want to deflect attention from the central issue of fighting the Manmohan Singh government on the nuclear deal.         
	The politburo was duly authorised to take action after the debate was over  and it did so with alacrity today.        
	Article XIX, clause 13 of the party constitution states: In exceptional circumstances, party committees in their discretion may resort to summary procedure in expelling members for grave anti-party activities.         
	The CPM resorted to this particular clause because the circumstances were truly exceptional  no party leader has held any constitutional post such as that of the Speaker before. So, while there are elaborate rules and regulations concerning party members in elected public bodies, there is no specific clause that could apply to Chatterjee.        
	But since the Speaker  whom the CPM general secretary referred to as Comrade on July 14 and whose name figured on the list of party MPs submitted to President Pratibha Patil when the Left formally withdrew support on July 9  is also a party member and legislator, there was ample scope to expel him summarily.        
	For instance, clause 2 of article XIX (which deals with the issue of party discipline) states: Discipline is based on conscious acceptance of the aims, the programme and the policies of the party. All members of the party are equally bound by party discipline irrespective of their status in the party organisation or in public life.        
	Clause 3 adds: Violation of the party constitution and decisions of the party as well as any other action and behaviour unworthy of a member of the Communist Party shall constitute a breach of party discipline and is liable to disciplinary action.        
	Although the politburo statement did not spell it out, there was a widespread feeling among ordinary party members that Chatterjee was placing his personal prestige above the party.                     
	Unlike the chairman of the Rajya Sabha who is above and beyond the House, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has to be an elected member of Parliament. And since he was elected on the CPM ticket  and is unlikely to have won his seat without the party symbol or backing  his first commitment should be to the party and not to his post, they felt.        
	The argument that Chatterjee was elected unanimously to the post of Speaker did not cut any ice with the CPM or its Left allies. The post came his way, they argued, only because the Left had offered outside support to the government in 2004.         
	At that time too, a section within the CPM did not approve of the decision to allow the partys leading Lok Sabha member to take on the post. But the leadership, which had vetoed joining the government, accepted it because it pertained to the legislature and not the executive. Chatterjees own eagerness to swap his seat for the Chair also played a role.         
	But once the Left withdrew support from the government, many in the party expected Chatterjee to give up his post voluntarily. The CPM leadership, therefore, stuck to the line that the Speaker should be left to take his own decision. It was their way of telling Chatterjee to step down gracefully at a time when all good comrades were expected to come to the aid of the party.        
	Chatterjee did no such thing. The media glare on the issue for close to two weeks added to the discomfiture of the party leadership, which gradually turned to rage.         
	The support extended to Chatterjee by the Congress, constitutional experts and large sections of the media only made things worse. The partys rank and file felt that the Speaker was getting away with openly defying party norms and  wittingly or unwittingly  working against the interests of the Left as a whole when it was engaged in a serious political battle against the Manmohan Singh government.        
	Chatterjees status as Speaker will not be affected by his expulsion from the party. The CPM is unlikely to move any motion for his removal and as an unattached member, he is free to continue in his post.         
	But since the 14th Lok Sabha has just a few months left of its term, no one is sure if Chatterjee will end his innings in public life as the Speaker who told off his party or take on more onerous constitutional responsibilities.

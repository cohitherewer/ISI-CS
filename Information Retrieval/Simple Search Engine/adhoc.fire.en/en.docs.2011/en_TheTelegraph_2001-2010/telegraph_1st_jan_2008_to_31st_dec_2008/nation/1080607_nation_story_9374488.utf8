	Cuttack, June 6: While Naveen Patnaik assured that Orissa was green enough, Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray called upon the states people to forge a mass movement to stop environmental degradation due to the so-called industrial blitzkrieg in Orissa.         
	Its time that the people rise above personal interests and come together to claim their rights over air, water and forests that stand to be destroyed by industrialisation in the name of development, Ray said.        
	Expressing concern over the green degradation owing to industrial boom, the former Speaker warned that a mindless approach would only spell doom. The time is not far when the population would be left struggling for air and water, he said while addressing a seminar yesterday on Politics of development organised by Lokshakti Abhijans Orissa unit at Cuttack.

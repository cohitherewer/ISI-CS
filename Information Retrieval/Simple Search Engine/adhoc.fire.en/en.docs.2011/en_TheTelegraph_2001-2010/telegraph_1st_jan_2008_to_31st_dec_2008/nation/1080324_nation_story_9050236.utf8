          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Amit Bodhiraja. Bangalore News Photos                                  
	Bangalore, March 23: A young Infosys employee who suspected his wife of having an affair smothered her to death and then hanged himself today.        
	The bodies of Amit Bodhiraja, 30, and Rinku Sachdeva, 28, were discovered at noon. A friend of the couple had arrived to pick them up for a movie. Having waited a long time at the door, she smelt a rat and called police.         
	The house owner, Aravamudan, gave the police a duplicate key and they found Amit hanging from a fan and Rinku lying dead on a bed.        
	A suicide note lay next to Amit in which he admitted to killing his wife in a fit of rage early this morning following an argument over her alleged extra-marital affair.        
	Amit, a software engineer from Delhi, wrote that he could not accept Rinkus relationship with her colleague at Standard Chartered Bank.         
	She came home late frequently. When I asked her, after many times, she admitted to the affair, the suicide note read.        
	The police said that prima facie, Amit seemed to have smothered his wife with a pillow and hanged himself from a fan in the bedroom. They are not ruling out the involvement of a third person. Rinkus colleagues will be questioned tomorrow.         
	We have questioned neighbours. The couple came home separately last night as usual and there were no loud arguments. A common friend, Urmila Ghate, who had booked tickets for the movie Race came to pick them up today. We entered the house following her complaint and found them dead, an officer said.         
	Amit had married Rinku in Mumbai, where she lived, a year ago. It was an arranged marriage, the police said.         
	Amit had been living on the first floor of Aravamudans house in Koramangala for the last four years.         
	Rinkus parents are in Muscat and are expected in the city tomorrow. The bodies have been taken to St Johns Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem.         
	Aravamudan and other neighbours said Amit and Rinku were a quiet couple and they never heard them quarrel.

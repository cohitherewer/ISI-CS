	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 21: The Orissa government, red-faced after drawing a blank in the publicised six-day-long combing operation, today claimed to have nabbed two rebels  one of them a self-styled area commander.        
	The two  a woman and a man  were identified as Manjulata Muduli alias Rina and Pratap Kimbaka.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik while informing Assembly members said the arrests were made in a forest near Bhanjanagar in Ganjam.         
	Providing details, Ganjam superintendent of police S. Devdutt Singh said Bhanjanagar police nabbed the two suspected Maoists in the Kupati forest.         
	A sharp weapon and a pistol without cartridges were seized from them.         
	During interrogation, the duo reportedly confessed to have played a part in the Nayagarh operation on the night of February 15 that led to deaths of 15 policemen.         
	Manjulata, a resident of Lachhamakana in coastal Jagatsinghpur, has allegedly been a member since six years. She is the member of the Sambalpur-Deogarh zone committee and was involved in Naxalite operations in Sambalpur, Deogarh and Nayagarh.         
	Pratap, a tribal youth from Chandrapur under Muniguda police station in Rayagada, was responsible for incidents of violence in neighbouring Khandhamal, Koraput and Kalahandi, besides the recent Nayagarh operation.         
	On the night of February 15, some 500 heavily armed rebels carried out simultaneous attacks on Nayagarh town police station, district police armoury, police training school, and on two neighbouring police stations at Daspalla and Nuagaon, besides Mahipur outpost. Sixteen people, including 14 personnel, a home guard and a civilian were killed in the attack.         
	Speaking in the Assembly, the chief minister also conceded that a group of militants was intercepted in Gosama hills under Tikabali police station of Kandhamal on February 16 after the Maoist attacks. He added that there was heavy exchange of fire between rebels and forces.         
	In this encounter Maoists suffered casualties and their exact numbers are being ascertained, he added.        
	This is the first time that a counter attack of this magnitude was launched so soon after a Naxalite attack.        
	On February 18, substantial arms, ammunition and equipment were recovered from the operation site in Gosama hill, added Patnaik.         
	Though the combing operations are still on and four more companies of CRPF have been pressed into the operations  so far the combined personnel have made little progress.

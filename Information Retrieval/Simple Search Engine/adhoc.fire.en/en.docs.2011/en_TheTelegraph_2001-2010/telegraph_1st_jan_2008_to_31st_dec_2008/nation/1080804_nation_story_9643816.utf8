                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     House of horror begins long wait for buyer
  - After Aarushi murder, Talwars want to move out of Noida flat but it might not be easy to sell        ANANYA SENGUPTA                            The entrance to the Talwars flat in Noida, (below) Rajesh and Nupur Talwar. Pictures by Prem Singh                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Rajesh Talwars Noida flat may be on the block but property consultants feel selling it wont be easy, like the other horror houses waiting for buyers.        
	Sources close to Talwar said he hadnt stepped into L-32 Jalvayu Vihar, in Noidas Sector 25, since his release after 50 days in jail as a suspect in daughter Aarushis murder.        
	The dentist is said to shudder at the thought of having to live in the house where his daughter and domestic help Hemraj were murdered on May 15 night.        
	Apparently, he has told wife Nupur he would like to 
  move back to Delhi. The couple had shifted to Noida from the capitals Hauz Khas area after Aarushi was born.        
	He doesnt want to live there any longer. He has fond memories of the house with Aarushi. Now he is devoured by sadness. This is the most tragic incident of his life and the house reminds him of it, a friend of the Talwars said.        
	After his release, Talwar put up with his in-laws a few blocks from Jalvayu Vihar. He cannot stay in his apartment, the site of a CBI investigation, but could have paid a visit had he wanted to.        
	Any sale, though, can take place only after the CBI completes its probe which, the sources said, could take several months.        
	Noida developers put the value of the house at Rs 45-50 lakh. If the Talwars part with it now, it will be a distress sale for emotional reasons. He is a successful dentist and a loss of Rs 2-3 lakh wont affect him. In India, one can even sell a graveyard these days, said Akash Aggarwal of Aggarwal Associates, which deals in properties in Noida, east Delhi, Gurgaon and Indirapuram, a township near Ghaziabad town.        
	Aggarwal recounted how the east Delhi home of Shoaib Ilyasi, who produced Indias Most Wanted, changed hands despite his wife allegedly committing suicide there.        
	Ilyasis home in Mayur Vihar was sold at the market price although it was well known that his wife was said to have stabbed herself in the house, Aggarwal said.        
	Closer to the Talwars home, Maninder Singh Pandher, an accused in the Nithari serial killings, tried selling his D-5 house in Noidas Sector 36 but is still waiting for a deal.         
	Other real estate agents accept that selling tragedy-tarred houses isnt easy but add that a lot depends on the sales pitch.        
	Satyakam Mukherjee, a dealer in Delhis Chittaranjan Park who was involved in the sale of one such house, said: One needs to reduce the price. One has to show the good features of the house and argue that the low price is an opportunity that wont come easily again. We also help arrange for priests (for a purging ritual) if a buyer is superstitious.        
	Overseas, too, such sales havent been simple or profitable. The California condominium that was the scene of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman on June 12, 1994  allegedly by her footballer-husband .J. Simpson  was put up for sale soon after the killings. It sat on the market for two-and-a-half years and finally sold for $200,000 less than what Nicole had paid for it.         
	Later, after the buyer remodelled the 1991 property and described it in the listings as stylish and elegant with four bedrooms, high ceilings and open spaces, it won a super deal.        
	There are real estate consultants abroad who specialise in selling such horror houses, but such expertise isnt easy to find in India.        
	Here, the practice is to wait till the stigma fades. Thats what the family of Nishi Banga, the 70-year-old found murdered and trussed up in her Greater Kailash home on December 12 last year, have chosen to do. Her sons and husband, who live abroad, have decided not to rent out or sell the house in a hurry.         
	The Talwars flat, under the spotlight for months, too would take time to regain much-needed anonymity.

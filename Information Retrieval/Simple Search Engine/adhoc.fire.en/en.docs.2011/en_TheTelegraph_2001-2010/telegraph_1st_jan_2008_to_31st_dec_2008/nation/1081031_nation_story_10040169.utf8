	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: Her goals and targets are written on her room walls. She has devoured over 100 books on chess.        
	Armed with all these and something extra  unlimited talent  chess prodigy Padmini Rout and her coachs strides towards grabbing the Grandmaster title in three years doesnt seem drastic.        
	The Oriya girl bagged the world Under-14 crown in the World Youth Chess Championship being held at Vung Tau, Vietnam, which concluded today.         
	Her latest win has only fanned the excitement among her admirers.         
	This is Padminis first woman international masters championship title and her fourth international win.         
	Padmini became the youngest international master from Orissa by obtaining her third and final norm in the World Junior (Under-20) Girls Championship at Yerevan in Armenia in October last year.        
	Padmini is aiming for the womens world title by 2009, the world junior crown in 2010 and the mens world championship by 2012.         
	She has her targets pasted on the walls of her home and has finished over hundred books on chess, said her coach Satya Ranjan Patnaik.         
	Needless to say, the overjoyed man is sure of his wards success. He goes on to say that the chess prodigys biggest strength is the love for the game. She doesnt have to be told to practise, said Patnaik.        
	At 14, the teenager has earned fame and money and respect of senior players, a status that few of her age can dream of.         
	Despite lacking proper sponsorship or state-of-the-art facilities she has emerged as a winner, always. Padminis father Ashok Kumar Rout and mother Sasmita Dhal have been their daughters strength from the beginning.         
	Recently, they spent a neat sum to hire an international coach for their daughter, but the problems have been worth it. She took up the challenge when chess was not popular in Orissa. Now, with Padminis win we can hope that the game would find new takers, Patnaik said.        
	A student of Class VIII at the DAV Public School, Chandrasekharpur, Padmini practises eight to 10 hours a day and six days a week.        
	The Mumbai triumph where Padmini won the National Under-13 Girls Chess Championship title for the third time in a row on January 18, 2008, enabled her to become eligible to represent India in the Asia and World Youth Chess Championships.         
	Padmini had earlier won the Asian Youth (Under-12) Championship at New Delhi in 2005 and retained it at Teheran in 2006.

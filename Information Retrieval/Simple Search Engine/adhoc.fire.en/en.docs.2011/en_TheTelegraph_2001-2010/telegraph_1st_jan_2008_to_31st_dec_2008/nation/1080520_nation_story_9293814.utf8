          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Flowers adorn Aarushis picture in Noida. Telegraph picture                                        
	New Delhi, May 19: Anyone could have killed Noida schoolgirl Aarushi Talwar  her parents took so little care of her security  police said today but identified her dentist fathers former helper as the chief suspect.        
	But they wouldnt rule out the parents as suspects, either.         
	Aarushi, 15, lived in a house that was open to anyone who wished to enter, 24x7. The locks of the flat hadnt been changed for 10 years. At least eight former servants had access to the house keys.        
	Vishnu Sharma was one of them, having worked for the Talwars for eight years  as household help, as compounder at the dentist couples private clinic, as their receptionist and as Rajesh Talwars assistant during surgeries.        
	A few months ago, the Talwars had angered him by replacing him with a man called Hemraj, who was murdered along with Aarushi on Thursday night. Officers suggested it was the new servant whom Sharma intended to kill for revenge but had to silence the girl as well because she saw something.        
	But the police arent sure this is the only explanation, and have allowed Sharma to leave after questioning.        
	We havent given a clean chit to the parents. Everybody is a suspect, said Noida police chief A.S. Ganesh.        
	Officers are sceptical of the Talwars claim that they saw and heard nothing while their only daughter was being murdered next room. The police say the couple have been giving evasive answers or clamming up during grilling.        
	Rajesh had told the police that it was part-time help Bharati who found the body in the morning. But the maid told the media today: When I arrived, both parents were crying. The father told me, See what Hemraj has done.         
	Hemraj may have killed the girl and been attacked by the parents, a source said. Or it could be an honour killing  Hemraj and Aarushi may have been caught in a compromising position. Rajesh used to lock Aarushi in every night but not the night of the murder.        
	Officers wouldnt confirm either theory. Both girl and servant, however, were killed in the same way  their throat slit and not stabbed.        
	The police say that if Sharma was the killer, he may have been accompanied by his brother, who happens to be Hemrajs son-in-law. The family connection had led Sharma to recommend Hemraj to the Talwars when he went on leave eight months ago.        
	When he returned, the Talwars said they had taken a liking to Hemraj and wanted to retain him, an officer said.        
	The bathroom in the flat has a door leading outside and another opening inside. Sources said Sharma probably entered this way. Call records show Sharma rang Aarushi and Hemraj that night at 8.30 and 9.30.

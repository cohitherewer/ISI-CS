	Mumbai, Nov. 26: The Shiv Sena has called a Maharashtra bandh on December 1, violating a court ban that it has once earlier been fined for defying.        
	The bandh has been called to protest what the Shiv Sena describes as a campaign to vilify Hindutva leaders like Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, a suspect in the Malegaon blasts case.        
	Sanjay Raut, who has penned many virulent Saamna editorials on behalf of party patriarch Bal Thackeray, said: The ATS is maligning Hindutva leaders every day with selective leaks to the media. This is nothing but the UPA governments plan to strengthen the Muslim votebank. ATS officials are threatening to hang upside down Hindutva leaders like sadhvi Pragya Singh. We are a Hindutva party and we will support them.        
	Reminded that the Sena was fined by Bombay High Court for holding a bandh in 2003, Raut said: We will face whatever we have to face legally. We will defy court orders, and we will pay the fine if need be.         
	This is the first bandh call by the Sena, known for its aggressive politics and violent shutdowns, since the 2003 strike that had been called against the Ghatkopar bus blast.         
	In the evening, Thackeray issued a statement to be published in the party mouthpiece tomorrow. The Congress has decided to take revenge on the Hindus and has adopted a policy of crushing Hindus. Shiv Sena has announced a Maharashtra bandh to give it a fitting reply, the statement said.         
	Using the Malegaon blasts as an excuse, Hindus are being vilified, and even the Indian Armys morale is affected it added.        
	Thackeray, with his eyes clearly on the next elections, accused the Congress-led government in the state of failing to provide relief to Vidarbhas cotton farmers and to tackle power scarcity.         
	In 2003, the city-based citizens group Agni had filed a public interest litigation against the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in Bombay High Court saying the bandh had caused a loss of Rs 50 lakh to the city.        
	The high court ordered the two parties to pay a fine of Rs 20 lakh each as compensation. The Sena and the BJP appealed to the Supreme Court, but were ordered to deposit the fine first before the matter was decided. The matter is pending before the apex court.         
	The VHP promptly announced its support for the Sena bandh. We will support the bandh. It is for the Hindu cause, VHP state president Vyankatesh Abdeo said today.         
	The BJP is also likely to participate. Party general secretary Vinod Tawade said: Our senior leaders are campaigning for the Assembly elections. Therefore, Sena-BJP leaders have not discussed the issue yet. But we agree completely with the Sena stand that Hindutva leaders are being maligned.         
	Last week, BJP leader L.K. Advani had expressed outrage at allegations of Pragyas torture.

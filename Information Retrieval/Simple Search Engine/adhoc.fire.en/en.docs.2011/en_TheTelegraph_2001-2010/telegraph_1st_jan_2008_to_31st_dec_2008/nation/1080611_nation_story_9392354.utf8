	Patna, June 10: The Left-sponsored 12-hour Bihar bandh in protest against the recent price hike of petrol, diesel and LPG today evoked mixed response.        
	The most affected were road and rail services. No untoward incident, however, was reported.         
	The traffic on Patna roads remained normal. Though a section of autorickshaw drivers preferred to stay off the streets in the first-half of the day, autorickshaw and bus services were back to normal in the afternoon.        
	The CPI, CPM, CPI-ML, Forward Bloc and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Krantikari Vichar Manch had called todays bandh.         
	Activists of the Left parties squatted on dharnas on the railway tracks at Biharsharif and also stopped the Delhi-bound Shramjivi Express for about half-an-hour.         
	The protesters also stopped Mithila Express near Mehsin Motihari (East Champaran) for about 40 minutes, but the train started its journey after the police intervened. A senior police officer said that all police stations across the state had been alerted to maintain law and order. Security was tightened at the Patna airport and railway stations. The Left parties said they wanted the Centre to rollback fuel prices. Several non-political organisations, including Bihar Industries Association and the Automobile Association of Eastern India, supported the Left parties demand of the price rollback.

	Cuttack, April 21: A firework competition to mark the annual Dandajatara ritual sparked tragedy yesterday night near a temple at Salipur, as 14 persons were injured in a series of explosions.         
	Of the 14, nine suffered severe burns and are battling for lives in the burn ward of the surgery department of SCB Medical College Hospital here.         
	The mishap occurred around midnight at Kentala Malipur under Salipur police station area, 40km from here. Nearly 1,000 people had gathered at the temple carnival grounds to watch the fireworks show. More than 40 people were competing in the event. During the meet, a burning chakri landed on one of the makeshift cracker shops, triggering a series of explosions involving all the shops, the Salipur police station in charge, P.K. Jena, told The Telegraph. Jena said the cracker sale and meet were being conducted without any licence. He added that a case would be registered against the temples trustee board.         
	Nine people have sustained 100 per cent injuries with third-degree burns. Their condition is serious, said Jayanta Biswal of the burn ward of the surgery department.         
	Three others have sustained over 80 per cent injuries but second degree burns, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Mahanga MLA Bikram Kersari Berma, Kisanagar MLA Pratap Jena and Kendrapada MLA Atanu Sabyasachi visited the hospital.        
	The injured include Sushanta Mallik (12), Chandan Mallik (12), Bapi Mallik (13), Balaram Das (21), Panchanan Mallik (30), Kartik Patra (42), Niranjan Jena (45), Nimai Charan Swain (45), Sarat Behera (45), Ajay Kumar Das (46) and Kulamani Sahu (49).

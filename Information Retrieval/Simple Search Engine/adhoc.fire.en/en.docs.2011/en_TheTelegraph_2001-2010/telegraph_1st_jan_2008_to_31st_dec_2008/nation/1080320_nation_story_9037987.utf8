                                                                                                               Veggie clue to rebel hideout
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Red under threat                                  
	Raipur, March 19: Vegetables and strict vigilance led security forces to a Maoist hideout in Pamed, where the red army had to bear one of the biggest casualties in an encounter yesterday morning.         
	Though the territory was in Chhattisgarh, the intelligence team of Andhra Pradeshs elite Greyhound Force was at work there. It had sent its informers to interior areas to collect inputs about Maoist movement in forests.         
	On Monday afternoon the informers spotted two rebels in Pamed weekly market, where they had come to purchase vegetables for the camp, said a top officer of the intelligence wing.         
	The informers followed the Maoists and succeeded in spotting the hideout and draw its map. They returned to Pamed and passed the information on to the Greyhound team, which chalked out a joint plan with Chhattisgarh police before storming the area early Tuesday morning.         
	The operation was meticulously planned and rebels were left with little room to retaliate or escape from the spot. This is reported to be the biggest loss suffered by the Maoists at a go in the country.         
	In 1992, 14 Maoists were killed in the Pagideru encounter in Khammam district (Andhra Pradesh) while the red army had lost 17 of its cadre in 2001 in the Mukhnoor encounter in Warangal.         
	The Tuesdays operation was the second major action executed in Chhattisgarh based on the intelligence tip-off collected by the Andhra Pradesh police.        
	Earlier, in January 2006, a Andhra Pradesh police team had picked up Maoist top gun and the member of central committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), Narayan Sanyal, from Raipur based on an intelligence input it had received.

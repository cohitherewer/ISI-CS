     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
             The INS Sindhughosh
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: An Indian submarine managed to sail into a Mumbai port after being hit by a cargo ship off the coast of Gujarat on January 7, but the collision has rung alarm bells in the navy that has begun an investigation. 
    
	The INS Sindhughosh, a kilo-class submarine procured from Russia in 1986, was refitted last year and is one of the navys most modern machines. There are 10 submarines of the same class  the Sindhughosh being the first  in the Indian Navys fleet. 
    
	A naval headquarters source said the submarines fin attached to the conning tower, a radar antenna and the periscope were probably damaged. But it is important to note that she made it to port on her own steam and, therefore, we have reason to believe she is seaworthy, the officer said. 
    
	This is the second time in less than two years that an Indian naval vessel was involved in a mid-sea collision. In April 2006, the missile corvette INS Prahar sank off the coast of Goa after it hit a merchant ship, the Rajiv Gandhi, run by the Shipping Corporation of India. The 73 crew members were rescued but the ship has not yet been salvaged. 
    
	An investigation by the navy had revealed that the bridge of the corvette was not manned during the night-time sail from Goa.

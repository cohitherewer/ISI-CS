	New Delhi, Sept. 16: India has accepted Nepals long-standing demand to review a 58-year-old treaty, agreeing in principle to revise it to reflect todays realities.        
	Sources said Delhis readiness to review and update the 1950 Trade and Transit Treaty was conveyed to the visiting Nepal Prime Minister Prachanda.        
	Nepal claims the treaty is unfavourable to it. Prachanda, on his maiden visit, has been pressing for a new treaty on the ground that the old one is not in tune with the times.        
	We hope to do that (review and update the treaty), foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said.        
	He said the Prime Minister had accepted Prachandas invite to visit Nepal.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

       
	Heli-shuttle to ferry high-fliers
  
	Hyderabads IT czars can soon opt for a helicopter to beat commuting woes as the connecting expressway wont be ready by the time a new airport opens in March.
  
	Deccans heli-shuttle, as it is called, will be the first such service in India that will cater to the business elite.
  
	The Andhra Pradesh government is in the final stage of clearing the service, which will ferry fliers from the international airport at Shamshabad, a 60-minute drive from the city centre. A helicopter will cover the distance in 15 minutes. The service to HITEC City, the software hub, will take less than 10 minutes. It takes 30 minutes by car.
  
	G.R. Gopinath, Deccans executive chairman, held talks on the launch with chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy earlier this week. We intend to start the heli-shuttle service as soon as the new international airport is inaugurated. We are working on the logistics now, Gopinath said.
  
	The chopper will have room for six, besides the pilot. We will increase the number of helicopters to two later, Gopinath said. 
    
	SC eye on Yamuna clean-up
  
	The Yamuna clean-up plan is under the Supreme Courts gaze.
  
	The court pulled up the Delhi government and the Delhi Jal Board for making contradictory claims on the deadline for the completion of the project. 
  
	Both were asked to specify if the river would be cleaned before the 2010 Commonwealth Games or by 2012.
  
	The government has come out with advertisements saying it will be completed before the Games but affidavits filed by the board have said it will be over only by January 2012.
  
	Ranjit Kumar, the legal officer assisting the court in the case for the past 14 years, accused the government of misleading people with the contradictory statements. 
  
	CM amp; son on calendar
 
	A new calendar is vying for Chennai eyeballs at a time when beaches and beauties splashed across glossier sheets are keeping many riveted.
  
	The wall calendar is not peppered with images of Goa or Ooty (the picturesque Tamil Nadu hill resort) but carries more down-to-earth pictures of de-silted ponds, bathing ghats and sports grounds  which are part of an ambitious rural plan launched by the ruling DMK-led coalition.
  
	A lot of thought and imagination has gone into the calendar. The layout is smart and the colours are pleasing. A professional photographer was hired to capture the images of how the states villages were changing.
  
	It is not easy to fight the feeling that the calendar is nothing but a way to tell people that the plan, Anaithu Grama Anna Marumalarchi Thittam, is a success. 
  
	Not when the man in charge of the scheme is M.K. Stalin, chief minister M. Karunanidhis son and the minister in charge of rural development. The pictures of the beaming father-son duo do not suggest that it is a piece of art.
    
	Ration whip
 
	The government is cracking the whip on the capitals unscrupulous PDS dealers, an action similar to the one in Bengal where hoarding sparked ration riots last year.
  
	The licences of three dealers were cancelled for not selling the foodgrain in specified quantities and keeping their shops closed during the specified working hours. The owners who got the stick were in the Karol Bagh area. 
  
	ore such raids are planned to address complaints of irregularities in the system, an official said.

The venue: Little Theatre Group Auditorium on Copernicus Marg. Time: 6.30pm. Tickets cost Rs 300, Rs 200, Rs 150 and Rs 100.

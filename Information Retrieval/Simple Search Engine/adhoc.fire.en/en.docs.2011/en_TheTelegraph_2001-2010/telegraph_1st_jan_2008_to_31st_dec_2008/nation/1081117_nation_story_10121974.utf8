	Unearthed: citys new proof of age      
	Hyderabad has a new set of age proofs to contend with.    
	Excavations near the city by the state archaeology department and recently unearthed devices dating back to the New Stone Age as well as the Iron Age. The history of Hyderabad goes back to the Neolithic Age, said P. Chenna Reddy, the director of archaeology and the one who headed the teams that carried out the excavations.    
	The site is close to Ramoji Film City, on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada national highway. Some New Stone Age implements were also recovered from a nearby village.    
	The discoveries could question the notion held by some historians that Hyderabad was around 400 years old.     
	Some artefacts, including iron implements, human bones and pottery, have been discovered in Hyderabad, Secunderabad and nearby areas in the past but the archaeologists decided to dig again at the sites for new finds.    
	A bigger task is to protect these places. We will continue excavations but have to protect the sites before the real estate erases their history, Reddy said.        
	Ripples in lake conservation               
	In the pipeline: a plan to take care of the lakes that keep Mumbai taps running.    
	A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) committee recently cleared a proposal aimed at conserving the catchment areas of Tansa and Modak Sagar lakes.    
	The project will be completed within five years and will cost around Rs 5.2 crore, Ravindra Waikar, chairman of the BMC standing committee, said. The panel has also decided to seek assistance from the Centre for the plan.    
	The conservation of the area around the lakes will prevent soil erosion from their catchment areas, said P.M. Guhe, a hydraulic engineer with the civic body.    
	The project will be carried out over an area of 9,000 hectares for Tansa lake and 3,000 hectares for Modak Sagar. The forest department had also recommended such steps. (PTI)    
	Two years to high street              
	Two years from now, Delhiites can hit the high road and take in the sight below.    
	The ground has been cleared for the first elevated road in the capital to come up in 2010. Part of the showpiece projects lined up for the Commonwealth Games that year, the lane will act as a corridor for movement of the 10,000 players and ease traffic to the citys east.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit laid the foundation of the road, from Sarai Kale Khan to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and passing over Barapullah Nallah, and said it would be ready within 18 months at an estimated cost of Rs 498 crore.    
	The 3.7km elevated road, with three lanes, will cut through the crossings on Ring Road, Nizamuddin railway tracks, Mathura Road and Lala Lajpat Rai Marg.     
	It (the road) is the countrys first project involving construction of seven long-span cantilever bridges within a small stretch of 4km. It will provide a birds eye view of heritage monuments in Nizamuddin, the chief minister said. (PTI).        
	Outbreak twist              
	Delhis dengue busters have a shock and salve.    
	They have said the outbreak could rise for sometime but would come down in a couple of weeks. In all, 478 cases have been officially reported this season, according to the MCD.    
	The indications of fewer cases in the days ahead came from N.K. Yadav, the civic bodys chief health officer. The number of dengue cases has stabilised and is not likely to see a sharp rise two to three weeks from now. (UNI)

Patnaik discusses security concerns with top police officers. Pictures by Sanjib Mukherjee       Bhubaneswar, Feb. 18: The Opposition today stalled the proceedings of Orissa Assembly demanding a special discussion on the recent Maoist attack in Nayagarh district.   They also sought resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik for his government rsquo;s ldquo;failure to contain the rebel menace and protect the life and property of people rdquo;.  Angry Opposition members stormed the Well of the House and shouted slogans against the chief minister and his government, forcing adjournment till 3 pm.   Finally, they staged an angry walkout at 4.50pm after the government did not agree for special discussion on the matter at the ldquo;present juncture rdquo;. The chief minister read out a statement on the matter after the Opposition walked out, though.  As soon as the House met this morning, Leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik said the Friday rsquo;s Maoist attack being an important issue involving the life and security of people, a special discussion on it should be taken up forthwith suspending the Question Hour and other businesses.  Parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty opposed Patnaik saying there was no justification for suspension of Question Hour.  ldquo;We are prepared for the discussion, but whether it will be taken up today or not will be decided at the meeting of Business Advisory Committee, rdquo; he said.  Speaker Maheswar Mohanty then proceeded with the Question Hour business and called finance minister Prafulla Ghadei to reply to questions.   Enraged over the Speaker rsquo;s move, angry Oppo  sition members trooped into the Well and tried to disrupt the proceedings by shouting slogans, standing on the reporters rsquo; table and snatching the pen stand from the Speaker rsquo;s table.  Finding it difficult to run the proceedings, the Speaker adjourned the House till 12.30 pm and then till 3 pm.  When the House reassembled, the Leader of Opposition pressed for his demand for special discussion.   He was supported by several Opposition members stressing its urgency.   However, the treasury members, including the parliamentary affairs minister, argued that if the discussion was taken up today, it would affect the ongoing combing operation and demoralise the police. The Speaker requested the Opposition members not to press for discussion at this juncture.   He also said that the chief minister would make a statement today and apprise the House from time to time about the developments.  Angry over the Speaker rsquo;s stand, the Opposition members walked out of the House in protest.

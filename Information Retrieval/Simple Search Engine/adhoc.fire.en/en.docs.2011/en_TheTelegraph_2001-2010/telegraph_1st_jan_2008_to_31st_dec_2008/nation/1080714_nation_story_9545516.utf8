	Bhubaneswar, July 13: Nine days after six devotees lost their lives and 15 others were injured at the Puri rath yatra, a devotee from Bengal died this afternoon near the chariots parked in front of the Jagannath Temple.        
	The deceased was identified as Ranjit Singh alias Rana (40), a resident of Kulti College Square in Burdwan, Bengal.         
	Initially it was believed that Rana died in a stampede. However, inspector-general of police (law and order) Pradeep Kapur, who is camping in Puri, told The Telegraph that the death was not due to any stampede.         
	The deceased suffered from chronic asthma. He apparently died of suffocation. However, the exact cause can be known after the post-mortem reports are out, said Puri chief district medical officer Trilochan Baral.         
	Quoting the relatives of the deceased, Baral said Ranjit was treated by a medicine specialist in Bhubaneswar three days ago.         
	Puri police superintendent Asit Panigrahi, who was present near the spot, denied that there was any stampede today, though there was a huge rush of devotees.         
	More than eight lakh devotees had assembled in the pilgrim town to witness the special ritual called suna besha. The lords and the goddess are adorned with gold ornaments on the occasion.         
	There is a belief that devotees achieve salvation if they catch a glimpse of the gods on this day. The three were before the public view today after they returned from their stay in Mausima temple, 3km from the Jagannath Temple in Puri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Street play on Indian romance
                                                                                                               Street play on Indian romance
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: On the eve of Valentines Day, a group of young volunteers set out to spread the message of true love and sacrifice, Indian style.        
	Six bikes carrying placards sped through the city streets for more than an hour today before coming to a screeching halt before RD Womens College. Minutes later the actors set up stage to enact Imported Love, a street play. We have selected this college as there are many young women here who may be swayed by the influence of western notions of love, said Kalindi Nayak, one of the actors. The play comprised two stories - a traditional one where protagonist Devdas proposes to his ladylove, who rejects him for the sake of her family and the modern one about a college girl, who does not believe in the idea of fidelity.         
	India has its own collection of love stories. Instead of celebrating western romances, we can celebrate Heer Ranjha and Laila Majnu and their love stories, said Prahlad Nayak, the play promoter.

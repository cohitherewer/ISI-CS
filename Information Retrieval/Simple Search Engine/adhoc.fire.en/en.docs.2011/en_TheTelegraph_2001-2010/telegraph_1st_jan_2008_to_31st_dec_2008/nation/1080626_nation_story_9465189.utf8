	Srinagar, June 25: The violence against the land allotment to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board, which spread to more districts in Kashmir and claimed two lives today, forced the state government to temporarily ban all construction on the land.         
	The PDP, whose forest minister had cleared the land transfer, threatened to pull out of the coalition government with the Congress if the allotment was not revoked on a day N.N. Vohra took oath as new governor.         
	Farooq Ahmad Rather, a resident of Mazhama in Budgam district, was killed when forces opened fire on protesters. Another youth, Sameer Ahmed, was killed in Srinagar.        
	The government banned any construction on the land till an all-party consensus is reached.

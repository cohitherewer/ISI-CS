          SANJAY K. JHA                           Rice                                  
	New Delhi, July 10: The BJPs dilemma over pulling down the government on the Indo-US nuclear agreement has prompted a section of party leaders to look for hidden persuaders who are working overtime to protect the deal.         
	Apart from the names of some important BJP leaders, ideologues and former ministers, the list of pro-deal suspects includes even senior RSS leaders.        
	Sources said Ved Nanda, a professor with the University of Denver in the US and a Sangh parivar member, has succeeded in convincing many senior RSS leaders on the necessity of the deal. They said the recent foreign tours of some RSS and BJP leaders are being viewed in this light.        
	Nanda entered the RSS through the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and gained prominence by launching the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS) in the US in 1989. But the most striking feature, RSS sources claimed, is that he is close to US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.        
	Apart from being an influential Hindu protagonist, Nanda is also known in RSS circles as Rices teacher. Rice went to study at the University of Denver and Nanda teaches at the John Evans School of Law at the university, where her father was also employed.        
	Nanda has been coming to India to attend conferences organised by the RSS. Nanda has a close association with top RSS leaders like Mohan Bhagwat, Madandas Devi, S. Gurumurthy and Ram Madhav, a source said, claiming that the professor had been pushing for the nuclear deal from the very beginning.        
	The pro-deal section of the parivar believes that the BJP has become a prisoner of dogmatism and now many leaders are feeling suffocated because of the partys strident opposition to the nuclear deal.        
	Another source said: When L.K. Advani attempted a course correction, he had the blessings of some RSS leaders and a large section of younger BJP leaders and a few apolitical Right-wing ideologues. But RSS chief Sudarshan and a section of the BJP stood firm. The pro-deal leaders also yielded because the government had not done enough to take the Opposition on board. Otherwise, the BJP would have taken a different position.        
	Many BJP leaders conceded in private that the American lobby was still active and the leadership resisted immense pressure to alter its stand.        
	Now that the deal is almost done, the pro-US camp in the Sangh parivar is not very upset.

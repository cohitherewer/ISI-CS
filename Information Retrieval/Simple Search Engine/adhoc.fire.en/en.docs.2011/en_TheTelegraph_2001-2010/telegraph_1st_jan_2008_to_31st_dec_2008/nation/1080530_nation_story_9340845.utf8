                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi says no to CBI probe 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 29: The Union home minister today said there was no need for a CBI probe into the Noida murders, hours after the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said she would ask for one.         
	There is no scope for politics or to my knowledge any scope for CBI investigation, junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said.        
	Mayavati had accused the Congress of playing politics, after Union women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury threatened legal action against a senior state police officer for maligning schoolgirl Aarushi Talwar whose body was found at home on May 16. The Talwars servant Hemraj was also found murdered.        
	Aarushis father Rajesh Talwar has been named prime accused in the murders and is now in police custody. His family claims he is innocent and has demanded a CBI probe.        
	If the CBI does not take up the case, the state police would would ensure that the guilty are brought to book and that no innocent person is punished, Mayavati said.         
	The police had evidence and this was presented in court, she added.         
	The police today submitted several documents in court, including a copy of an email Aarushi sent her father in which she sounds apologetic about something, and sought permission for a narco test, a lie detector test and brain mapping on Talwar.         
	Viscera reports of Aarushi and Hemraj have confirmed that no chemicals were found in their bodies, sources said.        
	Chowdhury said she had reacted as a mother.

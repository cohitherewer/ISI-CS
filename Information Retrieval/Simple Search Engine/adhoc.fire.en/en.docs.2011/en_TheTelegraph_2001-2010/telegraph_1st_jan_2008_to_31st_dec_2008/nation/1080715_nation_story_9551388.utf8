	Cop to catch cops without helmets    
	A thief to catch a thief. In Mumbai, it takes a cop to catch a cop.    
	The police have turned the tables on several of their own men who havent got the helmet rule into their heads. In the special drive, 126 men in uniform, cutting across ranks, were fined Rs 100 each for violating the rule that makes it compulsory for riders to wear the protective headgear.    
	But a senior officer in charge of enforcing the rarely followed rule insisted the crackdown on policemen didnt mean the traffic custodians were playing to the gallery. We wanted to set our own house in order. The rules are for all and no one flouting them will be spared, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Harish Baijal.    
	The officer said the drive, which got off the blocks last month, had drawn criticism from people questioning why the policemen were being exempted. There have been heated arguments on several occasions with two-wheeler riders who were booked, Baijal said. In all, 37,477 offenders were booked till last week.        
	Court trouble for mall    
	A real estate Goliaths planned mall is on shaky legal ground.    
	Madras High Court recently stayed the construction of the DLF plaza and ordered all temporary structures to be removed from the site in the bustling Ethiraj Salai area.    
	The public interest plea claimed the structure would cause hardship to residents already suffering congestion. Justices A.K. Ganguly and Ibrahim Kallifulah set the firm a short deadline to dismantle the temporary structures.    
	The court said the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, a government body, would be asked to carry out the removals if the company failed to act on its own.    
	Earlier, the member-secretary of the authority appeared in the court after it was asked to do so by the judges since the matter concerned the growth of Chennai and the way in which the goal should be achieved.    
	Towering threats    
	Mobile towers are known health hazards but the Delhi government would like the civic authorities to take a call.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit said recently it was the responsibility of the municipalities to remove the towers, which cause radiation, from residential areas. It is the responsibility of the municipalities (MCD) to remove the structures from the localities inhabited by people, she said.    
	The chief minister asserted that such towers were not safe for health and were a threat to the environment but insisted the MCD would have to take action. We have raised our concern. It is the MCDs job to remove them.    
	Dikshits words came days after the Delhi pollution committee issued notices to the mobile phone companies that had such towers in areas teeming with people. The firms were asked to specify the steps they had taken to ensure the safety of the people living in these zones. The towers are often erected on top of houses and apartments in return for payments to the occupants.

	Admission bias    
	Mumbai college admissions have slipped into uncharted legal waters amid complaints the entry rules are loaded against students from non-Maharashtra boards.     
	Some parents of students who had taken the ICSE and CBSE exams filed a public interest plea in Bombay High Court recently, saying the selections based on percentile marks, introduced by the Maharashtra government this year, discriminated against these pupils.     
	hey have claimed that the new system favours those who have passed the state SSC (Class X) exams.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, May 8: Sabeel Ahmed, the Indian doctor convicted in the Glasgow terror attack case, was deported to hometown Bangalore early today.         
	Anand P.I., a passenger on the British Airways London-Bangalore flight, said Sabeel was sitting in the economy class between two British policemen. He was not handcuffed but was sandwiched between the two. He did not speak much. He was escorted to the toilet only once during the nine-hour flight. The three were also the first ones to exit the aircraft when it landed at 3.30am, Anand said.        
	At Bangalore airport, the officers handed him over to the local police.         
	The police escorted Sabeel and his mother Zakia Ahmed, who came to receive him at the airport, out of the departure terminal of HAL airport.         
	Later, outside their house in Banashankari, Zakia pleaded with the media to leave. Sabeel is taking rest. He will not speak to the media, she said.

          JOHN MARY                          Jose                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, July 21: Ask former Kerala Assembly Speaker A.C. Jose what a Speaker should do if a Lok Sabha vote is tied and he will say vote for the government.        
	Thats what he did seven times when the K. Karunakaran ministry was on the brink in 1982, with 70 MLAs each on the government and Opposition sides.        
	Had Jose placed his casting vote against the Congress-led government on any of the seven finance bills, it would have been curtains for the fledgling ministry.        
	The Karunakaran ministry was the offshoot of a dramatic withdrawal of support to E.K. Nayanars CPM-led ministry in 1981 by the Congress breakaway faction of A.K. Antony and the Kerala Congress (M).        
	The Antony group returned to the Congress, paving the way for a new ministry under Karunakaran on December 28, 1981. Jose was elected Speaker in March 1982.        
	The Karunakaran ministry fell after two-and-a-half months when a legislator defected. It brought great relief to Jose, who virtually had no time to breathe when the House was in session. The CPM-led Opposition, finding itself defeated every time it pressed for a division in the House, had nicknamed Jose the casting Speaker.        
	I could not have voted differently. The Speaker does not vote at the first instance. But in the case of a tie, the Speaker has to cast his vote and ensure the smooth conduct of business for the government. This has been the British tradition (a Speaker voting in favour of the government). I did not break it, Jose said.        
	On Tuesday, Somnath Chatterjee may have to cast his vote if theres a tie, though the government, which is banking on abstentions from the Opposition, hopes a casting vote will not be needed.        
	Although the Speaker has to be non-partisan in both India and the UK, there are subtle differences. A British MP has to resign from the party after being elected Speaker.        
	In Britain, the Speaker continues in office unopposed as long as he or she remains an MP. The Speaker is impartial in the Chair, withdraws from party meetings and does not debate party issues. Also, the Speaker is not opposed at the general election. These practices are regarded as fundamental to the maintenance of the Speakers independence.        
	Former British Speaker George Thomas wrote: For the past two centuries the House has expected the Speaker to abandon all party loyalties and to be outside the battle in the Chamber. If he is to bring complete impartiality and fairness to his work, this requirement is an absolute necessity.        
	He added: Our democracy owes more than words can say to the clash of ideas and the rough and tumble of party political debate, but it also owes an enormous amount to the fact that the Speaker is completely impartial in the political controversies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Democracy begins young for Rahul
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Democracy begins young for Rahul
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Rahul Gandhi today ordered elections in the Youth Congress and the NSUI, eight months after asserting that he believed in democracy by instinct and education.        
	The exercise will be the first in the Youth Congresss 58-year history and in 27 years for the National Students Union of India. As a Congress general secretary, Rahul oversees both.        
	A fellow general secretary dubbed the move a reflection of Rahuls vision of a new Congress, saying it was aimed at loosening the iron-like structures of the two bodies to ensure vested interests didnt kill democracy.        
	Office-bearers from block to national levels will be elected directly by the members through a process Rahul hoped would eliminate foul play and nepotism.        
	In a presentation on prototypes of his ideal youth and student organisations made before party general secretaries today, Rahul said aspirants shouldnt be given the four-day campaign time the Congress allowed in its poll rules.         
	Instead, all formalities  nomination, gathering voters and polling  should be over the same day, Rahul said, adding that this would ensure nominees didnt unfairly canvass support. It would also help observers keep a close eye on them, Rahul said.         
	The first elections to the Youth Congress and the NSUI will be conducted in Punjab and Uttarakhand. Central representatives present at the polls will submit a report to iron out the glitches.        
	Rahul proposed raising battalions of aam aadmi sipahis, drawn from the two bodies, to monitor the Centres flagship schemes, especially in non-Congress ruled states.         
	It is meant to be a bridge between the organisation and people, a Congress leader said. Each panchayat is expected to contribute at least three sipahis. The target is to cover a third of each district.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: The Maharashtra government has appealed to eyewitnesses to furnish information to a committee probing whether police could have avoided shooting Rahul Raj.        
	The government said witnesses could give information or evidence so that the committee headed by chief secretary Johny Joseph could probe the matter fast. The witnesses have been requested to contact the personal secretary of Joseph, S.S. Kurdikar, on October 31 on 022-22028762 between 10am and 5pm.        
	The date, time and venue for submitting the information would be communicated later by officials, a government statement said.         
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and home minister R.R. Patil had announced the investigation minutes after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh phoned Deshmukh late on Monday night. Singhs call came after he met a group of Bihar politicians, including Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	The crime branch of Mumbai police will also conduct an internal inquiry that will be led by joint commissioner Rakesh Maria.        
	Uddhav warning        
	Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray today cautioned leaders from Bihar against adding fuel to fire by making statements about attacks on north Indians in Mumbai.        
	The Shiv Sena has been trying to match the rhetoric of Raj Thackeray in the wake of aggressive strides made by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena into what have been considered traditional strongholds of Bal Thackeray.        
	Reacting to railway minister Lalu Prasads demand that the Sena be banned, Uddhav branded the leaders the real culprits.         
	The Bihar leaders should ask themselves why people from their state have to migrate to Mumbai to make a living, he said. I would advise Lalu Prasad not to meddle in Maharashtras affairs.... The Bihar leaders should be sensible. Dont add fuel to fire.

	New York, Dec. 6 (PTI): An Indian-origin man from Kerala accused of killing his estranged wife in a New Jersey church has a slim chance of being freed temporarily as a judge more than doubled his bail amount to $5 million.        
	Joseph Mathai Pallipurath, 27, a resident of California, appeared calm when he was produced before New Jersey state superior court assignment judge Donald Vokert Jr.        
	He pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder of his 24-year-old wife Reshma James and a man, one count of attempted murder of the womans cousin, one count of unlawful possession of arms and one count of possession of arms for unlawful purposes.        
	But the judge agreed to the request of the prosecutor to increase the bail amount from $2 million to $5 million.        
	Passaic county chief assistant prosecutor John Latoracca argued that the defendant was a high flight risk as he had no relations in or ties with New Jersey and had relations in California and India.

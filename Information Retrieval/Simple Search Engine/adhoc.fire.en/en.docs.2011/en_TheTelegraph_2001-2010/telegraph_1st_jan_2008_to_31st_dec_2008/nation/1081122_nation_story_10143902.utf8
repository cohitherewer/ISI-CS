          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 21: The state cabinet gave its nod to a draft bill today to prevent violence against on-duty doctors and other medical personnel.        
	If any person attacks doctors or paramedical staff on duty or damages property of any public health care institution, he or she will land himself in jail, according to the draft bill tabled today at the cabinet meeting.        
	The offender would be put behind bars for three years and have to pay a hefty fine, up to Rs 50,000, as per provisions of the special legislation drawn in the lines of a similar law in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.        
	Earlier, the act of violence against doctors or paramedics was being dealt as per the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code. But now, the state will have the special legislation to prevent violence against medicare service personnel and damage to property of public health institutions, which have been very frequent nowadays.        
	A bill will be tabled in the Assembly during its ensuing session starting next week, said health minister Sanatan Bisi.        
	We have made the offence cognisable and non-bailable with very stringent penal provisions, said Bisi.        
	The accused would have to undergo the process of trial in court and finally face the sentence of three-year rigorous imprisonment along with a fine up to Rs 50,000, if convicted, said an official of the law department.        
	The cost  to be determined by the court  towards damage caused to public property would also be recovered from the culprit. But it will not be less than the purchase price of any equipment or cost of any property, he added.         
	The ambit of the enactment has been made broad-based covering all registered medical practitioners, nurses and other paramedical staff and even medical and nursing students.         
	Frequent mob attacks on government doctors on duty at several places across the state on the allegation of negligence on duty had been a matter of concern for both doctors and the state government. A couple of months ago, government doctors had gone on a days strike in protest against attack on Niranjan Nayak of Shergarh primary health centre in Ganjam district. In April, a senior professor of VSS Medical College amp; Hospital at Burla was seriously injured in a mob attack.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 31: The CPMs eagerness to expand its base in north India seems to have kept Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty out of the central committee.        
	The two-day central committee meeting, which ended in the capital yesterday, chose MLA Amra Ram, a member of the Rajasthan state secretariat, to fill up one seat left vacant at the Coimbatore party congress.         
	CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu had earlier favoured Chakrabortys entry into the central committee, an opinion he later said he shouldnt have voiced in public.         
	Two more party leaders from north India have found a place in the committee as invitees. They are the secretary of the Chhattisgarh state committee, M.K. Nandi, and the secretary of the Uttarakhand state committee, Vijai Rawat.         
	The central committee also elected a seven-member secretariat led by party general secretary Prakash Karat.         
	It picked Jogendra Sharma from Delhi and A. Vijayaraghavan from Kerala as new members.

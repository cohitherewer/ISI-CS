          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A congested road in Cuttack. Picture by Badrika Nath Das                                  
	Cuttack, Aug. 8: A high court diktat on traffic problems aimed at decongesting roads in the city has failed to make any difference.        
	The police administration found itself in a quandary during implementation of the court order due to public resentment over lack of parking spots at different places.        
	The police have missed the August 7 deadline set by the high court to bring the citys road congestion under control. The high court was infuriated when it found that several thoroughfares in Cuttack came to a standstill during the day due to traffic congestion aggravated by encroachments and undisciplined parking.        
	Faced with a two-week deadline, Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Praveen Kumar had launched a drive against illegal parking on July 25. At least two sections of armed police force were deployed along with four senior police officers to monitor the operations.        
	But public resentment marred the drive by the police at different places. Tension gripped certain areas when people of the locality gathered in hundreds and opposed the measures against illegal parking.        
	The drive by the police is unreasonable as there are not many parking places available for the public, said CPM leader Subhash Singh.        
	Senior police officers admitted that the city had only 14 parking spots against a requirement of at least 50.        
	Railway plea        
	Perturbed over frequent railway blockades, East Coast Railway has appealed to people to exercise restraint since such protests cause a huge loss of national revenue as well as immense suffering to passengers, especially to senior citizens and patients.        
	There is an urgent need for all-round resolve to curb such incidents and strong action by law and order agencies, said East Coast Railway general manager A.K. Goyal.        
	The blockades are avoidable and yield no practical result for the agitators but passengers suffer a lot. Besides, there is a huge loss of national revenue since trains carrying coal and other minerals are also held up, said Goyal.

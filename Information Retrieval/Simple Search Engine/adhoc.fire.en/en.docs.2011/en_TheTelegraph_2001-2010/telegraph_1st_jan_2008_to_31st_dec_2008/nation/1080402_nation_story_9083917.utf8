          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 1: Official work in Patna High Court and lower courts across Bihar remained paralysed for the second consecutive day today with 80,000 lawyers still striking to protest against the steep hike in Bihars court fees.        
	The convener of the co-ordination committee of the lawyers association, Yogesh Chandra Verma, said their committee would sit for a meeting tomorrow to decide its future course of action. Co-ordination committees, comprising lawyers and district Bar members, of the Patna High Court has called a three-day lawyers ceasework which has evoked a near total response in courts across the state.         
	However, lawyers, so far, have restrained from naming their move as a strike.

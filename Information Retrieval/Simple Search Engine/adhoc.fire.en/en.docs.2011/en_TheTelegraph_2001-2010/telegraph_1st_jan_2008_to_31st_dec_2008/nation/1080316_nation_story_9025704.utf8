          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 15: CPI chief A.B. Bardhan has created confusion on the Lefts nuke strategy by saying that the government could begin talks with the Nuclear Suppliers Group as long as it didnt accept the Hyde Act and the 123 Agreement.        
	Top CPM sources, however, said there was no change in the Lefts stand on the nuclear deal and that the bloc would withdraw support if the Congress-led Centre ignored its opposition and went ahead with the NSG talks.        
	The sources also maintained that the NSG talks could not be delinked from the 123 Agreement.        
	The bilateral agreement lays down the nuts and bolts of the civilian nuclear deal, while the Hyde Act, a domestic US law, imposes conditions on nuclear co-operation between Washington and New Delhi.        
	In an interview telecast today, Bardhan indicated that even if the Left withdrew support to the UPA government, it would not bring the coalition down. But the CPI general secretary evaded a direct reply when asked if the Left would move a no-confidence motion if the government went ahead with the deal. That we will think at that time, he said.        
	Asked whether the Left would support a motion moved by the BJP, he said: I dont think anything of that sort will happen. If the government is reduced to a minority, I think it will dissolve the House.        
	Bardhan, the first Left leader to have hinted that the government could go ahead with safeguard talks with atomic watchdog IAEA provided it got back to the UPA-Left panel before initialling an agreement, said the Congress-led regime might dissolve Parliament and become a caretaker.        
	In fact, (US assistant secretary of state Richard) Boucher has suggested that to the government, he said.

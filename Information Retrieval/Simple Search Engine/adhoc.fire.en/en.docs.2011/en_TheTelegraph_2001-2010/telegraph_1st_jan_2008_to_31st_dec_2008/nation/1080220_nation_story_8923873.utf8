The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hospital claims frozen-baby milestone
                                                                                                               Hospital claims frozen-baby milestone

	Chennai, Feb. 19: A hospital here today claimed it was the first in India to get a woman pregnant by freezing and thawing human eggs, two decades after an Australian doctor had pioneered the technique.        
	The Fertility Research Centre (FRC) at the private GG Hospital in Chennai has used the procedure to enable a 28-year-old woman, VR (identity withheld), to look forward to motherhood despite a history of medical complications that had prevented pregnancy.        
	VR is now in her seventh week of pregnancy, achieved after doctors implanted a donor egg that had undergone a freeze-and-thaw process into her uterus. Foetal screening tests are yet to be done, but the pregnancy is going well for her, doctors claimed.        
	Dr Priya Selvaraj, who led the medical team, said this technique is relatively new, though freezing of sperms is over a century old.         
	The woman had a bad obstetric history, with a foetal loss and three abortions, Selvaraj said. So, there was no way she could give birth to a child the normal way.         
	The oocyte (female egg) was harvested from a lady donor whose other main parameters, like blood group, were compatible with that of the recipient, she said. Unfertilised oocytes can be stored in a bank from five years to 20 years and fertilised whenever the womans cycle permits it later.         
	GG Hospital has been trying out this technique since 2005, but has made a breakthrough only now, said Selvarajs mother Kamala, who was also part of the team.        
	Other Indian research centres, too, have been working on the technique. Many centres in India have been freezing and thawing oocytes for the past few months. If Kamala has helped a woman become pregnant through this technique, its a proud moment for all of us in India, said Firuza Parikh, head of assisted reproduction at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai.        
	Professor Christopher Chen of Adelaide had achieved the first oocyte freeze-and-thaw delivery in 1986. But the success rate of the pregnancy achieved through this procedure worldwide has been less than 2 per cent, Kamala said.         
	With inputs from G.S. Mudur in New Delhi

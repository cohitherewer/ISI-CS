	Patna, March 12: Haryana Government Railway Police (GRP) in collaboration with its Bihar counterpart would be providing Bihar families a chance to find missing kin.        
	GRP (Haryana) has approached its Bihar counterpart to hold a camp in Patna on March 14 and 15 where families can come for information regarding relatives who left for Haryana.         
	On their part Haryana police would try to identify railway accident victims found between April and July 2007.        
	Though Patna superintendent of police (railway) Ajitabh Kumar could not be contacted, a senior officer said a GRP team from Harynana with 12-odd personnel was expected arrive soon to hold an identification camp near the Patna railway station.         
	GRP deputy superintendent of police (Hissar) Randhir Singh would lead the team.        
	The Patna officer conceded that families from Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Purnea and Khagaria were likely to visit the camp. Over 24-odd people are expected to participate in the camp.         
	The Haryana GRP team, he added, would carry clothes, shoes, photographs and luggage recovered from accident victims.         
	The pictures of the dead would also be displayed on a small screen through a projector for identification.         
	The Haryana GRP felt the need to hold the identification camp in Bihar because most migrant labourers working in the brick kilns and factories are from Bihar.         
	The railway police would hold similar camps at Uttar Pradesh and Orissa.         
	Haryana Railway police have found 35 unclaimed bodies in 2002. The figure swelled to 45 in 2006 and 50 last year.

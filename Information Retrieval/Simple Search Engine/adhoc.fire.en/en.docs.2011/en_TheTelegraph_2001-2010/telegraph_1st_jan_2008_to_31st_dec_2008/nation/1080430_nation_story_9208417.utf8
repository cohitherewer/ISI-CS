The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani guns for PM, Sonia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani guns for PM, Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Singh, Advani                                  
	New Delhi, April 29: Lal Krishna Advani today taunted Sonia Gandhi using her familys name and described Manmohan Singhs cabinet as the most corrupt in Independent India.        
	It is instructive to recall today the infamous Mundhra scandal that rocked Pandit Jawaharlal Nehrus government in the late 1950s, he told the BJPs parliamentary party while speaking on the T.R. Baalu controversy.        
	It was none other than Feroze Gandhi  the least remembered member of the Nehru-Gandhi family and the one who lent the Gandhi name to the family  who made an explosive disclosure in Parliament about the Life Insurance Corporation putting in Rs 1.24 crore in industrialist Haridas Mundhras sinking companies without consulting Parliaments investment committee, he said.        
	The BJP has been demanding a clarification from Manmohan Singh on the PMOs alleged aid to Union minister Baalus private business interests. But Advani went a step further, dragging in the Congresss first family  especially Feroze Gandhi, whom the party is uncomfortable discussing because of his differences with Indira Gandhi and Nehru.        
	Feroze Gandhi, backed by the Opposition, forced Nehrus government to appoint a commission of inquiry, which was headed by Justice Mohammed Currim Chagla, Advani said, recalling that the probe held the then finance minister morally responsible and he resigned.        
	The BJP leader then condemned the silence of UPA chairperson Sonia and Prime Minister Singh on Baalu, saying it shows how much the Congress party and governments headed by it have departed from the standards of probity and accountability that prevailed in the early decades of Independence.         
	Manmohan Singhs personal integrity is beyond doubt, Advani said. But it is now equally beyond doubt that he is neither able, nor trying, to enforce probity in his government. It is now common knowledge that the UPA government is by far the most corrupt in Indias history.        
	Advani perhaps did not take into account the Tehelka and Coffingate scandals that rocked the last BJP-led government, of which he was home minister and then deputy Prime Minister. That cabinet had not waited for George Fernandes to be cleared of allegations of corruption before taking him back as defence minister.        
	Manmohan Singhs cabinet, by comparison, has been scandal-free so far.

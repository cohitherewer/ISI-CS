	Jaipur, Jan. 6: Pramod Karan Sethi, the orthopaedic surgeon famous for the Jaipur foot, died late on Saturday after a heart attack. He was 80. 
    
	He is survived by his wife, son and three daughters.
    
	Dr Sethi won the Ramon Magsaysay award in 1981 for the artificial limb that he co-invented with Ram Chander Sharma, a barely literate master artisan.
    
	Developed in 1968, the light and inexpensive Jaipur foot has revolutionised life for millions of amputees not only in India but also in Afghanistan, Rwanda and other war zones. Those who wear the foot can run, climb trees and cycle. 
    
	Although there remains a controversy over who should have been given the Magsaysay, Ram Chander, who parted ways with Dr Sethi in 1981, told The Telegraph: Name and awards are not everything. The fact that Dr Sethi and I met and could create the miracle Jaipur foot, which has made millions walk again, makes me happy.
    
	The artisan added: I am illiterate and could not have made the Jaipur foot world famous as it is today without the help of Dr Sethi.
    
	Dr D.R. Mehta, the man behind the Mahaveer Viklang Sahayta Samiti set up in 1975 that has fitted over three lakh patients with the Jaipur foot, said of Dr Sethi: He guided Ram Chander to realise the miraculous foot.
    
	The surgeon explained to the artisan about pressure points and the intricate movements of bones within the foot. The two fashioned limbs out of willow, sponges and aluminium moulds for two years but found success only when they used rubber and wood. 
    
	Dr Sethi was cremated today.

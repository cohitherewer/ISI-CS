	London, July 2 (PTI): A British teenager has been convicted for assaulting an NRI at a birthday party where a mob also yelled racist abuse at him.        
	A jury at Guildford Crown Court held 19-year-old Nicky Chequer guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to Sanjeev Subramanian, 40, at the party in Surrey on April 7 last year.         
	The party of one Cydney Chopping turned into a riot after her father made racially insulting comments in front of 150 guests, prosecutors said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          no more blocked highway?                                  
	Cuttack, Oct. 12: In its first-of-its-kind step, the Orissa government has decided to recover the cost towards damages because of road blockades from persons responsible for organising those.         
	Making a beginning, the Jajpur district administration decided to recover Rs 1 lakh from the Vistapan Virodhi Jana Manchs former secretary, Chakradhar Haiburu (jr), in connection with a road blockade at Ambagadia near Kalinganagar that continued for over a year from January 3, 2006.        
	The amount would be recovered as arrears towards land revenue under the Orissa Public Demand Recovery Act on the basis of a high court order, Kalinganagar additional district magistrate Ranjit Mohanty said today.        
	The certificate officer at the court of the sub-collector has already been requisitioned for the recovery process, he added.        
	Categorising road blockades as a breach of public order, the Orissa High Court had nearly a year ago asked the state government to make adequate provision of law for assessing the damage caused by such violence to public and private property and for realising the cost of such damages from the persons responsible for organising them.        
	The government could recover the cost towards damages because of road blockades by treating the estimated amount as arrears towards land revenue under the Orissa Public Demand Recovery Act, the court further said.        
	The high court had issued the set of directions on October 3, 2007, while directing the government to pay compensation of Rs 1 lakh to Chambara Soy of Gobarghati village near Kalinganagar for the death of his son during the blockade on April 22, 2006.        
	The blockade at Ambagadia near Kalinganagar on NH-200 was allegedly spearheaded by Chakradhar Haiburu (jr) as the secretary of the association. The blockade had continued for 14 months and was lifted on March 9, 2007, following a high court order.        
	The association was formed following the death of 14 tribals in police firing on January 2, 2006, when local tribals clashed with the police while opposing the construction of the boundary wall of a Tata Steel project. It has since been agitating against industrialisation in Kalinganagar. Tata Steel is trying to set up its 6MTPA steel project in Kalinganagar Industrial Complex.        
	According to an official estimate, at least 500 road blockades were staged between October 2005 and September 2006.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: A young man from Oman has been arrested in Goa at a time a state government note has acknowledged that its tourist spots, teeming with foreign visitors, could become an al Qaida target.        
	Ali Akbar, 27, was arrested yesterday for surfing suspicious Arabic websites and reading al Qaida-related content in a south Goa cyber caf and holding an expired visa, police sources said.        
	The arrest comes at a time the Mumbai terror attacks have left the Goa administration on tenterhooks just before the peak tourist season begins. Police have been on the trail of suspicious tourists, especially if they are coming from Mumbai. So far 10 foreigners have been picked up, but the focus has centred on the Bangladesh-born Ali, who has told the police he had moved to Oman and taken citizenship in 2001.        
	While interrogating him, officers realised his visa had expired and he had been overstaying his visit.        
	He came to Goa from Mumbai in the first week of December, just a day before his visa was to expire, deputy superintendent of police Umesh Gaonkar said from Goa.        
	Goa police have been on high alert since a note from state chief secretary J.P. Singh was circulated at a cabinet meeting held after the attacks on Mumbai. A top Goa official said the note had warned against a threat from al Qaidas network. Today, Goa faces serious threats from terrorists and there are specific inputs that al Qaida would target certain installations/targets in Goa, reads the December 2 note, signed by Singh.        
	It lists an extremely short-staffed police as one of the major worries. According to the note, a reserve battalion raised for contingencies was now being used for chores like traffic duties.        
	There is hardly any reserve force available in the state. There is no India Reserve Battalion staff left for deployment at the secretariat, Assembly complex, Raj Bhavan and vital installations, the note says.        
	According to the chief secretary, Goa police are so short-staffed that the governors security had to be sourced from the Central Industrial Security Force.        
	Even for minor law-and-order situations, elections as well as VVIP visits or cultural events, we have to call for outside forces or work with the available limited force by diverting staff from the districts as well as units, thereby severely affecting the working of the police department, the note says.        
	Still, Goa, which attracts nearly two million tourists a year, has raised security levels since the Mumbai attacks.        
	The police have arrested 243 illegal migrants staying without valid documents at a south Goa slum and tightened security along its coastline following intelligence warnings of possible terror attacks on Indias western coastline.        
	We have been conducting information-exchange sessions with trawler owners along the states 105km coastline to report any unusual movement of sea vessels. Trawler owners have been asked to ensure they carry their ID card every time they venture into the sea, Gaonkar said.

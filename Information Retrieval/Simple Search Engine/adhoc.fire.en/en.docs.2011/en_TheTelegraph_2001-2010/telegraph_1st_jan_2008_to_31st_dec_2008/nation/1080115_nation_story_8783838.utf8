     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
             A view of Palika Bazaar
                 
	Beijing, Jan. 14: Metaphors are like five rupees to the renminbi when it comes to describing trade relations between India and China  Chindia, a tango between the dragon and the elephant, Himalayan heights et al. 
    
	But probably the link between the two fastest growing economies of the world  as the International Herald Tribune called it today  is more like a tu-tu-main-main between Silk Street and Palika Bazaar. 
    
	Beijings Silk Street is where prices are low and can be beaten down even deeper with some easy bargaining. New Delhis Palika Bazaar in Connaught Place is the same. Both places offer a wide variety. The difference is that Palika has more Chinese goods on its shelves than Silk Street has Indian. 
    
	Which just about sums up the whole issue of the trade deficit that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, aided by commerce minister Kamal Nath, has been trying to address through this visit. They have brought along a delegation of businessmen and industrialists, each of whom, this morning at the India-China economic meet, emphasised that China must allow greater access to Indian goods. 
    
	As of last month, India-China trade crossed $36.6 billion in a year. Encouraged, Singh and Premier Wen have decided to revise the target and set a stiffer one because it looks like the target of $40 billion by 2010 would be met two years ahead of schedule. The new target is $60 billion. 
    
	But this is where the tu-tu-main-main kicks in. Within the total trade turnover is a trade deficit of $9.6 billion that goes against India. The larger the turnover the greater will be the deficit unless China expands the basket of Indian imports. 
    
	We have mandated our commerce ministers to come up with a Regional Trading Arrangement, Singh said after the delegation-level talks. A high-level business leaders forum will advise them on future economic ties. 
    
	The trade deficit is huge. We need to focus on FDI investment on both sides but there is as yet a limited understanding, said Ficci president Habil Khorakiwala of Wockhardt. But our demands have been clearly articulated, added CII president Sunil Bharti Mittal. 
    
	Kamal Nath said border trade (as through Nathu La) did not figure much in the current talks that focused more on major investments. Jet Airways chief Naresh Goyal was among the happiest in the business delegation. 
    
	He said Jet was ready to fly Mumbai-Shanghai-San Francisco daily from next month now that India had conveyed its clearance for Chinas Great Wall cargo airliner to fly to Mumbai. Kamal Nath also said India wants to export more fruit and vegetables to China. A list of 17 has been presented, of which the China has so far agreed to only three. 
             
	An interesting but unexplained trade that is taking shape concerns Chinas excess of sporting facilities after the new infrastructure for the Olympics in August this year is in place. Singh visited the main Olympic stadium yesterday and noted that India was getting ready to host the Commonwealth Games in 2010. 
    
	Kamal Nath said there was the possibility that some of the infrastructure from Chinas sports facilities could be put to use by India. There was no understanding available of how facilities mentioned by Kamal Nath  like a swimming pool and a gymnasium  could be transferred.

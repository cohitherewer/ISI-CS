          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, May 4: Threat of punishment has prompted the parents of a two-day-old girl to take back the baby they had disowned.         
	There was a hue and cry after the mother alleged she had delivered a boy and blamed the staff for stealing him, said Dr Lateef Ahmad, superintendent of Srinagars premier Lal Ded maternity hospital.        
	For two days, the hospital was rocked by protests by the family. The mother refused to even breastfeed the newborn.        
	 The blood test of the baby matched with her father. We also proposed a DNA test, which costs Rs 80,000, and gave the parents the option that we would pay the money but if the DNA matches, they would have to pay the money plus the penalty the law imposes, Dr Lateef Ahmad said.         
	Fearing penalty, they took the baby but we are keeping the option of DNA test open.         
	The couple have three older daughters.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who described himself as the proud father of three daughters, had recently condemned the bias against girls and called for stricter laws against female foeticide.        
	The doctor said the baby girl was inadvertently not recorded on the delivery sheet. When the family protested, the hospital called police and it was decided a blood test would be done.         
	Superintendent of police Uttam Chand said the matter has been resolved after the family took the child home. We did not register a case.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Pocket-friendly                                        
	New Delhi, April 14: India has shelved a proposal to replace blackboards in government schools with whiteboards that double as touch-screen computers, saying it cannot afford the product.         
	The interactive whiteboard project would have initially cost India over Rs 1,500 crore, but the final bill could have crossed Rs 10,000 crore, officials said.         
	The decision carries echoes of Indias rejection of the One Laptop Per Child programme after critics questioned the rationale of investing in new-age technology when several schools still lack basic infrastructure.         
	The human resource development ministry has been planning to introduce interactive technology in classrooms to enable teachers to use the Internet and other facilities while teaching students, officials said.         
	Although the government already has plans to inundate schools with normal computers, the interactive whiteboard caught the attention of officials at an international meet of technology-providers in London last year.         
	The Centre invited SMART Technologies, a Canada-based multinational that produced the worlds first interactive whiteboard in the early 1990s, for a presentation before HRD ministry officials last month.         
	The product is certainly impressive. But the costs at present are too high. I have told them to try and reduce the costs, if we are to reconsider the project, junior HRD minister D. Purandeshwari said.         
	Over one lakh schools are covered under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the governments programme to universalise primary education.         
	In addition, India runs 980 Kendriya Vidyalayas and 565 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas. The Centre plans to double the number of these schools under the 11th five-year plan.         
	Each interactive whiteboard  called a SMART Board  currently costs around Rs 1.5 lakh, Purandeshwari said.         
	The touch-sensitive display of the board can be connected to a computer and a digital projector, and computer applications can be controlled directly from the display. A teacher can write on the whiteboard using a digital pen and all notes can be saved for future classes.         
	The One Laptop Per Child programme was conceptualised in 2005 by John Negroponte, the former director of the MIT Media Lab. The OLPC Foundation, a non-profit organisation, has been trying to convince developing countries around the world to purchase its laptops  one per child.         
	Rwanda, Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Mongolia have bought the laptops.         
	India, too, had initially expressed interest, but in June 2006, the HRD ministry rejected the concept, calling it pedagogically suspect in a letter to Negroponte.         
	Sudeep Banerjee, the then education secretary, wrote that the government was not convinced that the idea of Prof. Negroponte is mature enough to be taken seriously at this stage and no major country is presently following this.

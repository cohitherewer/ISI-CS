	Nandigram, March 14: Abdul Majid Shah, 26, crossed the road before his home this afternoon and sat down at the doorstep of Rezaul Islam, 30.        
	It was a few steps the Garchakraberia schoolteacher wouldnt have dared take a few months ago.        
	Abdul is the son of a local CPM leader who was forced to flee home after the clashes broke out in January last year. Rezaul is a supporter of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, whose activists ostracised Abduls family for a year and set fire to their home in October.        
	Our families used to be very close before the trouble started, said Abduls brother Mehboob, 21. Since then we have been through a lot of pain, but we are now trying to leave those days behind us.        
	Its what most families are trying to do, he added, after a year when a Talpatti canal often seemed to run between adjacent homes in Nandigram.        
	Abduls father Mohammad Yasin Ali Shah was the karmadhyaksha in charge of education at the CPM-ruled Nandigram panchayat samity. After the Opposition took control of Garchakraberia and neighbouring villages, he joined the hundreds who fled across the Talpatti canal to CPM-controlled Khejuri.

	From that day, no one in the village would speak to us, Abdul said. Shopkeepers refused us; we were stopped from using the neighbourhood tube well. But the situation has changed now.        
	As if to prove the point, Abdul and Mehboob chatted away with childhood friend Rezaul  the imam of a mosque in Daudpur, 7km away  and played with his four children.        
	The older generations have been less forgiving. Mehboobs grandmother Sharjana Bibi, 72, cannot forget how marauding Pratirodh Committee activists had set her home on fire after a stray bullet from Khejuri killed Opposition supporter Qaum Qazi.        
	First they ostracised us; then they torched our house. We had to run away to save our lives. How can we now mix freely with someone who was a part of the land movement? Sharjana asked.        
	Reazuls wife Saberun, 26, conceded that her husbands fellow land warriors had perhaps been too harsh on their neighbours.        
	We panicked when we heard our land would be taken over. Soon, we were at war with the CPM and so boycotted anyone who had anything to do with the party. But now we want to bury the past and revive old ties, she said.        
	Her daughters Rahina Parveen, 10, and Suhina Parveen, 6, and sons Mehdi Islam, 5, and Mansoor Rahman, 3, have resumed visiting the Shah home. Rahina is close to Mehboobs younger brother Yamun, 10, and sister Manisha, 9.        
	We always loved to go to didimas (Sharjanas) house and play there. But last year, our parents told us not to visit them any more. Now we go there almost every day and play with Yamun and Manisha, Rahina said.

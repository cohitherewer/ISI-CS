  - Foundation plan to feed students          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Healthy bodies lead to healthy minds                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 24: The Akshaya Patra Foundation programme that uses centralised, automated kitchens to cook food for schoolchildren is now planning to start a larger kitchen to cater to all students across the cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.        
	Plans are on to serve a three-item menu according to guidelines set by qualified nutritionists and serve over 2 lakh students in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.         
	The Akshaya Patra Foundation prepares food in its fully-automated central kitchen, which is then distributed to schools through special-purpose vehicles.         
	The voluntary body, at present, feeds 8.3lakh students every day all over the country.         
	In Orissa, the foundation serves children in Puri and Nayagarh.         
	For now, the foundation kitchens can cook about 100,000 meals in less than five hours in sustained quality.         
	Due to the extensive mechanisation of the kitchens, the program is able to offer children standardised, high-quality and hygienic meals  consistently.         
	The foundation has approached the government for a land between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar for the larger kitchen.         
	The response has been positive, said Madhu Pandit Das, a member of the foundation. The work would start, as soon as the land is handed over, he added.        
	The foundation organised its second-edition of its conclave to set the agenda for a hunger-free nation.        
	It started the programme in 2000 serving 1,500 children in five schools in Bangalore. In eight years, over 4,500 government, aided and anganwadi schools across the country were being covered.

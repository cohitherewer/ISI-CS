          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 17: A court here has dismissed Raj Thackerays plea for exemption from personal appearance.         
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief, against whom a lawyer had filed a case for his remarks on Chhath, faces a non-bailable arrest warrant for repeatedly ignoring court summons.        
	Mumbai police had arrested Thackeray from his home on Saturday and produced him at the Mazgaon sessions court, which granted him bail.        
	His counsel R.K. Singh said the MNS leader had cited the bail in his petition filed in the Jamshedpur court. However, the court turned down the plea because Thackeray failed to provide a certified copy of the bail order.         
	Raj Thackeray was granted bail on Saturday and it was not possible to produce a copy of the order today. The court has agreed to our argument and given us time, Singh said.         
	The next hearing is on December 1.

          BASANT RAWAT AND ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	Ahmedabad/New Delhi, Sept. 15: A Dalit employee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation who had converted to Islam five years ago was today arrested in connection with the Ahmedabad blasts.        
	Umar, 38, is on the corporation payroll under the name Ashokbhai Kalabhai and is believed to have attended a conspiracy meeting before the July 26 blasts, police said.        
	Another 38-year-old, Salim, was picked up today. Both their names were dropped during interrogation by some blast accused, 19 of whom are now in custody.        
	The twin arrests came on a day sources said an absconding Ahmedabad blast accused, Qayamuddin Kapadia, could be the mastermind behind Saturdays explosions in Delhi.        
	Kapadia, a resident of Vadodara, is apparently an activist of the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi). His name was revealed to the police by Abdul Bashir, alleged to be the brain behind the Ahmedabad blasts. No other detail was available.        
	Ahmedabad crime branch DCP Abhay Chudasam said Umar had apparently been actively involved in the blasts and his connections with the banned Simi were being explored.        
	After converting to Islam, Umar had moved out of his Shahpur home and begun living in Juhapura, a Muslim ghetto, he said. Umars wife, four children, brother Kishor and his wife and children had converted along with him.        
	Umar today told the police that six Dalits had embraced Islam with him. This could be telling in view of reports that the VHP had recruited a large number of Dalits who allegedly attacked Muslims during the 2002 Gujarat riots.        
	Juhapura municipal councillor Ibrahim Sheikh, who knew Umar personally, waved away any ulterior motives in the religion change.        
	Umar studied Islam and realised that there is no caste oppression and untouchability in Islam. So he was attracted to it, Sheikh said.        
	Dalit activist Valji Patel said he would not be surprised if a Dalit joined a terror outfit, given the kind of resentment and ill will the community harboured against Hindus.        
	Crime branch sources claimed the student outfit was involved in the conversions and could have enthused the converts into joining its brand of jihad.        
	Salim, the other person arrested, is an expert in bomb-making, the DCP said. A resident of Bapunagar, he has been making bombs since he was 14 and was into training aspirants in Surat, Vadodara and Bhahruch.        
	The police released the sketches of five accused who are absconding, including Kapadia. The DCP said legal action would be started against any person found sheltering or financially supporting the wanted five.        
	The others the police are looking for include Abdul Rafiq of Gomtipur and Mujib Shaikh and Alam Shaikh, both from Juhapura.

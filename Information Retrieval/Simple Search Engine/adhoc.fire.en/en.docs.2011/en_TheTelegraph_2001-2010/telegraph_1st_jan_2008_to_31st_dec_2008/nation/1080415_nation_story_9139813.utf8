	Cop in trouble for daring court    
	A station house officer has landed in trouble for daring a court to proceed against him.     
	A metropolitan magistrate has chastised Rajender Pathania of Karol Bagh police station for his contemptuous attitude.     
	Pathania was supposed to locate a policeman and ensure his appearance in court. It reflects his contemptuous attitude and has lowered the majesty of the court in the eyes of the lawyers, litigants and court staff, the magistrate said.    
	I find it a hard fact to digest that the SHO of a police station who is in charge and responsible for all the activities is not able to locate the actual person despite the fact that a limited number of the work force is deployed under him, magistrate Ajay Pandey said.    
	The court has asked the SHO why it should not initiate contempt proceedings against him.

	Lawyers face HC music    
	Bombay High Court has issued a contempt notice to two lawyers for misleading authorities in a remand home for procuring the presence of a girl in court.    
	Ashok Sarogi and S.P. Munghate represented the parents of a 17-year-old girl who went missing last November. The girls father, Manik Jagtap, filed a habeas corpus petition. But on March 9, police found the girl with her boyfriend Gautam Dasgupta.     
	She claimed she eloped with him. But as she was a minor, the court ordered that she be put in the juvenile home. But on March 25, she did a turnaround, telling the police she wanted to return to her parents.    
	The division bench of Justices Bilal Nazki and A.P. Deshpande was surprised to see the girl in court.     
	When they asked her why she had been brought to court, she told them Sarogi and Munghate had written to the observation homes in-charge, saying the high court wanted the girl to be present in court.     
	The bench immediately issued a contempt notice to both lawyers as such an order had never been issued by the high court.

	A village for elephants    
	Maharashtra does not know how to keep its elephants from rampaging crops, so the government has decided to build a village for the beasts.    
	Replying to a call- attention notice in the Assembly, forest minister Babanrao Pachpute said the elephant village would come up near the Tilari dam.     
	The pachyderms that damaged crops in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts will now get 200 hectares to roam free.     
	The elephants will also get eco-tourism training.     
	The minister said there was a proposal to force the beasts on the rampage back into the forests, either by tranquillising them or by using other trained elephants.     
	There is also a third proposal  to put up iron barricades on parts of the Maharashtra-Karnataka border to ensure that these elephants dont enter Maharashtra and damage more crops, Pachpute said.

	Lessons from US    
	Andhra Pradesh police will be given anti-terrorism lessons in the US, from none less than the FBI, the Los Angeles police department and other agencies. Young and efficient IPS officers will get training in special weapons and tactics, skills to execute high-risk operations, bomb disposal, canine operation s and dealing with fire hazards.     
	The trip will play a major role in moulding Octopus, the states anti-terror organisation. The cops will visit New York, San Francisco, Washington and Los Angeles from April 9 to 20. The purpose of setting up Octopus is to curb terror and function as Special Weapons and Tactics teams, said a senior official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NY push to Delhi embassy tax plea
                                                                                                               NY push to Delhi embassy tax plea
  - CIVIC BODY TO CITE $42.4M BILL
          MANDIRA NAYAR                          The Indian Consulate General in New York                                        
	New Delhi, March 23: India may soon have to cough up $42.4 million in taxes for its diplomatic offices in the heart of Manhattan  and the New Delhi Municipal Council is smacking its lips.        
	A New York court has turned down Indias plea for immunity from property tax on the 26-storey building, except the residence and the offices of the Indian ambassador to the UN.        
	Twenty of the 26 floors come under the tax net. The mission had been fighting a case since 2003 for exemption under the Vienna Convention.        
	Back home, the New Delhi Municipal Council, which has been urging the foreign ministry for over a decade to allow it to tax embassies, is likely to cite the arguments used by New York State to push its case.        
	This case is being carefully followed by the NDMC as it wants a similar agreement, a source said.        
	The foreign ministry has been willing to allow the NDMC to impose taxes on water and garbage collection, but not on property.        
	A year ago, the NDMC had argued in a report on changing the system of assessing property tax that only the residence of the head of the council or mission could be exempt from tax.        
	There is no exemption from payment of charges for specific services rendered by the host state, it said. Neither is there any exemption for business premises.        
	Since October 1995, the NDMC has been trying to slap taxes on the American embassy here. But the foreign ministry has stood in its way.        
	The NDMC has made another representation to the foreign ministry asking for permission to impose property tax, a source said. If it is allowed, municipalities in Mumbai and Calcutta will also reap rewards.

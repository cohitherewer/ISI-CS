          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Devotees ride ponies on their way to Amarnath (Reuters)                                  
	Srinagar, June 19: The Peoples Democratic Party, which is part of the government in Kashmir, today accused the outgoing governor of setting the state on fire and sought prosecution of the Amarnath shrine board CEO for inciting communal hatred.        
	The governor is setting Kashmir on fire before leaving, deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Beig said, after his party filed a case against Arun Kumar, a senior IAS officer.         
	Governor S.K. Sinhas five-year term ended this month.        
	Protests had erupted in Kashmir over the transfer of about 40 hectares of forest land to the shrine board for building facilities for Amarnath pilgrims. The governor, as chairman of the board, had secured the transfer.        
	The Opposition National Conference and separatists, led by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, opposed the transfer on grounds ranging from ecological to religious. The protests were centred on the fear that the transfer would allow building of dwellings for settlers.        
	At a news conference two days ago, board CEO Kumar asked why Muslim pollution is tolerable and not Hindu pollution. The reference was to the pollution caused to the Dal Lake, Wular Lake etc by local residents, mostly Muslims.        
	He intended to incite communal hatred across t he state and the country Beig said.         
	The PDP is in a spot because the forest minister, Qazi Afzal, who cleared the land transfer belongs to the party. Since the protests erupted, Beig has tried to shift the blame on ally Congress, accusing it of forcing Afzals hand.        
	Kumar is a disgrace for the shrine Beig said. If he has the blessings of the governor, it is a matter of shame.         
	At the same time, he tried to suggest the transfer was in public interest. The land has been given to construct lavatories which will safeguard the environment, he said.         
	Beig said the land has been diverted temporarily for the two months of the yatra. But the cabinet Order No. 94/7 dated May 20, 2008, he presented to reporters did not say so.         
	Hurriyat together        
	The land transfer protests have brought the rival Hurriyat factions together, five years after they split. Hardliner Geelani and moderate Mirwaiz Umer Farooq had lunch before addressing a joint news conference. At a seven-hour meeting at Geelanis residence, they agreed to a joint agitation.         
	There is a realisation that the character of Kashmir cannot be changed. A cultural aggression is being unleashed in the name of Sufism and other anti-Islamic propaganda, Mirwaiz said.

	New Delhi, May 22: Alleged Harkat-ul Jihad-i-Islami militant Abdur Rehmans arrest here yesterday has thrown up a link with Babubhai, the outfits man in Bengal believed to be involved in the March 2006 blasts at Varanasis Sankatmochan temple.        
	Investigators are also trying to find out if the arrest and the subsequent seizure of 3.1kg RDX near a mosque in Janakpuri have any link with the recent blasts in Jaipur.        
	A team from Rajasthan police left the Pink City today to interrogate Rehman, also known as Mohammed Iqbal.        
	However, sources voiced doubts on establishing any link between the blasts and the RDX found because no RDX was used in the Jaipur explosions that killed over 60 people last week.        
	Rehman was arrested near New Delhi railway station after he reached the capital from Bengal. He is said to have crossed over from Bangladesh and come to Delhi on a mission.        
	The police said Rehman was motivated by Babubhai and in 2002, both went to Bangladesh and from there visited Pakistan on a Bangladeshi passport.        
	Sources said he attended a three-month special training course conducted by Pakistans spy agency ISI somewhere in Sindh.        
	He was specially trained in the handling of AK-47s, pistols, rocket launchers and use of bombs and explosives, said a police officer.        
	After the training was over, he returned to Bangladesh and, by 2005, was in India, working as a cleric in mosques in western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.        
	Babubhai was arrested last year along with some other associates.

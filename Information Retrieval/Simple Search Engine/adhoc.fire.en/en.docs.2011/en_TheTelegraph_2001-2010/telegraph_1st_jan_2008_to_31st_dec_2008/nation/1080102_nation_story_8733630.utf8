	Pabingia (Khandhamal), Jan. 1: The cross on top of the pucca building is missing, while the door remains broken  the 30-year-old church, which witnessed mob rage on Christmas Day, stands testimony to the violence that rocked Khandhamal.
    
	Some 35 years ago, the church was built with the efforts of residents, who otherwise had to travel 40km to attend the services at Padangi. And it was renovated a year ago. This is the first time that we did not celebrate Christmas, or New Year, rues the chief priest. 
    
	On the afternoon of December 24, the premise was filled with activities, with members from 15 villages busy preparing for the midnight mass and the celebrations to follow. 
    
	But preparations came to a halt as priests received a tip-off about a possible attack on the church. Most people rushed home in panic. However, nothing happened that night so the following morning, the people steeled themselves for Christmas prayers. 
    
	Some hours later the trouble began afresh as the BDO and an officer-in-charge of a local police station warned the people of the volatile situation in other areas. Their fears were reiterated at 9am by a local RSS leader who came and warned the church about an attack. 
    
	A few minutes later, a group of people armed with lathis and weapons barged into the premises, said Jaladhar Kanhar, an eyewitness. We ran for our lives, said Nirmala Digal. 
    
	When I came out of my house hearing noises, I saw around 300 people in the church compound, breaking doors and windows. They smashed Mother Mary and Lord Jesuss statues, vandalised the holy books and instruments and destroyed the Blessed Sacrament, said Father Singh in an exclusive interview with The Telegraph. 
    
	Besides the building, the mob damaged the adjoining boys hostel, the sisters convent, the priests residence and a social service centre. They ransacked property such as TV, fans, lights and furniture, belonging to the hostel inmates, he added. The loss of property was to the tune of Rs 50 lakh. Eyewitness said the massacre continued for more than two hours in presence of police forces. 
    
	The chief priest, who has been in hiding ever since, said he met the inspector-general, Pradip Kapoor, on December 29 and lodged an FIR with the Town police station. Similar scenes of destruction and vandalism were witnessed in a nearby church at Srasananda, which was attacked on December 25 night following Pabingia church attack. 
    
	There too, eyewitnness Prasant Kumar Pradhan said, an armed mob shouting Jai Sriram and Jai Bajrangbali barged into their church after cutting off the power supply. 
    
	A RSS leader was leading the mob, said a witness requesting anonymity. 
    
	Talking to The Telegraph Vishwa Hindu Parishad state general-secretary Gouri Prasad Rath, however, denies all charges of mob violence. We were not involved in any attack on churches in Khandhamal. The Christians might have engineered such attacks to mobilise international public opinion against the Hindus, he fumed. 
    
	Attacks did happen, the revenue divisional commissioner, S.C. Mohapatra, conceded. Now, he added, steps were being taken to restore normalcy in churches, which had been damaged in attacks. And there are also peace committee meetings to bring the situation to normal. 
    
	Like Mohapatra Kandhamal superintendent of police N. Bhol admits that some churches were attacked, while many more in Pabingia and nearby areas could not celebrate Christmas. 
    
	Adequate forces, too, have been deployed in and around churches to restore peoples confidence.

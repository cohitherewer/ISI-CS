          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, July 24: A day after NDA constituents expelled their rebel MPs for crossing the floor in favour of the UPA government, JD(U) today followed suit sacking MPs Ramswaroop Prasad from Bihar and P.P. Koya from Lakshadweep.         
	With that, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, also clarified that the party was not surprised by the defiance.         
	Ramswaroop turned rebel after the party did not give him the candidature of Islampur Assembly seat in a bypoll. Koya has been hobnobbing with the NCP for the past two years, Nitish said.         
	The chief minister refused to lend credence to the victory of the UPA government on the floor of the House on July 22. It is not important what the result was. What is important is the manner in which the UPA got the results, he said referring to the bribe allegation obliquely.         
	Nitish Kumar lashed out at the Centre for ignoring the states repeated demand to allow production of ethanol in the new sugar factories coming up in the state.         
	We have been opposed to the Indo-US civil nuclear deal from the very beginning as we believe that ethanol has the potential to meet the energy crisis, he said.         
	Nitish Kumar said if the central government had not brought out a legislation disallowing new ethanol factories in Bihar, the state would have been producing ethanol to generate at least 2000MW of electricity.         
	I wrote to Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to allow the new sugar factories to produce ethanol, too. Pawar simply ignored my letters, said the chief minister.        
	Nitish Kumar also criticised the Centre for not increasing the states quota of kerosene oil.         
	The state has a fixed quota of 6.93 crore litres per month that falls short of the demand. We sent a delegation to the Centre seeking a hike, but the Centre refused, he fumed.

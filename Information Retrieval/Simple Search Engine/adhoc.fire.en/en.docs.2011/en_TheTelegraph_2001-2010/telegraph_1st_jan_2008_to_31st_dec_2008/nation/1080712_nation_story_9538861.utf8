	Mumbai, July 11 (Reuters): US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama supports the Indo-US nuclear deal and would not push for changes to it, an Indian news magazine quoted him as saying.        
	I voted for the US-India nuclear agreement because India is a strong democracy and a natural strategic partner for the US in the 21st century, he told Outlook, according to a transcript provided by the magazine today.        
	His support may prove decisive if India fails to finalise the deal under George Bush.         
	Obama said: The existing agreement effectively balanced a range of important issues, from our strategic relationship with India to our non-proliferation concerns to Indias energy needs.        
	I am, therefore, reluctant to seek changes.        
	He said the deal would help combat global warming by giving India an alternative to coal and that he hoped it would be finalised by the end of this year.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Lucknow University: Double test                                  
	Lucknow, May 21: Lucknow University has turned the classroom tables on its teachers. They will now get annual grades from their students.        
	The grading system has already got a name from the students  Guruji ki report card.        
	Lucknow University, which is known for prolonged absence of teachers and incomplete syllabi before exams, will not be the first university to introduce it.        
	The University of Pune introduced it last month and it went down fairly well with the teachers.         
	But that may not be the case in Lucknow. The teachers are planning to protest the move, citing an uneven teacher-student ratio.         
	The Lucknow University Teachers Association has asked for more time to debate on the matter.         
	But the university administration, which was instructed by the UGC on this, said there was no going back.        
	The students were happy with the move. We are happy that students are finally getting some say, said Rathindra Upadhya, a sociology student.         
	Sangeeta Bakshi, a student of English literature, found the assessment business a bit tricky but said this was another way students could make teachers feel responsible.         
	Manoj Dixit, a professor and spokesman for the university, said the apprehension of teachers that they may be unfairly treated was unfounded. It is a very structured process. The students would have no opportunity to be biased. They cannot write anything derogatory on the teachers. They are supposed to grade them, he said.         
	The grades  A,B or C  will reflect overall performance. The teachers working in colleges affiliated to the university will also get grades.         
	However, they claim that there is just one teacher for every 300 students.         
	If ever all the students come to Lucknow University together, there wont be place to stand. Besides, the university has not been able to ensure that students attend classes regularly. If they dont attend classes, how are they supposed to judge the teachers? asked Anil Shukla, president of the teachers association.        
	Delhi University was to have begun the process last year, but it got stalled after teachers protested.         
	University of Pune vice-chancellor Narendra Jadhav said the method would bring greater transparency and accountability to teaching.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 24: A 42-year-old employee of Capital Hospital, Bijay Nayak, was arrested today for allegedly raping an injured patient admitted to the government-run clinic.        
	The woman in her early twenties was rescued from Bhubaneswar station by Government Railway Police (GRP) last night and was handed over to Ruchika, a voluntary organisation.         
	She was badly injured and the police personnel asked us to rush her to a hospital, said Swarnalata Sahu, a Ruchika volunteer, who took her to Capital Hospital.         
	The young woman could barely speak because of her injuries. She had scar marks on her neck while both her hands were badly swollen. Around 9pm when she was admitted, Nayak was assigned to help Swarnalata lift and carry the patient.         
	I left the two to get some bread and milk, said Swarnalata. But when she returned she saw the man coming out from the hospital lavatory with the patient.         
	The woman was crying. I knew something was wrong as she gestured to me to stay close to her and to keep Nayak away. When I asked her she made it clear that she was assaulted, said Swarnalata, who informed the authorities.         
	The Mahila police station arrested Nayak today and sent the woman for medical tests. We are waiting for the reports before the next step, said Bilasini Nayak, the inspector in charge of the Mahila station.         
	Nayak, lodged in the police station, has denied allegations. Its a conspiracy. I demand a proper inquiry into the case, as the patient is mad. How can they believe a mad person? he asked.         
	Ruchika now plans to seek Nayaks suspension and would be writing to the hospital authorities soon. If he is proven guilty then we will take strict action against Nayak, said U.K. Mishra, the chief medical officer of the hospital.        
	The victims whereabouts are yet to be known. It appears that she was physically abused before as well as her body had injury marks. Now she is in a state of trauma and so we can say very little, said a doctor at Capital Hospital.

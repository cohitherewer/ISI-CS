	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 21: As the sun disappeared and the stars twinkled above the open-air auditorium, Konark stadium reverberated with classical notes and rhythmic steps of dancers.         
	Todays performances marked the concluding day of the 22nd Annual Konark Dance and Music Festival at Konark Natya Mandap. The festival is a tribute to the majestic monument where every year classical dancers perform live in the wintry evenings.        
	The three-day event started with a group performance by Orissa Dance Academy Repertoire. Agriculture minister S.N. Nayak, former diplomat Lalit Mansigh and Guru Umesh Kar graced the occasion on the first day.         
	The Odissi performance was followed by a flute recital by Jawahar Mishra of Cuttack and a solo Odissi performance by US-based dancer Shibani Patnaik, winner of the Devdasi National Award for young dancers last year.         
	The dance fiesta remains one of the most exciting events in the country. It has, to some extent, revived the temple dance tradition in Orissa, said guru Gangadhar Pradhan, the president of Orissa Sangeet Natak Akademi and the show host. The concluding evening today commenced with the acrobatic Gotipua dance performed by Konark Natya Mandap troupe followed by a performance by the Hyderabad-based Kuchipudi maestro N. Venkat Rao.         
	The highlight of the evening was the choreographed piece by Aloka Kanungo and her group that included an experimental Odissi presentation with Manipuri percussion called Pung. The festival ended with Sambalpuri and Bihu folk dances.

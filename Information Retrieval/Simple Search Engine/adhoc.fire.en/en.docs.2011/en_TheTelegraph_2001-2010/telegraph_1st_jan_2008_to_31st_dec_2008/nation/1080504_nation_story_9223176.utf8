	New Delhi, May 3: A Supreme Court bench has given a split verdict in a Babri riot case, with one judge acquitting the five accused and the other upholding their life terms.         
	The case  about the murder of three members of a minority community family by a Hindu mob in Assam days after the mosques 1992 demolition  has been referred to a larger bench.        
	Justice S.B. Sinha had acquitted all five. He said only because an offence was committed during a communal riot, it wouldnt be proper to contend that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act would not apply.        
	But judge H.S. Bedi said: Can we evaluate a murder committed during a communal riot as a crime committed in the normal course. The answer must be in the negative.

	Calcutta, June 16 (PTI): Gorkha Janamukti Morcha, spearheading the movement for a separate Gorkhaland, has asked people in Darjeeling hills to keep food stock ready for at least 45 days in view of the indefinite bandh from 6pm this evening.         
	GJM general secretary Roshan Giri told reporters that the request to the people were made by party president Bimal Gurung at a party meeting today.         
	We have not called a 45-day bandh. Ours is an indefinite bandh. We cannot predict how long it will last. Our president has asked people to keep ration stocks ready for 45 days at least, Giri said.         
	We have been demanding a separate state since 1907. The Centre is aware of our demand and only it can solve the issue. We want a tripartite meeting. Why is our demand not being accepted? he asked.        
	Meanwhile, GJM secretary Benoy Tamang said food stock for only 15-20 days was available in the hills.         
	The Left front chairman, Biman Bose, termed Gurungs demand as unfortunate. ...The threat is most unfortunate at a time when we are appealing for amity... We hope the bandh would be withdrawn, he added.

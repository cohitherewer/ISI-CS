          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 30: More than 60 undertrial prisoners are allegedly lodged in Angul jail despite receiving bail release from state courts.        
	Some 60 prisoners, who have been granted bail, have been suffering because of the on-going lawyers agitation that has delayed paper work across the state. On Saturday in response to the delay, the aggrieved prisoners had launched a hunger strike and subsequently some of them were released on Sunday night to appease the agitating men.         
	Talking to The Telegraph today, jail superintendent Birabara Nayak said: Further release has not been possible due to the ongoing lawyers boycott in Angul.        
	Court proceedings in Angul have remained paralysed for a month now due to the agitation and Angul Bar Association had ceased work since March 29 to press for a Coal Bearing Tribunal in the district. Sources said, of the 330 undertrial prisoners in Angul jail, release orders for as many as 40 had been issued.

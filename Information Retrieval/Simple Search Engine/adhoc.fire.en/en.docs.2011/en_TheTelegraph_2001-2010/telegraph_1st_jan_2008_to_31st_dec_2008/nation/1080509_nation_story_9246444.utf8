	New Delhi, May 8: The Supreme Court today effectively reinstated Dr P. Venugopal as AIIMS director, striking a blow to health minister Anbumani Ramadoss who had got a bill enacted to oust the cardiologist from the post.        
	A two-judge bench struck down as illegal the AIIMS and the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (Amendment) Act, 2007, which Ramadoss had personally tabled in Parliament after a failed attempt to sack Venugopal in July 2006.        
	Venugopals lawyer Maninder Singh said: He (Venugopal) continues to be the AIIMS director as the law by way of which he was removed has been struck down. The message is clear both to politicians and the executive not to tinker with the autonomy of the institution.        
	Under the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Act, 1956, an institute director was appointed for a fixed term of five years. So Venugopal, appointed on July 3, 2003, would have been director till July 3 this year.        
	The amended law, passed last year, said the directors tenure would expire at the end of five years or till he or she turned 65, whichever was earlier. It included a clause saying any person whose appointment was inconsistent with the bills provisions would immediately cease to hold office. In exchange, he would get only three months salary.        
	On November 30, 2007, within days of Parliament passing the bill, the Centre sacked Venugopal, provoking a doctors strike at the premier institute.        
	Ramadoss and Venugopal had been fighting a bitter feud over the ministers alleged interference in the running of the institute and the cardiologists alleged support, as AIIMS director, to the anti-reservation lobby among its doctors.        
	After Venugopal challenged the law that ousted him, the apex court had appointed the next senior-most doctor, forensic and toxicology head T.D. Dogra, as the interim director till it decided the validity of the new law.        
	The court is yet to decide on another petition, filed by the AIIMS faculty association, which has challenged the nomination of the health minister as the institutes president and a member of its governing council.        
	The association, headed by Dr B.K. Khaitan, argues that the appointment of politicians to AIIMS bodies has diluted its autonomy.

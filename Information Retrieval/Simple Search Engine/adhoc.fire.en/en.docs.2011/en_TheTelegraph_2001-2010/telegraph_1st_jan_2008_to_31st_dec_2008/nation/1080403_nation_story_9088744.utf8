	Patna, April 2: Over 200 Naxalites attacked an MLAs establishment in south Bihars Aurangabad and set three vehicles belonging to the construction company owned by him ablaze last night. They also abducted four labourers.        
	The armed rebels raided Kala Pahar, the village of Lok Janshakti Party MLA from Navinagar, Vijay Kumar Singh alias Dabloo Singh, with bombs and gunfire, creating panic among residents. The rebels invaded my village to kill my father and me, Singh said, adding: We are alive because of God. We were not there when they attacked.

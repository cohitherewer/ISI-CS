                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Before road food, ask for safety label
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Safe and savoury                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: A government initiative just launched in the capital and to be expanded to cities across India will allow street-based food outlets and restaurants to earn certificates endorsing the quality of their fare.        
	Indias Food Safety and Standards Authority plans to initially certify 1,000 eating outlets and takeaway kiosks across the capital ahead of the Commonwealth Games in 2010 as part of an effort to upgrade safety and quality of food, an FSSA official said.        
	Any food outlet that follows guidelines described on a three-page checklist drawn up by the FSSA will be able to earn a safety and quality certificate. Its a simple checklist, dealing with such things as hand washing, serving procedures, and cleaning and waste disposal methods, said FSSA chairperson P.I. Suvrathan.        
	The plan is voluntary, but officials are hoping consumer and peer pressure will make outlets sign up for the certificates. People will prefer outlets with this (certification) emblem, Suvrathan said.        
	The initiative in the capital has been linked to the Commonwealth Games to set a deadline, but we would like to introduce this in another 50 towns and cities in the coming years, he said.        
	In 2009, the FSSA will also introduce a grading procedure for restaurants under which licences when renewed will come with quality-linked grades. The scheme is intended to parallel systems in some developed countries where the frequency of inspections are linked to the grade.        
	A restaurant which earns grade A after an initial inspection may not need a future inspection for a long time, a senior FSSA official said. But restaurants that get grades B, C, or D may have to undergo inspections at increasingly higher frequencies.         
	The FSSA, created through legislation in 2006, is tasked with setting standards and regulating the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import of food. Some of its activities were earlier covered by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954. The PFA was a tough law with poor implementation, said Suvrathan.        
	Over the past few decades, the government had initiated proceedings in tens of thousands of cases of violation of PFA, but the conviction rate was less than 2.5 per cent, he said. The new approach that the FSSA is working towards is self-compliance.         
	Suvrathan said the authority also plans to set up mechanisms to monitor samples of all imported food for quality and safety tests by 2010. This process will require India to establish a database of imported food items and create additional infrastructure for testing samples.

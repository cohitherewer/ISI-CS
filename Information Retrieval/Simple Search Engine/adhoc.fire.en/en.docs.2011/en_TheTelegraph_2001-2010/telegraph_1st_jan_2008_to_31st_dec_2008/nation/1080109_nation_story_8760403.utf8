	Wild fox chase on city streets    
	There was an unusual face in the crowd at Thane recently  a fox strolled into the bustling Talaopalli area, roughly five minutes from the railway station, one fine morning.     
	The animal refused to be trapped without a fight. It took a bunch of people, including forest officials, an hour to catch it.    
	Raju Mhatre, an 18-year-old porter, was the first to spot the fox early in the morning. The animal was hardly one-and-a-half-foot tall and covered with dense fur. A pack of dogs was chasing it and it was running as fast as it could, he said.    
	The fox jumped into a lake and swam to the other side. Raju then began to follow it and shouted to a few joggers to lend him a hand.     
	At one point during the chase, Raju came in sniffing distance of the fox. Enraged, or perhaps scared, the animal pounced on him.     
	Raju, however, caught it firmly with his towel. It was very irritable and tried to bite me. Then someone gave me a gunny bag to trap it, he said.    
	Forest officials reached the scene by then and took the animal away.        
	Columbia comes calling    
	Columbia University is coming to town.     
	Senior faculty members of the Columbia Business School (CBS) will address a group of industrialists on asset management and share the Wests perspective on investment in developing countries like India.    
	CBS is a part of Columbia University, where several famous Indians, including B.R. Ambedkar, have studied.    
	Professor Bruce Greenwald, one of those scheduled to address the session, has been described by the New York Times as a guru to Wall Streets gurus.     
	Greenwald is an authority on value investing with additional expertise in productivity and the economics of information.    
	The seminar is being organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries in association with Federal Express.     
	Gods go on fast    
	Nowadays, any Tom, Dick or Harry is staging a hunger strike. So, to catch the governments eye, a group decided to don the garb of Shiva, Vishnu and Ravana.    
	The protesters  employees of temples across Tamil Nadu  squatted outside the government guesthouse near the Chepauk cricket stadium as they went on a an indefinite fast.    
	They wanted the DMK government to immediately implement a Madras High Court order to grant retired temple staff pension with retrospective effect from 1997.     
	The temple workers fall under the administrative jurisdiction of the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department.    
	Last year, the government had passed an order sanctioning a monthly pension of Rs 750 for each retired temple employee. But it is yet to be implemented.    
	The crowning glory of the novel protest came when the divine demonstrators handed a petition to a person dressed like chief minister M. Karunanidhi.

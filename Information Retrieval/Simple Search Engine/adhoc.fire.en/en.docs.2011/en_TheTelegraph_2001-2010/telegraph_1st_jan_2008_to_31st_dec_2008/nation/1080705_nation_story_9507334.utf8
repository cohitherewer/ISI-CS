          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati in Lucknow on Friday. (PTI)                                   
	Lucknow, July 4: Mayavati today sounded a warning against the two deals taking shape in Delhi, the Indo-US nuclear agreement and the political pact between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party.        
	Neither is in the interests of the nation. As it stands now, they are against the interests of a large community, the chief minister said, with an eye on the Muslim vote.        
	She, however, would not reveal what she would do in a possible no-confidence vote in the Lok Sabha over the nuclear deal, if the Left triggered one. Asked by reporters, Mayavati said she would take a decision when such a situation arose, PTI reported.        
	Mayavati has already termed the Indo-US agreement anti-Muslim and will be emboldened by the rumblings of dissent over it within the Samajwadi Party, which banks heavily on Muslim support. Also, a team of Shia and Sunni scholars met her on Wednesday, saying they would stand behind her in her opposition to the deal.        
	But the second deal will worry her more. A tie-up between Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Congress could hurt her in the general election.        
	The Congress-Samajwadi deal is meant to serve the individual interests of Mulayam, who will now try to wriggle out of the CBI cases against him, she said today.        
	Mayavati believes that if the voting pattern of the 2007 state polls  when the Congress and the Samajwadis did not have an alliance  holds in the general election, she would win at least 55 of the states 80 Lok Sabha seats, sources said.        
	In the Assembly polls, her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 33 per cent votes. But if the Congress and Mulayam  who won 8 and 25 per cent respectively  come together, their vote shares would also add up to 33 per cent.        
	Mayavati, therefore, would like to play the minority card against such a combine. The BSP now has 29 Muslims among its 206 MLAs and six among its 17 MPs. Sources said she was planning to field 20 Muslim candidates for the state in the general election.        
	The day after the Muslim clerics met her at her residence, Mayavati sent her pictures with them to all the media houses.

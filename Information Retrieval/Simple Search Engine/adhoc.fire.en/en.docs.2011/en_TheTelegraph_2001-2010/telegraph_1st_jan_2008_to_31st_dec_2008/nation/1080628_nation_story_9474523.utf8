                              GJM chief Bimal Gurung                            
	Calcutta, June 27 (PTI): The Bengal government today said it was not averse to a tripartite meeting and there was no need for creation of a separate state, as the GJM rejected the offer of more powers for the hill council and stuck to its demand for Gorkhaland.        
	I have no objection to a tripartite meeting, but it will be more meaningful if we ourselves discuss and reach an agreement. Before that it will be premature, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told reporters after a meeting with a four-member GJM delegation.        
	The chief minister said that the delegation had told him that they were asked by the Centre to approach the state government .... But I asked them on what basis will we go to attend a tripartite meeting in Delhi. If we find out a path for a political solution through a mechanism of more rounds of bilateral discussions and then go to Delhi for the tripartite meeting, it will be meaningful, he said.        
	The people of the hills and plains can stay together. There is no need for creation of a separate state. There are socio-economic problems in the hills which can be tackled with grant of more administrative and financial powers to the existing Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, he said.        
	GJM central committee member Amar Lama, on the other hand, said the delegation rejected the chief ministers offer of more administrative and financial powers to the DGHC as we are only for creation of Gorkhaland.

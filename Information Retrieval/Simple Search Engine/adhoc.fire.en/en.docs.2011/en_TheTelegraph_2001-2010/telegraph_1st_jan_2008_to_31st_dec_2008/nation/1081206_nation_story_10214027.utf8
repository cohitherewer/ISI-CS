The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trade team puts off trip to Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Trade team puts off trip to Pakistan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mumbai police released sketches of two suspects, who reportedly carried objectionable material, on Friday. The sketches were drawn on the basis of inputs provided by a rickshaw-puller. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Delhi has put trade talks with Islamabad on hold after the Mumbai terror attack.        
	Trade officials have put off a visit to Pakistan, where they were to discuss increasing the number of border trade points and the number of products to be traded.        
	Also being postponed is a trip by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who was to hold talks on helping Pakistan build a metro network and renewable energy systems.        
	The trade talks and other confidence-building measures are likely to be frozen till Delhi feels Pakistan is taking steps to dismantle the alleged terror network operating from its soil.        
	A crucial point could be what Pakistan does about the list of 20 fugitives India has handed Islamabad. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has ruled out handing them over, but India would want to see if Islamabad acts against some of them.        
	The downturn in relations will set back the efforts by both countries chambers of commerce to enlarge trade.        
	Pakistans exports to India were worth $287.8 million in 2007-08, five times the figure four years earlier. India exported goods worth to $1.94 billion in that period, an almost seven-fold increase. Unofficial sales, and sales through third countries such as the UAE, account for another $2 billion.        
	Analysts estimate that official trade between the two nations could more than double to $5 billion within two years if the political climate allowed it to.        
	Both sides admit they are losing money because of their unwillingness to hold trade talks. For instance, Pakistan is the worlds third-largest importer of tea but buys just 5.47 million tonnes from India, the worlds biggest tea producer. Instead, Pakistan looks to the east African state of Kenya for nearly 60 per cent of its tea imports and to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for the rest.        
	The Indian tea industry is eagerly eyeing the future of Indo-Pak trade talks since it has a surplus to sell. Pakistan, which buys between 110 and 120 million tonnes of tea a year, needs cheaper suppliers, analysts say.        
	The pharma and automobile industries see great opportunities in the huge price differences between the two markets. A Maruti 800 costs 20 per cent more in Pakistan; the antacid tablet, Zinetac, costs 10 times more.

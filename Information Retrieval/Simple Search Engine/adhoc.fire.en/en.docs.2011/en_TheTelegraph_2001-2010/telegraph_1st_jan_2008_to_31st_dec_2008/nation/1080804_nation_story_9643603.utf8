          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 3: The race for the post of Orissa Assembly Speaker has begun with the notification for commencement of the monsoon session on August 20.        
	The election to the Speakers post would be held on August 19, a day before the session starts.        
	The election has become necessary as the post of Speaker has been lying vacant since March 31 following resignation of Maheswar Mohanty in the wake of sexual harassment charge levelled against him by assistant lady marshal Gayatri Panda. Since then, deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora has been in charge of the Speakers office.        
	Since the post belonged to ruling coalition partner BJD, the responsibility of choosing a candidate for this coveted post lies with the party leadership. However, chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has not yet made up his mind, even as aspirants have started lobbying in favour of their candidature.        
	The Opposition parties have also not decided whether to contest this time.         
	Last time, the combined Opposition had fielded senior Congress legislator Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra against the ruling BJD-BJP candidate Mohanty knowing that the ruling coalition commanded majority in the House.        
	BJD insiders say the party leadership is undecided over its candidate. They believe that the party might wait for the verdict of the State Human Rights Commission, which is probing into the sexual harassment charge. The commission is likely to conclude its hearing on August 7.        
	Sources close to Mohanty hope that Naveen may like to renominate him if he gets a clean chit from the commission. Mohanty is quite hopeful that he would be exonerated of the charges. However, there are several ifs and buts for Mohantys renomination, feel party leaders. Naveen may not take a risk of antagonising the electorate in the election year.        
	All eyes are now set on an unpredictable Naveen, who is holding the cards close to his chest. Though party leaders think that he might announce his decision at the last minute, aspirants have started lobbying. Names of senior party legislatures like Kalpataru Das, Bikram Arukh, Jogendra Behera and Jayram Pangi are doing rounds, who have failed to get a berth in the cabinet.         
	While Das, Arukh and Behera possess experience in running the House as the member of chairmans panel.         
	Pangi is a former minister and represents tribal-dominated undivided Koraput district, which is left unrepresented in the cabinet.         
	According to party sources, Behera stands a fair chance since he enjoys support of senior party leader, Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, considered as Naveens principal adviser. Arukh belongs to Ganjam district, Naveens home turf.

	Lucknow, Dec. 10: A Lashkar-e-Toiba sleeper cell chief now in a Lucknow jail is said to have co-ordinated with contacts in Pakistan to help the 10 Mumbai attackers.        
	Mumbais crime branch, probing whether sleeper modules might have had a hand in the attacks, has sought the custody of Sabauddin Ahmed alias Abu Al Qashim alias Ashok.        
	Sabauddin, a laptop-savvy 25-year-old from Bihars Madhubani and an Aligarh Muslim University student before he went to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2002, was arrested from Uttar Pradeshs Rampur in February this year in connection with the December 2005 attack on Bangalores Indian Institute of Science and the raid on the Rampur CRPF camp on January 1 this year.        
	Brij Lal, the Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police, said today Sabauddins arrest led them to Fahim Ansari, another suspected member of the module who had allegedly surveyed the south Mumbai sites attacked last month in December 2007 and this January.        
	In Mumbai, Ansari had posed as Sahil Pawarkar  apparently using the Marathi surname to avoid suspicion, Lal said.        
	Ansari, he said, was carrying seven hand-made sketches and directions of Mumbai landmarks like the Taj Mahal hotel, Oberoi, BSE and the Assembly building. Charged with forgery and arms act violations, he is in Bareilly jail.        
	Ansari was taken to Mumbai and questioned by the Maharashtra anti-terror squad in March, Lal said.        
	The officer said a Mumbai team was expected to arrive in Rampur tomorrow to take Sabauddin and Ansari with them. Ansaris trial is to begin in Rampur on Friday.        
	In Mumbai, joint commissioner of police Rakesh Maria said: We have got a transfer warrant for Fahim and will be getting a warrant for Sabauddin tomorrow so we can bring them here for questioning.        
	Lal said Sabauddins role was being analysed afresh in view of the revelations that he had met the Lashkar top brass in PoK in 2002.

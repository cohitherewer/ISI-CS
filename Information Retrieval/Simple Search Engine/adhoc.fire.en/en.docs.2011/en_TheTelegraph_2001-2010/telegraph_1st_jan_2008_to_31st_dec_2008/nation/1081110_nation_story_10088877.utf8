	Chennai, Nov. 9 (PTI): A top hotel executive has been arrested for alleged involvement in human trafficking to the US.        
	P.R. Shivakumar, managing director of the Saravana Bhavan Group of Hotels and son of proprietor Rajagopal, was picked up last night on a complaint from the US consulate-general here, police said.        
	Shivakumar had allegedly prepared fake documents for four of his employees to try and get them US visas on the pretext that they would visit an expo in America. The real intention was to get them jobs in the US, the police said.        
	One of the employees, Ramu Murugaiyan, was arrested this morning. Charged with cheating and forgery, both accused have been remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.        
	Rajagopal, who runs the hotel chain across India and abroad, had been convicted in connection with the murder of an employee a few years ago.

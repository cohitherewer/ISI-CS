	 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The women and child development ministry is set to propose a law against acid attacks to punish the guilty with a minimum term of 10 years and provide government assistance to victims.           
	Officials said the law could be introduced in Parliament in the delayed monsoon session.          Under the draft Prevention of Offences (by Acids) Act, 2008, the term can extend up to life. A National Acid Attack Victims Assistance Board will be set up to supervise the implementation of the law and suggest any policy change.          
	The board can send inquiry teams to investigate such cases. Once the veracity of a case is established, it would order interim relief of Rs 5 lakh within 30 days of the complaint. The victim can seek an overall compensation of up to Rs 30 lakh, on production of medical receipts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kumar in Delhi. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: If the CBIs new chief has his way, the countrys premier investigative agency will play a wider role globally, and perhaps catch Dawood Ibrahim.        
	The CBIs role is not limited to the boundaries of the country. We want to have joint operations, investigation and prosecution with other countries, Ashwani Kumar said today after taking over as the agencys director.        
	The CBI is the countrys interface with Interpol, and handles all liaisons with the international police.        
	Kumar cited how more and more criminals had international links and how Indian criminals were being prosecuted abroad for crimes like illegal money transfer.        
	Our assets are being transferred to other countries in the form of illegal money. So our task is: how to bring that money back and catch the criminals, Kumar said.        
	Asked about Dawood, he said an Interpol red-corner notice had been served against the don, and hoped the 1993 Bombay blasts accused would be brought to justice.        
	I hope we will be successful in bringing him back to the country. I hope we will not only be able to arrest him but also other criminals, he added.        
	The new director, who superseded a more senior rival allegedly unacceptable to a political party, denied political interference in the agencys functioning.        
	There is no political interference. The CBI is a non-political organisation. It has responsibility towards the society, Kumar said.        
	He, however, acknowledged that there were other pressures. The CBI has pressure from society, the country and even the media. We are confident of taking this pressure and yet coming out successful.        
	He argued that the question of acting with impartiality did not relate to the CBI alone. Many organisations, especially the investigative and security agencies, had to deal with the challenge, he said.        
	Kumar avoided listing his priorities, saying the CBIs priorities kept changing every year.        
	Every year, different priorities are fixed. The government sets priorities, the Central Vigilance Commission sets priorities and if the Supreme Court or any high court gives any order, our priorities do change. Besides, if there is a major incident, like the bomb explosions in Ahmedabad and Bangalore, our priorities definitely get changed, he said.

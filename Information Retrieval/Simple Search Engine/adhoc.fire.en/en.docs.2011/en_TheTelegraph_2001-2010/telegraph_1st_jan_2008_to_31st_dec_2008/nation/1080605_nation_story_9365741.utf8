          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         
	Bhubaneswar, June 4: For aspirants to the panchayat poll, no lavatory at home could spell doom for an individuals election dreams.         
	In order to ensure the success of the rural sanitation programme, Orissa government has now decided to take a unique measure to motivate people and public representatives alike to pursue hygiene at home.         
	Aspiring candidates for the panchayat polls will be debarred from contesting the elections if they do not have toilets at home.         
	Orissa Gram Panchayat Act will be amended to this effect, said state rural development minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan.         
	Earlier, the state government had launched a novel cash incentive scheme, namely Parimal Mitra Award on October 2, 2007, to add vigour to the total sanitation campaign through gram panchayats.         
	Under the scheme, each sarpanch (village headman) was asked to persuade villagers to construct 500-1,000 household toilets in their respective gram panchayats and be eligible for the award.         
	All the 30 districts of the state have been covered under the total sanitation campaign.         
	So far, the state has achieved 25 per cent success in installation of household latrines (17.94 lakh toilets installed as against target of 70.56 lakh) and 49 per cent in respect of school toilets (34,368) as against the target of 70,663.         
	Similarly, 11,022 toilets out of targeted 25,160 toilets (44 per cent) have been installed in anganwadi centres, it was revealed from a review undertaken by revenue divisional minister, Harichandan here today.         
	The minister said intensive mass awareness campaign would be organised in five selected gram panchayats of each block for 100 per cent sanitation coverage during the current year, which is being celebrated as the International Year of Sanitation.         
	The campaign will be launched in Bhubaneswar at the state-level by the chief minister on June 18, he said, adding that the celebration of International Year of Sanitation would culminate on November 19.         
	The chief minister will also issue a letter of request to chairpersons of all zilla parishads and panchayat samitis reiterating the commitment for promotion of sanitation during the International Year of Sanitation.

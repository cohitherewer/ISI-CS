The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar family pins hope on UK boy 
                                                                                                               Bihar family pins hope on UK boy 
          SANTOSH SINGH IN PATNA AND AMIT ROY IN LONDON                          Gurrinder Singh in London and (above) a picture of Sintu handed by the Prasad family                                  
	March 25: An Aurangabad-based businessman has said a 9-year-boy found in the UKs Southall might be his son, Sintu, kidnapped three years ago.        
	Businessman Ganga Prasad, 41, lives with his family at Tikri Mohulla in Aurangabad town. Prasad and his wife, Bindiya, saw photographs of the rescued child, Gurrinder Singh, on television.        
	London police recently found Gurrinder roaming the streets of the city. The boy, who could not furnish details of his background, speaks only Punjabi, a language the Prasad family is not familiar with.        
	Prasad said the photograph shown on TV had a fair resemblance to his son Sintu, kidnapped from Aurangabad on March 3, 2005.        
	Aurangabad Sadar police had then voiced suspicions that the child could have been taken to Punjab after the abduction. But the investigation made little headway after that. Nor did the family receive any ransom calls in the past three years.         
	RJD legislative council member Bhim Singh, who is also Sintus uncle, told The Telegraph: I have sought the state governments help to approach London police. I have also spoken to the director-general of police and other senior officers to take up the matter through proper government channels.        
	Singh said the family had no relatives in London. Sintus grandfather Upendra Singh, now staying in Orissa, was the first in the family to notice the photograph on television. He believed that the boy was Sintu.        
	The Prasad family claimed that Gurrinders nose and eyes bore a fair resemblance to Sintus.        
	Singh said: It is quite possible that our Sintu was taken to Punjab and was given a Punjabi name either there or after being taken to London by the kidnappers. It is now up to the police to find out the truth.        
	 We have been waiting for some miracle to happen, Sintus mother Bindiya said. The Prasads have two daughters, aged 10 and 12 years, and another year-old son.        
	In the UK, Scotland Yard said its officers were aware of the familys claim and that inquiries were continuing.        
	The police are both baffled and troubled because Indian and Pakistani children are seldom found abandoned in such circumstances as Gurrinders.        
	Chief inspector Keith Lunson, of Ealing Police in west London, said the case was now being pursued through the missing persons bureau.         
	Lunson told The Telegraph that he had been in the force for a long time but had not encountered a case quite like this. It is a very, very unusual and interesting case.        
	On the claim by the Aurangabad family, Lunsons reaction was cautious: These are very early days.         
	Scotland Yard today issued a new photograph of the boy who is being looked after by social services in Britain. Officials are taking care to question the boy gently, using interpreters.

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 20: The Uttar Pradesh chief minister and chief of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Mayavati, today launched her party campaign for the forthcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, well ahead of other parties.
    
	Addressing a workers rally this afternoon, the BSP chief called upon party cadres to prepare for the polls ahead and gear up, as time was short. Rev up organisational units and start widening the support base, she advised.
    
	Interestingly, parties that enjoy a base in north India (read, the so-called cow belt) seem to have set their eyes on Orissa now. 
    
	A month ago, former UP chief minister and Samajvadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav addressed a rally at Puri. On his trail railway minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad followed and stayed at Puri and reviewed his partys stock in Orissa. 
    
	Nationalist Congress Party is also planning a massive rally in the state shortly. In a bid to shed off its image as a Dalit party, the BSP chief made it clear that her party did not belong to any particular caste and it was not anti-upper caste. Our motto is sarva jana hitaya, sarva jana sukhaya (well-being of all), she said. Perhaps to prove her point, leaders had named the rally as Sarva jana bhaichara maha samavesh (universal brotherhood rally).
    
	However, no prominent leader from the upper caste was present on the dais. 
    
	BSP secretary general Satish Chandra Mishra, an UP Brahmin, and an architect of BSPs, spoke on how his party was not anti-upper caste. Like in uttar pradesh, the BSP chief promised to allot three acres to the land-less for free, if her party was voted to power in Orissa. The Dalit leader castigated the Congress and BJP, for ruling the nation for 50 years and more and for neglecting Dalits, tribals, other backward classes and also the upper caste poor  a tirade she repeated in Raipur as well on Saturday evening.
    
	She blamed the Centre and the governments in Maoist-affected states for growing Left-wing terrorism, as they have failed to address poverty problems.

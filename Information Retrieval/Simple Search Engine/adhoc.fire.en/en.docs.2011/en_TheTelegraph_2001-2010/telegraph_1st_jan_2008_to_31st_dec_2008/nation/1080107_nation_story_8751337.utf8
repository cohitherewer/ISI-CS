	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 6: The Opposition Congress today blamed BJD and fundamental Hindu outfits for the communal flare-up in Khandhamal. 
    
	Talking to reporters here today, former chief minister Hemananda Biswal, who led a fact-finding team to Khandhamal, said despite being aware of the ongoing conflict between Kandha tribals and Dalit Christians, the government preferred to look away rather than mitigate the situation. 
    
	Since the past five to six months, the Kandhas have been up in arms against the move to accord ST status to Dalit Christians, who converse in Kui, the Kandha dialect. 
    
	Instead of lowering the discontent  by making it clear that Kui-speaking non-tribals would not get the ST status  the government chose to aggravate the situation. The district rally by the non-tribals, led by local BJD leader and former minister Padmanabha Behera last month, was construed by the agitating Kandhas, as a counter to a rally they took out to protest against the status call. 
    
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who was busy celebrating his partys anniversary, did not take the matter seriously then, the senior Congress veteran alleged. 
    
	Instead, local RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad used this ethnic divide as a basis for a communal flare-up and local BJD leaders helped them in this conspiracy, alleged the members of Congress team. 
    
	They claimed that the vehicle, which was used in the so-called attack on VHP leader Laxmananda Saraswati on Christmas eve belonged to a close aide of BJD MP Sugrib Singh. Such an attack was a ploy to flare up communal tension in the district, alleged Biswal. 
    
	If peace has not been restored in the riot-hit areas, its the governments fault. Its opting not to take any co-operation from other political parties, said Biswal, and added that the OPCC team was prevented from visiting troubled districts yesterday. 
    
	The chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, should have taken the leaders of any political party with him when he went for the visit to the riot-hit districts, said the former chief minister. 
    
	Instead of wasting time, the state should have allowed responsible political parties to visit affected areas and convene an all-party meet to evolve a strategy to restore harmony, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Transfer tussle keeps teachers on toes
                                                                                                               Transfer tussle keeps teachers on toes
          SANTOSH SINGH                              
	Patna, March 19: Ego tussle between Bihars administration and the education department is keeping 5,000 teachers in 1,200-odd primary schools on their toes.        
	Though school inspections by inspectors are routine affairs, schools in Munger have been playing reluctant hosts to sub-divisional officers, education superintendents and district superintendents of education (DSE).         
	Reason: differences over transferring 900-odd teachers in the past four months by the DSE office without the advice of the district development commissioner (DDC) and district education officer (DEO) have led to a power battle, with each trying to out do the other.        
	Munger DDC Arvind Kumar Singh, in particular, has taken offence to the alleged nepotism in the transfer of over 100 teachers from the riverine belts to urban schools.         
	The DDC, who can entertain appeal of aggrieved teachers, last week came with an order of treating the transfers of 186 teachers null and void. With that he instructed district treasury officer to stop payments of transferred teachers.         
	Interestingly, the DDC order was followed by a DSE order stating all transfers as valid.        
	Sandwiched between the big bosses, Munger teachers continue to remain on their toes and more dutiful than before. And with each individual out to prove their worth  inspections have doubled.        
	A senior education department of Munger told The Telegraph: Administrative and education departments are at loggerheads because of the transfers. He added that according to 2006 transfer regulations put into effect by former human resource development secretary M.M. Jha, the education department is free to take up matters of transfers and postings independently.        
	DSE Shyam Babu Ram said he had followed existing transfer regulations and would not accept undue interference.        
	The district education officer is the chairman of the establishment committee looking after transfers and postings while the DSE is his secretary.         
	DDC has only right to hear appeals and direct DSE to look into grievances of teachers. Officials such as SDO can visit school to monitor mid-day meal scheme. The previous transfer regulation of 2002 had the DDC as chairman of the establishment committee. The DDCs desperation can be a result of the new transfer regulation that grants him only appellate powers, argues an officer.         
	Kumar, however, was not available for comments.

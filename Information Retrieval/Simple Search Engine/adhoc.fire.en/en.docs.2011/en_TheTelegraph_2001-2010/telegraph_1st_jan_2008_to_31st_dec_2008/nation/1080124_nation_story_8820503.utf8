             The half-page advertisement on Page 15 of the special edition of Saamna, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece. The ad reads: Birthday greetings to the honourable Hinduhriday Samrat, Sena chief Shri Bal Thackeray. Sanjay Dutt and Maanyata Dutt
                    
	Jan. 23: Welcome to the biggest Bollywood wedding announcement you have ever seen, never mind it is etched on a birthday card.
    
	An advertisement in Saamna has carried birthday wishes for Bal Thackeray from Sanjay Dutt and a certain Maanyata Dutt, setting tongues wagging on whether the star has married his live-in girlfriend.
    
	The half-page colour ad, on the 15th page of the 88-page special edition, has a photograph of a reclining Thackeray  the Sena chief turned 82 today  with the caption, From Sanjay Dutt and Maanyata Dutt.
    
	Bollywood sources, however, said the news was known. Sanjay had tied the knot with Maanyata in 2006 with friends as witnesses. 
    
	Baba (Sanjay) married Maanyata on October 19 in 2006 but he didnt want to make it a social event because of the court cases, a source said.
    
	It was a simple affair with court registration and exchange of garlands.
    
	According to the sources, the other reason the actor decided to keep his marriage under wraps was that his sisters were not too keen on the relationship. At that time, both Priya and Namrata were not very friendly with Maanyata. But after her continued display of solidarity with Sanjay during his troubled days in and out of jail, the sisters have kind of warmed up to her, a source said.
    
	However, not all seems to be well in the Pali Hill building that Sanjay shares with Priya and Namrata.
    
	A friend of the actor, convicted in the Mumbai blasts case, said the couple were planning to move out of Imperial Heights. Sanju and Maanyata are looking for a plush flat or a bungalow in Bandra, he said.
    
	Priya, a Congress MP, refused to comment on the wedding buzz. We have nothing to say on this. You should ask the person concerned, said a statement from her office.
    
	Saamna editor Sanjay Raut said the ad could not have been an error. We dont publish false advertisements. The Thackerays have always shared a special relationship with Sanjay and his family.
    
	Maanyata, whose real name is Dilnawaz Shaikh, once a Bollywood item girl, is said to wield a lot of power in the Dutt household. 
    
	Since his release on bail in the Bombay blasts case late last November, the actor has seldom been seen without her, be it on the set of the film EMI or at public events.
    
	Recently, Maanyata accompanied him to a close friends wedding and sources there said the two were treated as husband and wife.
    
	Sources said he had been thinking of setting up home with Maanyata for a long time. He has even distanced himself from people she does not like. Long-time friend Sanjay Gupta was among those who got the cold shoulder.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Aug. 26: MBA and MCA examinees of Magadh University today assaulted an invigilator of Jagjivan Colleges Gaya centre on charges of molesting an examinees on the first day of the examination.         
	The examinees indulged in brick-batting and ransacked the centre, till police intervened and resorted to lathicharge to bring the situation under control. Students, including girls, received cane blows during the lathicharge. The examinees also blocked traffic on the NH-82 to register their protest against the charge and subsequent lathicharge.         
	According to Gaya Sadar SDO Navneet Ranjan Tiwari, the blockade was lifted following university authorities assurance to shift the centre to another college and conduct an inquiry into the charge. The assurance was conveyed to the agitating students by the Sadar SDO.        
	Denying the charge, the principal-cum-centre superintendent of Jagjivan College, Shaukat Ali, said the charge was mere eyewash to divert attention from the fact that some examinees wanted to use unfair means to pass their tests.         
	Defending his colleagues, he added that the man in question was a senior professor. According to him, the examinees walked out of the hall after vandalising the place when they were disallowed to use unfair means. After the trouble todays examination was cancelled.

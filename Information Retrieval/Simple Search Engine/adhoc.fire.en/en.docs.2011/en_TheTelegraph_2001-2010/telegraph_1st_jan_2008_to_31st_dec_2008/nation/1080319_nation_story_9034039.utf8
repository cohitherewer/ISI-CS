The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar banks plot pretty Patna plan
                                                                                                               Bihar banks plot pretty Patna plan
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 18: First they offered soft loans for autorickshaw drivers, then helped orphanages and now Bihar banks have plans to spruce up the state capital.        
	Call it aggressive marketing to broaden customer base or corporate ethics, representatives of Bihars commercial banks have already met officials of Patna district administration to lay out plans which include sprucing up and fencing parks, putting up lighting fixtures and general road maintenance.         
	Even the district administration seems keener to co-operate than ever before.        
	An worker in the office of the Patna district magistrate confirmed that former district magistrate B. Rajendra (replaced yesterday by J.K. Sinha) had held a meeting with officials of State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank of India.         
	Though the new district magistrate is yet to be briefed about the plan, the DMs office said new electrical arrangements had already been made on Boring Road and Bailey Road near Hartali Chowk.         
	In exchange the banks are being allowed to put up logos and banners along roads and on central verge. Especially the roads around Gandhi Maidan will be focus areas.        
	The government has already renovated and constructed traffic islands along Frazer Road and Gandhi Maidan.         
	However, the busy paths along Machhua Toli, Arya Kumar Road, Dariyapur, Sabzi Bagh, Bhanwar Pokhar, Saidpur, Govind Mitra Road, Makhania Kuan and Bakerganj would not receive the benefits  as yet.         
	A Punjab National Bank official said: Banks are interested in refurbishing vintage city points for now. Other areas would follow next.         
	P.K. Singh, a State Bank of India official, conceded that such financial institutions had turned to social sectors to present the human face of banking.         
	Its surely for publicity, but its also necessary to reach out to the society with a message, said the official.        
	Close on the beautification bid, PNB today decided to distribute 18,000 autorickshaws through a private ground by advancing loans.

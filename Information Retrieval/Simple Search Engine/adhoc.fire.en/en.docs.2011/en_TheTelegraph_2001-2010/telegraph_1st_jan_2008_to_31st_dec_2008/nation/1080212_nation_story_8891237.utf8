                                                                                                               Cloud on Patils university tour
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 11: With three days left for President Pratibha Patils scheduled visit to Magadh University (MU), the Bihar administration has expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made for the visit.        
	Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah along with deputy inspector of police Parveen Bashist and Gaya district magistrate Jitendra Srivastava inspected university premises on Sunday.         
	Rammaiah later held a meeting with the MU vice-chancellor, B.N. Pandey, and issued a 24-hour deadline to the university officials to set things right.         
	Else, the administration would be advising the government to cancel the programme, he warned.         
	The officials, according to sources, have become sensitive after the Nalanda incident in which stones and mud clods were thrown at the chief minister in presence of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.         
	The state administration perhaps feel wary of leaving things to chance at such a time.         
	President Pratibha Patil is scheduled to inaugurate Tarang, an inter-university cultural festival being organised in Bihar for the first time on February 15, 2008.        
	Rammaiah said with only three days left for the Presidents visit to the university headquarters, the arrangements made by the university officials lacked planning and foresight.         
	The approach road to the inauguration venue is allegedly in a bad shape and the replica of a stupa built at the inauguration venue does not have a strong base, he added.         
	Even the rostrum built for the event lacked quality. Also water hydrants were not available to meet incidents of fire - he said.         
	Rammaiah added that the parking space for VIPs did not have provisions to combat rains and the absence of sand in the parking area may result in muddy paths.        
	The commissioner also felt that total absence of a proper chain of command and teamwork marked the preparatory arrangements.        
	Time is running out for the university administration, Rammaiah added.         
	Magadh University vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey, in his defence, said that the administration had left the university to fend for itself and his request for help was not accepted on the plea that all the arrangements on the university premises have to be made by the university.         
	Moreover, the suggestions from the administrative officials come a bit too late. The university has made excellent arrangements for the Presidents visit, claimed Pandey.         
	There was perfect co-ordination among the event organisers, he added.

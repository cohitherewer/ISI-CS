	 Srinagar, Oct. 23: Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik has been detained as part of a crackdown on separatists who have called for a poll boycott.          
	Malik was picked up along with Jamiat-e-Alhi Hadees chief Moulvi Showkat Ahmad Shah around midnight yesterday, hours after the two had led an anti-election rally in Hajan, Baramulla. Hundreds participated in the rally and pledged to boycott the polls. The arrests sparked clashes between security forces and protesters in Srinagars Maisuma, where Malik stays.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain an application by the Ansal brothers seeking review of their bail cancellation in the Uphaar cinema fire case. A two-judge bench said Sushil and Gopal Ansal, owners of the cinema where 59 died in a fire in 1997, could not seek a review of the apex courts order in the garb of a modification application.

	 Ahmedabad (PTI): A court on Thursday sentenced 20 people, including nine women, to three years imprisonment for poaching of six Gir lions in 2007.

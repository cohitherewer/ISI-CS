 - Bengal youth convicted of ferrying 20kg RDX before blasts
    OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	Lucknow, Jan. 23: A Bengal youth and four others belonging to the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami were today convicted and handed life terms for their role in the March 2006 Varanasi blasts.
    
	Mehboob Ali Mandal, 22, has been identified as a hardcore Harkat operative from Murshidabad. He ferried 20kg RDX to a Bhiwandi-based colleague, code-named Umar, in the run-up to the blasts at the Sankat Mochan temple and Varanasi railway station.
    
	The others sentenced include Mohammad Farhan, 21, and Shahid Hasan, 23, both from Lucknow, and Rizwan Siddique, 25, and Saad Ali, 23, from Amroha in western Uttar Pradesh.
    
	The sentences handed out by the fast-track court of Dharamjay Mishra are the first in any blast-related case in Uttar Pradesh since 2005. Twenty people were killed in the explosions.
    
	According to sleuths probing the blasts, Mandal made 12 calls from mobile phones to the Harkat in Bangladesh in March 2006. He was arrested along with the other four a month later.
    
	In April 2005, Mandal worked out of a Varanasi hotel for three weeks, calling Harkat headquarters from public booths.
    
	After leaving Murshidabad in 2002, he studied at the Deoband Islamic seminary where he was allegedly motivated to sacrifice himself to the Muslim cause and take arms training in Pakistan.
    
	Mandal has disclosed that he went to Bangladesh four times and to Karachi once for training. He said after training in camps on the India-Bangladesh border, Harkat operatives were sent to ISI camps in Karachi.
    
	At both places, he met several youths from small towns in Uttar Pradesh, he said.
    
	The alleged mastermind of the blasts, Mohammed Waliullah, has confirmed what Mandal said. I sent these five young men to Bangladesh from where they were sent to Pakistan to attend a 28-day ISI training camp, he told investigators.
    
	Waliullah, 32, is an imam of a mosque in Phulpur in Allahabad. His trial is going on in a Ghaziabad court where it was shifted after Lucknow lawyers refused to take up his case.
    
	An advocate for the five sentenced today said he would move higher courts against the order. This is a judgment, not justice. We will move the higher courts against this verdict, H.A. Alvi said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 13: A Kupwara couple committed suicide in their homes, apparently after they failed to persuade their families to let them marry.        
	After a year-long courtship, Nazir Ahmad, 30, and Maryam Bano, 25, had wanted to marry, police said, but ran into opposition from their parents in the districts Chandigam village, 130km from Srinagar.        
	Nazir, an official in the home guard department, was the first to end his life, swallowing poison at home on Wednesday night. He died on way to hospital, an official said.        
	Next morning, when Maryam heard about Nazirs death, she locked herself in her room and hanged herself from the ceiling. Nazir and Maryam were buried separately.        
	Since both families are mourning, we are going slow. We dont know why the families were against the relationship, the official said.        
	Perhaps, they werent ready to marry against the wishes of their families. So they took the extreme step.        
	Sajjad Ahmad, the officer in charge of Sogam police station, near Chandigam, said a case had been registered. The investigations will find out what forced them take this extreme step. Anybody who abetted the suicides will be arrested and tried, Ahmad said.

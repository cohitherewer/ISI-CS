          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mayavati in New Delhi. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, April 10: The Congress is likely to tread with caution on the Supreme Courts quota verdict and use its perceived political gains judiciously.        
	The atmosphere at the Congress headquarters mirrored the mood of a party that in the past fell between two stools on reservation and took ambiguous positions.        
	The restraint was in sharp contrast with the celebratory zeal to laud Sonia Gandhi, distribute laddoos and rustle up a crowd to burst crackers soon after the budget announced a loan waiver for farmers.        
	Today, not a soul was to be found in 24 Akbar Road, the Congress base. Neither did anyone put out a statement.        
	The cue for the line the Congress was expected to take came from Arjun Singh, the author of Mandal, Part Two. The human resource development minister, who drew the ire of his partys upper caste liberals by refusing to budge on the quota question in 2006, spoke of social inclusivness, adding that the verdict would help the general category students as much as the OBCs.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hadnt exactly approved of Singhs exertions and often stressed as much on merit as on social justice in his speeches on education. But the Congress could not say or do anything against Arjun because it has nearly a hundred OBC MPs. Besides, powerful allies like the DMK and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which pulled their weight behind Singh, had a base to reckon with in their home states where caste-based quotas play a decisive role.        
	Sources said the political fallout of the verdict was expected to be discussed by the Congresss core committee on Friday. They said that after the Uttar Pradesh experience, the party was unlikely to flaunt it as a major achievement in the northern poll-bound states.         
	In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress was convinced that the OBC issue was a big reason why the upper caste Brahmins defected en masse to the Bahujan Samaj Party. The Brahmins rooted for a party which made no bones about its caste preferences than one professing to be an umbrella outfit with nothing substantive to offer any caste, said a leader from the state.        
	Mayavati welcomed the Supreme Court judgment but said the Centre should review the criteria for determining the creamy layer from the OBCs. Prices have sky-rocketed and in the name of excluding the creamy layer, deserving OBC students should not get left out just because their parents may be falling within the income bracket which does not entitle them to reservation, she said.        
	In the south, the reservation issue was likely to play out differently. M. Veerappa Moily, the chairman of the committee the Prime Minister appointed to prepare a road map for implementing the quota, said his slogan for the Karnataka election would be social justice at the door of every OBC member. Karnataka has 50 per cent reservation in state-run education institutions.        
	Yet, we will use this issue in a big way to iterate the Congresss historical commitment to social justice. Every time the judiciary gave a landmark ruling or Parliament enacted a major law on social justice, the ground was laid by Congress leaders, said Moily.

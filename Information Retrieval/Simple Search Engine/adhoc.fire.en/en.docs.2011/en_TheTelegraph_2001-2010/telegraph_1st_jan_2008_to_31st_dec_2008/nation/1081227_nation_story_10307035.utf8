	Cuttack, Dec. 26: Orissa has become the first state where beneficiaries of the NREGS were given smart cards for secure payment of wages.        
	The department of posts signed MoUs with the governments of Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat for making payment of wages to job card holders. The smart cards are being issued to NREGS workers as part of the implementation of the MoU under a pilot project for electronic payment system in five districts in Orissa postal circle.        
	The postal department has started off by issuing smart cards and payment to NREGS beneficiaries in Kamakhyanagar block of Dhenkanal district under Sambalpur postal region. The first India Post smart cards were issued to 24 wage earners and payment was made to them through mobile device at Baunspal branch post office on Wednesday, Sambalpur postal region director Lalitendu Pradhan said.        
	The pilot project is underway in 25 branch post offices spread over Dhenkanal, Bargarh, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj and Ganjam districts.         
	The information and communication technology-based mobile payment system through an authentication process is aimed at ensuring proper and timely payment of wages, secure payment transactions as per the wage lists and elimination of middlemen, he said.         
	Workers would be able to withdraw money with the help of the cards, which are readable with special mobile phones available at the post offices. Post offices in Orissa have opened over 3 lakh accounts for NREGS beneficiaries.

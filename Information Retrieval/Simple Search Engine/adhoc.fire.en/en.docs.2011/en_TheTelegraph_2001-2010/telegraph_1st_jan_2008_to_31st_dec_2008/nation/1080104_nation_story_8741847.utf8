     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will visit Beijing from January 13 to January 15 during his first official trip to China. 
    
	The trip follows close on the heels of a new-found warmth exhibited by the armies of the two countries during the Christmas week in Kunming. 
    
	The visit was announced by foreign office spokesperson Navtej Sarna here today. 
    
	Chinas President Hu Jintao visited India in 2006 and Premier Wen Jiabao in 2005. Singh again met Wen on the sidelines of an Asean-India summit in Singapore last November, where he is understood to have pushed through the joint counter-terrorism drill between the two armies that finally took place in December. 
    
	Singh is likely to be given the rare honour of addressing the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China during his visit. 
    
	India will also make the point during the Prime Ministers visit that it will pursue an independent foreign policy. Beijing has been suspicious of Indias increasing strategic ties with the US.

	Take the plunge on cricket pitch    
	The city likes to see its sports stadiums full, so what if no game is being played?     
	The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to rent out the sprawling venues for weddings, exhibitions, felicitations and even birthday parties.    
	So while the bat and ball are gathering dust, a cricket pitch can be turned into an aisle for the bride and groom to walk up and take their vows.     
	You can hire any of the citys 11 stadiums for a price. While the average rent for Gacchi Bowli, the cycling velodrome, is around Rs 20 lakh a day, the others are available at Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh.     
	The government has also offered to throw the gates open for film shootings, fashion shows and religious programmes.    
	Tower lights will be made available at Rs 16,500 for each hour of use.    
	For official sports bodies, the rent is just Rs 10,000 a day.    
	Science train chugs in    
	Schoolchildren in Mumbai used the last weekend to learn more about the universe in an exhibition  on a train.    
	The Science Express chugged into the Chhatrapati Shivaji terminus in south Mumbai on Friday.     
	The train, flagged off last October by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, made its 42nd stop. It reached Mumbai after halts in the south and the east. The Science Expresss journey covering 57 cities will end in Delhi in June.    
	The 16-coach mobile exhibition opened to the public in the presence of officials of the German consulate, Indian railways and the Max Planck Society in Germany, which has provided most of the exhibits.    
	Hundreds of schoolchildren waited patiently since morning to board the train. The mobile chemistry lab was a big draw as the children were allowed to try experiments there.    
	The experiments are related to what we have studied but are much more fun, said Raj Modi, a Class X student from suburban Ghatkopar.

	Kid killer on the prowl    
	Paediatricians have urged the Indian government to include pneumonia vaccination in the countrys immunisation programme, calling the disease the leading killer of children under five.     
	On April 5 and 6, Delhi hosted a conference of the Indian Association of Paediatrics and the Asian Strategic Alliance for Pneumococcal Disease Prevention.     
	Participating doctors called for an urgent intervention from the government to help the country improve on an embarrassing international statistic  India leads the world in under-five mortality.     
	Of the 20 lakh children under five dying in India each year, four million fall prey to pneumonia, R.K. Agarwal, who heads the association, said.     
	A pneumococcal vaccine  PCV 7  is now available in India, and the doctors are campaigning for its introduction in the national immunisation programme.        
	Cops on Net    
	Planning to file an FIR? If you are in Tamil Nadu, you can just fire an email.     
	The state police are set to go digital with a facility to file complaints on the Net, director-general of police K.P. Jain said on Sunday.     
	The emails would help people bring their grievances to the notice of senior officials, he said, adding that the sole objective of the move is to create confidence among people and tell them that the police are with them.     
	Jain, who assumed charge recently, is brimming with confidence, though. Replying to a reporters question, he said the 16 battalions of the Tamil Nadu special task force could take on any challenge.

	Mumbai: Saraswati Rajagopal plays the veena to accompany a Bharatnatyam performance by Pratibha Prahlad and UK-based Chitraleka Bolar, and an Odissi performance by Ramli Ibrahim and January Low from Malaysia. The show will be held at the India Habitat Centre on Lodhi Road at 7pm.

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, June 1: The BJP today sprang an old chestnut on the government, asking it to adopt panthnirapeksh as the official Hindi translation for secular instead of dharmnirapeksh.        
	Rajnath Singh voiced the demand in his presidential address at the two-day BJP national executive, adding the party itself would never use dharmnirapeksh.        
	Panthnirapeksh means sect neutral whereas the more familiar dharmnirapeksh means religion neutral. According to the Sangh parivar, all religions with a single founder and single holy book are panths on a par with the various Hindu sects while Hinduism alone is dharm (religion).        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani would often favour panthnirapeksh in their speeches but the BJP had so far not made a policy statement of it.        
	Political circles saw Rajnaths statement as an attempt to smuggle a Hindutva theme into the partys current talk about development and good governance. They said that despite the victories in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka without an overt Hindutva plank, the BJP appears to believe it cannot rely on the promise of good governance alone.        
	Many in the Sangh think that issues like inflation and governance are temporary and that the BJP urgently needs to return to its core ideology of Hindtuva. Rajnath obliged them by giving the panthnirapeksh demand the prime position in his speech, which also contained the usual references to terrorism, price rise, farmers and Muslim appeasement.        
	Rajnath said India was essentially religious and could not be religion-neutral.        
	(The term) dharmnirapeksh hurts our identity and traditions. India has always been a sect-neutral country. From Shaivism, Vaishnavism to Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, many sects have flourished. There has never been any discrimination, Rajnath said. He did not mention Islam.        
	Many academics and Congress leaders tend to dismiss the Sangh parivars point as conceptual obfuscation and needless word-juggling.        
	However, even the Constitution uses panthanirapeksh, experts say. In the mid-1970s, when Indira Gandhi was amending the Constitution to include socialist and secular in the Preamble, there was a debate over the right translation for the second word. Panthanirapeksh beat sampradaynirapeksh to the honour, with dharmnirapeksh not even in the picture.        
	The confusion cannot be removed only through explanation. The solution is to stop the use of dharmnirapeksh. I am announcing that in future, we will never use it, Rajnath told the meeting, which began today at the Parliament annexe.        
	The government should also issue a directive prohibiting the constitutional use of dharmnirapeksh so that, from the Prime Minister to the public, no one uses this term. This will prevent confusion and damage.

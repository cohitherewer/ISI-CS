          SUJAN DUTTA                           A soldier in Iraq: Setting an example?                                  
	New Delhi, June 9: The search for an Indian Way of Warfighting tops the agenda for a two-day meeting of the top brass of the military establishment that begins here tomorrow.         
	Ironically, the meeting is convened by a joint services body headed by a general who sought to replicate lessons from the 2003 US invasion of Iraq and the American way of warfighting in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Lieutenant General Hardev Singh Lidder, chief of the integrated services command, a joint military outfit established in 2002, and his deputy, Air Marshal D. Kukreja, will lead the discussions on the Indian Way of Warfighting after they make a presentation.         
	The Indian way of warfighting is not expected to be a throwback to battlefield scenarios from centuries ago involving elephant-charges, but an effort to lay down principles that will make it possible for integrated forces of the army, the navy and the air force to wage war in different theatres  on the western front (facing Pakistan), on the northern and eastern (opposite China) and, importantly, for homeland security and counter-insurgency.         
	Lidder, a highly decorated para commando, was in charge of the counter-insurgency Romeo Force in Jammu at the time of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Before that, he was Indias military attach at the embassy in Washington, and still earlier, he was military liaison officer in Colombo at the time of the Indian Peacekeeping Force deployment in Sri Lanka (1987-1990).         
	As the major general heading the Romeo Force, Lidder masterminded a counter-terrorist offensive named Operation Sarp Vinash in May 2003. Standing atop his operations centre at Jaran Wala Gali in his battle-fatigues, with the maroon beret of the para commando firmly on his head, Lidder had one afternoon claimed his forces had achieved shock and awe  the American phrase that gained much currency during the invasion of Iraq  in the offensive against terrorists who were said to have created an enclave of about a 100sqkm.         
	Operation Sarp Vinash later ran into controversy because figures of casualties that Lidder gave on the spot did not tally with the figures given in army headquarters. Besides, local police and political organisations in Jammu alleged that the army had totted up terrorist kills in fake encounters.         
	The presentation on the Indian Way of Warfighting, scheduled for Wednesday, is to be made by the doctrine, organisation and training (DOT) branch of the Integrated Defence Staff. DOT is headed by the deputy chief of the IDS, Air Marshal Kukreja.         
	The presentation on the Indian Way of Warfighting is not likely to be made public nor its contents revealed in any substantial detail. But if what Lidder told participants at a table-top exercise in Hyderabad last month is any indication, a significant portion will be devoted to counter-insurgency.         
	Addressing invitees to the Hyderabad drill, Lidder had said: The rise of fundamentalism, regional or ethnic underpinnings and ideological or social flare-ups, arising out of the non-inclusive growth patterns are becoming the prime reasons for conflicts. Conflicts today, therefore, are more intra-state than interstate and also involve a large number of non-state actors.

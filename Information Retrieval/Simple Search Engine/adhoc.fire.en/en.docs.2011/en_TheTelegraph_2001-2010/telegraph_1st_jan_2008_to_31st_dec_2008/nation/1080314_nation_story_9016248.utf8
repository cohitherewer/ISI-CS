  - Anganwadi workers strike ends        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The demonstration. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                         
	Bhubaneswar, March 13: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced that the Orissa government would henceforth pay a monthly remuneration of Rs 500 to anganwadi workers and Rs 250 to helpers, over and above the remuneration being paid by the Centre, in the Assembly this evening.         
	The changes will come to effect from April 1, 2008, he added.         
	Todays announcement came right in time as some 5,000 aganwadi workers from across Orissa had pitched tents on Mahatma Gandhi Marg, leading to the Assembly, in a bid to draw the governments attention to their plight. The workers and helpers called of the strike after the announcement.        
	The workers went on an indefinite dharna under the banners of Orissa Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Association and Nikhil Orissa Anganwadi Karmi Sangha for two days demanding a pay hike and regularisation of their posts.        
	While the governments ancillary works at the grassroots level are performed by us, we are provided with no remuneration, alleged one of the protesting workers today  before Naveens announcement.        
	Compared to other states, we are being paid a pittance. While several types of allowances and perks are extended to workers in other states, in Orissa our plight is unheeded, lamented Radharaman Sarangi, the working president of the Karmi Sangha.        
	Early in the day, a delegation met women and child development minister Pramila Mallick to press for their demands and submitted a memorandum.         
	The demands included universalisation of anganwadi workers according to directions of the Supreme Court, regularisation of posts and an additional remuneration of Rs 500 per month. The workers also demanded that trained personnel (those with Bed and CT) be preferred over untrained workers for the post of siksha sahayak and 30 per cent reservation in supervisory posts be enhanced to 50 per cent.         
	This apart, the workers demanded qualitative grain supply, building for each anganwadi centre, besides house and fuel allowances.         
	Yesterday, too, a seven-member delegation, led by former MP and chief of the Sangha Dutikrushna Panda, met chief minister Naveen Patnaik and discussed the demands. Finance minister P.C. Ghadei was also present at the meeting.        
	Opposition flak        
	The Orissa Opposition today lambasted chief minister Naveen Patnaik blaming him for the collapse of justice delivery system due to the stalemate over the lawyers strike demanding establishment of permanent benches of the high court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Education files lost: babus blame rats
                                                                                                               Education files lost: babus blame rats
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 25: Dont blame the lazy babus always for delays in government education programmes. Some busy rats may be the culprits.         
	The human resource development ministry has been losing crucial files on policy documents since January from its usually secure headquarters at Shastri Bhavan and flummoxed officials are fighting among themselves on who to blame  careless peons or rats.         
	We have carried out informal enquiries and questioned everyone who may have a clue about the files. But we havent come up with any answers. The only explanation can be that the files were misplaced, and eventually may have been attacked by rats, a senior bureaucrat said.         
	At least two directors  a grade below joint secretary  had complained of rats in their offices, but ministry sources said their pleas to drive away the rodents were largely ignored by maintenance officials at Shastri Bhavan.         
	Over the past few months, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has frequently called members of his cabinet to update him on the progress of schemes aimed at minorities.         
	But far from delivering under pressure, the HRD ministry lost a note from the Prime Ministers office to minister Arjun Singh on the status of minority education in January.         
	With a meeting at the PMO on minorities just days away, the HRD ministrys top bureaucrats  secretaries R.K. Agarwal and A.K. Rath  called an urgent conference with juniors. The secretaries had just one question: how could an important note from the PMO go missing? They were quite livid, said an official who was among those who took the rap.         
	It could not be found and the ministry had to suffer the shame of informing the PMO that it had managed to lose the crucial note, a source said.         
	An exasperated official said: Were trained as bureaucrats, not to play treasure hunt. How do we look a PMO official in the eye and say that we havent moved on a proposal because weve lost it.         
	In August 2007, Damodar Jain, a member of the National Council for Educational Research and Training, had written to the HRD minister proposing that the government set up a bureaucracy dedicated to education.         
	Arjun Singh and his adviser Sudeep Banerjee debated on the proposal, too. Both penned their views but before the ministry could arrive at a decision, the file containing all the documents on the proposal went missing last month.         
	Were desperately looking for the file. Till we find it, there is no way we can move forward on the proposal. Were helpless, an official said.         
	An under-secretary and a section officer in the ministry have each accused the other of losing the file in notes to HRD secretaries, sources said.         
	Letters informing some state governments of funds sanctioned under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan never reached the intended recipients. Some state governments called, saying they never received the letters we had sent a month back. Thats when we realised something was wrong, an official in the school education department said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 6: A team of RBI officials has fished out fake notes worth Rs 46.24 lakh from the State Bank of Indias Domariyaganj branch, possibly the first time such a find has been made from a nationalised bank.        
	The recovery, made on a tip-off from Uttar Pradesh police, comes at a time fears that sleeping terror modules are involved in counterfeit currency rackets are being probed. Six such rackets have recently been busted in the state.        
	As far as I know, this is the first time a public sector bank has been used to pump in counterfeit currency into the open market, even if unwittingly, Brij Lal, the state additional DGP, said.        
	The RBI officials had on Monday night sprung a check on the bank, in Siddharthnagar district close to the Indo-Nepal border, after the police told them a currency racketeer arrested in the area last week had mentioned such a scam.        
	Bank sources said Rs 20 lakh worth of fake notes was initially identified, with 20 bundles of 1000-rupee notes found to be carrying the same serial number. About Rs 70 lakh of genuine currency was found missing.        
	The RBI team today continued to sift the bundles in the strongroom  the sources said the bank had a balance of Rs 184 crore  and came upon more fake notes, taking the total to nearly Rs 47 lakh.        
	An official from the team said there was no knowing what the total amount of fake currency would be when scanning was finally over. So far, currency worth only Rs 1 crore has been scrutinised.        
	At a news conference yesterday, additional DGP Lal said the first whiff of the scam arose when arrested racketeer Abid Sheikh alias Pundit disclosed that an SBI cashier, Sudhakar Tripathi, had allegedly been helping them replace genuine currency with wads of fake notes.        
	This racket might have been going on in connivance with bank staff who could be involved in clandestine replacement of notes with fake currency, he said.        
	A police raid on Tripathis house yielded Rs 7 lakh in cash, of which only Rs 5,000 was fake. Tripathi, 58, has been arrested.        
	Lal, however, doused fears that terror modules, apparently lying in wait to launch the next strike, were orchestrating the currency rackets. Uttar Pradesh apparently has the biggest number of such modules.         
	We have not been able to establish any direct link between fake currency networks and terror groups yet. But the growth of such operations is unnerving, Lal said.        
	The special operations group of the police busted two other fake currency rackets in Rae Bareli and Kanauj on Monday evening. Three persons carrying Rs 18,000 worth fake notes were picked up from Rae Bareli and a racketeer with Rs 14,000 from Kanauj.        
	The police said they had got the first hint that a big network was flourishing after one Suhail Singh was arrested from Gonda district with Rs 16 lakh worth fake notes in July.

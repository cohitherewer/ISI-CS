	Washington, Nov. 5: Indians have significantly consolidated their presence across the American political landscape, winning posts at local and state levels, although Indian American dreams of sending one of their own to the next US Congress were dashed last night.        
	Raj Goyle was elected to the Kansas state legislature for a second time, trouncing his opponent with an impressive 71 per cent of votes polled. Goyle is a Democrat and his victory in Kansas, which remained loyal to Republican presidential candidate John McCain yesterday, is expected to lift him up in the eyes of the Democratic partys core national group.         
	Goyle got 56 per cent of votes when he was first elected to the state legislature in 2006, but this time, he improved on that figure by as much as 15 per cent.        
	Swati Dandekar, the first Indian American to become a member of the Iowa state House of Representatives six years ago, won a seat in the state Senate yesterday.         
	Dandekar was re-elected to the House twice, but she decided to move to the Senate after a Republican announced her retirement from the chamber this year. She captured the seat for Democrats.        
	In another significant re-election of an Indian American to a state-wide office, Democrat Jay Goyal won a second term as a state representative in Ohio. Winning from a constituency that has consistently elected a Democrat since 1974, Goyal defeated his Republican opponent with 17,309 against 10,110 votes.        
	By far, the only Republican to get into a state legislature from the Indian American community yesterday was Nikki Randhawa Haley, who was re-elected for a third term to the South Carolina House of Representatives.        
	Haleys election to the South Carolina House in 2004 was historic not only because she is a woman, but also because South Carolina has a long history of racial prejudice.        
	Her political ascent in the state has been colourful because when Haley first ran for the House four years ago, she was elected unanimously. However, she won her candidacy after successfully taking on Larry Koon, who held the House seat for her party for 30 years, in the Republican primary.         
	During the primary, Haley faced a nasty campaign because Koon derided her Sikh faith and ethnicity and referred to her only by her maiden name, Randhawa, to emphasise that she was different.         
	Indian Americans had high hopes that Democrat Ashwin Madia may win in a hotly contested poll to the US Congress from Minnesota and become the only person of Indian origin in the new US House of Representatives.         
	But Madia lost to Republican Erik Paulsen although the national Democratic establishment had heavily invested in Madias campaign. As in Haleys case, Madia faced intense racial prejudice during the election campaign.         
	Several Indian Americans across the US won seats in city councils and local boards and were elected as district judges, expanding their grassroots political presence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           HRD minister Arjun Singh with Kanimozhi in Chennai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Chennai, May 28: After a years political alienation and facing a business squeeze, the Maran brothers have embarked on an arduous journey to mend fences with DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi.         
	Efforts at a rapprochement between the Maran brothers  Kalanidhi, the managing director of Sun Network, and Dayanidhi, the former Union telecom and information technology minister  and the DMKs first family have been on for quite some time through informal channels.         
	But after a years bitter estrangement from the party and the family, Dayanidhi appears to have taken the lead himself by showing up at the wedding of the grand-daughter of agriculture minister Veerapandi S. Arumugam in Salem.         
	The younger Maran sibling extolled the couple to emulate the affection shown by your grandfather (Arumugam) and my grandpa (Karunanidhi). The indulgent reference to Karunanidhi had a mischievous tinge to it too as the DMK boss was reportedly peeved with Arumugam for not enthusiastically greeting his Madurai-based elder son, M.K. Azhagiri, who was recently acquitted in a murder case.         
	DMK sources played down Dayanidhis apparently humorous and impromptu remarks at the wedding. But they admitted that Maran joining senior party leaders at a wedding did send a strong signal. Karunanidhis son and youth wing leader M.K. Stalin also attended the wedding.        
	Dayanidhis was the first head to roll in the party after last Mays violent attacks, allegedly by Azhagiris supporters, on the office of Tamil daily Dinakaran at Madurai. The attack on the paper, part of the Maran-owned Sun Network, came on the day it had published findings of an opinion poll on who should be Kalaignar Karunanidhis political heir in the DMK?         
	The survey, carried out by A.C. Nielsen, gave 70 per cent backing to Stalin, while disclosing that only 2 per cent of the respondents wanted Azhagiri to succeed his father.         
	The DMK chiefs daughter, Kanimozhi, who later got a smooth Rajya Sabha nomination, was favoured by another 2 per cent of the respondents, while 20 per cent wanted others in the DMK to vie for the top post.         
	This enraged Azhagiris supporters for having needlessly dragged his name into a survey with serious political implications when their Madurai-based boss had shied away from party posts, wanting fair representation only for his loyalists.         
	Party insiders saw in the publication of the survey an ulterior political motive to capture the party. Dayanidhi, who was a bridge between UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in Delhi and Karunanidhi in Chennai, took the worst blow and had to quit the cabinet.         
	The rivalry stretched to business as well with the launch of Kalaignar TV as a rival to Sun TV. The DMK also decided to float a state-owned cable TV company to break the monopoly of Sun Networks Sumangali Cable Vision.         
	Squeezed on both fronts, the Maran brothers extended a hand. Their earnestness to patch up with Karunanidhi  Kalanidhi called on the DMK patriarch in March after wishing Stalin on his birthday  is beginning to pay off, albeit in small measure, sources said.        
	A formula has been worked out that balances the political interests of the Stalin-Azhagiri-Kanimozhi trio and the business concerns of Sun Network, the sources said. But the reconciliation formula has to be approved by all family members, foremost by Azhagiri, sources explained.         
	Azhagiri, whose standing in the party and family has risen after his acquittal in the murder case, still feels hurt by the poll Dinakaran published last year.

	New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): Guddi, a middle-aged rag-picker who lived with her extended family on a footpath near the explosion site at Gaffar Market, lost seven family members yesterday. Four are battling for their lives and two are missing.        
	The family had migrated from Rajasthan looking for a better life.         
	Saturday was a normal day for us. We were near the blast site when we heard a loud bang. After that the only thing I remember is my relatives lying on the road with blood splattered around. My family has been completely ruined, Guddi wept at Lady Irwin Hospital.         
	The relatives who died are Pooja, a teenager, Ramlal (40), Billu (42), Raju, Sandhya (45) and his two children Ashok Kumar (22) and Saroj (25). Guddi said her relatives were in Lady Irwin Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The whereabouts of two others are unknown. I dont even know whether they are alive. Please help me find them, she pleaded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress plays quota card
                                                                                                            Congress plays quota card
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 27: Post-Republic Day, the state government had to face criticism from some quarters  especially from the Opposition Congress and Samrudhha Odisha, the recently launched regional outfit.         
	The Congress today accused the Naveen Patnaik government of betraying backward classes by reducing their reservation quota. The party demanded Naveens resignation in this matter. Talking to reporters today, the chairman of OPCCs Backward Class cell, Jagannath Rout, and former Union minister K.C. Lenka said Naveen governments decision to reduce reservation quota in government jobs and institutions has pushed thousands of OBC youths into despair.         
	Rout and Lenka reminded the chief minister that the former government had introduced the 27 per cent OBC quota in 1994 through a cabinet decision  and not whimsically.         
	They condemned the present governments decision to alter the cabinet decision through an executive order and reduce the quota to 11.25 per cent.        
	The state government, before the change, had cited the Supreme Court decision that stated reservation quota cannot exceed 50 per cent. The Biju Patnaik government had introduced 27 per cent reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes following which the total reservation quota went up from 38.75 per cent to 65.75 per cent.         
	However, the former government had justified the stand through the Inder Sahani case. Several states including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have reservation quota exceeding 50 per cent limit, fixed by the Supreme Court. The Congress stated that the BJD-BJP government in the state could have taken a similar step to keep the reservation quota for the OBC intact. However, its choice to reduce the quota from 27 per cent has served a major blow to the people of the community.        
	The two leaders went on to state that this move was a betrayal of the BJD-BJP government, which came to power in the previous Assembly elections with the support of the backward class, who constitute 55 per cent of the total electorate.         
	Chargesheet        
	The regional party Samruddha Odhisa today released a 20-point chargesheet against the BJD-BJP government highlighting its failure. The copies were released at a news conference this afternoon.         
	The president of the outfit, Jatish Chandra Mohanty, announced the launch of a 40-day, 30-district campaign, styled as Janmabhumi Vikash Yatra, from Tuesday.         
	During the campaign, copies of the chargesheet will be placed before the people for an appraisal, said Mohanty, a bureaucrat-turned-politician.        
	Ridiculing the states claim of being number one on several counts, the chargesheet listed 20 failures of the Naveen Patnaik government.        
	The state has become number one when it comes to poverty, corruption, Naxalite menace, epidemic, crimes, atrocities on women, the chargesheet stated. Mohanty said the number of families living below the poverty line has gone up from 1.70 crore in 2000 to 1.84 crore in 2005.

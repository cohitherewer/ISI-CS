	Cuttack, Dec. 23: Concern over hazards posed by pollution in the Taladanda canal has resurfaced in Orissa High Court after 16 years, with a fresh PIL seeking judicial intervention against contamination of the waterway.         
	Taladanda, the states longest canal, starts at Jobra (Cuttack) and links the Mahanadi with the Bay of Bengal at Paradip. Parts of the 83km canal was dug up in 1862 by the East India Company as a waterway. It was taken over by the British government that completed it in 1869.         
	Over the years the canal became a prey to pollution.         
	It was used as a dumping ground of untreated water and sewage from SCB Medical College and Hospital and other clinics posing a threat to people living in Cuttack and adjacent areas downstream.         
	When Supreme Court lawyer and environmental activist M.C. Mehta first raised the issue in April 1992, Orissa High Court reprimanded the authorities and directed the government to act.        
	A fresh PIL filed during a hearing on hazards posed by bio-medical wastes generated by the SCB Hospital, has been raised again by Maitree Sansad, a socio-cultural organisation.        
	The government, on the other hand, has pleaded that it had drawn up a plan to restore the canal, reshaping it into something closer to the busy inland waterway that it used to be more than a century ago.         
	The project cost is expected to be over Rs 100 crore and a major part of it would involve cleaning the canal from Cuttack to Paradip. The Asian Development Bank has agreed to grant a long-term loan and the project is already in its final planning stage.        
	Maitree Sansads counsel Ajay Mohanty, however, has pressed for the implementation of recommendations made by a parliamentary standing committee on environment and forests that had surveyed the problem and submitted a report in 2005. Acting on it, Justices Laxmikanta Mohapatra and Indrajit Mohanty issued notices to the Centre demanding action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs seek teacher quota relief
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           IITs seek teacher quota relief
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 4: The Indian Institutes of Technology today asked the Centre for official exemption from all quotas in faculty recruitment, the first time they have requested to be excused from a decades-old policy.        
	The IITs have told the HRD ministry that faculty quotas for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes could vitiate their campus atmosphere, government and IIT officials said.        
	The exemption, if granted, would place the IITs alongside a select group of research institutions perceived to have security implications, such as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.         
	No institution primarily engaged in teaching is exempt from reservations in faculty positions. We have asked the government to find some way to exempt us. We told the ministry the reservations could breed discontent and vitiate the campus atmosphere, an IIT director said. Three other heads echoed him.        
	The demand was made at a meeting of the standing committee of the IIT council  the apex decision-making body of the institutes  chaired by C.N.R. Rao, chief scientific adviser to the Prime Minister, in Delhi today.        
	The government had introduced 22.5 per cent reservation in jobs for SCs and STs following amendments to the Constitution in 1951. Based on the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report, the quota was extended by 27 per cent in the early 90s to cover OBCs.         
	But The Telegraph, on December 6, 2007, revealed that the IITs were skirting government norms on implementing quotas, claiming an exemption that neither the institutes nor the government could provide. The revelation led to a strong reprimand for the ministry and the IITs from a parliamentary committee.         
	The ministry subsequently clarified that the IITs had never been granted an exemption. In March, HRD minister Arjun Singh announced the IITs had been ordered to fall in line. A formal order was also issued.         
	Today, the IITs presented an alternative plan, sources said. Under the HRD order, while the IITs are required to enforce quotas only for assistant professors in the science and technology departments, the reservations are to be implemented at all stages for humanities.         
	We asked the ministry to alter its notification so that in the humanities, too, we only need to implement quotas at the starting faculty position, an IIT director said.

  - Bihar CM writes to PM   on slashed aid funds        NALIN VERMA                                          
	Patna, June 16: Two days of monsoon has swelled north Bihar rivers, making the government, as well as the residents, wary.         
	The Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today pressed the panic button by writing a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reminding the Centre of last years Bihar flood.        
	He also criticised the Union government for a cut in the 2007 flood relief package.         
	The chief ministers letter, faxed today, stated that the denial of central assistance does not augur well for a healthy Centre-state relationship.         
	The issue merits your (Singh) urgent attention so that Bihar gets its admissible central assistance, it added.        
	A sum of Rs 2,156 crore was assigned to Bihar for flood relief and rehabilitation according to stipulated norms.         
	...the Centre assessed the relief requirement at Rs 745.26 crore. It suggested that the government adjust the amount from the central credit fund (CRF) balance, Kumar said.        
	He added: In a nutshell, after the most devastating floods in recent history, the assistance from the Union government was nil.         
	The letter also pointed out that the central government had made an error in assessing the requirement for relief. Last year, a central team went around the affected districts right after the floods to assess the magnitude of the devastation.         
	They concurred with the state government on the number of people affected. Each family was to be given Rs 200 in cash and a quintal of food grain.         
	The central government accepted the amount for the 45.56 lakh marooned families, but did not provide the money and left the state government to spend Rs 714.91 crore, the letter stated.         
	It (the reaction) was against norms laid down by the Union government, according to which a state is supposed to get Rs 1,030.41 crore to spend Rs 20 per day on 110,20,545 adults and Rs 15 per day on each of 843,94,02 children for 30 days.         
	In the flood that the state faced last year, 2.5 crore people were affected; 960 people lost their lives, while 7.36 lakh homes were washed away.

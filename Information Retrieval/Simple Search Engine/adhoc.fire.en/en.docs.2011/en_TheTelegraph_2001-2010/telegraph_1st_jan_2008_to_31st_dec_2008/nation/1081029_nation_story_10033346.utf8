          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Modi: VHP attack                                  
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 28: Those crying human rights violations against Narendra Modi may have found a kindred spirit that will stand out like a sore thumb: the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).        
	The VHP, which belongs to the Sangh parivar but had fallen out with the Gujarat chief minister, has levelled allegations of human rights violations against him after police arrested its state general secretary. The charge: sending text messages to defame the chief minister and foment communal tension.        
	This is a clear case of human rights violation. We will approach the human rights commission and also take legal steps against the police and the government, VHP state secretary Ranchhod Bharwad said.         
	The VHP is not known to have levelled similar charges against the government during the riots of 2002 when many people were killed.        
	The police crackdown signals the complete breakdown of ties between Modi and the VHP, which had once lent its machinery to help the BJP but not during the last elections which the chief minister swept on his own steam.        
	Curtains went up on the text-message drama last evening when Ashwin Patel, the state VHP general secretary, and another office-bearer, Devjibhai Rawat, were reported missing. VHP leader Pravin Togadia threatened to file a kidnapping case.        
	Gandhinagar superintendent of police M.L. Minama today said the duo had been called for interrogation regarding the text messages. While Patel was placed under arrest, Rawat was released this afternoon.        
	He said Patel had been sending messages against Modi from his mobile phone for the last three months to create communal tension. The VHP leader had also obtained a SIM card on forged documents, the officer added.

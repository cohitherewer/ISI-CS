          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Bhubaneswar, June 11: The pro-active efforts of Ganjam district administration for implementing the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) has borne fruit. It has ranked second in the country in implementing the job scheme.        
	From wages through bank cheques to toll-free telephone for labourers  the Ganjam officials had done it all to take the NREGS benefits to the remotest corner of the district.        
	Ganjam, in a recent survey report, has been placed next to Dungarpur district in Rajasthan in providing 100 per cent jobs to families by the end of March 31.         
	In Ganjam, 3,78,584 persons have been registered under the rural job scheme, while 3,76,291 persons have been provided with job cards.         
	Ganjam was the first district in the state to provide wages to labourers through bank cheques to check tampering. About 95 per cent of the wage labourers are paid through banks and the remaining five per cent are being paid in cash.         
	The district was also the first one to install toll-free telephone for immediate redressal of grievances. A toll-free number (1077) is open round-the-clock and attended by volunteers from Nehru Yuva Kendra.         
	Six volunteers trained in documentation of complaints have been deployed at the district headquarters to handle the calls and each block has two volunteers for the purpose. By the end of March, the NREGS site reported that the district had provided 100-day jobs to 13,629 households and generated 71.4 lakh man days during 2007-08. In the past two months, the district had generated about 14.04 lakh man days.         
	Our targets are to generate about one crore man days by the end of June and provide 100 day jobs to 1 lakh households, said district collector K. Pandiyan.         
	Continuing with the development, Ganjam has been able to check distress migration to a great extent. Of the total 5lakh (approximation) families in the district, 1.5 lakh are now working. Renovation of ponds and construction of roads have been the major works, Pandiyan said. All credit should go to the hardworking people of Ganjam, he summed up.        
	Teams keen to learn the ways in which the feat was achieved are visiting the district now. A team from Chhattisgarh, including officials and representatives, visited Ganjam on a three-day tour recently to learn and replicate similar methods in their state.         
	The 26-member team comprised residents of Bastar, Kanke and Dantewada with additional project directors of the district rural development agencies, block development officers and local representatives, including village panchayat heads and computer programmers.

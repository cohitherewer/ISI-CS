          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 27: A 15-year-old Delhi schoolgirl who was beaten by her teacher last November and slipped into a coma in January died in hospital last night.        
	Rinki Kaushiks family demanded that the teacher, Dhirendra Kumar Dinkar, be arrested for murder but doctors at the hospital said it wasnt clear if his blow had caused the death. The body has been sent for post-mortem.        
	Dinkar had whacked Rinki on her shoulders with a stick because the Class X student did not attend the private coaching classes he ran, police officers said.        
	The girl seemed to have recovered enough to return to her classes after a few days before the privately-run Dinkar Public School closed for the winter break.        
	But on January 7, Rinki slipped into a coma and was admitted to the Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in west Delhis Punjabi Bagh. Doctors said the coma had been brought on by a spinal injury at the base of the neck  round about the place where Dinkar hit her.        
	The Delhi government inquired into the incident and de-recognised the school, which had violated several norms, on March 4.        
	Rinki died at 11.55 last night. Her father Naresh Kaushik today said the girl had a pre-existing back problem that might have been aggravated by the teachers blow.        
	The Supreme Court has banned corporal punishment but a government study last year revealed that two of every three school-going children in India are beaten at school.        
	Naresh alleged that the police had ignored a blatant case of corporal punishment which, he claims, eventually led to Rinkis death.        
	I complained to the police five days after the teacher hit Rinki. They did not even register a case, he said.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (east Delhi), Ajay Chaudhry, accepted that no case had been registered against Dinkar  who happens to be the son of the schools owner  at the time of Kaushiks complaint.        
	However, we did question the teacher. And once the girl went into a coma and her father repeated his complaint, we did file a case, he said.        
	Dinkar is charged with voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation. The police may arrest him and further charge him with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, sources said.

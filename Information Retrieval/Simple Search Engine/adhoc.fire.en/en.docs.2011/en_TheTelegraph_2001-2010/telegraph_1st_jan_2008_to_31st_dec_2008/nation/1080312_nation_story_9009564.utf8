The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia pill for next election: work harder
                                                                                                               Sonia pill for next election: work harder
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, March 11: Sonia Gandhi said she was very disappointed with the string of defeats the Congress has faced in recent state elections and asked her party to work harder for the next, hardselling the aam aadmi agenda and the budget.        
	The Congress president sought to end speculation of an early general election  by October or November 2008  and spoke of preparing for it next year.        
	We have a busy election schedule for Vidhan Sabhas over the next few months. We must learn from our recent experiences, understand the reasons for these setbacks and work collectively to rectify them, Sonia told party MPs.         
	The Congress would also have to choose its candidates more carefully, craft its strategies better and be more united and disciplined, she said. Sources said Sonia stressed on careful candidate selection because of the partys disastrous experience with giving tickets indiscriminately to defectors in Gujarat and Nagaland.        
	Many political parties are naturally trying to take credit for what our government has achieved in this budget. The plain and simple truth is that it is our party and our government alone that has taken these bold measures, Sonia said, signalling that the Congress would flog the aam aadmi thrust in the budget and not allow allies to walk away with the credit.        
	The Congress president asked the party to help farmers get their loans waived. We must remember that the loan-waiver scheme has to be completed by June 30 and, therefore, work on preparing this database (district-wise data of loan beneficiaries) has to begin immediately, she said.        
	The budget had announced a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.        
	Sceptics in the party, however, wondered if there was reason to be as gung-ho about the budget bonanza as Sonia was. A cabinet minister raised some questions:        
	 If the waiver would send a wrong message to debtors who had never defaulted on their payments;        
	 How farmers in dry-land areas would benefit because those who owned two hectares (five acres) of land  the upper limit to qualify for a complete loan waiver  never got bank loans in the first place. Only those with reasonably large holdings get bank loans, and they dont qualify for the waiver.         
	The Congress should demand that all debtors in dry-land areas be covered, the minister said.        
	 Why the one-time waiver should not cover poultry farmers, fishermen, weavers and sericulturists?        
	At the start of the address, Sonia said: For us, these policies and programmes have nothing at all to do with elections. They have to do with our basic ideology and with our priorities, which remain the same whether we are in or out of power.         
	But later, she linked these with elections. Inevitably, we have also to start preparing for the Lok Sabha polls next year. We will go into these polls with an outstanding record of achievements, both in terms of government programmes and of legislation enacted.         
	These achievements should earn for us the trust and mandate of the people once again. These achievements should give us a firm sense of self-confidence to take on our political opponents.        
	Sources said she departed from her prepared text to inform the MPs that the Prime Minister would try to bring the UPA allies on board on the womens reservation bill once Parliament goes into recess.

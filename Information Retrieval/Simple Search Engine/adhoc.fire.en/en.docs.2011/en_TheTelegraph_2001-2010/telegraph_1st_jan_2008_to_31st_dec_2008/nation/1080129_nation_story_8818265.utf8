                                                                                                            Civic body finds answer in public-private model 
  - Facelift for bhubaneswar crematorium          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          A crematorium                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: The capital citys electric crematorium is slated for a makeover, as Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to shape up the previous one on a public-private partnership module.        
	Five years ago, the previous crematorium had stopped functioning after electric consumption soared exponentially. Ever since, the pillaged equipment have been lying around.         
	The faulty design of the previous crematorium drove the last nail. The crematorium ran into losses largely because the electric coil, of a substandard quality, would take hours to get heated and subsequently the process became a costly affair. Besides, rains flooded the crematorium and stagnating water resulted in problems. With poor patronage, the faults were not repaired.        
	The corporation has once again resolved to make the defunct crematorium operational and has appointed a consultant for the same. We will soon be inviting tenders from agencies, who will hopefully give us a proper model to execute the plan, said BMC commissioner Aparajita Sarangi. The BMC also plans to take up landscaping on the crematorium premises.        
	Elaborating on the strategy that the BMC is contemplating to put in place for the crematorium at Satya Nagar, Sarangi said the civic body was planning to utilise the surrounding area  around 2 acres  for development.        
	The crematorium is already in place alongside a more conventional yard. The building for the system is already in place with water supply system.         
	All that needs to be done is to set up an electric transformer and replace the electric plates. The environment-friendly facility, the only one in the city, will have two furnaces. The workers who perform the last rites at the burial ground would be serving at the electric crematorium also, which would function from 8am to 6pm.        
	According to corporation officials, the furnaces could generate a maximum temperature of up to 1,100Degree Celsius and the average time required for cremating a body would be 45 minutes (approximately). The family would be handed ashes after three hours. Relatives would be required to fill up forms to use the facility and in the case of unnatural deaths, copies of the police and post-mortem reports must be produced.        
	The BMC would reportedly develop a skating track and a health club in the vacant space. The revenue to be generated from the units would thereafter supplement the funds required for running the electric crematorium. The corporation, it is learnt, would levy a fee of around Rs 1,000 for cremating a body, besides a refundable deposit of Rs 200.         
	The corporation has already approved the schemes in previous meetings and is now mulling to facelift the burial ground for the Muslim community.

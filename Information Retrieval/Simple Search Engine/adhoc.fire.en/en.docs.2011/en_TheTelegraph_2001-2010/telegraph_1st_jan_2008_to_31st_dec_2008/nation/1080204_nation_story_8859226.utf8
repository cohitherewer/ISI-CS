	Mumbai, Feb. 3: The desperation to carve a vote bank nurtured by the Shiv Sena ahead of next years Lok Sabha and Assembly elections may have triggered Raj Thackerays verbal volleys against north Indians.
    
	Raj quit the Shiv Sena in November 2005 over differences with cousin Uddhav after Sena chief Bal Thackeray chose his son as his political successor. He launched his party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, in March 2006.
    
	Raj, who shares not only his fiery oratory but also his love for political cartooning with his 81-year-old uncle, pitched his party as one with a moderate outlook.
    
	Instead of borrowing the Senas ideology and its saffron colour, he created his own tri-coloured flag, with three horizontal stripes in saffron, blue and green. The last two colours represented Dalits and Muslims. 
    
	Before the partys launch, the 38-year-old toured the state to gauge the mood of voters. He harped on the need to recruit young, educated Marathi voters, at ease with English and moderate in views. At party meetings, he lectured on dressing well and behaving politely. While Raj had some militant elements of the Shiv Sena in his fold, his party didnt protest against Valentines Day, a recurrent theme of agitation for the Sena.
    
	The first key test for Rajs party was the municipal polls in 10 cities, including Mumbai, on February 1, 2007. But the Navnirman Sena bagged only seven seats in Mumbai compared with the Shiv Senas 79. It won 35 across the state. 
    
	Our party has reached every home. It looks like it has attracted first-time voters. It is important to reach out to people. Votes and seats will come eventually, Raj had then said. 
    
	Since those polls, the party has struggled to carve its own identity. Preparations have now begun in the state for the 2009 Assembly polls. Mayavatis BSP was the first to launch its campaign, trying to repeat the Dalit-Brahmin-Muslim combination that clicked in Uttar Pradesh last year. BJP president Rajnath Singh has led a yatra to six Vidarbha districts affected by farmer suicides. 
    
	Rajs new agenda clearly seems to be to snatch away the hardline Marathi voters from the Shiv Sena. Raj was always a mirror image of Balasaheb but this time he is positioning himself as his successor for protecting the Marathi agenda, says Vaibhav Purandare, author of The Sena Story, a book that chronicles the rise of the Shiv Sena.
    
	A senior BJP leader who has seen Raj closely in the Sena echoed Purandare. North Indian voters were never on Rajs agenda. The Shiv Sena has also learnt that playing the Hindutva card brings them more seats than the Marathi card. Raj is taking advantage of the Senas silence on the sons-of-the-soil issue. 
    
	Mumbais problems are not linguistic or religious. It is a city bursting at its seams and increasingly locals feel that the influx is affecting their quality of life. We also feel that immigrants should be stopped from entering Mumbai, but we dont want to use it politically. North Indians form a large chunk of the voters and cant be ignored, said the BJP leader who wished to remain anonymous. 
    
	Rajs hardline ways go back some way. His supporters in the Shiv Sena had allegedly attacked students from Bihar travelling to Mumbai for a railway recruitment exam at Kalyan station and vandalised examination centres, forcing the test to be postponed. The attack derailed Uddhavs Mee Mumbaikar campaign  that Mumbai belonged to all its residents, irrespective of origin. The fracas sent the wrong signals to migrants and later prompted the Sena to wind up the campaign.
    
	Rajs verbal attacks on Amitabh Bachchan (saying the actors loyalties lie in Uttar Pradesh), and the celebration of Chhath puja and Uttar Pradesh Divas in Mumbai are reminiscent of Bal Thackerays campaign against south Indian migrants in the 1960s.
    
	Alleging marginalisation of the Marathi population after the states formation in 1966, the Sena had targeted mushrooming Udipi restaurants and the recruitment of south Indians in public sector undertakings before the party moved on and embraced Hindutva.

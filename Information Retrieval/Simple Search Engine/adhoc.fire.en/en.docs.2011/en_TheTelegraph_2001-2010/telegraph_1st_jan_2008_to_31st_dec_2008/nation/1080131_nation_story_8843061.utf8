	Raipur, Jan. 30: Humanity seems to be the new buzzword for Chhattisgarh police. 
    
	Senior state officers have decided to arrange for the school fees of two children of a Maoist leader, who was arrested last week in Raipur. 
    
	Police on February 22 arrested Shantipriya and her accomplice Meena Chowdhary from a hostel in connection with an arms haul. Based on leads provided by Shantipriya, the police then nabbed Calcutta-based publisher Asit Sengupta, a freelance journalist Prafulla Jha and a travel agent Siddharth Sharma, as abettors to rebel activities. 
    
	When the state police raided Shantipriyas Bhilai residence, about 40km from Raipur, they seized nine foreign pistols, five country-made pistols and Rs 5.31 lakh  the familys savings. Her husband, who the police believe is a rebel, too, has been absconding ever since  leaving the children, Sneha and Raja, alone in the city. 
    
	The two high school kids were left with minimum security and no money while their school fees were also long due. Further delay could have prevented them from appearing in annual examinations. 
    
	Police chief Vishwa Ranjan asked officers to take care of the requirement, admitted a senior police officer. The authorities arranged for Rs 1,600 and sent it through a constable to the school to clear the dues.
    
	The authorities also arranged for food and items of daily need. And it seems that the officers have put in that little extra by requesting school authorities to not discriminate against the children as it would affect their academics. 
    
	One relative of the family who lives in Andhra Pradesh has approached the state police and submitted an application in the court of sub-divisional magistrate to take the children in his possession. 
    
	Meanwhile, Shantipriya has been taken into police remand till February 4. 
    
	Meanwhile she would be interrogated by police parties from Bengal, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Kerala.

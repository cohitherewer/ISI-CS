The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flowers for train from Mumbai 
                                                                                                            Flowers for train from Mumbai

	Lucknow, Feb. 5: Raj Thackerays rowdies said it with stones. Residents of Varanasi today replied with flowers.        
	Volunteers from a social outfit in the city of redemption scrambled onto compartments of the Lok Manya Tilak-Varanasi Express as soon as it entered Varanasi Central station this morning, searched out Marathi passengers and welcomed them with hugs, garlands and sandalwood paste.        
	Others tossed petals in the air or blew conch shells as the tense Marathi pilgrims, expecting a hostile reception after Thackerays outburst against north Indian migrants in Maharashtra, let out sighs of relief.        
	When the youths entered the train, we thought we were in for trouble after what the rowdies of Raj Thackerays Navnirman Sena did in Maharashtra. But all fears disappeared after the hugs and the floral welcome, said Damodar Gokhale, who is leading a 35-strong group to the holy Uttar Pradesh city.        
	Its a tribute to Varanasi, which has always upheld the spirit of social amity, said Rukmini Patil, an elderly woman who boarded the train from Mumbai with husband Vinayak.        
	The city police had sent a team to the station after being alerted that 150-odd volunteers from the Vande Mataram Sangharsh Samiti, led by convener Anup Jaiswal, had reached shortly before the trains scheduled 9.15 arrival.        
	But the cops relaxed once they realised the volunteers were trying to ease tensions with their own version of Gandhigiri  or the rediscovery of satyagraha in the Sanjay Dutt starrer Lage Raho Munnabhai.        
	It is wrong to return violence with violence. Raj Thackerays loss of sense can be dealt with flowers, said Jaiswal, sounding like a true Munnabhai follower.        
	The Marathi passengers soon joined the Varanasi youths in chanting slogans against Thackeray and the violence in Maharashtra.        
	Raj to apna yar hai, abhi to voh bimar hai (Raj is our friend but he is sick now), they chorused. Raj se apni yari hai, patthar par phool bhari hai (we have friendship with Raj, flowers are ultimately stronger than stones).        
	Varanasi has been home to many Marathis for generations. Areas along the banks of the Ganga like Durga Ghat, Shitla Ghat, Ram Ghat, Brahmha Ghat, Panchganga Ghat and Assi Ghat have nearly 900 Marathi-speaking families.        
	The volunteers vowed to protect these families from any attack triggered by Thackerays hate campaign.         
	The floral gesture will give a befitting reply to Raj Thackerays goons, said Sadhna Vedanti, who is originally from Maharashtra.

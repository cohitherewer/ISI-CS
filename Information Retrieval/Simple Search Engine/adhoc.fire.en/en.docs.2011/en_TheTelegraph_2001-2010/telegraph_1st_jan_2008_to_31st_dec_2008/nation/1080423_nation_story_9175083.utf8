	London, April 22 (PTI): A 32-year-old Indian-origin man has been sentenced to five years of imprisonment in a human trafficking case.        
	Asif Patel, a mobile phone shop owner, was a key player in the gang which used forged passports and documents to bring thousands of Indians into the UK.        
	He was found guilty of a conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry into the UK at Leicester Crown Court in January and was sentenced yesterday.        
	The court was told that his role in the scam included handling of the money taken from the clients, which was as high as 8,000. Patel sent money to contacts in India who recruited the clients, using a money exchange bureau, Bolton News reported.

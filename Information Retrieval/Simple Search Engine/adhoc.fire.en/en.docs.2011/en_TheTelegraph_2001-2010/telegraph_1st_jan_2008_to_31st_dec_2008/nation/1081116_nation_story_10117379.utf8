          AMIT ROY                           Trevor Abrahamson in the main hall of Jersey House                                   
	London, Nov. 15: Jersey House, a London residence put up for sale with a price tag of 40 million even in these difficult times, is hoping to get a Bollywood owner.        
	Anyone rich enough to afford the property would be welcome, but Trevor Abrahamson, managing director of Glentree Estates Agents who is acting on behalf of Fitzroy, the property company that has built Jersey House, is making a special pitch at the badshahs of Bollywood.         
	Judging from the kind of home Shah Rukh Khan has in Bandra in Mumbai, one can understand why Abrahamson thinks Jersey House could be just right for a dollar-rich desi.         
	It is located at 62, The Bishops Avenue, on the Highgate/Hampstead borders in north London in a street and an area full of millionaire Indians.         
	For example, 10 doors along, Lakshmi Mittal still has his place, The Summer Palace, which was his first home when he arrived in London in late 1995. Mittal now lives in Kensington Palace Gardens but he hasnt sold The Summer Palace yet.         
	We have not skimped on anything, said a man from Fitzroy, as Abrahamsons colleague, Jeremy Gee, gave The Telegraph a guided tour of the property.         
	The area  20,000sqft  means the eight bedrooms all have luxurious bathrooms fitted in marble. The main bedroom boasts his/her bathrooms with dressing rooms.         
	Every room, even the bathrooms, appears to have a plasma screen. The wooden doors are dark-stained walnut which contrasts with the pale of the 400/sqmetre limestone marble from Italy. The marble has been laid down with exquisite precision even managing curves with perfection.         
	The built-in sound system, which would enable the Bollywood star to listen to the soundtrack from his latest release, requires 1,000 cables apparently. And for the post-private screening party  Jersey House has a cinema  the kitchen can handle 250 guests. For servants, there is a separate entrance and a separate flat.         
	And finally, there is a hidden and air-conditioned strong room, entered via a steel door, which provides secure storage space for jewellery and, say, M.F. Husains paintings.         
	Abrahamson explained why he thought Jersey House was crying out for an Indian owner. The reason why it could be suitable for a wealthy Indian is that, number one, there are a number of wealthy Indians, in fact quite a big community, in north-west London; and, secondly, it is self-evident that to live in The Bishops Avenue is a status symbol  its like having a Rolls-Royce, he said.        
	Certainly, it is a very safe investment, economically and politically, Abrahamson pointed out. A lot of the base currency of Indian families is dollars. And in dollar terms (because the pound has weakened against the dollar), they are getting a 25 per cent discount. If you live in The Bishops Avenue, you have arrived.

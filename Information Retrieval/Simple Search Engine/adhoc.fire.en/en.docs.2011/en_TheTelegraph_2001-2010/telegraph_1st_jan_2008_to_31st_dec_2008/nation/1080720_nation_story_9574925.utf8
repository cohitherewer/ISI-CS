	Indore, July 19 (PTI): An IIT aspirant ran away from his coaching class here because he was unable to cope with the pressure, police said today.         
	Vivek Purohit, 17, of Shivpuri district, disappeared on July 14. He was preparing for IIT admissions in a reputed coaching institute in the Palasia area.        
	A few hours after his disappearance, Vivek rang up his family and said he had been kidnapped. His family lodged a complaint with the police, who began searching for him.        
	However, Vivek returned home yesterday, before the police could get any leads.        
	Additional superintendent of police, Indore, Mahesh Chand Jain said Vivek was unable to bear the pressure of studies and that he often missed his coaching class.        
	Quoting Vivek, Jain said that after running away from Indore, the student went to Ujjain, Kota, Bheelwada and Agra and then returned home.        
	Viveks family blamed the coaching institute for demoralising him, alleging that teachers had been telling him that he would never be admitted into an IIT.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 5: Over a dozen Lok Sabha members from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have given a notice for a privilege motion against Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for denigrating Parliament.        
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said he would decide on the notice and consider action after following the due process.        
	Thackeray, who avoided adding fuel to the fire when his estranged nephew Raj recently lashed out at north Indian migrants in Maharashtra, attacked Parliament in an editorial for discussing the issue when the country faced more serious crises.         
	In the article in Sena mouthpiece Saamna, he said Parliament had fanned a dead fire.        
	Thackeray claimed that Maharashtrians were abused in Parliament discussion and warned that Biharis in the state could face a backlash.        
	The Sena boss targeted Biharis in general and described leaders from the state as pigs from hell and accused them of maligning the Ganga with the stream of bloodshed, corruption, casteism and crime.        
	He also targeted individual MPs from the state, calling them criminals and murderers.        
	He said the behaviour of the MPs had revealed the true face of Biharis, who are disliked by the whole country.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Aug. 24: If it wasnt for the saffron angavastram, the team would pass off as school inspectors from the directorate of education.        
	Once in class, they hold a brief question-answer session. Students are asked to name the chief minister and his party symbol. At the end, the team leader asks the children to prevail upon their parents to vote for the ruling BJP.        
	Welcome to the BJPs new campaign strategy in Bhopal.        
	Party leaders are visiting government schools in the Madhya Pradesh capital and distributing uniforms free of cost. But nothing comes free.        
	Once the uniforms have been handed out to the predominantly lower and lower-middle class students, a small lecture follows. The children are told their gifts are coming from a benevolent chief minister from the BJP, the party that has the lotus as its symbol.         
	So come November, the students should ensure their parents vote for the right party.         
	An angry and somewhat bewildered Congress has rushed to the state election commission armed with a CD that shows local BJP functionaries campaigning inside the Government Girls Senior Secondary School at Bairagarh.         
	The Congress delegation, which includes state unit chief Suresh Pachauri, has also sought the intervention of chief secretary Rakesh Sahni and police.        
	Cases of alluring voters and employing wrongful means to attract voters should be registered against the BJP, demanded Pachauri.        
	But Prakash Mirchandani, general secretary of the state BJPs traders cell who is seen in the CD telling students to put their foot down and change the world, doesnt see any wrong in the campaign.

	New Delhi, April 23 (PTI): The national consumer commission has held that a person suffering from dyspepsia  a painful form of indigestion  cannot be denied the assured sum by an insurance firm on the ground of non-disclosure as it is not a disease.         
	In todays world, people face problems like acidity, indigestion, back pain and headache, which are sometimes chronic in nature. They cannot be considered diseases, which require to be enumerated while answering questionnaire of the LIC in its proposal form, said the panel headed by Justice M.B. Shah.        
	Dismissing a revision petition of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) against an order by the Madhya Pradesh consumer commission, the panel directed the firm to pay the assured sum of Rs 50,000 to Chandra Kant Lohande, widow of public sector employee Kanti Kumar. It held the repudiation of policy as unjust and improper and also imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on the LIC.        
	Kumar, an employee of Western Coalfields, had obtained the policy with a quarterly premium of Rs 1,404 in March 1992. The LIC, however, denied the assured sum to his widow, claiming he was a chronic patient of dyspepsia.        
	The firm submitted his employers certificates to back its argument that Kumar had taken medical leave every year from 1993 to 1997 for treatment as an outdoor patient.        
	But the commission said that in government departments, medical leave was liberally taken as it could neither be accumulated beyond a particular time nor be encashed.

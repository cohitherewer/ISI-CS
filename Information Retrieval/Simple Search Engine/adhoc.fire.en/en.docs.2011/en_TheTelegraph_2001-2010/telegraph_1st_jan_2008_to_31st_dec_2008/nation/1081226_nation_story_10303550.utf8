	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP brass are saying the disappointing state election results were caused by strategic deficiencies, not unfavourable issues or a stronger Opposition, forcing senior leaders into introspection.        
	Demands for changes in the BJPs organisational structure are also being heard at various levels. Party sources say that while a shake-up is improbable so close to the general election, there may be changes in the approach to poll management.        
	The Sangh feels that the Delhi and Rajasthan defeats were mainly the result of internal factors, a worry for a party that prides itself on its poll management. Sangh leaders argue that lack of co-ordination and unity between BJP leaders and Sangh cadres affected the outcomes.        
	The Sangh believes that the Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh chief ministers worked within the larger parivar framework, but the Rajasthan chief minister tried to run a parallel structure, almost in defiance of the Sanghs wishes.         
	It is being claimed that Vasundhara Raje was retained as the BJPs mascot despite opposition from a party lobby close to the Sangh. This group believes the party would never have lost Rajasthan had Raje been more accommodating.        
	Sangh and BJP leaders are convinced the party lost in Delhi not because of poor selection of issues or the absence of popular support, but because of a lack of harmony of purpose, from the selection of candidates and would-be chief minister to campaign management.         
	The Rajasthan and Delhi blows came after last years success in Gujarat, where the BJP won despite the Sanghs non-cooperation. But unlike Gujarat, neither Rajasthan nor Delhi had a Narendra Modi or a polarised polity.        
	L.K. Advani, too, has blamed the two defeats on the partys own follies. The Congress did not win, the BJP lost, he was quoted by leaders as saying at yesterdays meeting of party officials.        
	Advani is said to have spoken of factionalism and nepotism in the party and called for objectivity in candidate selection. Yours and my considerations should not guide candidate selection, he said.        
	Unlike Advani, who is trying to distance himself from the system by criticising the selections, party chief Rajnath Singh is trying to defend the decisions citing how the BJP won more seats overall than the Congress in the five states.

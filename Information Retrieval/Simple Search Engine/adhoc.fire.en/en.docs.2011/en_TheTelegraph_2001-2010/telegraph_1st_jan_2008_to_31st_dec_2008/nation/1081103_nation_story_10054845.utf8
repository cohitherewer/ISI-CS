	New Delhi, Nov. 2: American couple Iftah and Martha Mashav had picked up a street dog in Virginia because they didnt want to shell out money to get a pet. Now, having lost Luka on the streets of Delhi, they are ready to pay Rs 1 lakh to get him back.        
	Luka, who panicked and ran out of the Mashavs Chanakyapuri home on Diwali when a cracker burst near him, is a son, explained Martha, a US embassy employee here.        
	We had adopted Luka last December. He is a mixed breed and not worth much money. But he is like a son to us, she said. Thats why we are offering the huge amount to anyone who finds him.        
	Luka had been enjoying himself since arriving in Delhi with the couple on August 29.        
	The autorickshaw drivers all knew him and Luka loved riding the rickshaws, Martha said. Some drivers even refused to take money from us.        
	But on Diwali night, we were in the garden and a small band arrived, playing drums and singing. A loud firecracker nearby frightened Luka.        
	The couple have pasted Lukas pictures in the locality, asking anyone with information to call them at 09801302769 or contact the embassy.

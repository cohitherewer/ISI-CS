	Jhansi, Jan. 29: Whats the surest way of keeping Mayavati awake? Simple: Just ask Rahul Gandhi to sleep in a Dalits hut.
    
	The Bahujan Samaj Party chief, wide-eyed with fear that the young Gandhi was making inroads into her backward-caste vote-bank, went full blast at the Congress today at a massive rally in drought-hit Bundelkhand, the cradle of her partys Dalit politics.
    
	The Congress, she said, was trying to take political advantage of the regions economic crisis and resorting to abject tokenism to woo back the Dalits.
    
	Let the Congress yuvraj (crown prince) dine and sleep in the hut of a Dalit. Dalits and backwards wont be impressed, nor will they be grateful to him, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said. This has only exposed the Congress desperation to regain its lost ground among Dalits.
    
	The allusion was to Rahuls surprise move to sleep in the hut of a Dalit in Amethi on January 26 after a frugal meal with the family.
    
	Earlier, on January 16 and 17, the Amethi MP had toured Bundelkhand and addressed a rally where he slammed the Mayavati government for farmer suicides and cattle deaths in seven drought-hit districts  Mahoba, Banda, Chitrakoot, Hamirpur, Lalitpur, Jhansi and Jalone.
    
	Rahul alleged that only 5 paise of every rupee meant for development reached the regions downtrodden. The Congress also called for carving a separate state out of the region.
    
	At todays public meeting, named Bundelkhand Hakeekat Maha Rally  or a rally to reveal the truth about Bundelkhand  Mayavati tried to blunt the Congress criticism with a Rs 900-crore package for the region.

	The Congress government at the Centre did not sanction any of the economic packages I had asked for, she said.
    
	Even now, the Congress-led governments approach to the poor is disrespectful. The central governments rozgar yojna (income guarantee scheme)  offers Rs 100 for 100 days per year. This is not the money to live with dignity. The poor are not beggars.
    
	She said the Congress and other parties were to blame for the regions backwardness. The Congress, which ruled the state for 38 years, and other parties, which were in power for 19 years, are responsible for the prevailing crisis, she said.
    
	The chief minister also visited Barwara, a village where cattle and humans had fallen victim to long, dry spell.
    
	According to a survey by a non-government organisation, around 250 farmers in the region had committed suicide over the last two years, while four years of drought had killed cattle worth Rs 50 crore, said P.S. Gautam, the additional director of the states animal husbandry department.
    
	The official today announced a Rs 12.87-crore package for the seven affected districts, while newspapers carried huge advertisements with warnings from BSP ministers not to waste water. Let water be preserved, read one hoarding across a city street.
    
	A 10-member team led by National Rainfed Agricultural Authority director-general J.N. Samra had visited Mahoba, Chitrakoot and Jhansi last week and accepted that the region had been adversely affected by drought.
    
	Governor T.V. Rajeswar also visited some of the affected districts.
    
	Sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might tour the region next month

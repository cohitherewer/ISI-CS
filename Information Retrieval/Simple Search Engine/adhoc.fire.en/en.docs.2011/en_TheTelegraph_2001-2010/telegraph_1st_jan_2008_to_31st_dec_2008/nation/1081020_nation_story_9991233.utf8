	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 19: Veterinary doctors today threatened to cease work from November 1 and tender mass resignations if the state government did not meet their demands before the end of this month.        
	Members of the Orissa Veterinary Association have been demanding the upgrade of entry level scale of pay of veterinary doctors to Rs 8,000 to 13,500 with junior class I status according to the recommendation of the fifth central pay commission.        
	The other demands included restructuring of Orissa Veterinary Service cadre post creating adequate promotional avenues, implementation of assured career progression scheme, provision of non-practising allowances at 25 per cent of the basic pay, rent-free accommodation to all veterinary doctors, enhancement of retirement of age to 60 years and complete parity with medical officers in respect of scale of pay and career prospects.        
	Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have already extended the pay scale and other facilities.

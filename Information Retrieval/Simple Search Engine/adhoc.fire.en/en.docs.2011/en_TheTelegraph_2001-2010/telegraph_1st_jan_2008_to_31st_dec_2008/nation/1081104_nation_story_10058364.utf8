          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 3: Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB), has entered into a partnership with the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) and Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS), doubling itself as a State Training and Resource Centre.        
	With it, the premier B-school becomes the first management institution in India to undertake such a project.         
	The aim of the programmes operated by the centre will be to train participants to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS with active participation of the target community.         
	The programme will also aim to help develop a sense of passion and a certain level of commitment to the task at hand, among the participants. Overall, the objective would be to create an atmosphere conducive to both, learning and unlearning, as the case may be.        
	Participants passing out of these programmes would go on to become consultants for implementation of target intervention among the target groups like female sex workers, men having sex with men, injecting drug users, and migrant truckers and labourers, said S. Peppin, the co-ordinator of the centre.        
	In August last year, XIMB had conducted a leadership and managerial proficiency programme, a certificate-level course attempting to build personal and professional capacity of HIV-positive individuals.         
	The faculty and their family members, students and staff of XIMB were highly sensitised along with 30 partner organisations, which provided field-learning support to the participants of the programme.         
	XIMB will work in partnership with Naco, OSACS and various other NGOs.         
	Training programmes would be conducted so that the participants can act as trainers and facilitators for targeted interventions among high-risk groups. Participants will be sourced from members of the partner organisations.

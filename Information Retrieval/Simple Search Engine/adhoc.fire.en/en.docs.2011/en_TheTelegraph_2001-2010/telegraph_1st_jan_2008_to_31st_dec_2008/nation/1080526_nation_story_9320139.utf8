          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 25: Actresses Bidusmita Mantri and Leslie Tripathy have again alleged that Raja Acharya had been making threat calls to them from jail premises.         
	The duo today sought the help of the deputy commissioner of police, Himanshu Lal.         
	He has threatened to blow my place up. He has given similar threats to Leslie and Jubuli Sunderray, said Bidusmita. Both actresses have claimed to have received at least 200 calls from the gangster.         
	We could identify his voice. Besides, sometimes he would also introduce himself, said Bidusmita.         
	Police and jail authorities have been at a loss to comprehend how an isolated gangster is managing to make calls despite the strict security.         
	Last week, after Leslie made similar allegations, Raja was shifted to a special cell and was kept handcuffed.         
	Meanwhile, Jubuli lodged a complaint at Shahidnagar police station last night alleging that Rajas mother, Nalini Panda, had threatened her, Leslie, Bidusmita and her brother Arun Mantri to withdraw a case against him.         
	Jubuli Sundaray has claimed that the threats were conveyed at his residence in the presence of his personal security officer.

	New Delhi, Jan. 11: A political push for a framework to resolve differences on the border and intensive commercial ties are likely to dominate the agenda for Manmohan Singhs three-day visit to China beginning Sunday. 
    
	The Prime Minister leaves tomorrow night with a delegation that includes industrialists and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, who is also Indias special representative for talks to resolve and settle the boundary dispute. 
    
	Narayanan and his counterpart Dai Bingquo will meet on the sidelines of Singhs meetings with Premier Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao. 
    
	Essentially, they are trying to arrive at a framework for the boundary question, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today. 
    
	Singhs first visit to Beijing as Prime Minister follows a year in which India-China exchanges were scaled up. Bilateral trade totalled $37 billion  second after the US. China enjoys a positive trade balance and a suggestion from the business delegation would concern ways in which exports from India can be increased.

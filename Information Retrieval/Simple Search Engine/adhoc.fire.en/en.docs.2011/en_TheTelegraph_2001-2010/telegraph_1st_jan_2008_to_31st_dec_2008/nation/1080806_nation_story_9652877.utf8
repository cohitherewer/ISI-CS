	Srinagar, Aug. 5: Two policemen battling Amarnath protesters in a Jammu town were suspected to have been killed today, a day after the death of two agitators in firing.        
	The suspected deaths of law-keepers occurred when a mob of thousands with sticks and stones overran a police outpost at Jourian, 50km from Jammu, and torched it.        
	Atul Sharma, sub-divisional police officer of Jourian, had to hide in an army post after he was chased by the crowd, which also damaged government offices.        
	Sharma described the two policemen as critically injured but police sources said they were dead. The clashes left 11 policemen and a dozen protesters injured.         
	We have been able to evacuate the injured with the help of army. Our post was torched, Sharma said. At least a dozen policemen were inside when the post was set afire.         
	In Samba, where the two youths were killed yesterday, the protesters uprooted a stretch of the tracks near Gaghwal as the authorities concentrated on freeing highways.         
	As our focus remained on the restoration of national highways, the agitators targeted the railways and uprooted 2.5km of the track, Samba deputy commissioner Saurav Bhagat said. Hundreds joined the funeral procession of the two protesters.         
	Todays mob rampage came even as Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta and defence secretary Vijay Singh held meetings with the top brass of the state and the army in Srinagar on ways to contain the violence raging in Jammu and, to a relatively lesser degree, in the Valley.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called an all-party meeting in Delhi tomorrow.         
	Little seemed to have changed on the ground, though, after last evenings announcement of the all-party meeting.         
	The curfew continued in Jammu, where a strike entered its 13th day. The curfew was relaxed for three hours in Jammu and Udhampur but not in Rajouri, Samba and Bhaderwah. The army was helping clear the highways.         
	In the Valley, the backlash against the economic blockade, which has choked supplies to Kashmir and stopped fruit growers from taking their produce outside the state, a bandh was observed, though no outfit had called it.        
	J amp;K Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik, who started a fast unto death in Srinagar against the blockade, alleged a false curfew was on in Jammu and rioters have been given a free hand to block supplies to the Valley and target minorities there (in Jammu).        
	The focus of the meeting that home secretary Gupta and defence secretary Singh held with state chief secretary S.S. Kapoor was on restoration of supplies to the Valley by opening the 300km Jammu-Srinagar highway.        
	As the blockade continued, the calls to open the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road for trade became shriller. Fruit dealers have given the state until Thursday to open the link, failing which they have threatened to cross the LoC and sell stocks, in the danger of rotting, in Pakistan. Traders are looking at supplies from across the LoC.        
	Kapoor sought to calm the supply jitters, saying governor N.N. Vohra had issued clear instructions to ensure free movement of trucks on the highway.

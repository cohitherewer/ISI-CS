          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Amar Singh today mounted pressure on the Centre to seize the opportunity to act against Mayavati following the murder of a PWD executive engineer in Uttar Pradesh, allegedly by a Bahujan Samaj Party MLA.        
	The Samajwadi Party general secretary said he had met senior Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel and told them the Centre could not remain a spectator. He said he would meet Sonia Gandhi soon.        
	Amar said home minister P. Chidambaram should wake up and ask for a report from the Uttar Pradesh governor. Saying the murder was proof how Mayavati was extorting money, he said the Centre should start an income-tax probe against her. Why is the home minister not talking to the governor for a report? Even Rahul Gandhi should talk to people about this.        
	M.K. Gupta was killed for allegedly resisting a BSP drive to extort money for Mayavatis birthday celebrations. The incident offers the Samajwadis a chance to get back at the chief minister after the rout in the 2007 state polls.        
	Amar asked Mayavati to step down and surrender to police. He said Samajwadi workers would observe her birthday, January 15, as Thuthu Divas (Spitting Day).        
	Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan too wants the state governor to send a report to the Centre.        
	Samajwadi and Congress workers joined mobs in a firestorm of protests across central Uttar Pradesh today. The Samajwadis had called a statewide bandh too.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 22: Bihar government has stopped the import of chicken from Bengal as a matter of precaution against the bird flu. 
    
	The government allegedly was alarmed by hundreds of dead chickens being found from a parcel van of a train at Samastipur station yesterday. The railway administration, however, assured that the chicken died because of the journey. 
    
	Deputy chief minister and animal husbandry minister Sushil Kumar Modi said: We have decided to stop importing from Bengal not out of any direct threat, but as a matter of precaution. The deputy chief minister added that the district administration of Kishanganj, Purnea, Araria, Katihar, Banka, Jamui and Bhagalpur had been especially asked to ensure that traders did not import from adjoining Bengal. 
    
	Animal husbandry and fishery department officials has been monitoring poultry farms and wholesale and retail chicken shops. Meanwhile, chicken sale has dipped in Patna and most of Bihar districts with customers preferring fish and mutton. 
    
	No case of chicken infection, however, has been reported as yet. Though Samastipur railway authorities were worried about the 3,000 dead chickens found at the stations parcel room, district divisional commercial manager S.K. Yadav told The Telegraph: It seems that around 5,000 chickens were sent by the Maurya Express from Ranchi to Samastipur. The chicken might have died due to overloading and for not being fed for hours. 
    
	He said the railway administration had informed the district administration about the incident. Our job is to grant compensation to the trader in question. Its up to the administration to find out the reason behind the deaths. 
    
	Though Samastipur district magistrate S. Kumar could not be contacted, a senior officer said samples of the dead chicken had not been sent to a laboratory as yet. 
    
	Hajipur division spokesperson U.K. Jha said: We know of the incident but there seems to be no reason to panic as of now.

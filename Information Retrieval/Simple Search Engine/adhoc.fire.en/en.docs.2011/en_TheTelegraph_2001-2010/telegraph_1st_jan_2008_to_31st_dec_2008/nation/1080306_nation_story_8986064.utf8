          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 5: With elections round the corner, BJD chief Naveen Patnaik today called upon his party members to spread the message of his governments achievements.        
	Addressing a state-level function to mark the 92nd birth anniversary of his illustrious father and legendary leader Biju Patnaik, Naveen said BJD was launched 10 years ago with an objective to fulfil the unfulfilled dreams of the departed leader.        
	Our party and government will strive hard to fulfil his dream of making Orissa a prosperous and industrialised state, he said.        
	Listing the various programmes launched by his government for the welfare and economic development of various sections of the society, the chief minister said his government had announced a special package for farmers and launched Employment Mission for the self-employment of jobless youths. Mission Shakti has been initiated for empowerment of women, he claimed. Reach out to people and tell them about these, said Naveen        
	We all are members of Biju Parivar. Always remember his dreams and try to find out some time to help in fulfilment of these dreams, he said apparently in a bid to exploit the sentimental attachment of the people to the legendary leader.        
	Several senior leaders of the party, including vice-president and finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, secretary general and former minister Damodar Rout, agriculture minister Surendra Nath Naik, works minister A.U. Singhdeo, energy minister S.N. Patro, women and child development minister Pramila Mallick and heads of frontal organisations paid glowing tributes to Biju Patnaik.

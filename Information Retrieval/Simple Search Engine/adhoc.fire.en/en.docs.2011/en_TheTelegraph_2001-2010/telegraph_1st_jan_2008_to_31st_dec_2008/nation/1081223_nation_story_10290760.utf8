          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Jaya Bachchan had to resign from her Rajya Sabha seat because of the office-of-profit row      
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Sonia Gandhi may not have violated the office of profit provision by heading the National Advisory Council as a Lok Sabha MP, a joint parliamentary committee report has suggested.        
	The panel, set up after a controversy erupted two years ago, has kept advisory offices in the Union and states outside the purview of offices of profit in its recommendations submitted to the Lok Sabha today.        
	It has said two other categories of office should also not be deemed to be offices of profit: minister for the Union or for states and office in Parliament or legislatures.        
	The committee, headed by Iqbal Ahmed Saradgi, has said that while defining an office of profit it is essential to identify the generic criteria of the offices/posts which would not constitute offices of profit or which would not be deemed as offices of profit.        
	Advisory office means any office (by whatever name called) which is associated with purely giving counsel or recommendation on any particular subject/policy, in respect of any matter of public importance/interest and no salary or remuneration except for compensatory allowance is attached with it.        
	The committee has asked the government to revisit the amendment of Article 102(1)9(a) that regulates the matter.        
	A political storm had broken out two years ago after Jaya Bachchan, then a Rajya Sabha MP, was found holding an advisory post in the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Corporation.        
	Sonia, then a Lok Sabha MP, was sucked into the controversy as she was heading the National Advisory Council. She resigned from the House and other cultural organisations, including those connected with the Nehru-Gandhi family.        
	The committees recommendations have relieved politicians cutting across parties. A leader said: This bogus controversy would not have happened had Rashtrapati Bhavan not acted like a post office and the Election Commission viewed this matter with greater maturity.        
	The committee has hailed the philosophy behind appointing senior politicians as advisers to important institutions.        
	Certain posts like leader of Opposition have to be kept outside the purview of office of profit to ensure smooth functioning of parliamentary democracy, it said.        
	Jurists Ram Jethmalani, Arun Jaitley, Abhishek Singhvi and Virendra Bhatia were on the committee, apart from Sitaram Yechury and Kishore Chandra Deo.

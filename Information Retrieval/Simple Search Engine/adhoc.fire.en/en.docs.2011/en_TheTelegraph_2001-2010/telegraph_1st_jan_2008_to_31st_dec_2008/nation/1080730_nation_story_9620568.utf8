	New Delhi, July 29: The insurance agent you just dismissed or the mechanic who came to your home today could be part of a militant module operating in your city, intelligence officials warn.        
	Only a deeply entrenched, widely spread-out and extremely efficient sleeper cell network could have made the back-to-back serial bombings in Bangalore and Ahmedabad possible.        
	The attacks demonstrate that the terrorists are now able to strike anywhere and at will, an official said, adding that the country needs a far better ground-level intelligence network to counter them.        
	Its clear these sleeper cells are made up of local youth. Even women are being indicted now. We cant just continue blaming all terror strikes on Pakistan or Bangladesh-based outfits, the official said.         
	He added: And dealing with home-grown terrorists is that much more difficult.         
	For one thing, they easily avoid suspicion because they hold regular jobs.        
	Arrests across the country have shown that most members of local sleeper cells, like those of the Students Islamic Movement of India, work as mechanics, phone booth operators and insurance agents, the official said.        
	They generally opt for jobs that involve meeting a lot of people which helps them carry out recruitment and gather data such as which areas can be better targets, how and when to strike, or where bomb-making chemicals or bicycles can be bought.        
	Generally, officials said, the members of a local sleeper cell do not carry out the attack. A person from another sleeper cell is sent in for this, with the local member only providing logistical support. It makes detection even more difficult, the official said.        
	Experts said a strong human intelligence network or sound ground-level policing is the only option to tackle terror. It is very evident that there is an intelligence failure, said terror expert A.S. Dulat, former Research and Analysis Wing secretary.        
	I think there is a need to do a threat assessment for metros. For instance, state governments and their leaders should take terrorism more seriously and not just depend on what is given to them (by the Centre).        
	Militant groups are now recruiting even educated and tech-savvy youth, including engineers and medical students. But officials believe these recruits have so far been confined largely to data collection and improvisation of techniques during terror strikes.        
	But once they have gathered experience, they could be used for field activities, which means an active role in a terror strike.        
	According to intelligence officials, many militants have said during interrogation that they, for the most part, collected data and recruited youths and trained them.         
	Since most of them are ordinary people, ostensibly doing their routine job, it is difficult to pin anything on them till they actually strike. The key is to strengthen local-level intelligence, the official said.        
	Security officials investigating militant strikes complain that they are let down by the intelligence wings.        
	There is no excuse for not knowing. It takes several people to carry out a serial blast, so how come they cant be traced? And even those who provide them logistical support like houses, phones and transport cannot be traced, an official involved in the Ahmedabad blast investigations said.

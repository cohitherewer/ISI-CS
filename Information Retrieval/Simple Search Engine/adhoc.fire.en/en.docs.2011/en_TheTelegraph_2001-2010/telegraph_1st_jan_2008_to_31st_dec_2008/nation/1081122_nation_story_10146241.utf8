          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, Nov. 21: The absence of sizeable crowds at rallies in Madhya Pradesh, where Assembly elections are less than a week away, has political parties worried.         
	At Iqbal Maidan in the heart of Bhopal, Rajnath Singh attracted a gathering of barely 1,500 despite the BJP having control of all but one seat in the state capital. A crowd of 5,000 would have been considered sizeable.        
	BSP chief Mayavati chose the Dussehra ground in the city but, in spite of arriving late, she ended up addressing just over 2,500 people.         
	Digvijay Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Jyotiraditya Scindia and several other Congress and BJP stalwarts addressed dozens of meetings where the attendance was below 5,000.        
	Rahul Gandhis meetings at Harda and Jhabua drew about 5,000 people, but Congress leaders admitted that elaborate preparations and carefully chosen venues failed to evoke the desired response.         
	Sources said perhaps the All India Congress Committee general secretary had not been given enough local inputs  his 10-minute speech focused on broad national issues which did not strike a chord.        
	A worried Congress camp is now preparing for Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs rallies in Indore and Badwani on November 23.        
	Congress leaders said the economist Prime Minister did not evoke much confidence when it came to oratory and vote-catching skills.        
	Elsewhere in the state, too, responses have been lukewarm. The exceptions are chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Kamal Nath and Uma Bharti. These leaders drew big crowds on their home turf or where local caste equations were favourable.         
	Uma drew big crowds in places with a sizeable Lodhi population. Nath did well in pocket borough Chhindwara while Chauhan was impressive in his home district of Vidisha.        
	BJP strategists who had planned a grand carpet bombing with LK. Advani, Narendra Modi, Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma, Ananth Kumar and others admitted that the crowd strength had been less than expected.         
	They explained that before the elections, crowd mobilisation and large-scale movements could become a constraint. Moreover, they said elaborate efforts to make a particular rally a success could cause the party to suffer in other areas.        
	Congress leaders admitted on condition of anonymity that voters silence was adding to their worries. We believe that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency but somehow it is not reflecting in public meetings, said a general secretary.        
	Both Congress and BJP leaders said that crowd mobilisation had become more difficult with dedicated workers in short supply because of the localised nature of Assembly polls.         
	According to the sources, the going rate of a hired worker was Rs 200. So, a crowd of over 2,000 would cost Rs 4,00,000, though such transactions are not accounted for.         
	The Election Commission has further queered the pitch as the cost of every vehicle, poster, banner, chair, public address system and light has to be shown in candidates expenses.        
	For November 27, the day of polling, booth management cost is estimated at Rs 2,00,000 for each booth. This includes ensuring brisk voting, voters mobilisation and keeping an eye on the Opposition camp.         
	Madhya Pradesh has 47,213 polling stations and 3,179 contestants.        
	A conservative estimate of contestants from the main political parties numbers 900.

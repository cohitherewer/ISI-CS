          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 10: The state police received a jolt as gangster Sandip Acharya alias Raja, prime accused in Biranchi Das murder case, today refused to undergo narco-analysis or brain mapping test.        
	The police were planning to send Acharya (in picture) for narco-analysis as he allegedly did not co-operate during the course of investigation. Acharyas counsel Bana Bihari Mohanty said he had objected to any technical test in the petition filed at the SDJM court here while opposing police move to bring him on remand.        
	As per Supreme Court guidelines, consent of the accused is needed for the test.        
	Judo coach Biranchi Das was murdered on April 13 evening. Eyewitnesses had said two persons gunned down the coach from point-blank range in front of the judo hall. Widow Gitanjali Panda accused gangster Raja Acharya in her FIR.        
	Acharya surrendered before Goa police recently after giving a slip to the Orissa police. He was brought on transit remand for interrogation. Though Acharya allegedly did not co-operate with the investigating team and denied his involvement in Biranchis murder, city police commissioner B.K. Sharma said he was satisfied with the outcome of the interrogation.        
	Sharma, who reviewed the progress of investigation today, said there was sufficient proof and evidence of Rajas involvement in the murder.        
	Meanwhile, neither the accused admitted to his alleged involvement, nor did he throw any light on how the murder was executed or what the motive was in an intense interrogation for several hours for the third consecutive day today, said a senior police officer associated with the investigation.        
	The interrogation will conclude tomorrow, when the police will take a decision on whether to move court for extension of remand, said the police commissioner.

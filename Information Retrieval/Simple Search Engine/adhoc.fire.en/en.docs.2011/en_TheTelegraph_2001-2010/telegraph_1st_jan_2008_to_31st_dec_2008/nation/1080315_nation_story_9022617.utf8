	Everett (Washington), March 14 (AP): A Superior Court has awarded $40.1 million (Rs 162.1 crore) to a man whose heart was damaged by a malfunctioning machine during an operation, forcing him to go in for a transplant.        
	Paramjit Singh, 54, of Mount Vernon, has contracted other ailments as a result of the injury and anti-rejection drugs he has to take, his lawyers said.         
	Singh had checked into Providence Everett Medical Center in Snohomish County, Washington, in 2004 for cardiac bypass surgery when a monitor manufactured by Edwards Lifesciences Corp. of Irvine, California, malfunctioned, causing a catheter to overheat and burn his heart, said his lawyer Paul Luvera in a statement.        
	The award, delivered on Monday, included $8.35 million in punitive damages.        
	We do not believe the award of punitive damages will withstand the scrutiny of the higher court, Edwards Lifesciences has said.        
	This was the only reported injury related to millions of uses of this device and the problem has been rectified.         
	Edwards had blamed Providence Everett Medical Center, saying it used a damaged cable.         
	The hospital had said Edwards failed to disclose a problem with the monitor.

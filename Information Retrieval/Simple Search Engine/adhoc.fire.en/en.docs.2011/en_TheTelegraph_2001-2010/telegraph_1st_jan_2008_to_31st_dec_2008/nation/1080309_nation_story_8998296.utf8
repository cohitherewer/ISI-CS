          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 8: Delhi police have arrested three men trying to sell two rare copies of the Quran dating back to the Mughal period.        
	On a tip-off, the crime branch laid a trap for the crooks by planting a decoy customer at a Nizamuddin station restaurant where the transaction was to take place.        
	We laid a trap by setting up a decoy customer. The accused originally wanted Rs 5 crore for the copies of the Quran, but they finally settled for Rs 3.5 crore, said Satyendra Garg, the additional commissioner of police.        
	They have not been able to provide us any details on how they got hold of the books. They must have laid their hands on the books by unfair means.         
	Experts have estimated that the copies  one bound in leather and the other with golden lettering  date back to the time of Aurangzeb or Shah Jahan. The police said the books would fetch a much higher price in western markets. We worked closely with the Archaeological Survey of India. They claim these books are the rarest of rare copies.        
	The accused have been booked under the IPC and the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972. They were property dealers wanting to make a quick buck. Antiques have to be registered with the ASI and cannot be sold without proper documentation on transfer of ownership.

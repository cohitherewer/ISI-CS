The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Calcutta under threat
                                                                                                            Calcutta under threat
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: Calcutta is extremely vulnerable even to earthquakes of moderate magnitude, experts have warned.         
	The National Centre for Disaster Management and Geo-hazard International have put Calcutta on a list of 20 cities in the world where significant efforts are required to reduce the consequences of quakes.        
	An extremely high population density, often poor quality of structures, especially the old dilapidated buildings, and, above all, almost non-existent preparedness makes Calcutta extremely vulnerable even to an earthquake of moderate magnitude, said Tapas Ghatak, a geophysicist and member of the states expert committee on quakes.        
	The city is close to the Eocene Hinge Zone, a tectonic block between Bengal and Bangladesh that has been identified as quake-prone.        
	Structural engineering experts and real estate developers in the city are unanimous that new structures in Calcutta, including the 30-storey-plus highrises, are much less susceptible to earthquakes than the old brick buildings.        
	I would stick my neck out and say Calcutta builders are better prepared to bear seismic load than their counterparts in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Here, on an average, 3.5kg steel is used in every square foot of construction, as opposed to a mere 1.5-2kg in western India, said Pradip Chopra, a former secretary of Credais state chapter.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation requires every building plan to be sanctioned by a qualified structural engineer, which isnt mandatory anywhere else, Chopra said.

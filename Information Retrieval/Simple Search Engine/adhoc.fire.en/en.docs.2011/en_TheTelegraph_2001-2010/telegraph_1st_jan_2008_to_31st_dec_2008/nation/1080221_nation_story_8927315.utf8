  - BJD unhappy with cuttack ward rejig           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Cuttack, Feb. 20: Orissa government has completed the delimitation of wards under Cuttack Municipal Corporation area by increasing their number from 48 to 54, while reserving 18 of them for women.         
	States urban development departments final notification has demarcated the six new wards by splitting 14 of the previously existing ones according to a population-area ratio: All to facilitate fair polls in each ward.         
	The notification, issued on Monday, left just 20 of the 54 wards unreserved.        
	The notification also reserved 11 wards for women candidates, 10 for other backward classes, five for women candidates from other backward classes, five for scheduled caste members, two for scheduled caste women and one for a scheduled tribe member.         
	In the process, newly-formed wards have also been demarcated with new numbers.         
	Ward number 45 has been split into ward number 50 and 51, while wards two, three and four were created from ward number 2.         
	Similarly, ward 6 was created from parts of ward four and 11, and nine from parts of six and five.         
	Parts of eight and nine were put together for ward 10, while ward 12 was created from parts of 10 and 11.         
	The newly demarcated ward 2 was made from parts of 15, 26, 18 and 19.         
	Meanwhile, the final notification has triggered unrest among a section of the BJD corporators.         
	These leaders have alleged that the wards were reorganised to further electoral prospects of the BJP in the next municipal polls.         
	Deputy Mayor Madhusudan Sahu of the BJD said that while the CMC had submitted a proposal to increase ward numbers from 48 to 59, the urban development department ignored the suggestion and stuck to its decision to increase the number of wards from 48 to 54.         
	A bargain that would prove to be disadvantageous for the party.

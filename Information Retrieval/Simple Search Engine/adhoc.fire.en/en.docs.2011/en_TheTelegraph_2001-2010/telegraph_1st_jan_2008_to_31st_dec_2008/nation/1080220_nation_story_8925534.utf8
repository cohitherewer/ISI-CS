The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | London launch for Calcutta law firm
                                                                                                               London launch for Calcutta law firm
          AMIT ROY                           Som Mandal                                  
	London, Feb. 19: Indias second oldest law firm, FoxMandal Little, which began life in Calcutta in 1896, made legal history today when it formally opened a permanent office in London with a gala launch party.         
	Presiding over the celebrations was the firms managing partner, Som Mandal, who told The Telegraph that the practice was established in what was then an unprecedented joint venture between an Englishman, John K. Fox, and my great-grandfather, Gokul Chander Mandal.         
	Our guest list includes lawyers from the topmost law firms in London such as Clifford Chance and Freshfields, declared Som.         
	It helped the party was being held at La Porte Des Indes, a fancy Indian restaurant whose cuisine is inspired by French recipes from Pondicherry.         
	Asked what he thought his great-grandfather might have to say from his consulting chamber in the sky if he could witness todays legal landmark, Som laughed and said: He would be very, very happy. He set up a firm in Calcutta with a Britisher  and now his great-grandson is opening a London office.         
	Its timing is explained by the rapid globalisation of the Indian economy and the need to provide expert legal advice both to NRIs and British and European Union companies wanting to do business with India.         
	Today, there is internationalisation of everything, commented Som. The Tatas are there, the Birlas are there, so why not a law firm?         
	He went on: We feel theres a huge market for international and UK-based companies in need of advice in India. We will do probate, property, litigation. Clients will feel comfortable walking across and getting advice in real time, not waiting for a call back the next day because of time zone issues. For US clients, too, London is a better time zone to discuss over the phone or for even coming over.         
	In 2006, Fox Mandal, the firm set up in 1896, merged with what is believed to be the oldest legal practice in India established in 1856  Little amp; Co  which had been adviser to the East India Company and successive governments of the Presidency of Bombay.         
	FoxMandal Little now has offices, with 365 lawyers including nearly 50 partners, in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Noida and Dhaka.         
	Som, 46, is the fourth generation in his family to work for the firm. The founder was a leading and distinguished solicitor of his times.         
	He was succeeded by his son, Sudhir K. Mandal, who was solicitor to the Government of India in Calcutta for many years.         
	Next in line was his son, Dinu Mandal, now aged 76 and the firms most senior partner, who was present at the party today, as were his two younger sons, Shuva, 43, and Shourya, 40, who also work for the practice in India.         
	Som attended Ramkrishna Mission Vidyapith in Deoghar and St Xaviers College in Calcutta before studying law at Calcutta University.         
	Accompanying him today was his lawyer wife, Sangeeta  no marks for guessing she is a partner, too  and their three children, Shimantika, 16, who is studying in Delhi and hopes to apply to Cambridge next year to read law, Shivanu, 13, and the youngest, Shamik.         
	Shamik is only 16 months so I cant really say if he is going to become a lawyer, his father said.         
	Som will keep Delhi as his base but spend 7 to 10 days every month at the firms London office in Kings Street, Cheapside, in the City, the capitals financial hub.         
	These days, when Indians come to London frequently, they tend not to stay with relatives or go to cheap hotels  they buy an apartment.         
	I bought a flat in Marble Arch (conveniently situated near Selfridges in Oxford Street) a year ago, confirmed Som, who will commute (business or first class) to London by Virgin Atlantic, which he finds comfortable.         
	The partying is not over yet. Tomorrow, the Law Society of England is hosting a welcome to London reception for FoxMandal Little.

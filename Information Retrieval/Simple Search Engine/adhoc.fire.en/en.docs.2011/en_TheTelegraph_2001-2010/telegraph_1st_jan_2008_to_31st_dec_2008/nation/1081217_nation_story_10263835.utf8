The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab asks Pak to hand over Masood
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Pranab asks Pak to hand over Masood
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 16: Pranab Mukherjee today asked Islamabad to hand over Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, who is on the wanted list of 20 that India has given Pakistan.        
	He made the demand during a surprise visit to Srinagar, where he toasted the high turnout in the ongoing state elections as a triumph for Indian democracy.        
	We hear he (Azhar) is under house arrest, Mukherjee said. If somebody is under house arrest, surely the authorities in Pakistan know about him. What is the difficulty in handing him over?        
	On Saturday, Mukherjee had said Pakistani nationals linked to terror strikes in India could be tried in their own country.        
	Azhar was freed by the NDA government in December 1999 to secure the release of passengers of an Indian plane hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar in Afghanistan.        
	The hijack did not take place in Pakistan. The hijackers did not get the person on Pakistani land (Azhar was escorted from India to Kandahar). Then how does this gentleman appear on Pakistani television? the foreign minister asked, adding that the hijack was an international crime.        
	He, however, de-linked the Kashmir dispute from the Mumbai attacks. The terror attack in Mumbai has nothing to do with Indo-Pak relations vis-a-vis Kashmir. It is not a Kashmir issue. It is about a global war against terrorism.        
	Mukherjee then cited the higher-than-expected voter turnouts: It is a very important development as people have demonstrated their willingness to participate in democracy.        
	His party colleagues seconded him. The celebration of democracy is in full swing in Kashmir, Union minister and state Congress chief Saifuddin Soz said.         
	This is the time to cash in on the huge voter turnout despite the recent Amarnath agitation that had fed fears that Kashmir was going out of our hand, another Congress leader said.        
	Five of the elections seven phases are over and the sixth is scheduled tomorrow.        
	Mukherjee chose an unusual site for his media briefing  a hotel in the heart of the city, where tens of thousands had gathered during a separatist march in August.        
	This was the first time any leader of Mukherjees stature was addressing the media in this area, and the security was lighter than usual  a sign of how dramatically the situation had changed in Kashmir in the past few weeks.        
	Mukherjee hinted that the Congresss relations with the Peoples Democratic Party were not strained enough to rule out a post-poll alliance. The PDP had withdrawn support to the Congress during the Amarnath agitation, causing the government to collapse.        
	He said confidence-building measures with Pakistan had come to a pause after the Mumbai carnage, but the internal mechanism to solve Kashmirs problems would continue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land notice to UP with breather for Reliance
                                                                                                            Land notice to UP with breather for Reliance
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government on a PIL challenging the forcible acquisition of fertile farmland in Dadri, Ghaziabad, for a power plant proposed by Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy.         
	The court, however, did not issue any notice to Reliance after its lawyer Mukul Rohtagi objected. The bench asked the petitioner to drop Reliance as a party.        
	The two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, issued the notices on a petition filed by Sahyog Samiti, an NGO registered in Meerut, which claimed to be representing the affected farmers.        
	The company claimed that the petition was motivated and aimed at the Reliance IPO that was coming on January 15 to secure funds from the public for the power project.         
	Appearing for the farmers, K.T.S. Tulsi said while the state had forcibly acquired some land, others were being threatened with forcible acquisition without inviting objections from farmers as required under the law.         
	The rules mandate the state to make an inquiry to find out whether any alternative site could be found to avoid acquisition of fertile land for a public purpose.         
	If any alternative barren land is found, it could be acquired only after paying adequate compensation.         
	Several of them (the farmers) had committed suicide and crime rates had shot up, Tulsi said.        
	By a notification issued on February 11, 2004, the Uttar Pradesh government acquired 903.449 hectares in seven villages, saying the land was meant for the public purpose of setting up a gas-based thermal power generation plant, energy research and development centre.         
	But this land was later handed over to Reliance Energy, the petitioner said.         
	Despite assurances from the then chief minister that the farmers would get Rs 300 per square yard, they were paid only at the rate of Rs 150, the petition said.

	Srinagar, July 9: After refusing to bail out the Ghulam Nabi Azad government, Kashmirs main political parties are now trying to outsmart each other in their support for the Congress at the Centre with an eye on a possible post-poll alliance in the state.         
	The Peoples Democratic Party, which had reduced the Azad government to a minority over the Amarnath land row, has made a swift U-turn by making it clear that it would support the UPA during the confidence vote in Parliament following the Lefts pullout.         
	We were a part of the UPA and continue to be so. We will vote as an ally of the UPA, said PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, the lone member of the party in the Lok Sabha.         
	The PDP, with 19 members in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, withdrew support to the Congress around a fortnight ago, forcing Azads resignation on Monday.        
	Smelling an opportunity to get back into the political limelight, the National Conference has also chosen to keep options open.         
	The party, with two members in the Lok Sabha, is yet to take a decision on supporting the UPA. But we are not ruling it out. I am presently in Delhi, in consultation with both pro-nuclear deal and anti-nuclear deal parties. Our decision will be based on merit, NC chief Omar Abdullah said.         
	He scoffed at statements that the deal was anti-Muslim. I have no problem with arguments that this deal is not in the national interest. What I am against is when somebody looks at it through the prism of religion, Abdullah said.         
	Sources said both the PDP and the NC were keen on a post-poll alliance with the Congress as the prospects of any party winning a clear majority in the Kashmir Assembly elections, scheduled later in the year, appear bleak.         
	Although its action triggered the fall of the Congress regime in the state, the PDP does not want to sever ties with the party at the Centre. After the 2002 Assembly polls, the Congress allowed the PDP to lead the government in Srinagar despite having more MLAs.        
	An alliance between the NC and the PDP is almost impossible, given the rivalry to dominate the local turf.         
	We are looking to mend fences with the Congress and our support to the UPA is aimed at rebuilding the bridges, a PDP leader admitted.        
	The party is now giving a different twist to its strained ties with the Congress, arguing that it has a problem with its local chapter and not the high command.         
	The NC was quick to pounce on this, accusing the PDP of engaging in duplicity and cheap politics. They want to keep the Congress high command in good humour for the upcoming elections, Abdullah said.

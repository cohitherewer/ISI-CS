The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP seeks probe into CMs role
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     NCP seeks probe into CMs role
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 22: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) today demanded that chief minister Naveen Patnaik should come under the purview of the Lokpal probe following the alleged official-criminal nexus.         
	There are also allegations that the nexus enjoyed support of a ruling party. The role of the chief minister, who is also the home minister, should be probed into, said NCP state unit president Bijoy Mohapatra. Our peaceful city has turned into crime capital with the help of the chief minister, alleged Mohapatra.         
	Accusing Naveen of shielding those guilty, the NCP leader said his habit of ordering an inquiry into every allegation was just a ploy to buy time. Ultimately, the reports come to a nought, he added.         
	He also wondered how an IAS official (Santosh Kumar) was entrusted an inquiry into a report filed by a constitutional body involving an IPS officer (former inspector-general Sanjiv Marik).         
	Stating that the institution of Lokpal was to probe into corruption at high places, the NCP leader wondered now crime-related matters were being referred to an ombudsman.         
	Quoting provisions in the Orissa Lokpal Act, he added that police officers could refuse the Lokpal information regarding criminal matters on the plea that it might hamper investigations.         
	What was the police doing for the past two years? There was a similar incident on January 23, 2006, when police engaged in a crossfire with a gang involved in the scrap racket in Mancheswar industrial estate. Similar crimes are still being committed, he roared.        
	He lambasted the police department, headed by him, for its inaction and said that the government had been warned when his department came up with the 2006 White Paper on the law and order.

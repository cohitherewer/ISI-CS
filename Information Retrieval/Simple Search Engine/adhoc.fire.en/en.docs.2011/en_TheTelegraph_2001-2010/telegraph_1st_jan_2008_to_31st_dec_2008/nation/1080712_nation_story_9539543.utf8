          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, July 11: The day Rajesh and Nupur Talwar received a clean chit in daughter Aarushis murder, a Mumbai teenagers parents have been handed life terms for strangling and dismembering her.        
	Mehnaz Bano was 18 when she was hacked to pieces for eloping with a Hindu boy two years ago, put in a sack and dumped in a sewer near a flyover.        
	Mumbai sessions judge .S. Jaiswal today sentenced Mohammed Munna Khan, 40, and his wife Shehnazbano, 37, to life imprisonment based on circumstantial evidence and their confessions.        
	Mehnazs sister Gulnaz, 15 years old at the time of the crime, has been sent to a juvenile home for abetting the murder.        
	But a crucial player in the crime, neighbour Insaan Yadav with whom Mehnaz was last seen, still remains untraced.        
	On July 2, 2006, while on a routine patrol near the J.J. Flyover in Byculla, I saw a sack with bloodstains in an open sewage line, said police inspector Atmaram Ghorpade, who investigated the case.        
	On opening it up, I found a body that had been chopped into pieces. Taking a lead from the name of the company printed on the gunny sack, we zeroed in on the accused within days.        
	The search took the police to the grocery shop of Mohammed Munna where the company had delivered the sack. As the interrogation began, officers say, the parents confessed to the crime.        
	Investigations revealed that Mehnaz had eloped with her neighbour, a Hindu boy named Vidyanand Jadhav, to Panvel on July 1, 2006, where they got married.        
	Her parents rushed to Panvel when she called and informed them about her marriage and brought her back home promising reconciliation.        
	Their neighbour Mary Nadar, a prime witness, said the Khan family had a bitter fight after their return from Panvel.        
	She said Insaan, 26, who used to live near the Khans home in the Babasaheb Ambedkar slums in the Cuffe Parade area, was friendly with Mehnaz and close to her parents.        
	After the fight, Mary testified that she saw Mehnaz leaving with Insaan. That was the last time anyone saw her, raising questions about Insaans involvement in the crime. He has not been seen since that day and the police have not been able to trace him, Ghorpade said.        
	Mehnazs parents told the police and the court it was they who had strangled Mehnaz to death and chopped her head off before cutting the rest of her body into 10 pieces. They took it on a bicycle to the Byculla flyover and dumped it in a drain.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Asked why Afzal Guru had not been hanged for his role in the 2001 Parliament attack yet, Rahul Gandhi said he was still waiting for justice 17 years after his father was killed by an assassin in front of many witnesses.        
	Our legal system works slowly, very slowly, the Congress MP said.         
	It took seven years for his grandmother Indira Gandhis killers to be hanged, he added.         
	My father and grandmother were both Prime Ministers. I have not got justice till today but I believe one will get justice through the judicial system, he was quoted as saying at a question-answer session in an Uttarakhand college.        
	Rahul had been asked if the UPAs reluctance to hang Guru amounted to minority appeasement.        
	With elections in six states round the corner, Congress leaders who have been pinning their hopes on Rahul and even pitching as for Prime Minister were surprised when he headed off to Uttarakhand on Monday.        
	They wondered whether the general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India intended to tie himself down to the front organisations. Rahuls trip to the state, to oversee NSUI polls, did allow them a peek into his mind on issues raised by students in colleges he visited.         
	When a student prefaced his query on Raj Thackeray with the hope that there is someone like you to look after north Indians, he was mildly rebuked. Sources close to Rahul quoted him as saying terrorism and communalism were born out of the idea that people are different  an idea that fostered divisive politics. He asked the youth why he thought of himself as a north Indian, not just an Indian.        
	Thackeray was trying to divide people, he said, while he as general secretary in charge of the Congresss youth and student wings wanted to create a leadership that inculcated unity and taught members to be good citizens.        
	Rahul dodged a direct reply on reservation in higher education. He said there was need for more quality institutions and he was in favour of inviting foreign education institutions to India.

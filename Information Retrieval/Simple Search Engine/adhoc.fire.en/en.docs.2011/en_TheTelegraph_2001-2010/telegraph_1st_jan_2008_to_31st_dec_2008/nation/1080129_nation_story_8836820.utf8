          OUR BUREAU                          Choudhary                                  
	Guwahati/Srinagar, Jan. 28: Of all the promises Captain Sunil Kumar Choudhary had made in the last three months, he could keep only one: to do his lieutenant colonel father proud.        
	The one made to his fiance  to marry her in March  and to his colleagues  to host a party to celebrate his Sena Medal  have died with him.        
	The Tricolour-wrapped coffin arrived at the air force station in Chabua, nearly 500km from Guwahati, today to take the slain officer home to Jammu on a special flight.         
	The news that Choudhary had been awarded the Sena Medal had reached the camp yesterday, prompting a burst of celebrations. Around the same time came the information that some Ulfa militants were hiding in a village not far from the base.        
	As always, the captain was the first to reach the scene of action, followed by troops of the Gorkha Regiment.         
	It turned out to be Choudharys last counter-insurgency operation. He was shot in the neck shortly after felling a rebel.        
	He was such a committed and excellent officer of my unit.... It is a great loss to all of us and the country, said Col Pramit Saxena, the commanding officer of the 7/11 Gorkha Rifles.        
	Tributes were paid to Choudhary at the headquarters of 2 Mountain Division in Dinjan before his body was taken to Tinsukia Civil Hospital for post-mortem and embalming. The coffin was then moved to the air force station in a six-vehicle convoy.         
	At Jammu airport, the captains father, Lt Col P.L. Choudhary, could not hold back tears. He would always tell me that he would make me proud one day and he has done it, he said.        
	The coffin was flown to Pathankot and it reached Kathua village in Jammu tonight. The cremation will take place tomorrow.         
	The captain had got engaged to Monika, a lecturer in a Jammu college, in October last year and the two were to be married on March 9. An inconsolable Monika, accompanied by her parents, received his coffin at the Jammu airport.

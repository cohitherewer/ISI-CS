          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: BJP president Rajnath Singh will participate in a two-day kisan yatra in Maharashtras crisis-ridden Vidarbha region from Thursday.        
	The former Union agriculture minister, desperate to carve out a distinct image by identifying with farmers issues, will kick off from Seva Gram, Mahatma Gandhis ashram in Vardha.        
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said the party wanted to press home that the Prime Ministers special package for the farmers of Vidarbha, which has witnessed a spate of suicides, had not been of much help.        
	Manmohan Singh, too, had visited Vidarbha to get a first-hand view of the problem.        
	Rajnath will cover the districts of Akola, Amravati, Wasim and Yavatmal  some of the regions worst hit by agrarian distress. He will address a farmers rally at Yavatmal on Friday.         
	Rajnaths aides denied the march was aimed at an image makeover. They said as he had always been associated with the farmers cause and had helped them in when he was agriculture minister. They recalled that he had organised the biggest farmers rally in Delhi in recent times.        
	Rajnath will distribute cheques for Rs 15,000 among the families of the farmers who had committed suicide. Local BJP workers have raised Rs 75 lakh for the purpose.

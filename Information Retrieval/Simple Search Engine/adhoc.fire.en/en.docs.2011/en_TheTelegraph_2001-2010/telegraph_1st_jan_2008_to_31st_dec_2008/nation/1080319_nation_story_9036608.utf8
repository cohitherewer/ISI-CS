The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protest over pesky call penalty
                                                                                                               Protest over pesky call penalty
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 18: Telecom operators today protested the decision to fine them for failing to rein in telemarketers, saying service providers were simply pipes to transmit calls.        
	Service providers merely provide the pipes for carriage of calls and cannot be held responsible for pesky calls made by marketing agencies, said T.V. Ramachandran, the director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, in a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).        
	The operators have asked Trai to modify the amendment to the Telecom Unsolicited Commercial Communications Regulations, 2007, such that financial disincentive on service providers is removed.        
	Yesterday, Trai had announced the notification of the amendment that makes service providers and registered telemarketing firms liable to pay fines of up to Rs 20,000 for unwanted calls.        
	In the letter, the operators have contended that it was difficult to prevent unwanted calls in the absence of technology to identify unorganised telemarketers who violate regulations.         
	Besides, they do not have any statutory power control over them.        
	In case of registered marketing firms, there is no method available to ensure that the telemarketer has scrubbed the calling list in an appropriate manner before making the call, said S.C. Khanna, the secretary-general of the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India.        
	The operators said it was the poor compliance by telemarketers and their clients  banks, credit card agencies, hotels and travel agencies  that needed to be urgently addressed, more than penalising service providers.        
	According to Trai data, about 13,600 telemarketers are registered with the department of telecommunications out of an estimated total of over 75,000 marketing firms.         
	Only 600 telemarketers access the national do-not-call (NDNC) registry to ensure that no calls are made to people who have signed up.        
	The operators have also challenged Trais jurisdiction. Under the Trai Act, the authority does not have the power to penalise the operators.        
	According to the current policy, Trai can set the rules for the working of the NDNC registry, refer violations to the telecom department and recommend penalties on ope- rators.         
	But it does not have any independent authority to impose punitive measures, industry analysts said.

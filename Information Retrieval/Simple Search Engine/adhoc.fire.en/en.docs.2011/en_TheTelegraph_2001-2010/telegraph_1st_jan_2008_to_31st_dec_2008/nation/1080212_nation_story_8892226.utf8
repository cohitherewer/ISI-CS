          M.R. VENKATESH                              
	Chennai, Feb. 11: Hundreds of scholars at a state-sponsored bash put their seal of approval on a new law that advances the official Tamil New Year to January from April.        
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi, whose DMK regime steered the law through the Assembly, said the move to change the new year from mid-April to mid-January was based on the ancient Tamil linear notion of time and was part of efforts to return to authentic Tamil roots.         
	This alone can do justice to our concept of linear historical time and protect the Tamils unique identity and self-respect, the chief minister told the gathering of Tamil scholars, including one from Sri Lanka.        
	The DMK patriarch had braved ill health to make it to the event, organised at Valluvar Kottam, a popular cultural venue, last night to silence critics who had raised allegations of state interference in cultural matters. His cardiologist, Dr Thanikachalam, was by his side.         
	The new year will now coincide with Pongal festivities in the Tamil month of Thai, signifying the way ancient Tamils had divided their seasons in a year. The old date in mid-April marked the month of Chittirai.        
	According to the chief minister, unlike the Sanskrit calendar mentioned in the Puranas where the cycle of time is repeated once in 60 years, the Tamil year dates back to 31 BC, when legendary poet Thiruvalluvar was born. For example, corresponding to the English year 2008, the official Tamil year is Thiruvalluvar Aandu 2039.         
	Karunanidhi recalled that the late savant Maraimalai Adigalar had organised a meeting of 500 scholars in Chennai in 1921 to debate the need for a new and separate calendar for Tamils. He seemed to suggest that he was only carrying forward a near-century-old legacy by getting scholars to bless a new calendar that was much more in tune with Tamil culture.        
	There was a shower of plaudits. Actors, many dressed like great 12th-century Tamil poets Tholkapiyar and Kambar, strutted on the stage singing paeans to Karunanidhi for upholding Tamil culture.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                         Bashir and (below) Menon in Delhi on Monday. (Rajesh Kumar, AP)				                                       
	New Delhi, July 21: The dialogue with Pakistan is under stress, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today, suggesting the attack on the embassy in Kabul was a key factor.        
	Menons remarks came after talks  the fifth round of the composite dialogue process  with his Pakistan counterpart Salman Bashir here.         
	Menon said elements in Pakistan were behind the embassy strike, one of the recent events that had vitiated the atmosphere between the two countries and cast a shadow on the four-year-old dialogue process.        
	Bashir reacted by asking India to provide credible evidence.         
	He stressed the two sides should refrain from blame games and pointed out that national security adviser M.K. Narayanans statement, that there was pretty good evidence of the ISIs involvement in the car bombing, had caused some disquiet in Islamabad.        
	Menon did not specify who the elements were, saying the probe was continuing. Our investigations so far point towards a few elements in Pakistan to be behind the Kabul blast.         
	Forty people, including an IFS officer, were killed in the July 7 embassy explosion.         
	The foreign secretary said the talks were taking place at a difficult time, after the return of democracy and a new government in Pakistan.         
	Unfortunately, there have been several issues in the recent past which have vitiated the atmosphere and the composite dialogue process is under stress.         
	Menon also referred to recent ceasefire violations along the Line of Control, cross-border terrorism and incitement of violence in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	There have been public statements by leaders in Pakistan who are reverting to old polemics, he said, appearing to suggest such anti-India rhetoric ran the risk of fanning terror.

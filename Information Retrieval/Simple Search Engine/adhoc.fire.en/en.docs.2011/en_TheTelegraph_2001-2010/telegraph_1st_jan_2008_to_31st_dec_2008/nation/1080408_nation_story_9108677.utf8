          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                          
	Lucknow, April 7: Mayavati has fresh trouble on her plate: her regime has run into legal obstacles over three projects being set up in memory of Dalit icons in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The government, walking a tightrope to balance the interests of upper-caste Brahmins and Dalits, her original vote base, had been working on these memorials dedicated to Babasaheb Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshi Ram. But in its zeal to execute the projects, the regime has allegedly flouted environmental norms.         
	On Friday, Allahabad High Court clamped a stay on three of Mayavatis pet projects in Lucknow  a new Ambedkar Memorial Park, the Kanshi Ram Shodh Sansthan and the Rama Bai Ambedkar Maidan, a rally ground on the outskirts of the city.        
	The government moved a petition today in the Supreme Court, challenging the order. Work on the projects is going on at full steam, but could come to a complete halt if the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear the government appeal tomorrow, does not vacate the stay.        
	Worried by the frequent intervention of the judiciary in her dream projects, Mayavati is learnt to have asked lawyer-turned-party loyalist Satish Chandra Mishra to focus on fighting the cases.        
	On Saturday, Mishra resigned as chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Corporation. He had earlier relinquished his post as cabinet minister. Mishra is back to his plush law chamber to consult his battery of lawyers.         
	Mayavati is already facing trial in the Rs 175-crore Taj Corridor scam. The CBI court is awaiting the governors sanction to prosecute the chief minister in the case.        
	Sources said the Lucknow Development Authority, which was executing Mayavatis dream projects, allegedly deviated from the original plan.        
	The government had launched a series of projects in the capital, including renovation of the Ambedkar Park, since May 13 last year when Mayavati took over as chief minister for the fourth time. The parks original landscaping was done by Satish Gujral, but the government demolished that and drew up a new plan.        
	The high court has been hearing a petition filed by the Gomti Nagar Jan Kalyan Maha Samiti, which alleged that the government resorted to blatant change in land use and violated environmental safeguards.        
	B.K. Singh, a counsel for the petitioner, argued that the government had ignored the high courts previous orders issued on June 15, June 21 and July 27, 2007, asking it not to tamper with land use or narrow down the green cover.        
	Additional advocate-general Jaideep Narain Mathur and chief standing counsel Devendra Upadhaya contended that no order had been flouted and that the green cover stood as it was, but the court was not convinced.         
	The chief ministers critics said she was constructing a kind of Taj Mahal for her mentor Kanshi Ram at the Ambedkar Memorial Park. Over 2,700 workers are working day and night to complete construction of the memorial to the late BSP leader. The park was supposed to be opened to the public on April 14 by the chief minister.         
	Two fountains worth Rs 3 crore have been installed. Around 3,000 elephants  the symbol of the BSP  are being constructed to give the park a grand look.         
	The estimated cost of 64 elephants sculpted in sandstone is around Rs 38.44 crore. These are to be installed on the main gate of the memorial. Around 350 artisans from Rajasthan have been brought for the project.         
	The elephants, both big and small, will be installed soon. Their importance can only be known once they are placed in a row, said Ganpati, an artisan at the site.

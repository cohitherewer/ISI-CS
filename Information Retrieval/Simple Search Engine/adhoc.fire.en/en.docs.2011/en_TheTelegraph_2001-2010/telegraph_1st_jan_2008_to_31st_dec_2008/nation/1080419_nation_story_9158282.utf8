	Panaji, April 18 (PTI): Two college girls have committed suicide in Ponda town after allegedly being blackmailed with an obscene MMS clip featuring them.         
	The incident, which happened in March and went largely unreported, was today taken up by the Opposition BJP. It has decided to seek the intervention of the National Commission for Women.

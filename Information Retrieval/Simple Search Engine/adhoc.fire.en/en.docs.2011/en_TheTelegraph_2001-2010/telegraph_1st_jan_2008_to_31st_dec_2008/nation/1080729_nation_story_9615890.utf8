          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raj Thackeray                                  
	New Delhi, July 28: Raj Thackeray will have to appear in a Jamshedpur court to defend himself in a defamation case over his alleged anti-Bihari remarks made in Mumbai on March 9, 2007.         
	The Jamshedpur court had issued an arrest warrant against the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief on May 24 last year after he failed to appear for a hearing. He faces charges under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153B (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC.         
	A local lawyer, Sudhir Kumar Pappu, had filed the complaint. Rajs last-ditch effort to skip an appearance failed today, with the Supreme Court refusing him relief. These statements may incite people anywhere, the apex court said, dismissing his appeal against an order of Jharkhand High Court.        
	On May 16 this year, the high court had turned down Rajs appeal seeking to quash the complaint on the ground that the charges were baseless. He was asked to appear in the trial court on June 12.         
	Rajs lawyer Rohington Nariman contested the legality of the proceedings in the trial court, saying it didnt have territorial jurisdiction. The incident happened in Mumbai, he argued, questioning a Jharkhand courts competence to deal with the case.        
	The apex court dismissed the argument. Your argument will make Section 179, CrPC, redundant. Section 179 says a case can be filed where an act is done or where its consequence ensues.        
	Nariman also argued the petition was mala fide, saying the complainant had admitted he was a politician. He said there was no intention to hurt any sections sentiments. The bench wasnt convinced. Charges can be framed even on mere suspicion.         
	Lawyer Pappu had filed the case in Jamshedpurs Sonari police station on March 11, 2007. He moved chief judicial magistrates court on March 13 after the police didnt take action. The matter was heard on April 19 last year after which Raj was asked to appear. He didnt, forcing the court to issue the warrant.        
	Thackeray then moved the Supreme Court requesting that the case be transferred from Jamshedpur to Maharashtra but was asked to approach Jharkhand High Court.

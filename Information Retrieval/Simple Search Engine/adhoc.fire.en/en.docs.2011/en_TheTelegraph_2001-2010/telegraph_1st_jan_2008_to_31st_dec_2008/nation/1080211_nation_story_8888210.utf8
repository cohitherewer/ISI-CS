          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 10: Vacant posts in Bhubanananda Orissa School of Engineering (BOSE) led to campus unrest, as peeved students took to protest path on Friday and agitated against an insincere government.        
	With more than 70 per cent of the teachers posts lying vacant in various departments, the technical institution has been the final casualty.         
	When the problems were not addressed even after repeated demands, we were left with no other option but agitation, said a student.         
	A cross-section of students has been boycotting classes since Friday.         
	The students launched their agitation from February 6 with a dharna to press for their demands to fill up the vacant posts.        
	But we received virtually no response from the school administration, said a students.        
	BOSE, one of the oldest technical institutions in the state, was established in 1923 for diplomas in engineering courses.         
	Currently, it offers three-year diploma courses in electrical, civil, mechanical and automobile engineering, along with computer science, information technology, applied electronics and instrumentation and electronics and telecommunication.        
	While 900-odd students are currently enrolled in the institution, there are 30-odd teachers in the regular category, against a stipulated requirement of 130.        
	Education has been adversely affected, over the years due to the vacancy.        
	The BOSE administration, however, claims that they have been able to maintain the standard of education despite the vacancy.         
	Though posts in the regular category have remained vacant, steps have been taken to ensure that teaching is not affected, maintained principal A.K. Sahu.         
	Its not that we are not doind anything. Teachers have been appointed on a contractual basis in two categories to tide over the problem , he added.        
	Some temporary teachers had been appointed with a monthly stipend of Rs 6,000, while the services of another category has been availed by paying Rs 40 per hour.

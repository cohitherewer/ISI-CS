	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Former Orissa director-general of police Bidya Bhushan Mohanti, who has evaded arrest so far for allegedly helping his rape convict son Bitihotra Mohanti jump parole, informed the Supreme Court on Thursday that he would surrender within two weeks. 
    
	A Rajasthan court had issued a non-bailable warrant against him, after his son, Bitihotra, who had been sentenced to a seven-year term by a Rajasthan court for raping a German tourist, disappeared while on parole to see his ailing mother in Orissa. Mohanti senior had stood surety for his son and hence became liable for his escape. 
    
	A Rajasthan court had issued a non-bailable warrant against him but state police had not been able to implement it after Mohanty senior went underground. He has since been placed under suspension by the Orissa government. Rajasthan police then moved the Supreme Court seeking a court direction to Orissa to help them nab Mohanty senior. The apex court had on April 7 last year, stayed his arrest in connection with the case. 
    
	On Thursday, when the case came up for hearing again, Mohantis lawyer informed the court that he would surrender within two weeks before the Rajasthan police. Mohanti has been evading arrest since August 24, 2007. A Jaipur court has also declared him an absconder for allegedly helping his son jump parole. On Thursday, a bench, comprising Justices CK. Thakker and D.K. Jain, assured Mohanti senior that his bail plea would be heard by the local court expeditiously once he surrendered.

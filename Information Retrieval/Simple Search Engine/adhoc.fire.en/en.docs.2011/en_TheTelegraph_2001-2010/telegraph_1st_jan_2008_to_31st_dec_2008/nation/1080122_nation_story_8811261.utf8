     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Lucknow, Jan. 21: A 12-year-old schoolboy was allegedly bludgeoned to death by four Uttar Pradesh policemen who went hunting for his brother last night but failed to find him.
    
	The cops apparently kept beating Santosh Singh with their rifle butts as they questioned him on the whereabouts of his brother Sunny, wanted in connection with a Rs 2-lakh burglary.
    
	Santosh collapsed and died in front of his parents at their Dataganj home in Baduan district in western Uttar Pradesh. The policemen then hanged the boy from a ceiling fan to make the death look like suicide, his mother alleged.
    
	In the shivering cold, the young boy could not take the torture and collapsed in front of me. But to cover up the atrocity, the policemen hanged my son from a ceiling fan with a rope to make it appear as if he had committed suicide, a weeping Munni Devi said.
    
	The quartet have been suspended and a murder case registered against them under IPC Section 302. Uttar Pradesh DGP Vikram Singh ordered a case filed immediately.
    
	The shocker comes days after the release of Calcutta youth Aftab Alam Ansari who was mistaken for an explosives courier and taken into custody by the police. He spent nearly 20 days in a Lucknow jail.
    
	Badaun SSP Prakash Kumar said the four who went to Bajaria colony, 310km from Lucknow, to arrest Sunny were sub-inspectors Jagdev Mallik and Sacchidanand Singh and constables Ram Nath and Ajay Rana.
    
	The policemen raided our house around 12.30 at night. When we told them Sunny was not in, they picked on my 12-year-old son Santosh. They kept asking him where Sunny was and beating him with the butts of their rifles, the boys father, Uma Shankar, told the police.
    
	After the policemen left, infuriated residents went on the rampage and set fire to the Bajaria police outpost. Over 500 people protested outside the police station.
    
	A secretary-level officer in the home department said frequent reports of police atrocities had been embarrassing the Mayavati government. Rights groups, including the National Human Rights Commission, have been making adverse comments.
    
	Last September, the NHRC had twice initiated action against the police after the death of three Gujjar men and the thrashing of a Dalit youth.
    
	On September 12, the police shot dead Praveen, Anit and Yadvendra in Saharanpur alleging they had barged into a liquor shop and killed a salesman. The NHRC found, after initial investigations, that they had not gone to the shop at all.
    
	Eight days later, a youth on his way back home to Agra was beaten with sticks by policemen who suspected him to be a criminal. He was also forced to drink urine.
    
	There is an urgent need to sensitise Uttar Pradesh police on the issues of human rights of suspects, social activist Sandeep Pandey said.
    
	According to the state human rights commission, 13,765 of the 43,369 complaints it received between January and October 2007 were against the police.

	Srinagar, Sept. 6: Rubber bullets fired by police apparently killed a young man who witnesses said had just stepped out of home, a kid on his shoulders, as Kashmir erupted again during a shutdown over use of force to gag protests.        
	Sources said 22-year-old Javed Ahmad Bhat was hit in the chest after the police opened fire in Srinagars Nowhatta area. He collapsed on the spot. His family rushed him to hospital but he died on the way, said a witness.        
	Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul-Mujtaba said his men fired rubber bullets after protesters in Nowhatta turned violent. He received grievous wounds and was taken to hospital where he succumbed.        
	Witnesses said clashes between the police and the protesters in the area had subsided when Javed was shot. He had a kid on his shoulders when the bullet hit him, a witness said.        
	The strike, called by the Separatists Co-ordination Committee, came after security forces clamped down on protesters to prevent rallies. Police sources said they had filed over 200 FIRs in the past 10 weeks.        
	Thousands of police jawans had been deployed but clashes broke out today in the city and other districts after people hit the streets crying freedom. Indian forces go back, we want freedom, PTI quoted the protesters as shouting.

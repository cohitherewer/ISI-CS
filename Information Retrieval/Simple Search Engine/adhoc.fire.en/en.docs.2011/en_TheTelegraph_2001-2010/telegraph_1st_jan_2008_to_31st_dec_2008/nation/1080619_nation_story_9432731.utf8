          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, June 18: A sum of Rs 45 lakh was paid to eliminate matka don Suresh Bhagat in an engineered road crash made to appear like an accident, police said today.        
	The 52-year-old, whose gambling empire is said to be worth Rs 250 crore, died when a truck rammed into his Scorpio on June 13.        
	The arrest of the trucks driver, Praveen Shetty, and owner Shaikh Azimuddin led the police to Suhas Roghe, a henchman of don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli, and history-sheeter Harish Mandivkar.        
	Mumbai police joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said Mandivkar had hired the truck from Azimuddin, his long-time transporter, and paid driver Shetty Rs 3 lakh to stage the crash. Mandivkar, in turn, got a Rs 45-lakh supari from Roghe.         
	Who ultimately gave the murder contract is still being probed but Bhagats ex-wife Jaya Chheda and estranged son Hitesh could be questioned. A month back, Bhagat had written to Maria saying his former wife and son could get him killed.

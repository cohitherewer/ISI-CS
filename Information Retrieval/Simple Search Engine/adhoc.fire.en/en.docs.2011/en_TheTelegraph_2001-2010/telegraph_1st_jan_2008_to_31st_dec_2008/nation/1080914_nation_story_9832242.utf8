          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The city and its adjoining areas suffered frequent power cuts today after a 250MW unit at CESCs Budge Budge power plant collapsed.        
	The shortfall through the day hovered between 150MW and 200MW. Areas in Calcutta went without electricity three to four times.        
	The unit was restored tonight.        
	CESC officials said around 11.45 last night, the main controlling switch of the 250MW unit developed a fault and broke down, plunging several places into darkness for about an hour.         
	The officials said the demand for power at night was low, but it shot up since this morning as the temperature soared.        
	The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited tried to supply additional power in the evening but a snag at the CESC receiving station in Howrah put paid to its efforts.         
	The power distribution company could supply only about 550MW to the CESC grid.        
	However, we are not sure whether the problem was at our end or theirs, a CESC official said.

	Islamabad, Dec. 14 (Agencies): Pakistan might release detained leaders of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa if India does not provide evidence of their involvement in the Mumbai terror attacks, a top police official has said.        
	Islamabad had asked the government of Punjab province to detain seven top Dawa leaders after the group was declared a front for the Lashkar-e-Toiba by a UN Security Council committee.         
	Of them, five are under preventive detention, provincial police chief Shaukat Javed said. The two yet to be detained had gone to Saudi Arabia for Haj, he said.        
	However, Javed told The News daily that the leaders would be freed if no evidence of their involvement in the Mumbai attacks was received from India.        
	The UN panel also put Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the Lashkar founder who now heads the Dawa, and suspected Mumbai attack mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, also a Lashkar leader, on a list of terrorists subject to sanctions. Saeed is among those under house arrest.        
	Javed said all schools and colleges run by the Dawa would be allowed to function normally under the supervision of other bodies to be formed by provincial governments.         
	Our own investigations cannot proceed beyond a certain point without provision of credible information and evidence, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said.        
	But his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, said it would be premature to share evidence with Pakistan now.         
	According to India, the 10 gunmen were from Pakistan, as were the handlers, masterminds, weapons, training camps and financing.        
	India had traced previous terrorist attacks to Pakistan too, but animosity and distrust had ruined any hopes for co-operation.         
	After the 1993 Bombay blasts, India had provided evidence of Pakistani complicity, which Islamabad rejected as fabricated, said C. Uday Bhaskar, a defence analyst in New Delhi.         
	This time may be different.        
	Evidence collected from captured terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman Kasab, as well as recovered phones and forensic proof, may be too strong to dismiss, analysts say.        
	Besides, 26 foreigners were killed, which has brought help to India from other countries and international pressure that makes it harder for Islamabad to avoid taking action.        
	But Indias evidence also includes intelligence apparently gleaned by eavesdropping on Pakistan, which authorities will be loath to share.                    
	In September, the Research and Analysis Wing, Indias foreign intelligence agency, had intercepted telephone conversations apparently coming out of Pakistan that discussed possible attacks on Mumbai hotels, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.        
	India will almost certainly not disclose details of its espionage work to Pakistan.

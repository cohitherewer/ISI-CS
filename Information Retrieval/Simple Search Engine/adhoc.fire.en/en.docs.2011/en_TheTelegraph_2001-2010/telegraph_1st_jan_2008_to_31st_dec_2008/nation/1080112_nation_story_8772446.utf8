     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Sinha
                 
	Srinagar, Jan. 11: Jammu and Kashmir governor S.K. Sinha today said most Indian politicians were corrupt and that elections were a source of wrong-doing.
    
	Even today we have some individual leaders in politics who uphold high moral values but they are an exception, the retired lieutenant general said while delivering a lecture on morality and politics in Jammu University. He did not name any politician, though.
    
	Sinha said elections had become the fountainhead of corruption, crime, communalism and casteism. Corruption is rampant in every sphere of elections.
    
	Ever since Sinha took over as the states governor in 2003, he has had repeated run-ins with politicians, particularly former chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. That could be a reason Mufti has been demanding an elected governor for the state.
    
	When Mufti was chief minister, he and Sinha had fallen out over the duration of the Amarnath yatra that the government wanted to curtail to one month. Congress leaders had then backed the governor.
    
	Today, the former military man hit out virtually at all politicians. He made a distinction between a statesman  a leader with a broad and long-term vision  and a politician who has a limited and myopic vision and thinks only of the next election.
    
	The young generation that takes to politics should strive to become statesmen rather than politicians.
    
	Sinha has been known to stir controversy with his remarks. A few years ago, when he was Assam governor, he had said illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were changing the demography of the state  a concern often raised by the Sangh parivar but widely dismissed as a bogey.
    
	Other governors have been known to make more personal remarks. Balram Jakhar had a year ago threatened to shoot Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan if projects did not finish on time. 
    
	Sinha said politics without morality had brought about degeneration in public life since the Gandhian era.
    
	He also spoke against campus politics. The temples of learning should remain apolitical and not become the battlefield of party politics.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 21: Despite facing severe coal scarcity in the region, National Aluminium Company (Nalco) is planning its third phase of expansion plans involving an investment to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore in Orissa.        
	Speaking to reporters on Saturday after the annual general meeting, Nalco chairman-cum-managing director C.R. Pradhan admitted that the production in the aluminium smelter and captive power plants had been affected due to a short supply of coal from Mahanadi Coalfields Limited over the past couple of years.         
	The short supply had resulted in a fall in power generation from the 960MW captive power plant to 5,609-million units in 2007-08, from the previous 5,968 million units in 2007. About the steps taken by Nalco to overcome the crisis, Pradhan said: We have the option of importing coal or procuring from domestic private coal miners to meet the shortfall. However, both options are not feasible when the cost factor and quality is taken into account.        
	Despite the crisis, Nalco will go ahead with its third phase brownfield expansion project with an investment of Rs 6,000 crore, expected to be ready by 2012, the CMD said.         
	He added that the with the expansion, Nalcos aluminium production capacity would go up to 5.80 lakh tonnes and the power generation capacity to 1,400MW per annum. The second phase of expansion, with an investment of Rs 5,000 crore, is on the verge of completion, while Nalco has invested Rs 3,600 crore on the first phase, he said. Apart from the brownfield expansion, Nalco has plans to set up two greenfield projects of Rs 15,500 crore in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.

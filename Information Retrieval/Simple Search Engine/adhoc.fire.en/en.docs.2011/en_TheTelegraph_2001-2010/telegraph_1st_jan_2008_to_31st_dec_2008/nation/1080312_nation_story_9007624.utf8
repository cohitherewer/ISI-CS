  - Security breach slur   on AICC leader        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Causing trouble?                                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 11: The alleged security breach by AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi during his recent Orissa tour triggered arguments in the Assembly today with ruling BJD-BJP members describing the act as a conspiracy to defame the state government on grounds of security failure.         
	The safety issue was raised in the zero hour by BJD member Kalpataru Das, who referred to a March 7 incident in Koraput where Rahul gave a slip to the district police and spent more than four hours in a tribal village without informing the police.         
	When the Koraput superintendent of police (SP) tried to stop his vehicle and then followed the convoy, the SPG officers rudely asked him to leave, said Das, quoting SP D.K. Chouhan. Rahul reportedly returned to his Nalco guesthouse at midnight.        
	He also labelled the trip pre-planned as a former IAS officer of Meghalaya cadre, now working with the Rajiv Gandhi Forum, had planned the night trip.         
	Congress members stormed into the Well in protest, forcing adjournment till 3pm, and finally staged a walkout in the afternoon.        
	Das alleged that Rahul and the SPG personnel deliberately breached security by not informing the state police.         
	He demanded a discussion on the matter and a statement from the government. The Opposition members objected to the discussion arguing that matters regarding non-members, who cannot defend themselves in the House, should not be allowed in the House.         
	Instead, they insisted on an adjournment motion on the ongoing lawyers strike demanding the establishment of permanent bench of the high court.         
	As Speaker Maheswar Mohanty found it difficult to run the House, he adjourned proceedings till 3pm.         
	CM notice        
	The Opposition today moved a privilege notice against chief minister Naveen Patnaik for announcing policy decisions outside the House.         
	NCP member Arun Dey said the chief minister had announced policy decisions related to the allocation of water from Hirakud reservoir at a BJD farmers rally in Bargarh on Sunday.         
	Stating that parliamentary procedure bars the government from making policy announcements outside the Assembly while it is in session, Dey alleged that Naveens announcements amounted to the breach.         
	Referring to the chief ministers announcement that not a drop of water from Hirakud reservoir meant for irrigation will be allocated to industries, the NCP leader said: Lets hope he (Naveen) is not trying to hoodwink the farmers.         
	He also wanted to know the fate of commitments to the industries under the Industrial Policy Resolution and the MoUs signed with various industries to provide water to their projects.

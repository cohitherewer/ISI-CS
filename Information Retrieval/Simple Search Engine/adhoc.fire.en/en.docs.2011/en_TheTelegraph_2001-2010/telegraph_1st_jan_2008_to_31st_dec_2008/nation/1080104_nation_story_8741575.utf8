	Jaipur, Jan. 3: Palaces, camel rides, folk music and dance, even the mandatory snatching of a roll of film from a photographer  Madonnas India visit seems so far to have met every expectation.
    
	The pop star (in picture) has been making short excursions twice a day in and around the Rohetgarh Fort, about 40km from Jodhpur, local travel industry sources said. 
    
	She has checked in at the 16th-century heritage hotel with husband Guy Ritchie and her children and friends.
    
	Today she visited the Chanwa Fort in Luni, travelling the 20km from Rohetgarh on horseback, and took several pictures of the 19th-century fortress made of red sandstone, the sources said. The fort, now a heritage hotel, is known for its latticework friezes and intricate jharokhas.
    
	After a lunch of gatte ki curry (made of besan), ker sangri, bajra roti and other Rajasthani dishes, she rode back to Rohetgarh.
    
	Madonna was charmed by a performance of Rajasthani folk music and dance at Rohetgarh, especially Ghoomar and Kalbeliya, and even tried matching steps with the artistes. Her children enjoyed the puppet show, a source said.
    
	The singer, who arrived in Jodhpur on December 31, earlier visited a wilderness camp in Khandi, located on a sand dune near Rohetgarh. 
    
	The camp, set up by the Rohetgarh Fort hotel, is a luxury tent pitched on the highest point of a largely flat landscape.

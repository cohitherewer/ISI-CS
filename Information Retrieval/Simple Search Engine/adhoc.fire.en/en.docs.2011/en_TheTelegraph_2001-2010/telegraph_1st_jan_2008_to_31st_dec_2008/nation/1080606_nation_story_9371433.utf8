          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, June 5: Dentist Rajesh Talwar was today sent to judicial custody for 14 days after the CBI told the designated court it did not need to question him any more.        
	Sources said the agency had not unearthed any concrete evidence against Rajesh, accused of killing his 15-year-old daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, but prised out crucial leads from him during a lie-detector test.        
	They claimed the dentist knew where the murder weapons and the victims missing mobile phones were hidden.        
	(Rajesh) Talwar was cautious and evasive even while undergoing the polygraph test but the results have yielded some positive leads, a senior official said.        
	Agency sources said they had evidence that Rajesh and his dentist wife Nupur had lied about Aarushis bedroom door being closed on May 15 night when her throat was slit.        
	The Talwars had said they did not hear anything during the double murder in their two-bedroom house since the doors of their bedroom as well as Aarushis were closed. They had claimed they slept through the murders, with the air-conditioner blanking out any sound from outside.        
	Sources said the CBI had evidence that the door of at least Aarushis room was open, and would establish it in court.        
	The agency also believes that Aarushi was killed before Hemraj.        
	In the four days that the CBI had custody of Rajesh, it took him to Hardwar and questioned him in the presence of Nupur and also together with the Talwars colleagues Anita and Praful Durrani.        
	The sleuths have questioned the Talwars other domestic help, Bharti, who was the first to arrive in the house on May 16, and driver Umesh.        
	The sources said the CBI had found a blood-soaked blanket and some other clothing with suspected blood traces at the Talwar home.        
	Agency officials have held a series of meetings with forensic experts to discuss the crime scene and other evidence. CBI officials said they would have to rely heavily on forensic evidence and hoped experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, who were assisting them, would help crack the case.        
	Renuka salvo        
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury today accused the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, who had defended the polices handling of the case, of neglecting child protection. She met top ministry officials to examine Mayavatis record on ensuring child safety.

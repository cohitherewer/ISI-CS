     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Feb. 26: The future of Poscos steel plans in Orissa continues to hang in balance owing to a long-drawn legal battle over the mining licence for Khandadhar iron ore reserves.
    
	The lease grant to the Korean steel major has remained mired in dispute for over a year now before Orissa High Court. As things stand today, a verdict is expected in March.
    
	The companys lease request has been delayed for more than 25 and more months. 
    
	A two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and B. Mohapatra on Monday had closed a hearing that had reached the court for the second time in the year. But the bench deferred the judgement, as submission of written arguments remained pending.
    
	Now, the court has fixed March 4 as the deadline for the submission of the written note of arguments by the state and parties opposing the process being adopted for the lease grant.
    
	The verdict assumes significance as the fate of Poscos proposed 12MT steel plant in Jagatsinghpur hinges on it. 
    
	The government had initially recommended an iron ore-bearing area of 6,204 hectares at Khandadhar in Sundergarh in favour of Posco in December 2006. 
    
	Later, Kudremukh Iron Ore Limited took the lease issue to the high court and they contested that the states recommendation (in favour of Posco). The PSU added that since they had prospected the Khandadhar mines before, the company had a preferential right to the lease. 
    
	The high court lobbed the ball to the Centres court in April 2007. The Centres revision court subsequently returned the ball to the state with a direction to consider all applications afresh. 
    
	But the mining issue was pushed to a second round of battle in the high court when some of the applicants filed writ petitions in December 2007 challenging the process being adopted for considering applications. 
    
	The firms alleged that the state was adopting a pre-meditated approach in favour of Posco.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mulayam keeps elbow room 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, July 4: The Samajwadi Party is unlikely to join the government but could extend outside support, at least for now, to convince its voters in Uttar Pradesh that it is not power hungry, party sources said today.        
	Congress sources, however, hinted that some sort of power-sharing might eventually take place after the dust over the nuclear deal had settled down.        
	Samajwadi insiders, too, suggested that once the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) died a natural death, the flow of events might bring the party alongside the Congress. The Samajwadis see the Congress as a secular champion of national interest and a natural ally against Mayavati and the BJP, they said.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh today discussed seat-sharing in Uttar Pradesh in detail with the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi but claimed there was no trade-off in their support to the Centre on the nuke deal.        
	I am not interested in any cabinet post; we are not joining the government, Amar said.        
	The events of the past few days, however, suggest that the Samajwadis might want to leave themselves with enough room for manoeuvring.        
	For a week, they had tested the waters by attacking the Congress on price rise while committing their party to keeping the communal forces at bay. They demanded details of the safeguards agreements text but later seemed satisfied with the already known opinion of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the Muslim face of the countrys nuclear programme.        
	Just before meeting Kalam and getting an assurance about the nuclear pact being in the national interest  which paved the way for the deal with the Congress  the Samajwadis had put up a show of UNPA unity.        
	Their UNPA partners later said they might hold a meeting in the absence of the Samajwadis to discuss the nuclear deal once again. Mulayam said his party would not hold any more meetings with the UNPA on the deal.        
	Samajwadi sources said the UNPA was likely to die a natural death. Even as the UNPA was being formed it was being labelled a baloo ki deewaar (wall of sand) within the party, a source said.        
	Amar had said yesterday that not supporting the UPA earlier was an error that he would not keep repeating.

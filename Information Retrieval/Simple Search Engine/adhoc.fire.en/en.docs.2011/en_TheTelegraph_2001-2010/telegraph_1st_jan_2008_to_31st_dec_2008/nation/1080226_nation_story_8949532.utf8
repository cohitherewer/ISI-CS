The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Airport strike put off 
                                                                                                               Airport strike put off 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The shadow of an indefinite strike at state-run airports from tomorrow has lifted with their 18,000 employees agreeing to give Praful Patel a maximum of three months to sort out problems.        
	The decision came after a meeting the civil aviation minister and Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials held with representatives of the Airport Authority Employees Union. Patel assured them he would hold another round of talks from March 10, sources said.        
	A number of issues, including the closure of Bangalore and Hyderabad airports, raised by the union representatives were discussed, an official said.        
	The union has demanded continuation of employees permanent jobs with the state-run airport operator and an end to moves to force them to join private airport operators Mumbai International Airport Ltd and Delhi International Airport Ltd.        
	It wants to highlight the government policy of asking the AAI to run unviable non-metro airports. The closure of the AAI airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore after private airports become operational there next month is also an issue.        
	Citu Bengal president Shyamal Chakraborty said the strike was put off after Patel agreed to withhold the closure of Hyderabad airport and revive a tripartite panel that could hold talks with the Prime Minister.        
	We will watch the governments moves and decide accordingly, he said.        
	Officials said a strike by the employees union would have resulted in dirty airports. But security, air traffic control, ticketing and baggage handling would not have been affected.        
	Our agitation is in protest against privatisation of airports, said Dilip Gujjar, the national assistant general secretary of the airport employees union.        
	The government can have greenfield airports by all means but it should allow the AAI to have a level playing field, added M.K. Ghosal, the union general secretary.

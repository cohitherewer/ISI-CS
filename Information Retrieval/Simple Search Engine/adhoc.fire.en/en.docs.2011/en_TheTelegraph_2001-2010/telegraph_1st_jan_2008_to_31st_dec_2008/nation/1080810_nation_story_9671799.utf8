          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 9: Local fruit growers call to cross the Line of Control on August 11 today received the backing of separatists, traders, transport operators and lawyers.        
	Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani announced the Muzaffarabad chalo programme after a meeting with the moderate faction, other separatist groups, fruit growers, trade and industry bodies, and officials from Kashmirs High Court Bar Association.        
	The fruit growers want to sell their produce in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir since an economic blockade by Jammus Amarnath protesters has stopped any trade between the Valley and the rest of India.        
	Only the Friendship Bus is allowed on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, and an official said the authorities might use force to stop the march. We fear some major violence on the day, he added.        
	After the meeting, Geelani said: We request the people of Srinagar, Anantnag, Shopian (all in central and south Kashmir) to converge at 11am on August 11 at Srinagars fruit mandi (market). We will march on the route towards Muzaffarabad in a procession.        
	He added: People from north Kashmir will join us on the way. We also urge people from Poonch and Rajouri districts (in Jammu) to march on the Teetal road towards Rawalkote (in PoK) and Karnah.        
	The fruit growers had decided sometime ago to cross the LoC on August 11 but moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq preferred a date after August 15. Geelani today said the date fixed by the fruit growers had now received everyones approval because their fruit is rotting.        
	The march call comes at a time a high-level team from Delhi is meeting members of the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, the umbrella group leading the Jammu protest.         
	The economic blockade by the Samiti, protesting the cancellation of a land allotment to the Amarnath shrine board, has sparked five-day-long protests here that have claimed one life and injured dozens.        
	The state government claims no economic blockade is on and that only a few disruptions have taken place. But traders and fruit growers here allege that a large number of Valley trucks have been targeted by mobs on Jammu highways.        
	Geelani said the blockade was criminal and had faced the Valley with a shortage of life-saving medicines, food, fuel and other essentials.        
	Todays meeting featured, among others, separatist leaders Shabir Ahmad Shah, Sheikh Abdul Aziz and Bashir Ahmad Bhat besides the head of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Mubeen Shah, and high court bar president Nazir Ronga.        
	Come what may, we will march on August 11. Our fruit is rotting, Baramulla Fruit Grower Association president Ghulam Rasool Bhat said.        
	The separatists called off the five-day-old strike today.

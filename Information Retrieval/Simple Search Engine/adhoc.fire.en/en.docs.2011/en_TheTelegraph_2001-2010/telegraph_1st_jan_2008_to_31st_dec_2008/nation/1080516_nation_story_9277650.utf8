	Dibrugarh, May 15: Two women and a seven-year-old spent four days and nights with two decomposed bodies in their Dibrugarh home after a botched suicide pact.         
	When police broke open the door this morning after neighbours complained of a nauseating stench coming out of the Verma residence, the three survivors were too traumatised to speak and were taken to hospital.        
	All that Kalyani Devi, 55, and her daughter Asha, 33, could tell doctors was that they had all tried to commit suicide by swallowing sleeping pills.         
	Kalyanis son Shiv Verma, 30, and one of Ashas two children, Krishna, died. But the two women and Ashas other son, Aman, survived.        
	A relative who lives nearby said Asha had returned from her husbands home a couple of years ago. Neighbours added that the family, which once owned a flourishing jewellery shop, was going through an acute financial crisis.         
	We are yet to interrogate them, Dibrugarh Sadar police station officer-in-charge Sisir Barauh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dig into steak, gift an animal a home
                                                                                                            Dig into steak, gift an animal a home
          MANDIRA NAYAR                          Fuzzy feeling                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Just gorged on a succulent steak? Get ready to go back home with a warm, fuzzy feeling.        
	People for Animals, run by former MP Maneka Gandhi, has found a simple way to get people to support their cause  a tiny donation added to the restaurant bill.        
	The non-profit organisation has tied up with 20 of the capitals most expensive restaurants to get them to add an extra Rs 10 on their bill.        
	The donation is, of course, voluntary.        
	Customers have the option to ask the management not to charge them the amount, said Revathy Radhakrishnan, an activist with the group.        
	The money  the NGO has so far added over a lakh to its kitty through this initiative  goes towards running shelters and for rescuing and sterilising animals.        
	We have supplied the restaurants with cards, which explain everything. These cards are placed on each table and customers get to know exactly what will happen with their money, Radhakrishnan said.        
	The NGO also ensures that dogs around these eateries are healthy, inoculated and sterile.        
	Started over a month ago, the scheme seems to have struck a chord with restaurants.        
	From the ultra chic Olive Bar and Restaurant  opened in a new beach avatar after being sealed  to Magique in Garden of Five Senses, this conscience cess has given restaurants the chance to show off their sensitive side.        
	We have always supported causes, said a spokesperson for Olive. So far, no customer has refused to pay Rs 10. After all, it is for a good cause.        
	Olive is also planning to tie up with another group of NGOs to run a similar scheme to battle hunger.        
	Restaurants that have opted to charge this money have had to change their whole software system, Radhakrishnan said. The money is added on to the bill and is not taxed, so the way the bill is generated needs to change. It really shows they care.        
	But not every customer is happy to donate Rs 10 for keeping the population of dogs in the city stable or healthy. I think restaurants shouldnt add the money to the bill, said Sarita Mehra, who was taken aback when she paid for her dinner at a restaurant in Delhis Khan Market.        
	They should have a donation box so that people who want to donate can put the money in it, she said. I felt they were playing on guilt. Its only Rs 10 and after it has been added to the bill, you feel its mean to say no.

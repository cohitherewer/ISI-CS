                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP sharpens N-deal attack
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 5: Those who expected the BJP to be ruing its rigid stance on the nuclear deal, now that the Prime Minister appears to have pulled it off despite the Lefts resistance, were in for a surprise today.        
	The main Opposition party has sharpened its attack on the agreement, even putting its darling, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in the dock.        
	A joint statement by L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh, the partys leaders in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, said the crisis of the past few weeks was a consequence of an ill-conceived, ill-timed, ill-negotiated and hastily pushed nuclear agreement with the US administration.        
	The statement asked the Prime Minister and the Congress to explain what reasons had compelled them to rush the country into this agreement in such desperate haste.        
	The UPA has supinely now consented to be pushed into agreeing to this deal at a pace dictated by the US and at their domestic convenience.        
	Todays attack was far more scathing than the BJPs earlier criticism of the deal that was based solely on the restrictions imposed by the Hyde Act. All senior leaders, including Advani, had said in the recent past that the BJP could rethink its stand on the deal if it was convinced on the question of further nuclear tests.        
	Today statement, however, raised questions also about the quantity and price of the nuclear energy the deal would bring.        
	And despite the BJPs repeated assertions in the past about its resolve to improve Indias ties with the US, the statement said: To keep the US establishment happy, propriety, principles of governance, probity in public life have been abandoned.        
	It added: No government has behaved as timidly as the UPA to China and the US. Never in the past 60 years of our independent existence has any government done as much harm to our strategic autonomy as this government.        
	So far, party spokespersons had avoided criticising Kalams views. But Jaswant today said the former President  who is said to have advised the Samajwadi Party that the deal is in the national interest  was taking a simplistic view of the situation. I regret he has given this advice.

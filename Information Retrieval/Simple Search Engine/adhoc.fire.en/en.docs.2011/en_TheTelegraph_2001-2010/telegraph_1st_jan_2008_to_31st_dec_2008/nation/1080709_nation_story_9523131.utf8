          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 8: The ill-fated launch that had sunk in Balimela reservoir near Alampekka village in Chitrakonda following a Naxalite ambush has been brought ashore.         
	Five bodies trapped in the launch were pulled out today using cutters, while three more were fished out from the reservoir. Weapons were also recovered from the launch. There were guns, though we cant say exactly how many. Some weapons are believed to have fallen off the launch. We tried to use magnets, but it was difficult because of the muddy reservoir bed, said Malkangiri superintendent of police S.K. Gajbhiye, who was monitoring the operation.         
	Earlier, eight slain jawans were flown to Visakhapatnam. With todays recovery, the number of casualty stood at 31.         
	For now, the search and rescue operations have been wound up, said the senior officer. The search for the rest of the missing jawans would be resumed after a few days.         
	Two gas balloons, brought in from Singapore, were used to lift the motor-launch from a depth of over 40m yesterday. The boat was then towed with the help of vessels.         
	The launch is full of mud and soil and proved most difficult to drag. Besides, incessant rains delayed the operation. The presence of crocodiles in the reservoir also posed hurdles.         
	On June 29, the vessel capsized in Balimela near Alampekka village after Naxalites fired bullets and grenades from surrounding hills on Greyhound commandos of Andhra Pradesh returning to Chitrakonda after conducting a search operation in Janbai.         
	Twenty-six commandos, a constable and two members of the launch crew managed to swim to the shore.

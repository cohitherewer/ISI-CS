	Mumbai, Aug. 1: Niketa Mehta, carrying a 25-weeks-old foetus with a heart block, must wait some more to find out if she can have an abortion.        
	Indias 37-year-old Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act does not allow abortion beyond the 20th week of pregnancy. Doctors at Mumbais J.J. Hospital have been directed by Bombay High Court to advise if Niketa, 31, should be allowed an abortion but are dithering.        
	Today, the court asked the doctors panel to go back to the drawing table and take a considered stand.        
	The doctors agree that the disorder is likely to give the child, if its born, a very poor quality of life. Niketa, husband Haresh and their gynaecologist have filed a petition at the court requesting abortion.        
	The doctors panel told the court that though it is possible for the child to have a life, the heart block would mean a serious compromise on the quality of its life, said Amit Kharkanis, the couples lawyer. They said they would leave the decision to the parents. The court did not accept this and insisted on clear advice.        
	The report should be submitted on August 4, the next day of hearing, according to PTI.        
	If the court allows the abortion, it will mean an amendment to the 20-week legal ceiling. Many countries, such as the UK, have set their cutoff at the 26th week.        
	The MTP Act was passed with an eye on stopping female foeticide. It bans abortions beyond 20 weeks because that is when the sex of a foetus can be determined.        
	The penalty for violation is jail for up to seven years.        
	The act, however, mentions that if a pregnant womans life is under threat, abortion can be allowed even beyond the 20th week, Kharkanis said.        
	Niketa and Haresh, childhood sweethearts who married five years ago and are expecting their first child, are ready to approach the Supreme Court if the high court decides against allowing the abortion.        
	The couple spent Wednesday running from department to department at the government-managed J.J. Hospital, going through tests and evaluations by the doctors panel.        
	It was a long day from 11am to 6.30pm with no meal. The hospital did not have the latest machines and we were orally told after a sonography that there was only a heart block (in the foetus). Niketa was exhausted at the end of the ordeal, Kharkanis said.

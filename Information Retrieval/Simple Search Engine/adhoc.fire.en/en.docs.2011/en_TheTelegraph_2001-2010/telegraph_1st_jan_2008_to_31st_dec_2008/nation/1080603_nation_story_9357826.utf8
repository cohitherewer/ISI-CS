	Bhopal, June 2: Madhya Pradesh health minister Ajay Vishnoi today stepped down following raids on his ancestral home by income-tax officials.        
	The move was a blow to the Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime, which is worried about the political fallout of the raids, with Assembly polls less than six months away.         
	Income-tax officials on Friday conducted raids at the residence of Vishnois brother Abhay in Jabalpur.         
	The sleuths said they had raided 56 places and examined 37 lockers. They claimed to have unearthed a scam involving people in high places. The income-tax director-general (investigation), S.S. Rana, said Rs 86 lakh was recovered.

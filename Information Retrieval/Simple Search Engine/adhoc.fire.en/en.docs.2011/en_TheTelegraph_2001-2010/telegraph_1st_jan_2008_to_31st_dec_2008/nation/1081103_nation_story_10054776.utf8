	Sambalpur, Nov. 2: Orissa Civil Liberty Forum opened its Sambalpur chapter and organised an FIR awareness camp here.        
	Deputy inspector-general of police (northern range) Y.B. Khurania, collector Pradipta Kumar Patnaik and senior members of the forum from different parts of the state were present.         
	The forum was chaired by the newly appointed president Pramod Kumar Patnaik.        
	Inaugurating the camp, Pradipta said that every effort would be made to see that all the citizens get justice from police stations. In filing FIR, the police should not make a choice, he suggested.         
	Khurania said the police also faced several problems amid rise in population and crime rate. But the number of policemen and allied facilities to it didnt rise in proportion, Khurania added.         
	In spite of all problems, refusal of lodging an FIR is not a good gesture from the department, he added. He assured people of justice from the police by saying:         
	My door is always open for the people in distress. Those who find problems in local police stations, are free to meet me or the superintendents of police of districts concerned, he added.         
	The forums state office-bearers  Merusagar Samantray, Simantini Jena, Subhendu Parida  spoke on the objectives of the association and the service it was rendering to innocent people whose voices are hardly heard in the society.         
	Khurania also handed over a postal kit box to the welfare officers of Sambalpur jail to enable inmates to send letters to their homes and relatives.         
	Nimai Charan Sahu, S .K. Bisi and Mahabir Mishra would act as vice-president, organising secretary and zonal co-ordinator, respectively, state working chairman Samantray announced.

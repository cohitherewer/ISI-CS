                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Karat points to Birlas to back Tatas
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, May 7: Prakash Karat had cited the Birlas to counter criticism on the presence of the Tatas in Bengal.        
	At the recent party congress in Coimbatore, the CPM general secretary also admitted that promoting a non-monopolistic industrial policy was not possible in Left-ruled states like Bengal and Kerala.        
	Karats comments came while replying to a discussion on the partys political organisation report. The CPM is yet to make the report public.        
	The CPM chiefs observations followed criticism from various quarters about the Singur project on the ground that the party was promoting big industrial houses though it had a non-monopolistic industrial policy.         
	Sources claimed that Karat, in his reply on April 3, the concluding day of the congress, said the approach to industrial policy involving big houses should be on a case-by-case basis.        
	Karat hinted that the Tatas couldnt be kept out when it came to a car manufacturing unit and reminded delegates at the congress about an old debate on a similar issue involving the Birlas in Kerala.        
	The Birla groups Gwalior Rayon factory at Mavoor, which was closed in 2001, was one of the largest private sector enterprises in Kerala, where the worlds first elected communist government came to power in 1957.        
	The point here is that when it comes to setting up a car manufacturing unit, houses like the Tatas cant be kept out. The project gives employment to many people, a source explained.        
	We still want to promote non-monopolistic industrial houses and believe that large industries should be owned by the public sector. At the same time, we are constrained by the policies of the Centre, a party leader added.         
	A report on the website of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy said: He (Karat) underlined that these governments (Left-ruled state governments) are part of the struggle to implement the Left and Democratic programme and the governments would keep this in mind.        
	However, this does not mean that all aspects of this programme can be implemented. As an example, Karat cited how it is not possible for (the) Bengal and Kerala governments to implement the 18th congress formulation of promoting non-monopolistic industrial growth as part of its all India platform. He said this will be campaigned for in these states along with the rest of the country.        
	The political resolution of the 18th party congress advocated promoting non-monopolistic industrial policies, encouraging medium and small scale industries and streamlining and strengthening public sector units for an economy based on national sovereignty and peoples needs.        
	The website report said Karat noted that Left-ruled governments could not implement even the Left and Democratic programme in full.

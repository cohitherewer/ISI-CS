  -   Leader in dark on Jaswant mission

	New Delhi, March 22: L.K. Advani today washed his hands of the decision to send Jaswant Singh with terrorists during the Kandahar hijack, in a controversial revelation that could embarrass members of the erstwhile Vajpayee government afresh.        
	 I dont think that I am answerable for that (sending then foreign minister Jaswant with the terrorists), if the committee on security had taken a decision, Advani told a TV channel.        
	Asked if he was not part of the decision, Advani said: I wouldnt say it I would know that. He must have consulted Vajpayeeji, but it was not an issue at all and this issue was also raised by many others many months later.        
	Asked pointedly whether he was unaware of the decision to send Jaswant, he said: I dont know about it, I came to know when he was going.        
	Advani insisted, though, that Jaswant was not escorting the terrorists; he had gone to bring back the passengers.         
	The Vajpayee government had in 1999 controversially decided to release Maulana Masood Azhar, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Ahmed Omar Sheikh in exchange for passengers on board the hijacked IC 814 flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. All have since been reported to be active in exporting terror into India from Pakistan.        
	Unlike what he said on TV, Advani the author has been careful not to court controversy in his recently released autobiography, My Country My Life.        
	He has made revelations that will not affect the BJP, like a secret meeting he held with Mulayam Singh Yadav at Jaya Jaitleys home in 1999 before Sonia Gandhi went to stake claim to form the government.        
	The dominant view now is the book has corrected Advanis image of being a fundamentalist, a Hindutva hawk and a perpetual agitator. It has apparently bolstered his image as a serious politician and thinker.        
	Advanis handling of thorny issues has received acclaim. He has talked about differences with Vajpayee, but underlined that he never defied the party patriarch.        
	He has emerged unscathed while talking about the Jinnah row too, pushing his colleagues on the backfoot by saying they misunderstood him.        
	In a chapter titled I have no regrets, Advani wrote: An impression had been created that, after my return from Pakistan, I had begun to endorse everything that Jinnah said. This impression was baseless, misleading.        
	He recalled: One day, in the middle of 2005, I was told that I should step down from presidentship of the BJP.        
	I was in a dilemma. What should I do? My state of mind was not quite unlike that of the unsure Arjuna on the battlefield.        
	Advani has also diluted the allegation that the Babri Masjid demolition was the target of his Ayodhya movement. He has put in perspective the subtle difference between agitating for a Ram temple at his birthplace and pulling down the disputed structure.

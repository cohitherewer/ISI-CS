          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 10: The CBI today told the Supreme Court it had enough evidence to file a charge-sheet against Mayavati in a Rs 28-crore assets case.        
	Mayavati, a cabinet colleague and several officials are accused of siphoning money off the Rs 175-crore Taj Heritage Corridor project during one of her previous stints as chief minister.        
	The Taj Corridor case has since hit a roadblock with the governor denying sanction to prosecute the chief minister on the ground that the charges did not stand scrutiny. The agency is yet to challenge the governors order in court.        
	The apex court, though, has de-linked the assets case from the Taj Corridor case and directed that the charges against Mayavati be probed.        
	The CBIs latest status report on the wealth case says it has enough evidence to file a charge-sheet. The agency can file the charge-sheet in a Lucknow court under the Criminal Procedure Code since it has completed investigations.

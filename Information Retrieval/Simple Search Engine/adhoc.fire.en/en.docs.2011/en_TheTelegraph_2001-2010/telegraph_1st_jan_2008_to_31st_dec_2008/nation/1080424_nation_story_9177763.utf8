          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 23: Levels of nitrate in underground water in localities across Gaya have risen a high 250mg-per-litre as against a maximum permissible limit of 45mg.         
	This discovery was made during a test conducted on behalf of residents of Pita Maheshwar locality of the town and was conducted by officials of the public health and engineering department. The report has caused alarm.         
	More than 60 per cent of the half-a-million residents falling under the purview of Gaya Municipal Corporation depend on underground water sources, as the civic bodys water supply system caters to about 40 per cent of the estimated 45,000 households in the town.         
	The presence of nitrate and other harmful trace substances was seen to be concentrated in areas located around the Falgu, as municipal waste and effluents contaminate the river. A while ago, Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah had threatened to take action against municipal authorities, under provisions of the Pollution Control Act, for dumping municipal waste in the Falgu. But, so far, little change has taken place.         
	According to Shahid Siddiqi, visiting gastroenterologist, nitrate in water affects children more than adults. It reduces oxygenation processes leading to breathing problems, repeated respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. Prolonged use of water with high nitrate content can also cause cancer, said Siddiqi.         
	When contacted, the executive engineer of PHED, Ajay Kumar Sinha, washed his hands off the matter and said that it was for the civic body to work out a strategy to combat the nitrate menace.         
	While city commissioner S.K. Tiwari passed the buck on to PHED.

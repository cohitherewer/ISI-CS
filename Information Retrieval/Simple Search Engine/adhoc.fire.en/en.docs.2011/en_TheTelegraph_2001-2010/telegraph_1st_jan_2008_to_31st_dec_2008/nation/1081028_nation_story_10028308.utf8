The importance of Bhubaneswar has been on the rise as it is emerging as major IT hub in the country besides being a prominent tourist spot and the state capital.        
	The city has been divided into four zones for planned development  extensive, intensive, sensitive and restrictive. It has been estimated that around 4.4 lakh houses would be needed for 30 lakh population by 2030 (at present, there are nearly 2 lakh houses). Besides, the requirement of drinking water would be an estimated 88 million gallons per day.        
	Various related departments, including rapid mass transit system, improvement of roads, construction of parking space and open space to cater to the burgeoning population, have been planned.         
	The other major aspect discussed at todays meeting was solid waste management, sewerage system and waste water disposal.        
	As Bhubaneswar is famous for its heritage, emphasis has been laid on the plan on preservation of ancient monuments and sacred ponds keeping the tourism potential in view.         
	Slums in the city would be resettled on public-private partnership mode, the sources said.         
	The meeting also decided that a land-use policy would be formulated and land would be identified for domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural and institutional use, besides development of green zones.

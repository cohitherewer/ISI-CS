          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Lucknow, June 1: IIT Kanpur student Toya Chatterjee, who hanged herself on Friday night, would often miss classes because of chronic illness and had been counselled for depression, her classmates and teachers say.        
	The 22-year-old Calcuttan, who had lied to her parents saying she had passed her finals, killed herself in her hostel room after her father arrived on the campus for Saturdays convocation.        
	Her friends said Toya, a bio-engineering student, had recently cleared CAT and received an interview call from IIM Indore, but her failure in two subjects meant she couldnt join the MBA course.        
	But the main reason for her depression, they said, appeared to be the gastro-intestinal ailments that had been dogging her over the past one year.        
	She was under the treatment of a private doctor for problems in digestion. The canteen food never suited her and she would often avoid taking meals. She frequently skipped classes because of illness, a teacher in the bio-engineering department said.        
	He added that his colleagues would often provide Toya with home-cooked meals.        
	The dean of student affairs, Prawal Sinha, said he had informed Toyas father three times about her health problems and her state of depression. Institute sources said she had been put on a counselling course.        
	Toya, who had a fine record in school, had got an F in two papers in her finals but scored well in all the other subjects. Institute sources said she was asked to join a special coaching course from May 13 because she was to reappear in these papers in about a month. But she appeared reluctant to do the course.        
	One of Toyas batchmates said she surprised her professors by applying for permission to visit her parents in Calcutta even though it meant she would miss the coaching.        
	Institute sources said she was granted leave since her mental condition was poor and she was physically not stable.        
	Toya returned with her father Kunal, a retired CESC employee, on Friday. She was cremated this morning after her mother Ena, a college teacher, reached Kanpur from Calcutta in the early hours.        
	The parents left the campus with her body around 5am, IIT Kanpur spokesman R. Shukla said.

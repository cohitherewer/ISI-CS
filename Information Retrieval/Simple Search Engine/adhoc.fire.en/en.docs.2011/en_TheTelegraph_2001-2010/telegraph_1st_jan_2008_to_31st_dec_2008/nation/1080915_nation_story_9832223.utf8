          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Prime Minister has extended the life of the National Knowledge Commission in an indication that the panel set up as a one-time initiative could enjoy a long-term role in Indias education policy framework.         
	The three-year term of the Sam Pitroda-headed commission was to end on October 2, but it has been extended by six months till April 2009, government officials said.         
	The BJP has already hinted its support to the concept of an independent education policy adviser by launching a panel in Karnataka modelled on the knowledge commission, sources said.         
	The commission, announced in July 2005, started functioning on October 3 that year with the mandate that it should prepare a blueprint to turn the country from an emerging education power to a knowledge economy.         
	The commission comes directly under the PMO and answers to the Prime Minister, not to the human resource development ministry that runs education in the country.        
	We believe the commission still has a role to play, though its three years are about to get over. That is why we have extended its term, a PMO source said.         
	With the general elections likely by the time the panels extended term comes to a close, the government does not want to think too far ahead, the source added.        
	But the impressive performance of the commission suggests the country could use such a body in its administration for policy framework in the future, too. The source also said the Prime Minister is keen that the commission continue its work.         
	Despite Manmohan Sin- ghs support, the commission has had frequent altercations with the HRD ministry over the past three years. The panel has implicitly  and on occasions explicitly  accused the ministry of not doing enough to promote autonomy of institutions of higher learning such as central universities and the IITs.         
	The Centre has, however, accepted several key proposals of the commission and they are at different stages of implementation.         
	The panels proposal for an unprecedented thrust to skill-based vocational education has resulted in the Centre announcing plans to launch a massive skill development mission that Singh will head.         
	The UPA government has also accepted its proposal to revive libraries across the country and link them through the Internet to allow access to documents and books at any library from any other.         
	The proposal for a national knowledge network linking all higher educational institutions through high-speed Internet is in the process of implementation.         
	Last week, the BJP government in Karnataka launched a state panel modelled on the national commission to promote higher education in the state.         
	The Karnataka Knowledge Commission, to be headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation chairman K. Kasturirangan, is the first state-specific panel of its kind.         
	The BJPs support to the concept of an independent advisory panel for education modelled on the National Knowledge Commission indicates the national panel may enjoy support irrespective of who returns to power in the next Lok Sabha, the PMO source said.

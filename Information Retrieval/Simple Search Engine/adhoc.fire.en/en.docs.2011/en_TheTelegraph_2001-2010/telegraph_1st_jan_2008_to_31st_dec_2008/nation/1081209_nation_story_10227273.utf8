	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Congress is relieved it has broken the rout jinx, which started with Gujarat last December and carried on to Karnataka in May, ahead of the general election.         
	The results put the Congress on the upswing. We have got on to the launching pad for the Lok Sabha polls, said M. Veerappa Moily, the chief spokesperson.        
	The Congress was also grateful the two bugbears chasing it through the campaign  inflation and terrorism  did not have the feared impact.         
	Delhi certainly proves our point because if there is one state where these issues would have had the maximum effect, it is urban, predominantly middle-class Delhi, said a source.         
	Sources said the Congresss mandate to the Centre for its last few months in office  the governments term ends in May  is to implement and expand its social sector schemes, expand rural infrastructure and create jobs in small towns and villages.        
	Sources said the message from Delhi and Jaipur was that the poor and the under-empowered still regarded the Congress as their first choice.         
	A pro-poor image is our biggest cachet and we have to capitalise on that by fine-tuning our economic policies. If the first half of the PMs bailout package was aimed at big industry, the second half will target the have-nots, a general secretary said.        
	This is the reason Congress leaders have told Manmohan Singh he would have to bring in a political face as the finance minister if he wished to give up the portfolio. Someone who can sell the aam aadmi policies credibly, the office-bearer said.        
	The Congress won one big state (Rajasthan) and two small (Mizoram and Delhi). But the victory was tempered by the realisation that the margin in Rajasthan was much narrower than that with which the BJP won Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.         
	In both the heartland states, the BJP had incumbent governments to save, which it did easily.        
	Although the situation in Rajasthan was tailor-made for an effortless Congress win, it could not reach majority and will have to count on rebels and Independents. However, Delhi and Mizoram sweeps recompensed for the shortfall.        
	The two states might not count for much in terms of seats (between them they have 110 Assembly and nine parliamentary seats) but, as Moily put it, Delhi is mini India and a victory in tiny Mizoram is one to retain the soul of India.        
	Sources said the Congress was also relieved on another score. Had the result been 4-0, the BJP would have leveraged it to gain advantage in the Lok Sabha polls by positioning the NDA as the clear winner. The self-inspired aura, they said, would have drawn allies to the BJP  something it lacks with just five partners.        
	On the flip side, sources said they were worried the infighting they saw in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and to an extent, Rajasthan, may cost them seriously in the general election unless Sonia Gandhi intervened right away.

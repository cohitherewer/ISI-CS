  - Top trade official accuses Centre of conspiracy to scupper global trade parleys        OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              Nath, Padilla				                                       
	June 10: A top US official has accused India of working behind the scenes to kill the Doha trade talks while reminding Delhi that the round was not a donors conference.        
	Under secretary of commerce for international trade Christopher A. Padilla told a seminar last evening that economic powers like India must shoulder more responsibility.        
	It is disappointing that India has been a roadblock to success in the Doha negotiations... the negotiations are not a donors conference. They require major economic powers like India to take responsible leadership, rather than working behind the scenes for Dohas demise.        
	Padilla told the seminar, organised by Washington think tank Heritage Foundation with Rising India as its theme, that India had resisted virtually all proposals, including those from developing countries, to free up trade. The allegation came with the warning that Indias stance could result in the failure of the Doha round.        
	Padillas remarks come days before commerce minister Kamal Nath meets US trade representative Susan Schwab and treasury secretary Henry Paulson in Washington.        
	Padilla said he hoped India would raise foreign investment limits in retail, insurance and financial services, moves likely to run into resistance from local firms.         
	In Delhi, the comments were seen as a thinly veiled attempt to pile pressure. Minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh iterated the Centres now-familiar stance that the interests of millions of subsistence farmers wouldnt be sacrificed to clinch a global trade accord.        
	Padilla also slammed Indias export bans on non-basmati rice and edible oils, saying the curbs had rattled the international market. They (the restrictions) take food off the global market, drive prices higher and discourage farmers from responding to market forces and investing in future production, he added.        
	Ramesh refuted the allegation that the export curbs had fuelled a surge in global food prices, saying India sold a very marginal amount of non-basmati rice overseas.        
	Before the March ban on non-basmati rice exports, India was exporting 4 million tonnes of rice a year, including 1 million tonnes of basmati. But after record production and for strategic reasons, some shipments were allowed to neighbouring countries. Limited exports to some West African nations are also being considered.        
	On edible oil, he said the country had to import to meet its own requirements and was forced to ban exports  of whatever little it produced  in March to contain prices.        
	The annual consumption of edible oil is around 11 million tonnes, of which nearly 6 million tonnes is imported.         
	Commerce ministry officials pointed a finger at the developed nations, saying the global food crisis had occurred because their farmland was being used for bio-diesel production instead of grain and edible oil cultivation.

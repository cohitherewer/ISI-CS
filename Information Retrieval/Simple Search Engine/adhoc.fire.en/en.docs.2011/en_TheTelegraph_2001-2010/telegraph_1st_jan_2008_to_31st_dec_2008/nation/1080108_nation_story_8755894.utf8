	Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 7 (AP): Malaysia has awarded a $1.08 billion railway contract to an Indian company, indicating a strengthening of bilateral ties during a visit by Indian defence minister A.K. Antony.
    
	Although the contract awarded to the Indian Railway Construction Co. is not related to defence, it is a reflection of the growing ties between the two countries in all fields, Antony said.
    
	This is a signal that they are encouraging Indian investment. That means all-round (cooperation) in defence, trade, commerce, education, health services, he said.
    
	The two sides said a 31-member Indian Air Force team would arrive in Malaysia next month to train pilots on Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 MKM fighter jets  a rare foreign project by the Indian armed forces.
    
	Antonys three-day trip to Malaysia, a month after he visited Vietnam, is part of Indian efforts to expand military ties with Southeast Asia  a region it long neglected when it was an ally of the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. India is particularly interested in wooing Malaysia, which has deep military links with Pakistan.
    
	The Indian Air Force team will be based in Malaysia for two years as part of an agreement signed last year. A batch of 55 Malaysian air force personnel began training in India on December 17, and 47 more will be sent in March, deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said.
    
	The rail contract puts to rest a major controversy that had soured relations between the countries. In 2001, Malaysia awarded a $3.5 billion double-tracking project to the same Indian company, but withdrew the contract two years later.
    
	Last year, Malaysia invited India to resubmit its bid for the project. Indian officials said the company was awarded the smaller contract last month to double-track 100km of rail line for 3.45 billion ringgit ($1.08 billion).
    
	It was officially announced by Najib, who said bilateral trade was expected to hit $8 billion this year. 
    
	In the area of business, the double-tracking railway project that we have awarded was most significant and it should be implemented this year, he said.
    
	He said the two countries were also exploring possible cooperation in the operation and maintenance of French-made Scorpene submarines but declined to say whether there would be joint exercises.
    
	Malaysia expects to receive two Scorpenes next year, while India has purchased six of the submarines which will be delivered in 2011, he said.
    
	Najib said they did not discuss the issue of ethnic Indians, who staged an unprecedented protest in November to complain of racial discrimination.

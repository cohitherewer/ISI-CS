The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi plays down China nuke shock
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Delhi plays down China nuke shock

	New Delhi, Sept. 1: An article in Chinas top newspaper today termed the Indo-US nuclear deal a major blow to the non-proliferation regime but Indian officials played the comment down.        
	Although the Peoples Daily article comes days before the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) gathers in Vienna to bless or sink the deal, sources here said Beijing was unlikely to oppose India at the September 4-5 meeting.        
	On the face of it, the Chinese comment should give India a new headache at a time it is bracing for a tough battle to secure a crucial waiver from the NSG.        
	But Indian officials cited two points. One, China hadnt created any problems for India at the earlier NSG meeting, where half-a-dozen countries raised objections. Two, the article in the Communist Party of Chinas official newspaper was an opinion piece by a researcher from a think tank.        
	An opinion cannot lead to China raising objections at this weeks meeting, when it hadnt done so at the August 21-22 conference, a source said.        
	The opinion is being noticed because of its timing. We have been seeking Chinas support for the waiver, and so far there has been nothing to suggest it will oppose the waiver, he added.        
	The article said: The US-India nuclear agreement has constituted a major blow to the international non-proliferation regime. Irrespective of the fate of the US-India nuclear agreement, the United States multiple standards on non-proliferation issues have met with a sceptical world.        
	Indian officials said the NSG sceptics reaction to a revised waiver draft, drawn up after the last meeting, had not been encouraging.         
	They said President George Bush and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice would use their influence among the unwilling NSG members and Delhi too would engage itself at a high level.

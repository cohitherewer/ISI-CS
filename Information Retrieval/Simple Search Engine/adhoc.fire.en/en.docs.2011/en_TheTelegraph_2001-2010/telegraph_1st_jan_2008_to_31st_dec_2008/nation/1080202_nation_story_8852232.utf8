	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 1: Uttar Pradesh police team today arrested one of the associates of don Brijesh Singh from the Airfield area.
    
	Pramod Khetri, Brijeshs business partner, is being interrogated about his background and how he met the UP don. The interrogation would continue tomorrow and more builders are likely to come under the police scanner.
    
	Brijesh, who was arrested by the New Delhi police a week ago, hails from Varanasi. The UP don took the name Arun Singh and made Bhubaneswar his home from 2003. 
    
	A two-member Special Task Force (STF) team of Uttar Pradesh police arrived here yesterday to zero in on the associates of Brijesh. This time their visit was more co-ordinated and the STF team met police commissioner Binay Kumar Behera and senior officers before beginning their investigation.
    
	Pavan Kumar, Brijeshs second partner in the real estate trade, is still absconding, though. 
    
	His firm, Bindhyanchal Real Estate Developers and Property Limited, has six completed apartments to its credit in the capital and several others are in different stages of completion. 
    
	Pavan, a native of Uttar Pradesh and Brijeshs relative, looked after Brijeshs businesses in Bhubaneswar. He became untraceable soon after Brijeshs arrest. 
    
	The Bhubaneswar police, it is learnt, has requested the UP police to assist them in their investigation. 
    
	Both the city police and STF team are likely to scan through bank transactions and investments made by Brijesh in Orissa. 
    
	The dons accounts have been frozen. During their routine search, the personnel found two accounts at ICICI Bank and Standard Chartered with Rs 13 lakh and Rs 1.7 lakh, respectively. 
    
	We have asked the banks to freeze all transactions and suspend his credit, debit and ATM cards, said Bishnu Mishra, the inspector in charge of Kharavela Nagar police station.

	Mumbai/Chennai, Aug. 10 (PTI): New Delhi is hoping for an unconditional and clean waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group to operationalise the India-US deal as an equal partner, a top official said today.         
	The US should enable the deal package in its current form to have a smooth passage at the August 21-22 NSG plenary meeting because India was not in a position to give in any more, M.R. Srinivasan, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, said.        
	After the IAEAs nod to the India-specific safeguards agreement, we are hopeful that the NSG will not be unreasonable in giving a clean and unconditional waiver to India in the coming weeks negotiations, he said.         
	However, with even a very small probability of them not accepting India as an equal partner in civil nuclear trade, we may walk out of the deal, Srinivasan said, adding, either the current package of the deal or no further giving in.        
	Speaking at a conference in Chennai on the need for the nuclear deal, he said: We dont think the NSG will be in the end unreasonable to let India move ahead.         
	By coming out of nuclear isolation, India can be part of a decision-making process on issues like a country acquiring nuclear technology in a clandestine manner or some terrorist and anti-national groups acquiring nuclear arms or weapons of mass destruction, Srinivasan said.

	Lucknow, June 27: Not knowing things suited Mulayam Singh Yadav at todays news conference.        
	For instance, he did not know if he might back the Centre on the nuclear deal if the Left withdrew support.        
	Again, he did not know that old friend Prakash Karat was in town.        
	The CPM general secretary had come to Lucknow to attend a condolence meeting for a former party state secretary but did not meet the Samajwadi Party chief.        
	Is he here today? Okay, I didnt know, Mulayam told reporters.        
	Nor did he know if Karat was on the fast track to becoming an ex-friend.        
	How can I take a stand on the nuclear deal when I dont know what is in it? Mulayam asked. I have asked for a copy of the draft. Let me find out what the deal is about.        
	He then turned towards old associate and former minister Revti Raman Singh, now MP from Allahabad, who wore an amused look.        
	Cant you sense the change in the atmosphere? Revti Raman later told The Telegraph. Yes, he (Mulayam) has definitely softened somewhat towards the Congress.        
	The Samajwadi chief wouldnt criticise the Centre, not even on the price rise, which he said was Mayavatis fault.        
	Prices are going up in Uttar Pradesh because of the exorbitant taxes imposed by the Mayavati government through VAT, he said.        
	Mulayam had no opinion on the performance of the Manmohan Singh government, which he had months ago labelled one of the worst in the country.        
	What is there to say about the Centre; see what is happening in this state. The state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh is worse now than it was during the Emergency.        
	Yesterday, at a programme to honour those who had fought the Emergency  which would normally be an occasion for Congress-bashing  Mulayam had deftly steered the rhetoric towards Mayavati.        
	Today, he had only one thing to say: he would go through the draft copy of the deal and place his views at the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) meeting on July 3.

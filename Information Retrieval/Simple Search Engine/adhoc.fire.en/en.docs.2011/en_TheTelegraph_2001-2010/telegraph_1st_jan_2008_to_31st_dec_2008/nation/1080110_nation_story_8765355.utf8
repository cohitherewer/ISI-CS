     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Jaipur, Jan. 9: Simultaneous allegations of sexual assaults on foreigners have surfaced in Rajasthan in the middle of the peak tourist season. 
    
	A British journalist has filed a complaint of rape against a guesthouse manager in Udaipur, while an American dance student has said she was molested at a Pushkar temple.
    
	Both Udaipur, 400 km from Jaipur, and Pushkar, 145 km away, figure high on the tourism circuit.
    
	According to police, the 40-year-old tourist based in London registered the rape complaint formally today. The journalist said she was raped by Parvat Singh alias Rana, 32, the manager of Pardesi Rest House in Ambamata area of the Lake City on December 23. 
    
	She had been staying in the guesthouse from December 19. According to the complaint, Parvat Singh entered her room on the pretext of giving her a blanket and raped her.
    
	Having fallen ill after the assault, she was admitted to hospital. She eventually contacted one of her friends, who was also in Udaipur then. The journalist also sent an email to the British high commission.
    
	Bhagwat Singh Hinger, Ambamata police station incharge, said a medical examination had confirmed rape. The accused has been arrested.
    
	The American, who hails from Oregon, was allegedly molested by a relative of a temple priest. She had reached Pushkar on Saturday for Kathak lessons.
    
	According to her complaint, she was molested yesterday at the Paab Mokshni temple on a hilltop when she went for darshan. 
    
	Police officer Sangram Singh said a case under Section 354 of IPC (outraging modesty) had been registered against the temple priests brother-in-law, Satyanarayan. 
    
	 The accused allegedly took her inside the temple premises and molested her. The police have taken Satyanarayan into custody and claimed that he had confessed.
    
	Singh said the woman, 38, has decided to stay on in Pushkar for a month to complete the training in Kathak.
    
	State tourism minister Usha Punia said she was worried by the increasing attacks on women guests. Such cases definitely do not augur well for Rajasthan, more so in the peak tourist season. The government has issued guidelines for foreign tourists, asking them to be careful and avoid shady places. We have also stationed tour assistants in cities where tourist traffic is high.
    
	The temple town has witnessed two similar cases in the recent past. In May 2007, a German woman had alleged sexual assault by the driver and conductor of a bus.
    
	In April 2006, a Japanese woman had said she was drugged, raped and robbed by the son of a hotel manager.

          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 30: The foreign ministry will soon start outsourcing secretarial assistance jobs on a contract basis to fill up over 200 posts that have been lying vacant for a while.        
	Sources said the ministry had put out tender notices earlier this month inviting head-hunters to supply around 100 stenographers who are graduates, fluent in English and polite, cordial, positive and efficient.        
	The manpower agencies  the ministry term for head-hunters  have also been mandated to ensure that persons supplied should not have any criminal cases against them.        
	The sources said this was one of several measures the ministry was taking to ensure the recruits behave (properly) in the sensitive department and do not pose a security risk.        
	The agencies have been given a list of dos and donts to follow while shortlisting candidates. Some of them are:        
	One, they will have to make adequate enquiries about the character and antecedents of the persons they are recommending        
	Two, a candidate can be classified as suitable and from a proper background only after investigations by the local police. Proofs of identity have to be collected, including driving licence, bank account details, work experience, proof of residence and a photograph;        
	Three, the agencies will have to immediately replace a candidate if he/she is found unacceptable because of security risk, incompetence, conflict of interest and breach of confidentiality or improper conduct upon receiving written notice from office        
	Four, the agencies will have to take care of candidates conveyance expenses and make it clear to them that there will be no master-servant relationship between them and the ministry. After the contract expires, the employee will have to quit without claiming any absorption        
	Five, the agency will have to furnish a Rs 1-lakh security deposit that will be forfeited in case the supply of manpower is delayed beyond the stipulated period.        
	The sources said the exercise was being undertaken because work was being hampered by the shortage of hands in the ministry, with regional passport offices being one of the worst hit sections.        
	Last year, junior foreign minister E. Ahamed had told Parliament that there were at least 294 vacancies in various passport offices.        
	Ministry data show that the number of passports issued by the Central Passport Organisation went up from 22.2 lakhs in 1997 to 49.4 lakhs in 2007, an increase of 123 per cent. But the percentage growth in staff strength in the same period is 25.41 per cent.

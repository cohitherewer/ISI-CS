          FARHANA KALAM                              
	Gaya, Sept. 26: The Magadh University Teachers Association has demanded immediate removal of vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey.         
	At a representation addressed to the governor and chancellor, the associations president, Thakur Amrindra Singh, has said that Pandeys continuation in office was not in the interest of the university as he had come under cloud on account of serious allegations involving personal conduct as well as official functioning.        
	Jan Jagran Manch, an NGO, released a list of 20 charges against Pandey and the charges include those relating to moral turpitude.         
	The Jagran Manch chargesheet has named several women who had allegedly been sexually exploited on the promise job in the university.         
	The other charges include alleged bungling in the appointment of grade III and grade IV staff (the appointments were subsequently cancelled) and withdrawal of more than Rs 20 lakh as advance travelling allowance by Pandey, registration of the official car purchased from the university fund in the vice-chancellors personal name, alleged misuse of the universitys Patna guesthouse for fun-making among others.         
	No rebuttal of the charges with documentary support was made by Pandey, thereby increasing the credibility of the allegations.

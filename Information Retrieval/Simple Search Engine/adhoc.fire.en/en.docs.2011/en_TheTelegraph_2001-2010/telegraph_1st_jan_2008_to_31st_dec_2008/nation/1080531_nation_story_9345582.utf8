          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 30: Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani had an unusual guest at his Hyderpora residence  Kashmir police chief Shiv Murari Sahai.         
	Sahai, along with SSP, Budgam, Ashiq Bukhari, came calling at 3pm yesterday and chatted with the separatist leader for about 15 minutes.         
	It is rare that a senior government official visits the residence of a separatist leader in the militancy-torn state. If one does, it is always kept under wraps.         
	IGP Sahai, too, denied going to Geelanis residence. Nothing like this has happened, he said. But Bukhari confirmed that he was accompanying Sahai, though he refused to divulge what transpired during the chat. Ask the IG about the details, he said.         
	Geelani also confirmed that Sahai and Bukhari met him yesterday.         
	They came at 3pm and we talked for about15 minutes. The IGP said there was no agenda for the meeting and that he was on a personal visit, the chief of the Hurriyats hardline faction said.         
	Since the meeting lasted for only 15 minutes, there was not enough time to talk about issues. But I told him we are suppressed people and later I gave him a copy of an English translation of the Holy Quran and other literature.        
	According to Hurriyat sources, the literature comprised books by Geelani on the separatist struggle.        
	Hurriyat spokesman Ayaz Akbar said Geelani took both the officers to his drawing room and they were offered juice and tea. The IGP was in civvies while Bukhari sahab was in police uniform, Akbar said.

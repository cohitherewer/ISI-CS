The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi for setu dredge 
                                                                                                               Delhi for setu dredge 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The Centre will ask the Supreme Court to vacate the stay on the Sethusamudram project, which seeks to carve a shipping channel between India and Sri Lanka.        
	The cabinet committee on political affairs has approved a new affidavit that looks to mollify opponents of the project, which involves dredging an islet chain that many revere as a bridge built by Rams monkey army.        
	Delhi had sat on the affidavit for months because of differences between the two nodal ministries  shipping, and culture and tourism  and confusion in the Congress on its content and wording.        
	The government had hurriedly withdrawn its first affidavit after it appeared to question Rams historical existence. It had stated that the Ram setu was not a man-made structure but a natural formation of shoals, and that Valmikis Ramayan and Tulsidass Ramcharitmanas were mythological texts that could not be relied upon.        
	The new affidavit says that while there is no scientific evidence that the setu is man-made, the Archaeological Survey of India does not have the expertise to support or contradict this conclusion.        
	Sources said the new affidavit did a balancing act. The government, they argued, could not afford to annoy the DMK, a key ally that has touted the project as beneficial to Tamil Nadu.        
	Although the Centre was prepared to consider an alternative alignment that would not affect the islet chain, it is now expected to tell the court, under pressure from the DMK, that the project should continue on its originally approved route. The government will ask that the petitions challenging the project be dismissed.        
	Shipping minister T.R. Baalu of the DMK has publicly said that 60 per cent of the dredging has already been done.        
	The government had got cold feet after the BJP used the original affidavit to raise the issue of Hindu sentiments. Culture and tourism minister Ambika Soni, backed by home minister Shivraj Patil and defence minister A.K. Antony, felt the government should tread cautiously on issues of religious sentiment.        
	Other senior ministers, particularly Arjun Singh, argued that the Congress had survived such emotive crises before.

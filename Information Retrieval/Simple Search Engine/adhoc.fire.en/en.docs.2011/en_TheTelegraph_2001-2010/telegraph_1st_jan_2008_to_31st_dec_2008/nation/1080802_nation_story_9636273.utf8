                              Bipasha                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 1 (PTI): Bipasha Basu today rued the trend of making actresses in their late 20s feel old.        
	I agree that Bollywood is a male-centric industry. But I expect the media to be intelligent. If heroes who are over 40 are paired opposite much younger heroines, it is not talked about, Bipasha told reporters here        
	But if I am romantically paired against heroes two to three years younger than me, a big issue is made out of it. It is really unfortunate, she said responding to questions on being cast opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Bachna Aae Haseeno and Neil Nitin Mukesh in Freeze.        
	The actress said she had a western persona attached to her image because of her modelling background. But I think I am adaptable because I have a very Indian face, she added.        
	Asked about her co-stars in Bachna, newcomers Ranbir and Deepika Padukone, Bipasha said they had been groomed well before facing the camera.        
	Ranbir has even worked as an assistant director. Compared with them, I have learnt everything while on the job, she added.

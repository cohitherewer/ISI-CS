          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 7: Forensic experts have told the CBI that Aarushi Talwars throat was probably slit with a knife than with a surgical instrument like a scalpel.        
	After examining the post-mortem reports of the 15-year-old and the Talwars domestic help Hemraj, the forensic experts from AIIMS and Central Forensic Science Laboratory said a scalpel was too small to cause such deep wounds.         
	Especially in the case of Aarushi, the wounds in the upper neck region were very deep. In all probability, a sharp-edged knife was used. A scalpel would have caused different kinds of injuries as it cuts the skin layer by layer, a source said, citing the opinion given by the forensic experts who are assisting the CBI.         
	Police had suspected that a surgical instrument was used as the murder weapon.        
	The post-mortem reports also clearly indicated that Aarushi had first been hit with a heavy object on the head and then her was throat slit. It was the head injury that caused her death.         
	The forensic experts have examined the clothes Aarushi was wearing when she was murdered. They could provide vital clues, sources said.         
	The CBI court has postponed the bail hearing for Rajesh Talwar, the girls father and key accused in the double murder, to June 10.         
	Talwar is in judicial custody now. The application for his bail came up today in the court but was pushed back as the judge was not present.

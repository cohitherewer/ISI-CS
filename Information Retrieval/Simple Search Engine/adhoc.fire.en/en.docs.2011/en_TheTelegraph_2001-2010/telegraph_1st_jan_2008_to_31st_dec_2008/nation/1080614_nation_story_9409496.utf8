                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     DMK divorce hint at wedding
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, June 13: M. Karunanidhi today chose a wedding to set the stage for a split with ally PMK, which is said to be preparing to use another wedding to warm up to his rival Jayalalithaa.        
	The DMK chief said he would take a decision whether to continue our alliance with the PMK or not in the next four to five days. The PMK, led by S. Ramadoss, is also part of the ruling United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.         
	At the wedding of an employee of DMK mouthpiece Murasoli, party treasurer Arcot Veerasamy produced a VCD of a PMK leaders speech in which he allegedly threatened to behead senior DMK leaders.         
	Veerasamy offered to play the speech of PMK functionary and OBC Vanniyar Sangam chief Kaduvetti Guru and asked: How long should we continue the relationship with such a party (PMK)?        
	Karunanidhi promised that the DMKs policy-making body would meet soon in Chennai to take a decision, after the partys womens wing two-day conference in Cuddalore that begins tomorrow. His daughter Kanimozhi, a Rajya Sabha MP, is to be projected as the DMKs next generation woman leader at the meet.         
	The DMK patriarch said the party would not be cowed down by such death threats and added that it was even more disturbing that the PMK leadership was going to any lengths to heap baseless charges on his government.         
	Ramadoss had yesterday iterated the charge that his phones were being tapped by the state police when telephone tapping involves complicated procedures and approvals at various levels, including from the Centre, Karunanidhi said.         
	The PMK has been bitterly critical of its senior partner for several months now. It has opposed the ruling partys plans to build a satellite city off Chennai and does not want farmland to be acquired for the purpose. Sand mining and the PMKs pet demand for total prohibition are other issues on which there is friction.         
	Now, there are reports that the PMK is planning to revive ties with Jayalalithaas ADMK. The Opposition leader is expected to be invited to a wedding where Ramadoss will be present. PMK legislature party leader G.K. Mani is due to call on Jayalalithaa, who is away at her Kodanad tea estate in the Nilgiris, to invite her.         
	This appears to have been the last straw for the DMK, promoting Karunanidhis announcement today.        
	Mani was not available for comment.        
	Should the first step in the political realignment materialise, it is learnt that the ADMK is contemplating a grand alliance for the next general election, similar to the one it had forged in 1998, including the BJP, PMK, MDMK, and perhaps the DMDK launched by filmstar-turned-politician Vijayakant to counter the formidable DMK-Congress-Left combine.

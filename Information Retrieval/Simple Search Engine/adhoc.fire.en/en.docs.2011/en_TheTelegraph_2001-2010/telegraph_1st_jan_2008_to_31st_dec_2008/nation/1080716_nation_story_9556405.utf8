          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 15: Boxed into a corner, the CPM has responded the way it has been brought up: wield the rod and straighten out the flock that strays.        
	The partys central leadership has asked the Bengal unit to take up Subhas Chakrabortys outburst against voting with the BJP and his defence of Somnath Chatterjees reluctance to quit as Speaker.        
	The Bengal sports minister could be censured in an apparent signal to other sources of defiance, such as Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and those who are celebrating the discomfiture of the central leadership.        
	But acting state secretary Benoy Konar, standing in for Biman Bose who is abroad, suggested that Prakash Karat would face many questions  from the Lefts pullout to voting with the BJP in the July 22 trust vote  during the central committee meeting in Delhi on July 19-20.        
	If the politburo has taken any wrong decision, the next central committee meeting will amend it and take a final position. Thats the way our party functions, Konar said, hinting that Bengal comrades would raise questions.        
	Konar, a central committee member, appeared to defend Chakrabortys right to express differences but said it shouldnt have been done in public. The central committee has asked us to discuss Subhass public speak on the party line and we will do it in the next secretariat (meeting).         
	Being a secretariat member, Subhas has the right to write to the general secretary and express his differences. But he went wrong by saying it outside the party, he added.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is also learnt to have raised the issue with Jyoti Basu.        
	Konar pointed out that the Chakraborty hadnt voiced his reservations when the state CPM unit met last week. Subhas didnt air his dissent at the last secretariat meeting on July 11, when we discussed the Left pullout.        
	Chakraborty, though, stuck to his guns even after being told of the top brass unhappiness, asserting that he would tell the party that he stood by his words.         
	Konar defended the pullout and the voting decision but left scope for speculation about differences of opinion when he said the central committee would have a threadbare discussion since the turn of the events was unexpected for the party.         
	He said the Left couldnt let the government survive to pursue a nuke deal that we are opposing as a sellout to America.         
	But soon after, he seemed to suggest that a lot hadnt been anticipated. The last central committee meeting didnt decide on withdrawal of support and a post-pullout scenario since we never expected this kind of betrayal by the Congress. We were sure we would be able to stop the nuke deal or amend clauses detrimental to Indian interests.

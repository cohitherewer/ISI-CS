          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Tata pullout will force companies to demand a review of the land acquisition policy and reassurances their investments dont end up like the Singur fiasco, chambers and industrialists said today.        
	The concerns over politically-inspired land logjams lay at the heart of India Incs refrain that Tata Motors decision to shift the Nano plant out of Singur would sully the image of Bengal and India as an investment destination.         
	Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra rued the project could have brought about a major change in the industrial scenario of Bengal, saying it wasnt a one-off venture but one that could have brought to the state a host of ancillaries, creating jobs and new opportunities. The Nano plan had marked a turnaround from the years when Bengals engineering and heavy industry had stopped getting fresh investments and closed, he said.        
	Most industrialists and chambers agreed that the lack of a political consensus on the Nano project would have a wider impact by hitting Bengals overall industrial recovery.        
	Ashok Leyland managing director R. Seshasayee felt it (the pullout from Bengal) is a sad day for industry and makes a comment on the state of politics of our country. We will be depicted as a nation which is very wobbly on its feet. Needless to say, investments into the country will be affected, said Seshasayee, whose firm competes with Tata Morors in the market for heavy vehicles.        
	The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said the Tatas were compelled to pull out because of the lack of political consensus. The Tatas have been very patient and this decision has come as a compulsion after the political dialogues failed to yield a consensus.        
	CII officials said most industry bodies understood the Tatas compulsions and would back the group on its stand.        
	Support for the pullout also came from the Singur vendors, who would be hardest hit by the decision but have decided to bear the losses and move out with Tata Motors.        
	We stand committed in accompanying the Tatas for the Nano project, no matter which destination they decide on. We have been supplying components to them for the last 20 years. It is a very unfortunate development, but as a company one has to always take some entrepreneurial risk, said D.M Reddy, CEO of Subros Limited, which is supplying air-conditioners for the Nano.        
	Some vendors were even considering asking the Bengal government for compensation for their losses. Their investments have ranged from Rs 1 crore to Rs 20 crore.        
	With the withdrawal of the project, Bengal will not only lose the mother (Nano) plant but also 56 ancillary units that could have created thousands of jobs.

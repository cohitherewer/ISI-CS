	Chennai, May 6: A 600-metre wall erected by upper castes to segregate Dalits in a Madurai village was partly pulled down today on the eve of CPM chief Prakash Karats visit.        
	The CPM had publicised Karats May 7 visit to Utthapuram, 450km from Chennai, and threatened to mobilise public support to demolish the 10-foot-high wall if the state government did nothing.        
	District authorities today made a 15-metre breach in the wall as a compromise, saying the Dalits could now pass through it. The Dalits had been complaining for at least 10 years that the wall, apart from being a humiliation, forced them to make a long detour to the bus stand.        
	But the government was cautious not to offend the upper castes, who had yesterday threatened to leave the village if the wall was pulled down.        
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi told the Assembly the government had accepted the Dalits demand for a path without jeopardising the upper castes security.        
	Utthapurams upper castes claim the wall stands on private land, and was built only to prevent a repeat of the 1989 caste clashes that had killed seven persons, both Dalits and upper caste members, in the village. There are no records to show exactly when the wall was erected, though.        
	Members of the upper castes had yesterday met district collector Jawahar and threatened to relinquish their ration cards and revenue documents  a proof of residence  in protest if the wall was pulled down.        
	They argued that large portions of the wall formed the rear boundary of their homes, an official said over the phone from Madurai.        
	But with a lot of preparation going into Karats visit, Karunanidhi could neither sit idle nor ignore the possibility of old caste tensions being inflamed across the states sensitive southern districts. He spoke to the collector yesterday and is understood to have suggested the compromise solution.

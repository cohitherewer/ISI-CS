          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Batla House just after the Jamianagar encounter                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The fight against terror was an issue in a corner of Delhi after all. The Congress won the capital but lost in Jamianagar.        
	The warren-like locality, where police stormed a house and killed two young Muslim men in an alleged fake encounter three months ago, is still burning with anger at the government.        
	Sitting MLA and former transport minister Parvez Hashmi trailed Asif Mohammed Khan of the Rashtriya Janata Dal by 4,500 votes in the 10 booths in Jamianagar, a locality near the Jamia Millia Islamia university.        
	Hashmi scraped through by just 541 votes from the seat, Okhla, making up in the constituencys remaining six booths where residents from large slum clusters voted.        
	Before the polls, leading Muslim bodies, including the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, had called for alternative candidates to Hashmi.         
	Congress leaders in Delhi had privately expressed fears that Muslims perceptions about the encounter and its aftermath may hurt the party, not just in the constituency but across the national capital.        
	Many of the questions relating to the police version of the encounter remain unanswered. In the past three months, the locality has seen frequent police raids that have only alienated the residents further.        
	On September 19, six days after five blasts had killed 25 people in Delhi, Jamianagar had watched in horror as the police, in what the force claimed was a gunfight, shot dead two men in Batla House.        
	A Delhi police hero, Mohan Chand Sharma, died of multiple bullet injuries in the incident.        
	The police arrested a third youth from the house. One of the two dead men and the arrested youth were students of Jamia.        
	Residents almost immediately questioned the police version of the encounter  which appeared to have many holes  alleging the youths were killed in cold blood. Teachers and students at the university, too, joined in.        
	As opposition to the police action within Jamia Millia Islamia gathered steam, vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan announced the university would legally aid the arrested boy.         
	Many politicians, including Hashmi and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, demanded a judicial probe into the encounter, but it was rejected by the Congress leadership and the Centre.        
	Hashmi could indeed have lost Okhla had the CPI and the CPM  which had called for a non-Congress, non-BJP government  backed the RJDs Khan. The Congress candidate won less than 29 per cent of the votes, among the lowest for the winners in Delhi.        
	Following Khan, who mustered 28 per cent of the votes, were the Bahujan Samaj Party, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party. Two Independents  Chander Pal and Santosh Kumar mustered thin but significant slices of the vote.        
	Kumar, a software professional, earned popularity by offering voters a unique promise  a signed affidavit stating he would resign at any point during his tenure as a lawmaker if the voters so wished.        
	The Left twins, allies in each state that the communists have held, battled each other. Yet, together they managed to cross just a thousand votes that, if transferred to the RJD, could have helped Khan win.         
	The CPMs Raza Haidar won 525 votes and the CPIs Amiruddin 477.

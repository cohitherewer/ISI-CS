     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The CPI today said it would continue to support secular-democratic forces to prevent the BJP from coming to power at the Centre.
    
	The stand toes the CPM line that the BJP was a greater enemy than the Congress and must be kept out of power at any cost.
    
	The CPI has, however, attached less importance than its partner to efforts to form a third front. The country will be facing another general election soon. Efforts have to be made by all secular forces to defeat the BJP and its allies, who think they can make a bid for power. This is politically necessary, said the draft political resolution for the 20th CPI congress released today.
    
	But what shape this effort will take in each state depends on the correlation of forces in that state. The CPI and the CPM have to play a role in bringing this about. 
    
	The stand of the Left twins, despite serious differences with the government over the US nuclear deal and economic issues, must have delighted the Congress and dismayed third-front players.
    
	The CPI made a passing reference to the proposed front. Some parties are trying to forge a third front opposed to both the Congress and the BJP. They have announced the formation of the UNPA. The party will interact with them so that they join the common struggle for evolving a programme-based alternative, it said.

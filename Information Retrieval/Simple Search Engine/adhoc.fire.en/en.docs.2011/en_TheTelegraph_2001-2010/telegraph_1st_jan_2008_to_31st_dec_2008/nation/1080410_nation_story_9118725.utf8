                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mulayam to do a Rahul
  - Congress MPs visits to Dalit homes rattle CM, set rival an example to follow					 					      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    (From top) Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI); Mayavati and Mulayam Singh				                                       
	Lucknow, April 9: Thanks to Rahul Gandhi, Dalit homes have become the hottest travel destination for politicians in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today announced that he would visit Dalit homes from April 23, accompanied by party colleagues.         
	I dare her (Mayavati) to call me names as many times as she can. Let her say that I also go for a purification ritual. I will start visiting Dalit villages and Dalit homes from April 23. Along with me will go my party leaders, the Samajwadi Party chief told reporters in Hardoi, 80km from here.         
	Rattled by Rahuls attempts to woo Dalits  the support base for her party, the BSP  chief minister Mayavati had alleged on Monday that the Congress MP bathes with a special soap and undergoes a purification ritual using incense after visiting their homes. Rahul had spent a night in a Dalit home in his constituency, Amethi, in January.         
	Mulayam today said: If Rahul Gandhi visits Dalit homes, why should that irritate Mayavati? Is it a crime to do so?         
	Not too long ago, the Samajwadi leader had dismissed Rahul as a kid in politics. Now, he seems to be taking a leaf out of the young politicians book to tackle old foe Mayavati. His frequent barbs at Mayavati had failed to get her attention in the way Rahul has.         
	Mulayam today said his party has its share of Dalit leaders, too, and my party has been doing a lot for the Dalits in the state.         
	A secretary of the Samajwadi Party said: We will start preparing for our visits to Dalit homes after April 12 when the bypolls are over.         
	Mulayam is taking a cue from Rahul not only on wooing Dalits, but also the youth. Finding that Rahuls rallies are drawing in a large number of youths, Mulayam has decided to field son Akhilesh to bat for the Samajwadis.        
	The Congress MP found support even from the BJP on Mayavatis outburst against him. Ye sab betuki batein hain (all this is baseless). How does Mayavati know that Rahul is bathed with special soaps (after visiting Dalits)? Has she seen this? BJP president Rajnath Singh asked.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Plunging into the problem                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 9: Decks were cleared for the construction of two barrages on the upstream of the Mahendratanaya with a technical advisory committee of the Orissa water resources department giving its stamp of approval.         
	The two barrages would be constructed at Champapur and Dampur on the upstream of the river Mahendratanaya in Gajapati district.        
	Engineer in chief of water resources department Harish Behera, who chaired the committee meeting yesterday, said the panel had examined all aspects of the proposed barrages, including the hydrological position and its likely impact on environment, before arriving at the conclusion.         
	The recommendation of the technical committee would be placed before the state government for administrative approval before taking up the project work, said Behera.         
	The engineer in chief explained that the state would not have to seek further permission from the Central Water Commission, as a previous Orissa government request for the construction of a dam and reservoir across the Mahendratanaya had been cleared by the commission in 2002. The constructions across Mahendratanaya would be complete within a year, he added.         
	The committees decision was a follow-up action to the announcement made by the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, a few days ago. The move is being seen as an eye-for-an-eye measure after the Andhra Pradesh government laid the foundation stone for an off-shore irrigation project on the downstream of the same river at Regalupadu in Srikakulum district.        
	The move was announced by the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Y. Rajasekhar Reddy, ignoring Orissas protest against the construction that is likely to affect the latters water supply in some districts.         
	Official source said the state government has already sought financial assistance from Nabard for the construction of the barrages at an estimated cost of Rs 38 crore.

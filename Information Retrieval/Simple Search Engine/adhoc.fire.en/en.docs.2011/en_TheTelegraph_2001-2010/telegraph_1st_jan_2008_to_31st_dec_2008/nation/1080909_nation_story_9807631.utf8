	Darjeeling, Sept. 8: Czech entomologist Petr Svacha and his associate Emil Kucera were pronounced guilty of illegally collecting insects and larvae in a national park in Darjeeling, but were granted interim bail today.        
	They would be sentenced on Wednesday.        
	Svacha, 51, and Kucera, 52, were arrested from a lodge at Srikhola, about 90km from Darjeeling, on June 22. The forest rangers team that arrested them found the insects, illegally collected from the Singalila National Park.         
	Chief judicial magistrate U.K. Nandi said the charge against the two had been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.         
	They have been charged under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

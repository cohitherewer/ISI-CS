                                                                                                               SA honour for Krishna Menon
          M.R. VENKATESH                              
	Johannesburg, April 1: South Africa has decided to confer one of its highest civilian awards on the late V.K. Krishna Menon, Indias former defence minister, reinforcing generations of good bilateral relations.        
	He joins former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the list of Indians given the Companion of .R. Tambo Award, instituted in memory of the founder-president of the African National Congress.        
	Menon, who was part of Jawaharlal Nehrus cabinet, is being honoured for his sustained support to the anti-apartheid cause and contribution to the liberation of South Africa since the 1930s.        
	Essop Pahad, a senior minister in the Thabo Mbeki government, told visiting Indian journalists today that Menons family members would be invited to receive the award in the third week of April.         
	Pahad acknowledged Menons deep involvement in building a long-standing relationship between Congress movements in India and South Africa since the days of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.        
	Despite losing his position in the Nehru cabinet, Menon remained an anti-colonial freedom fighter in his own right and continued to express solidarity with South Africas fight against apartheid, Pahad said.

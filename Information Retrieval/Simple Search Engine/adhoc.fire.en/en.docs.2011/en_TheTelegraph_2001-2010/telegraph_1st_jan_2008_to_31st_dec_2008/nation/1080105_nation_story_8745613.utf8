The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen cloud on dads dream
                                                                                                            Naveen cloud on dads dream
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Naveen Patnaik                                  
	Rourkela, Jan. 4: Biju Patnaiks dream project  turning the steel city of Rourkela into Orissas industrial hub could well have soured before taking off.        
	His son Naveen, who inherited Biju Babus political mantle and is now the chief minister, almost didnt make it for an event to mark the cash infusion of Rs 9,000 crore to more than double the citys steelmaking capacity to 4.5 million tonnes and add some 10,000 fresh jobs.        
	The cash injection is expected to catalyse investments of several thousand crores in privately owned ancilliaries and processing plants that are expected to create another 10,000 jobs.        
	Throwing the administration into a tizzy, Naveen accepted Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswans invitation to join the celebrations at the eleventh hour.        
	Naveens frosty reception to the invitation was viewed with trepidation, with many in Delhi fearing the chief minister would cold shoulder their overtures. Naveen is involved in a spat with the Centre over royalty rates paid to his states treasury for iron ore as well as over re-allocation of idle mines lying with the Centre-owned National Mineral Development Corporation.        
	Naveen has also stonewalled pleas by SAIL, which owns Rourkela Steel, to renew leases for three mines  Bersuah, Taldih and Kalta  which supply ore to the steel plant.        
	Naveens posturing had, in effect, placed a question mark on the future of the dream steel plant. He hasnt yet agreed to award a new mining area at Thakurani, which SAIL says is essential to its plans to raise Rourkelas steelmaking capacity in the years ahead.        
	But there is something that draws all Oriya matiro monuso (sons of the soil). Biju Patnaiks Doon School-educated son, whose first words in Rourkela were a mispronounced Biju Patnaiks swapnar thila Rourkela , too perhaps couldnt resist the emotional appeal that his fathers pet project has for the state.        
	Biju Patnaik had indeed lobbied hard with Jawaharlal Nehru to get the the Centre to agree to set up the giant steel plant in the tribal district of Sundergarh in Orissa and not in the rival states of Bengal and Bihar.        
	His success in getting Delhi to set up the plant at Rourkela, a small protected vale surrounded by hills on three sides, in 1959, helped Biju Patnaik become hief minister of the mineral-rich but extremely poor state in 1961.        
	Naveen is also trying to go down in Orissas history as a chief minister who brought in investments and created new jobs.         
	Besides SAILs Rourkella, he has managed to attract Korean steel major Posco, ArcelorMittal and the Tatas among others to sign pacts to set up steel projects in his state. Orissa is believed to have resources sufficient to feed a steel making capacity of 60 million tonnes, more than the countrys total steel production as on date.        
	Although the chief minister is facing opposition from tribal rights groups and political opponents, Neveens aides say he will win and end up turning Orissa into an industrial hub that could well overtake Bengal in the decades ahead.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Gowda
                 
	Bangalore, Jan. 10: A 22-year-old committed suicide after his car bumped into H.D. Deve Gowdas SUV yesterday, but the former Prime Minister appeared unmoved. 
    
	Accidents happen. Dont make it a big issue. Our leader is not responsible for it, Janata Dal (S) workers said. I dont want to speak about this issue, Gowda sent word.
    
	N. Ramesh, a commerce graduate who manufactured hollow cement bricks, was driving the Maruti 800 he had bought a year ago when it hit the blue Chevrolet Forester ferrying Gowda to one of his familys numerous houses in Padmanabha Nagar around 11am. The bumper of the SUV was dislodged.
    
	The former Prime Ministers securitymen jumped out to upbraid Ramesh, and let him go after Gowda intervened. Its a minor accident, let the boy go, witnesses quoted him as saying. 
    
	But around 3pm, some 20 Dal (S) workers and the SUV driver arrived at Rameshs house in the same locality and allegedly demanded Rs 25,000 to make good the damage. The scared family members paid them Rs 10,000. 
    
	Ramesh was chided by his family for getting embroiled with a political heavyweight. The youth, who had never been booked by traffic police, locked himself in his room. His sister-in-law found him hanging from the fan around 5.30pm. 
    
	Police have registered a case of unnatural death and none for abetment of suicide. No one has complained in this case. I can only confirm there was a minor traffic accident earlier and the boy committed suicide later, DCP (south) Alok Kumar said.
    
	The family has refused to accept Rs 1 lakh offered as compensation by Dal (S) workers last night. 
    
	We declined the compensation offered by some political workers as any amount of money will not bring my dead brother back. We did not register a police complaint as we do not want trouble with politicians, his brother Harish said after the funeral.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The BJP today said it would press ahead with its three-day Amarnath agitation to dispel the false impression that the land taken back from the cave shrines board would have been used to alter Kashmirs demography.        
	The decision came on a day L.K. Advani called the Prime Minister to say the time had come for direct talks with the protesters.         
	But sources claimed Manmohan Singh has made it clear the governor, as his representative, would hold the talks.         
	Home minister Shivraj Patil will lead a multi-party team to Srinagar and Jammu for a first-hand feel of the situation. Sources close to Advani said the BJP would also send a delegate.        
	A meeting of the BJPs core committee at Advanis residence decided the party would start a crowd-the-jails agitation from August 11 throughout the country to tell people that a false impression was created by (Kashmir) separatists that the land would have been used for permanent settlement.        
	Instead of negating this communal propaganda, the Congress government buckled under this unjustified pressure and revoked the land allotment, party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said.         
	Sources claimed the BJP wished to keep the peaceful agitation low-key and, left to itself, wouldnt have started it but for the RSS, which said: A lot of blood has already flowed and there is no point looking back.

 Stay away

               Bal Thackeray
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 23 (PTI): Bal Thackeray today said only the Shiv Sena pattern would work in Maharashtra, hinting that Narendra Modis incursions into the state were not welcome. 
    
	Maharashtra will not accept anybody. States have been divided on a linguistic basis. Modi has got Gujarat. Mayavati has got Uttar Pradesh. Leave Maharashtra to us. In Maharashtra, only the Shiv Sena pattern will work, the Sena boss told reporters at his residence.
    
	Thackeray, who turned 82 today, made light of the BJPs efforts to project Modi in Maharashtra. The Gujarat chief minister was in Mumbai last Sunday for a rally in which NDA ally Sena was not involved.
    
	The BJP, however, denied that the partys relations with the Sena had hit a rough patch. Gopinath Munde said his party was fully with the Sena and they would jointly fight the next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.
    
	In an interview to Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Thackeray had said the Godhra killings and the Gujarat riots that followed had been beneficial for Modi.
    
	Godhra certainly helped (Modi). He cannot forget Godhra. Godhra victims and Gujarat riots were useful to him, the Sena chief had said.
    
	Gujaratis began to think Modi is their support. Muslims are terrified (of him). This is his formula in politics.
    
	Thackeray today cautioned against a likely civil war in the country. There can be a big uprising by Muslims. Are Hindus ready? he asked, adding that it couldnt be said how a person would behave if power went to his head.

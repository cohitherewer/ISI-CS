          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 26: A cautious Samajwadi Party is working on its public stand and what action to take against the BJP while waiting for a notice from the Speaker on the bribery allegations on the day of the Parliament trust vote.         
	BJP members Ashok Argal, Mahavir Bhagora and Faggan Singh Kulaste had on July 22 flashed wads of currency notes in the Lok Sabha and alleged that they had been offered the money as bribe to stay away from the vote.        
	They claimed that a Samajwadi leader had given them the money and the alleged meeting had been recorded on camera.        
	Initially shaken, Samajwadi leaders now appear better placed to respond to the challenge following several meetings among themselves and with Congress leaders.        
	If they have recorded the sting, let them show it, said a Samajwadi leader, who requested anonymity till the party received a notice from the Speakers office. We will react on record when the time comes. Let the Speaker send us the notice.        
	Sources said the Speaker would serve a notice early next week.         
	The BJP has accused Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh and Allahabad MP Rewati Raman Singh of being involved in the alleged bribery attempt. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said it was through Amar that his party members got in touch with Ahmed Patel, the political adviser to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.         
	The Samajwadis have since denied the allegation and maintains that no party member was involved.         
	Samajwadi leaders say the BJP has brought disgrace to the House through the drama and feels that a united voice from within the party can counter the malicious propaganda.

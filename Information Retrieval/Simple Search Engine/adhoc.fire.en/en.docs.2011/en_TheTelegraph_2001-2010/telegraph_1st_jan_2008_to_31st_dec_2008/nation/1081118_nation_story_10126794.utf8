          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 17: A team of ministers headed by Sharad Pawar today held talks with Naveen Patnaik on the situation in Kandhamal and measures taken to give confidence to and rehabilitate riot-hit people.        
	Orissa chief minister Patnaik told the team there had been no violence in Kandhamal in the past month and over 15,000 riot victims staying in relief camps had returned home.        
	He said the state was taking steps to rehabilitate people whose houses were damaged in the riots that erupted after a VHP leader was killed in late August.        
	The state was also employing the needy on projects begun under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in riot-hit areas, he said.        
	Pawar said the team had come to help restore normality. Our effort will be to see that the situation normalises.        
	But the BJP reacted with anger. Where were they when the district was burning? asked state party chief Suresh Pujari.

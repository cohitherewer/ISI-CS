	16000 jump red lights in Delhi    
	Delhi lieutenant governor Tejinder Khanna and chief minister Sheila Dikshits censure that the capitals citizens lack traffic discipline has been proven true through recent statistics.    
	Traffic figures have shown that 16,000 drivers were prosecuted for jumping red lights and speeding in just the first four months of the year.    
	Waiting at a traffic signal for a few seconds seems very irritable for people here. But what they do not understand is that jumping a red light could sometimes cost them their lives, a senior police official said.    
	A total of 9,273 drivers were caught speeding and 6,827 were handed challans for jumping red lights till April 30.    
	The red light and speed check violation enforcement system issued 52,421 challans last year while 30 speed radar guns detected 1,59,361 cases of speeding last year.      
	Aamirs lucky mascot    
	Movie stars are known to change the spelling of their names to get lucky.     
	But Aamir Khan does something different. He goes to Shammi Kapoor.    
	Shammi uncle is my lucky mascot. Whenever I have started something new, I have sought his blessings.... Be it my first film as an actor or as a director, he said.    
	On may 20, Aamir was again at the home of the seventies sensation.    
	His production Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na is set to hit theatres.    
	The film is also the debut appearance of his nephew Imran Khan, so Aamir was doubly keen to seek Shammi Kapoors blessings.      
	Why Paanchvi has not failed    
	Here is the answer to Amitabh Bachchans quiz question on his Big blog: Why does Paanchvi Paas seem like Paanchvi fail on the TRP chart?    
	His one-time KBC producer, Siddharth Basu, says low TRPs for a television show do not mean low viewership. Television audiences have become a fragmented lot in the last few years. Viewership has gone up phenomenally and the dominance of particular shows do not exist any more, Basu said.    
	He said TRPs were not necessarily the absolute standards of judging the popularity or viewership of any show.     
	Basu said Kaun Banega Crorepati in its first season, hosted by Bachchan, had 18 TRPs while the third season hosted by Shah Rukh Khan garnered 12 TRPs.    
	These numbers do not mean the viewership for the third season was low considering the huge number of television channels which have come into existence in the last six to seven years, he added.    
	Shah Rukh Khan would be happy with this answer. Fix it, SRK?

	With the cabinet giving the green signal, the government will soon place the order with the company, official sources said.

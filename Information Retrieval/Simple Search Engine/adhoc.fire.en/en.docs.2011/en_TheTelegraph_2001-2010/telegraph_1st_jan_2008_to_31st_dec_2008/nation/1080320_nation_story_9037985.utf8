The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BPL list blame game in House
                                                                                                               BPL list blame game in House
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Orissa Assembly                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 19: The Assembly today witnessed blame game between the treasury and the Opposition over the Centres decision to cut 10-lakh families from the BPL list in the state.         
	While BJD-BJP legislators lambasted the UPA government in the Centre over the issue, the Congress MLAs claimed that the move was initiated during the NDA regime in the Centre and criticised Naveen Patnaik for sitting over the matter.         
	A BJD-BJP combine raised the issue in the zero hour allegedly to snub the Congress-led UPA government in the Centre ahead of Assembly and Lok Sabha polls. However, the Congress and NCP legislators tried to turn tables on the BJD-BJP coalition saying that the then NDA government in the Centre took the decision in 2003.         
	Demanding a special discussion on the matter, Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik said the Opposition parties were prepared to participate in the debate.         
	Raising the issue, BJD MLA Kalpataru Das said benefits of welfare and poverty programmes are given on the basis of BPL list. This is the outcome of Rahul Gandhis Discovery India trip, said BJD legislator Pradeep Maharathy sarcastically.        
	Several poor families were deprived from such benefits as the BPL list was not revised after 1997. Recently, the Centre had asked the state government to restrict the number of BPL families within 34.63 lakh, thereby excluding 10 lakh poor families from the 2002 BPL survey list, he said.        
	Pump push        
	The NDA governments decision to subsidise only large diesel pumps has not been received well by legislators, irrespective of party lines.         
	Members belonging to the treasury and the Opposition benches today urged the government to reconsider its decision and allow purchase of portable kerosene-operated pump sets. Agriculture minister Surendra Nath Naik assured to reconsider the decision keeping the farmers interest in mind.

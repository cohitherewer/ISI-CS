	 Bangalore, Oct. 17: Mangalore police today arrested two suspected Indian Mujahideen members who allegedly put together all the explosives that went off in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Delhi and Surat.           
	The duo, identified as Rafique and Fakir Bawa, were picked up from a hideout in Koppa in Chikmagalur district.           
	We have seized large quantities of ammonium nitrate, nails, nuts, bolts, gunpowder, chemicals, wires, timer devices along with engineering tool kits, inspector-general, Mangalore range, Ashit Mohan Prasad said. There is no doubt the bombs were all made here as the materials used in the recent blasts are the same as those seized.          
	Rafique worked as a driver for alleged Indian Mujahideen co-founder Riyaz Bhatkal, who is on the run.                  
	 Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir High Court has stayed a government order asking Sheeba Masoodi, the American wife of Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, to leave India as her visa expired last month. Sheeba, a US citizen of Kashmiri origin, has applied for dual citizenship.                  
	 Kanpur (PTI): Police arrested a third person on Thursday in connection with a blast in Kanpur. Ayaz was allegedly carrying crackers on a cycle with another person. The cycle topped over, causing the blast.                  
	 Vadodara (PTI): A seven-member delegation from India on a visit to Pakistan for the release of 434 fishermen alleged on Friday that Pakistani authorities had denied them permission to meet the fishermen. The delegation was allowed to check 140 of the 379 boats captured, the president of the Indian fishermen association said.                  
	 Ahmedabad (PTI): The Gujarat government on Friday issued a notice to an IPS officer demanding an explanation for his unauthorised absence from duty. Himanshu Bhatt has been asked to appear before the inquiry officer within 30 days, failing which a departmental inquiry would be ordered.

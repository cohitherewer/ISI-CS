          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 1: The market meltdown has claimed another life in Hyderabad.         
	Amir Ali Virani, the 24-year-old CEO of Oman Solutions, a stockbroking firm, hanged himself in his bedroom with his mothers dupatta on Thursday night.         
	He left a note saying suicide was his last resort as the nose-diving sensex had gobbled up all his investments.        
	The incident comes days after the slowdown led a stockbroker couple to commit suicide. They allegedly blasted the gas cylinder at their Saidabad home, killing themselves and their one-year-old son. In another part of the city, a broker jumped out of his third-floor office window.        
	Amirs father Jaffar Ali Virani, a retired central government official, has blamed recovery agents hired by creditors for his sons death.        
	My son was in the right business at the wrong time, he said, adding that recovery agents had come to his house twice last week and created nuisance.         
	Amir used to trade in both the securities and futures markets. He had made good money till March, with which he bought a flat at Fateh Sultan Nagar in the heart of the city. He had also invested Rs 25 lakh in scrips of sunrise companies when the economic downturn was in its nascent stage.         
	But the market did not recover, throwing him into a debt trap.         
	The 24-year-old had been under stress since last week after failing to pay two monthly instalments of Rs 3.5 lakh each to his creditors.        
	Police are yet to assess the total value of his dues but fellow brokers said he owed creditors around Rs 1 crore.         
	His investments in certain scrips would have held him up had he survived the dull run for another two months, said Sayee Krishna, a broker who had worked with Amir.

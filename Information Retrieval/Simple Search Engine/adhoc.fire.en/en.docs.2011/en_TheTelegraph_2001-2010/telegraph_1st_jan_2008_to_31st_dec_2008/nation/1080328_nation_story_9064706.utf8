The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Night shift to meet deadline
                                                                                                               Night shift to meet deadline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, March 27: With the advocates strike and economic blockade for a permanent bench of high court showing no signs of ceasing before the current fiscal, district government offices are burning the midnight oil to ease the year-end pressure.         
	The advocates, government officials complain, do not let the offices function in peace during daytime. Recently, advocates ransacked a Wesco office in Sambalpur town when officials disagreed to close offices at the end of the year.         
	Thus, night hours away from the public gaze are better  the officials reason.        
	Officials of revenue, finance, forest, DRDA, PWD and PHED departments who wish to avoid direct confrontation are not only burning the midnight oil, but are working in secluded places, outside the offices. End of the fiscal is crucial for us. In case of any lapse excuses would not work with the bosses. Hence, we thought of this novel path, said a senior officer, preferring to remain anonymous.

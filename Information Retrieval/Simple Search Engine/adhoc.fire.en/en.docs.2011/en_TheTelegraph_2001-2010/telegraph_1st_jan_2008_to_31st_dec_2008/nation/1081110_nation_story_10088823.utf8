The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Time for polls, candidates watch their step
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Time for polls, candidates watch their step
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Fighting a successful election campaign means you have no time to eat or breathe, and your every action is ruled by your watch. Jagdish Mukhi knows this as well as Barack Obama.        
	So, heres how the Delhi BJP candidates diary entries for November 8 would read:        
	8.30am: Met supporters.        
	9.15: Wound up havan.        
	9.30: Started for poll office.        
	11.30: Put the last signature on nomination papers.        
	Every bit was crucial, his astrologer had told him. Winning an election, Mukhi believes, is as much about appeasing the stars in the sky as the voters on the ground.        
	Three weeks before the Delhi Assembly polls, Mukhi and many other candidates have been huddled behind closed doors for hours with their religious gurus to get the date and hour of filing nomination exactly right.        
	Barkha Singh, chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women and Congress candidate from R.K. Puram, for instance, is a staunch Shiva devotee.        
	I shall file my nomination on Monday, the day of Shankar Bhagwan. I follow the predictions of my family priest Shashi Bhushan Sharma. He has never let me down. I had to choose an auspicious day, she said.        
	A candidates aide said some 100 astrologers were working round the clock for the politicians contesting from Delhis 70 seats.        
	After the date is decided, many candidates dont eat, travel or meet anybody on the day they file papers unless their celestial minders can declare the exact moment it would be all right to do so, a state BJP insider said.        
	Mukhi, candidate from Janakpuri, had told The Telegraph on Friday: Ill meet my supporters at the Sanatan Dharm Mandir at Janakpuri at 8.30am tomorrow and perform a havan till 9.15. Then Ill leave to file my papers at 9.30.        
	He had declined to give any more details about his special day, fearing that could be inauspicious.        
	Industries minister Mangat Ram Singhal had two good days lined up  Saturday and Monday. He eventually decided to file his papers tomorrow. For his Congress colleague Naseeb Singh, too, Monday is the day that will decide his naseeb (fate).        
	How can I fix the date without instructions from my priest? Its natural to select an auspicious day for such an important event, Singhal said.        
	Pawan Sharma, BJP candidate from Uttam Nagar, wouldnt reveal his plans. All he said was that he was consulting his gyaan guru, a man well versed in the Panchangam (astrological almanac).        
	If the stars can plot a candidates victory, they can bring down an entire government, too.        
	Jayalalithaa, who pulled the rug from under the BJP-led governments feet in 1999, had locked herself in at her Delhi hotel room in the suspense-filled days before she handed to the President her letter withdrawing support to the Centre. She refused to meet anyone since the moon was in the inauspicious eighth house.        
	After the moon moved on, the ADMK chief performed a prayer to propitiate a powerful female goddess before emerging from seclusion. She then precisely timed her letter hand-over.        
	It had to be within the one-hour window between 9am and 10am, the stars had ordained. Jayalalithaa kept to the script and the government was ousted by a single vote.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Three Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives said to have been in Delhi since August are topping the list of suspects in the serial blasts case, intelligence sources said tonight in the now-familiar ritual of wisdom in hindsight.        
	The police have been trying to track down the sleeper modules. An alert on the three militants was active in Delhi before August 15.         
	As part of the drill, searches were conducted in peripheral areas of Delhi like Noida and Faridabad but they drew a blank. Delhi police receive a steady stream of such alerts and often the quality of the inputs is such that the force is unable to decide which one to take seriously and act upon.        
	One name repeatedly mentioned by security agencies this evening is Taukir, an engineer considered an expert in rigging up timers. Taukir is suspected to be working for the Lashkar and hand in glove with the Simi  the governments usual suspect.        
	The suspected militant may have used mobile phone timers in the bombs, the sources said. Wary, police activated cellphone jammers near sites where bombs were defused today.        
	CISF officers are scanning closed-circuit Metro television footage to identify possible suspects. Delhi police are examining footage captured this evening by cameras at Connaught Place, sources said.         
	Such footage had played an instrumental role in cracking the case of the London Underground bombings on July 7, 2005.        
	SMS salt in wound        
	Suspected plotters of the Delhi bombings were so audacious they made sure that chest-thumping text messages were sent to some of the senior-most police officers in the country before the blasts took place.        
	Sources said a top official in the Delhi police commissionerate received a text message on his personal cellphone, claiming responsibility for the blasts that were still a few minutes away. The message was attributed to the Indian Mujahideen, a suspected offshoot of the Simi.        
	Similar text messages were sent to a senior officer in Gujarat and an additional-director general of police in Rajasthan, blaming them for arresting Simi operatives.        
	The fact has not escaped us that the blasts coincide with the Supreme Courts order of extending the ban on the Simi yesterday, said a home ministry official.

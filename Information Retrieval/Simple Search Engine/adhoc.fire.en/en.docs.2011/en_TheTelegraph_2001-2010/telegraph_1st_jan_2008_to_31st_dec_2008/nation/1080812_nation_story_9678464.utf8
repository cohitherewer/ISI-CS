          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 11: Two robbers armed with a country-made firearm, a sharp weapon and a packet of chilli powder robbed Rs 3.45 lakh from two employees of a petrol pump station on the Mahanadi bridge today.         
	The incident took place when Nrusingha Bhatta and Kanhu Sahu of IBP petrol pump in Chatia were taking the cash to Bhubaneswar. The two were travelling on a motorcycle. The robbery took place under Jagatpur police station area, while they were crossing the bridge around 11.30am. The two armed men in a motorcycle stopped them.        
	One of them threw chilli powder on the faces of the employee while the other snatched the bag. The duo then fled with the cash said Pravat Pradhan, the officer in charge of Jagatpur police station. Investigation is on, he added.         
	Failed attempt        
	Robbers attacked as many as five SBI ATM counters in Bhubaneswar a few hours after midnight today.        
	The counters that were targeted at several places were broken between 2.32am and 5.14am, said police. The attempts were discovered in the morning after customers reached the ATM to draw cash and found the machines smashed. The customers then complained to the police.        
	The attempts were made at counters near Mancheswar, Rail Vihar, Bayababa Math and two other places near the Fortune Tower. Though robbers failed in their attempts, they succeeded to damage the machines worth lakhs with the security cameras that were installed there.         
	It seems they choose SBI, as their ATMs dont have security guards, said inspector P.K. Mishra.         
	For now the police teams have deployed forensic teams and sniffer dogs for the probe. We are still trying to determine whether the attempts were made by the same gang or by different groups, the officer added.

 - Routray demands CBI 
 probe into charges

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 25: Former health minister Bijoyshree Routray, charged by be the Orissa government for accepting a Rs 5-lakh bribe, has demanded a CBI probe into the allegations and have described the charges as a conspiracy.
    
	There is a deep-rooted conspiracy by the power brokers to finish me off politically and to cover up some ones fault, said Routray today while addressing a news conference. He dared the state to order a CBI probe and investigate the role of all politicians and officers associated with the World Bank project, since its inception from 2000. 
    
	Routray also said he was contemplating to move court against the government to protect his honour. The former health minister and a senior ruling BJD legislator added that he had carefully examined the World Bank report and saw that it did not mention the name of the firm alleged to have bribed a minister and the detail of the project for which the payment was made. 
    
	The report, reportedly, also stated that their assessment could not be used for the purpose of an inquiry, as it was not an investigative report, he pointed out. Routray fumed that it was irresponsible on the part of chief secretary Ajit Tripathy to name him. 
    
	Quoting the bank report, he said that three firms had alleged that they had paid 20 per cent bribe for supplying equipment during 2003 September, 2004 January and 2004 April, a tenure in which he was not at the helm of affairs.
    
	Why was the firm, claiming to have bribed a minister, not booked and why were other officials who received the bribe not named by the chief secretary? asked Routray. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik evaded all points raised by his former colleague and said appropriate action would be taken against those guilty after a vigilance inquiry.

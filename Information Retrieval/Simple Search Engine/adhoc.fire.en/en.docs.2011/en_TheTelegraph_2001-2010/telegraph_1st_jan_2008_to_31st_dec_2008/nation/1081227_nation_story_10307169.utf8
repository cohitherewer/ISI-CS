	Chennai, Dec. 26: The external affairs ministry is hopeful of securing very soon the release of Simon Paramananthan, the cook from Tamil Nadu abducted by militants in Afghanistan.         
	We are aware of the (Sunday) deadline fixed by the kidnappers and the phone number which Simons brother in Kabul is calling to talk to them. We are very much in the loop and are hopeful of finding a solution very soon, Vayalar Ravi, the minister for overseas Indian affairs, told reporters here today.                           
	Ravi said that the Indian embassy in Kabul had been working towards the solution since Simons employers informed it about the kidnapping in October. It has come to the medias knowledge only now but our officials have been engaged in the process for more than two months and we know that Simon is safe, the minister said.        
	Simon, who works in a restaurant that serves Italian soldiers, was abducted in mid-October and his captors had called his brother, also a cook in Kabul, demanding a ransom of $50,000.         
	Ravi said Indian visitors to Afghanistan had been instructed to stay in regular touch with the embassy there.        
	 He insisted that Indians were not being discouraged from travelling to Afghanistan, but added that the government was not in favour of Indians travelling to Iraq. We discourage people from going to Iraq but still a few go to Kuwait and travel from there, he said.

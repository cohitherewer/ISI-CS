	Cuttack, Sept. 14: Spina bifida (split spine) is devastating to children and nothing is more heartbreaking than the baby born to Annapurna Devi at the SCB Medical College and Hospital here.        
	The week-old male child was born with what may be the first case of meningomylocele type of spina bifida, a congenital spinal cord related abnormality ever recorded at the hospital.        
	At birth, the baby had an open spine. Both ends of the spinal cord opened to the lower part of his body and with the abdominal skin not being formed, the bladders were left exposed. The genitals had not been formed and the anus was not well defined too. Its a rare case of meningomylocele involving critical congenital multiple abnormalities where the spinal cord, instead of rolling up into a tube, stayed on the surface of the skin, said Dr Maya Padhi, under whose unit of the gynaecology and obstetrics department of the hospital the baby was born.        
	Moreover, the nerves that are below the level where the spinal cord stopped rolling up, do not work properly, Padhi explained.        
	The hospital referred the baby  born to Annapurna Devi, wife of daily wage labourer Ajay Nayak of Kantiagadia in Jajpur district  to Sardar Vallabhai Patel Postgraduate Institute of Paediatrics here.        
	According to experts, the meninges or membranes, which form a fluid-filled sac that is usually covered with skin, are exposed, often causing nerve damage.         
	In such cases, a series of major surgeries are recommended and the treatment involves huge expenditure.

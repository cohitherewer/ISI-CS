          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 21: Ajit Kumar Pradhan and six others of Kandhamal today filed a defamation suit seeking Rs 50 crore damages from Ashok Kumar Sahu, the president of the Orissa unit of Hindu Jagaran Samukhya, for accusing them of plotting the murder of Swami Laxmananda.         
	The petitioners filed the defamation suit in the court of the civil judge (senior division), Cuttack, in the capacity of members of Kandhamal-based Baticola Church Council.        
	The damages have been claimed from Sahu for the false imputation he made at a news conference that the conspiracy to eliminate the monk was hatched at Baticola Church in Kandhamal, the petitioners counsel Prasanna Nanda said here today. A criminal complaint has also been filed against him under Sections 499, 500, 505 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act at the appropriate court in Bhubaneswar, Nanda said.        
	The defamation suit petition has claimed that the allegations were made on the basis of document with fabricated contents and forged signatures.        
	Actually nine entries were made in the general body meeting of the Parish Council held at Baticola Catholic Abbey. But the 10th entry in the document released in the news conference was fabricated by forging the signatures endorsing it, the petition further claims.         
	The leader of Hindu Jagaran Samukhya, an outfit under the aegis of the Sangh Parivar, alleged at a news conference on October 6 in Bhubaneswar that the decision to eliminate the seer was taken at the general body meeting of the Parish Council. Sahu had even circulated meeting proceedings that read as according to the command of our bishop, it was decided to offer those (who indulged in satanic activities opposing our expansion) as sacrifice at the altar of the Lord.         
	The forged proceedings reportedly also mentioned August 23 as the date for the execution of the seer.

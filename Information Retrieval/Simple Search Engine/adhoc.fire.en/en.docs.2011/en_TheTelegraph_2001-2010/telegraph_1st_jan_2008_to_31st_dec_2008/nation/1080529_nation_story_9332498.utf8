          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 28: Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP) has expressed apprehension about the safety of inmates at homes for destitute women across the state in the wake of alleged suicide by a 30-year-old superintendent of a short-stay home in Balasore.        
	After a fact-finding visit to the home at Sahadevkhunta near Balasore, the Cuttack-based NGO described the death of Rajalaxmi Panda a case of rape and consequential death by committing suicide.        
	Her body was recovered from the railway tracks near Balasore on May 13.         
	She had apparently no option but to jump onto the tracks, said Bikash Das, the executive vice-president of the NGO.         
	Rajalaxmi was at the home following her marriage dispute and was entrusted the charge of superintendent.         
	The director of the home allegedly sexually abused her. During the visit, it was revealed that the residents are living in a state of mental agony and fear. Almost nine inmates have already left the home out of 22 residents, Das said.        
	Binod Nayak, the director, was arrested on May 18 after scrutiny and ascertaining the authenticity of a suicide note recovered from her.         
	The seized handwritten note read that Nayak had been sexually exploiting Rajalaxmi and compelling her to marriage.         
	Other inmates of the home know the facts, the letter added.         
	The letters also referred to sexual harassment to other inmates by the accused.        
	A case was later registered against Nayak under Sections 376 and 302 of the IPC and taken into judicial custody.         
	The fact-finding visit was made by the NGO along with a member of the State Legal Service Authority and Convener of Swadhikar Forum  a federation of NGOs operating shelter homes for deserted and destitute women.        
	CLAP had since submitted a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik urging government direction for formation of sexual harassment prevention committees in all the homes for destitute women in the state.         
	At present, there are 54 swadhar (correctional) homes and 26 short-stay homes.         
	It should be made mandatory to verify the functioning of sexual harassment prevention committee while approving the grants or at the time of approval of the homes in greater interest and safety of women, the memorandum stated.

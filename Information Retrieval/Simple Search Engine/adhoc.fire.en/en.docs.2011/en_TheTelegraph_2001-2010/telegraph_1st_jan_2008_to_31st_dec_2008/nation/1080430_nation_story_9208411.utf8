          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, April 29: The Bangalore airport operated by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) may continue to function even after a new one is inaugurated 40km from the tech city.         
	The Centre and the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), the consortium for the new Devanahalli airport, are trying to tie up loose ends before this is made possible.        
	According to the concessional agreement, HAL was to close down the old airport that is just 9km from the city centre. Also, no other airport was to come up within 150km of the new airport.        
	The old Begumpet airport in Hyderabad, another IT city, closed down in March after a new one came up in Shamshabad.        
	But after sustained public pressure  Bangalore residents complained about the airports distance from the city  and a suggestion by Karnataka High Court on reworking the concessional agreement between BIAL and the Centre, there were signs of a compromise at a meeting held in Delhi today.         
	While the aviation ministry suggested that aircraft below 80 seats could continue operating from the existing utility, BIAL was more keen on the specifics  like which flight routes should be allowed and what type of aircraft could operate from the old airport.         
	BIAL sources said the company would insist on only short, non-metro route flights from the HAL airport. Short-destination flights from Bangalore to Hyderabad, Chennai, Coimbatore, Kochi, Mangalore, Belgaum and other cities can operate from HAL, a source said.         
	We are discussing whether the agreement should mention only below-80-seat, turbo-prop aircraft or also include jets. As jets can cover larger distances, we do not want airlines to operate a Delhi-Bangalore flight from HAL. Also, the flights should not be of feeder nature, the source added. A Mumbai-Bangalore flight would feed (transfer passengers to) international flights. Hence, BIALs insistence that flights to metros operate from Devanahalli.         
	BIAL public relations officer Monica M. Prabhu said: We have taken note of the suggestions by the civil aviation ministry. Further discussions will be held on May 12.        
	The new airports opening will get delayed beyond the second week of May because of the state elections, Prabhu said. It will open on May 25, the day the Assembly poll results are announced. The delay is costing the airport Rs 1 crore a day.

          JOHN MARY                           Karat: Rebel menace                                   
	Dec. 17: CPM rebels this evening looked set to end a 28-year reign of the Left in a civic body in Prakash Karats home district where the party used to have a stranglehold.        
	Eight of the nine rebels who contested the municipal elections in Shornur in Palakkad district, won, reducing the CPM to a minority in the 30-member board.        
	After todays results, the rebels have eight seats, the CPM 14, the Congress-led UDF seven and the BJP 1. The rebel group, expected to be supported by the Congress, will be the decisive factor in the reconstitution of the council.        
	Shornur is about 40km from Elapully, the village where CPM general secretary Karat traces his roots. Elapully falls under the CPM-ruled Pudussery gram panchayat.         
	The result is ominous for the CPM in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. This is one place where upper castes had embraced the proletarian party  E.M.S. Namboodiripad, the late ideologue and the worlds first elected communist chief minister, also belonged to Palakkad in north Kerala.        
	The CPM, which had swept all but one of Keralas 20 seats in the last Lok Sabha polls and added to the Lefts bargaining muscle at the Centre till the nuclear row, is now being wracked by a faction feud.        
	Echoes of the feud, blamed on ideological and personal differences between chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state party chief Pinarayi Vijayan, were heard in the municipal elections also. Vijayan had recently derided the rebels as family wreckers, reacting to Achuthanandans position that they be corrected and taken back.        
	The Congress-led Opposition fished in troubled waters and backed the rebels, sending a message that dissidents in other places where the CPM has been crushing rebellion can expect similar gestures.         
	The dissidents had cited a mafia culture in the party for their rebellion. Mafia culture is usually interpreted as an indirect reference to allegations of corruption and strong-arm tactics levelled against the official faction.         
	The CPM attributed the Shornur result to money power, aided by a rare consolidation of anti-party elements.

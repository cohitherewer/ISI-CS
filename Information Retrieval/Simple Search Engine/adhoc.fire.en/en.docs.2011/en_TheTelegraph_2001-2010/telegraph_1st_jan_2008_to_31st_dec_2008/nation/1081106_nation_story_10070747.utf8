	An extraordinarily gracious John McCain has applauded Barack Obama for achieving a great thing for him and his country.        
	Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this greatest nation on earth.         
	McCain urged all Americans  including his supporters  to rally behind Obama, shushing them occasionally with please, please when they booed his mentions of Obama.        
	These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face, McCain added. He was joined by his running mate, Sarah Palin, who did not speak.        
	Referring to McCains phone call to concede, Obama later said his poll rival had been extraordinarily gracious.

	New York, Nov. 5: There were tearful faces in the crowd in Rockefeller Plaza watching the tearful faces on screen as Barack Obama made his victory speech after he had received an extraordinarily gracious call from John McCain conceding defeat.        
	The time was midnight, the bewitching hour when people, black and white and overwhelmingly young, sensed America was being reborn. It was, above all, a time of hope when those lucky enough to be present felt the sins of previous years  as viewed, fairly or otherwise, by millions in America and hundreds of millions all over the world  were washed away.        
	For an Indian, caught up like everyone else in the magic of the moment, there was almost a temptation to insert Nehrus lines for Obama: Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, America will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of black Americans, long suppressed, finds utterance.        
	For an Indian, a gathering in the tens of thousands is scarcely anything to write home about. Yet, there was something touching about the effect of Obamas speech. This happened to be to an audience in Rockefeller Plaza in New York but there were numerous similar congregations listening to the countrys President-elect.        
	The TV editors monitoring the cameras in Obamas home city of Chicago clearly understood the significance of the occasion for the lens lingered on the tears rolling down the faces of black Americans.        
	Yes, we can, Obama said to the crowd back in Chicago. Yes, we can, responded the young men and women in Rockefeller Plaza.        
	An Indian murmured something about the arrival of an avatar of Krishna but the comment was lost in the night.        
	All through the evening crowds and foreign tourists, too, had started gathering in the plaza, festooned in a sea of Stars amp; Stripes. The ice-skating rink below was taken up with an illuminated map of the US. All around were banks of television cameras, while a scorecard read, Obama 0, McCain 0, as though an IPL final was about to begin.        
	Though the loudspeaker system was not always clear, a young woman held up her mobile phone, possibly to relay Obamas words to a loved one who could not be there. Again and again, they were met with spontaneous applause.        
	There was laughter when Obama addressed his daughters: Sasha and Malia you have earned the new puppy thats coming with us to the White House.        
	Perhaps only an Indian would have noticed the irony of the remark: here was the nations first black President headed for what will still be called the White House.

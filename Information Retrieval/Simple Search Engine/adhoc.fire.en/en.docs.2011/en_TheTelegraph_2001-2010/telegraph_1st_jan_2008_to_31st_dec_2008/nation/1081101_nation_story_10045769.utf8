                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani call for terror law revival

	Guwahati, Oct. 31: L.K. Advani today asked the Centre to revive the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which allowed security agencies extraordinary powers to detain and question terror suspects.        
	We need stringent laws to deal with the situation, he told reporters here after visiting the blast sites and claiming Bangladeshi soil is being used for terror activities in India.        
	I hold the two weak (Congress) governments in New Delhi and Guwahati responsible for the blasts in Assam. They have not taken any measures, legal or administrative, to stop infiltration from Bangladesh, the BJP leader said.        
	I would like to know the Prime Ministers response to this kind of challenge. He is an MP from the state.        
	Advani asked whether the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) was functioning in Assam under the name of the Muslim Students Union and the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam. This needs to be looked into.

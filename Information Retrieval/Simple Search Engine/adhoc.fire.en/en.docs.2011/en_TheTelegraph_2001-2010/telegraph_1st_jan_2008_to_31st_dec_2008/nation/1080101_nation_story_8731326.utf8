 Buzz in Big Cities 

   
	Mumbai trains on superfast track
 
	Mumbai may not have turned into Shanghai as promised, but the dream lives on. 
 
	The Maharashtra government is considering a pound;3.75-billion high-speed train network in the metropolis whose transport system is bursting at the seams. 
 
	The state received an expression of interest from six leading infrastructure giants for preparing the feasibility report of the magnetic levitation, or maglev, trains. 
 
	These trains are suspended with the support of electromagnetic force, leaving a small gap between the wheels and the elevated tracks. As they glide, they pick up speed mdash; beginning with 100 kmph, moving to 200, then to 300, on to 400 and then finally reaching 430kmph. 
 
	A maglev could turn a three-hour train journey from Mumbai to Pune to a 40-minute ride and an overnight journey to Nagpur will be covered in just four hours. 
 
	But maglevs have a spotty record. In Japan, the exorbitant costs were a hurdle to plans to build a maglev line between Tokyo and Osaka. And critics in Shanghai say the trains are a drain on money and the high speed cannot be justified for short-distance travel. 
 
	Eve-teasers? Spray pepper
 
	Pepper sprays keep eve-teasers away, so says a police-backed study conducted a few months ago. 
 
	The study suggests making small bottles of pepper spray available at a low price as a key strategy to shield women from harassment. 
 
	It identifies marketplaces and colleges as places where the capitals women feel the most insecure.
 
	Titled How secure or insecure are women in the city of Delhi, the study was conducted by the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences for the Bureau of Police Research and Development.
 
	Every girl should carry a pepper spray and it should be available in a small bottle at a very low price... easily available in the market, says the study, for which 70 women were interviewed in markets, colleges, railway stations, malls, the airport, slums and villages.
 
	The study recommends that women move in groups and carry contact numbers of helplines and police. 
 
	No Lolitas, please
 
	Lolita may have lured an entire generation, but in Karnataka, a 14-year-old as the object of the heros affection is a strict no-no. 
 
	Cheluvina Chittara, a Kannada film with a schoolgirl as the heroine mdash; a la the 1962 film in which a 40-something man falls for a 14-year-old mdash; is facing the music from parents and the state womens commission.
 
	After complaints poured in, the commission slapped notices on the censor board, and the director and producers of the film, which has been running to packed houses in the state.
 
	Commission chairperson Pramila Nesargi said parents had told her that their school-going daughters have fallen in love enthused by the movie and some have even eloped. 
 
	In one locality, at least eight girls have run away, she said.
 
	How can a schoolgirl, who is a minor, be portrayed in such a role? What impact will it have on the society? Nesargi asked. How can the censor board clear such films?
  
	Reluctant Rajni
 
	To his hordes of fans, Rajnikant may be the Muthalvar (chief minister) of the Tamil film world, but the actor seems to have given up on his ambition to jump on the star-studded political bandwagon for good. 
 
	His followers had sent the message loud and clear on the superstars 58th birthday on December 12, pasting colourful posters all across Chennai. One of them depicted him as the Shirdi Sai Baba, signalling that as chief minister, he would look after the poor just as the saint did. 
 
	But the once-bitten-twice-shy Rajni is not falling for the bait. He disappeared to an undisclosed location on B-day.
 
	Delhi: The jewels of the Nizam of Hyderabad are on display at the National Museum after six years. Feast your eyes on the 173 pieces of jewellery, whose collective worth is estimated at more than Rs 2000crore. No wonder CISF commandos will be guarding them. The exhibition is open from 10am to 6pm.

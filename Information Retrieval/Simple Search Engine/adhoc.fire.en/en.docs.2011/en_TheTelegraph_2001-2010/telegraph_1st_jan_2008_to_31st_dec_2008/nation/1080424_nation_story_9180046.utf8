          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 23: Tamil Nadu legislators today asked the Centre to shed its hands-off policy and prod the Sri Lankan government and the banned LTTE back to the talks table to end the ethnic bloodletting in the island nation.        
	The plea, in the form of a resolution adopted by the Assembly, came after an acrimonious debate on Delhis approach and a telling comment from chief minister M. Karunanidhi on the fratricidal war among rebel groups that has scuppered chances of victory.        
	Had all the groups remained united, the island Tamils, Karunanidhi said, would have attained victory like the Maoists in Nepal.        
	The internecine rivalries among Tamil groups havent helped the Lankan Tamils gain their rights, he told the Assembly.        
	The resolution  moved by Karunanidhi, an ally of the Congress-led central coalition  and adopted by a voice vote urged Delhi to come forward to reinitiate a meaningful dialogue process between the warring parties in Lanka to find an amicable political solution to the 25-year-old ethnic strife.        
	The chief minister, however, made it clear there was no point in blaming Delhi for all that has been happening in Lanka.        
	During the debate, MDMK leader Kannappan had said Indias approach had facilitated the killing of Tamils in Sri Lanka.        
	Karunanidhi said he didnt expect the comment from the member. Hence, I recommend to the Speaker to expunge those portions, he said.         
	The Speaker promptly did so.        
	Without naming the Congress, Karunanidhi said the party had already borne heavy losses.         
	They lost their great leader Rajiv Gandhi in pursuance of the (Tamils) cause. So to fault or blame them now is futile.        
	The DMK boss also referred to Priyanka Gandhi Vadras recent meeting with Nalini, jailed for involvement in the former Prime Ministers assassination, and her mother Congress chief Sonia Gandhis efforts earlier to get the convicts death sentence commuted to life.        
	All these showed the Gandhi family has been an embodiment of deep humanism, Karunanidhi said, and expressed hope that the Centre, too, would view the resolution from a humanitarian perspective to protect the lives of Lankan Tamils.        
	The resolution had been so worded as to be non-problematic, which would also help get us even the  support of Congress MLAs, the DMK chief added.        
	On the fratricidal war among the militant groups in Lanka, Karunanidhi recalled how one leader, Amirthalingam, was shot dead while his wife was in the kitchen making tea for the visitors.        
	It was such ghastly killings that had weakened the Tamil movement in Lanka, the chief minister reminded parties that have a soft corner for the Tamil Tigers.

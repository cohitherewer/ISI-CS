	Oct. 22: A section of Air Indias ground staff has threatened to go on strike from 4pm on Thursday if their demands, which include higher wages, are not met.        
	The employees, largely associated with baggage handling and loading, were about to launch a strike from Wednesday midnight but agreed to wait till tomorrow afternoon after talks with the management.        
	A fresh round of talks is scheduled tomorrow, sources said. It was not clear whether the cabin crew, who are also represented by the union, will join the strike if it takes place.        
	The Air Corporation Union said the management had promised the board would discuss the hike tomorrow but disclosed today that the issue was not on the agenda.

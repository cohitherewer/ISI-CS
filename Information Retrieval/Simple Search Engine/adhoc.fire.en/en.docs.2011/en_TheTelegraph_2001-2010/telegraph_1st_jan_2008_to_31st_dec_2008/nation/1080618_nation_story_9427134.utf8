          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: Russia today came out in support of the Indo-US nuclear deal, terming it useful for New Delhi and favouring its early conclusion.        
	In my personal assessment, in principle, by and large the Indo-US nuclear deal is useful for India, Russian ambassador Vyacheslav Trubnikov said.        
	India should sign the deal. The sooner is better than later, he said, adding it would open the doors for expansion of Indo-Russian civil nuclear cooperation.        
	He, however, said it was for India to decide at what price it has to strike the deal.        
	Trubnikov said Moscow was bound by international obligations and would like India to conclude the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and get a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group to participate in nuclear trade.        
	Once these were done, Russia would be able to increase co-operation with Delhi, he said. We cannot violate international obligations as an NSG member. This is the very reason that the draft agreement between India and Russia has been initialled but not signed, he said.        
	We are bound by international obligations as also our internal laws.        
	Trubnikov said Russia would be in a privileged position once India joined the nuclear mainstream as we already have a presence in the country.        
	Switching to the Iran issue, he said Tehran had the right to have access to peaceful uses of nuclear technology but should not attempt to pursue a military programme. No one has any kind of proof that Iran is busy fulfilling some military programme. he said, adding IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei had said Tehran complied with its international obligations.        
	The Iran issue should be resolved through diplomatic means and not by use of force, Trubnikov said. By and large, India has been sticking to the same position. We do not differ much.

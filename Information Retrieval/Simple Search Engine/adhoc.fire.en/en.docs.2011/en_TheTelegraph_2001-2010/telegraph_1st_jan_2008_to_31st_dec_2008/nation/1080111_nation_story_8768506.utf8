	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 10: Orissa may receive a lot of bad press regarding poverty and general squalor  but today a panel comprising parliamentarians, models, celebrities and a filmmaker found hope in Orissas story. 
    
	Citizens Alliance on Malnutrition, a motley group of MPs  Sachin Pilot, Supriya Sule and Baijayant Panda  and celebrities such as Shyam Benegal and Feroze Gujral today found positive deviance (a sociological word describing adaptability) in a nondescript Salepur village. 
    
	The group, which is trying to push the Centre for a national policy and an action plan, especially for the children, has toured states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh already. 
    
	Recently, it picked up the fortification scheme in Gujarat. As a result of the efforts edible oil is fortified with Vitamin-A and D and flour is fortified with iron and folic acid and is available both in open markets as well as in government programmes such as ICDS and mid-day meals.
    
	The gathered personalities also pointed out that according to a health ministry survey, around 48 per cent of Indias children are malnourished. The number of undernourished children below three years has increased in the past few years, despite a host of government schemes and ample funds.

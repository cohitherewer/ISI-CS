	Feb. 4: Amitabh Bachchan and family landed in Jaipur on the eve of his sons birthday while television channels and fans tried to figure out whether his Mumbai house was the target of a bottle attack.
    
	Rumours flew thick and fast through the day that two men on a motorbike threw empty bottles around 1.30am on Monday at Amitabhs Prateeksha bungalow in Juhu. Housekeepers at Prateeksha  the Bachchans stay at Jalsa, a five-minute walk away  were quoted as saying bottles were hurled by unidentified people.
    
	The incident came hours after Raj Thackerays foot soldiers assaulted Samajwadi Party supporters in an unfolding drama over whether Amitabh discriminated between Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.
    
	As news broke and younger brother Amar Singh railed how unsafe Mumbai had become, police said they could not find evidence to establish the attack.
    
	I personally visited both homes  Prateeksha and Jalsa  and found out that there was no such incident. There is no question of looking for anyone, Deepak Katkare, the senior inspector of Juhu police station, said.
    
	Joint commissioner K.L. Prasad added: Senior police officials visited both places and they did not find a single piece of glass.
    
	However, Amar said: The recent incidents have demonstrated that no one is safe in Mumbai. As seen from the disturbance outside Bachchans house, when even someone like him is not safe, one can imagine the plight of an ordinary Mumbaikar.
    
	The police said 33 people had been arrested for violence in Mumbai over the past 24 hours. Around 50 had been arrested in Thane for attacking two cinemas screening Bhojpuri films. 
    
	Raj Thackeray, whose Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had been trying to carve a niche for itself by projecting itself as more hawkish than his uncle Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena, has been provided Z-category security.
    
	Mumbai was largely peaceful today, barring an attack in Dadar. MNS supporters beat up taxi-drivers and hawkers and whisked some of them from the luggage compartment of a train. Some TV crews accompanied the group, filming the incident. 
    
	However, the abductors soon realised that the captives included some Maharashtrians, too, which prompted the release of all.
    
	Amid the swirl of speculation and the hunt for shards of evidence, the Bachchans checked into the Rambagh Palace hotel in Jaipur, the city that had given refuge to Taslima Nasreen initially after she was bundled out of Calcutta.
    
	Sound bites served, Amar, too, accompanied the family that included Jaya Bachchan and daughter-in-law Aishwarya. Tomorrows birthday boy Abhishek has been camping in Jaipur for the past month, shooting for Rakeysh Mehras Dilli 6.
    
	Security was tightened around the hotel with the inside gate closed, which otherwise remains open. 
    
	Amar has lodged a first information report against Raj and his supporters, accusing them of making provocative statements and harbouring intention to cause grievous hurt.
    
	Raj, back in Mumbai from Pune, today tried to defend himself: I didnt start the war of words. Whatever I said was in reaction.
    
	The breakaway Sena leader did not specify whose or which comment he had reacted to.

  -  Minister wings clipped in air             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           LOOK WHAT YOUVE GOT: Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada at the swearing-in. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, April 6: Mani Shankar Aiyar was today stripped of his charge as minister of sports and youth affairs  a role that turned controversial after his tiff with other sports bosses.        
	As M.S. Gill, the former chief election commissioner, was sworn in at Rashtrapati Bhawan this evening, Aiyar was flying back from Wellington, New Zealand.         
	Aiyar stays in charge of panchayati raj and development of the North-Eastern region, but it was his role as sports minister that saw him in the midst of controversy most often.        
	On April 11, 2007, Aiyar had said that the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to be hosted by Delhi, would have little relevance for the common man. He had reportedly also questioned the governments decision to allocate Rs 7,000 crore for the Games when it does not have enough money for social development programmes.                   
	Whether you organise the Commonwealth Games in Delhi or in Melbourne, the state of people living in the colonies right opposite the Games site (on the banks of the Yamuna) will remain the same, Aiyar had reportedly said.         
	His comments sparked a public spat with Suresh Kalmadi, head of the Games organising committee and Indian Olympic Association chief.         
	When later that month, India failed to pip South Korea to host the 2014 Asian Games, Kalmadi accused Aiyar of backing the Korean bid.         
	Aiyar was on a three-nation official tour, sources said. He went to Hong Kong, Australia and finally New Zealand, where he discussed each of his three portfolios with officials. Aiyar, who is returning tomorrow, has not cut his trip short, an official close to the minister said.         
	In Australia and New Zealand, in particular, he discussed possible strategies India could adopt to improve in sports. He wanted to understand how these countries with their small populations produced so many sporting champions, a source said.         
	Aiyar is unlikely to get a chance to implement what he understood anytime soon.

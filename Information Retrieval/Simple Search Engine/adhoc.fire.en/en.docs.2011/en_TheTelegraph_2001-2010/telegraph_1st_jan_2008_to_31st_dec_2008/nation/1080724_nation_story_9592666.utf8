The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left fumes at Soren demand
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left fumes at Soren demand
          OUR BUREAU                          Champion or foe? Shibu Soren                                  
	July 23: Bengals Left front chairman Biman Bose has threatened street protests if Delhi tried to shift the Coal India and DVC headquarters from Calcutta or transfer three Bengal districts to Jharkhand  apparently promises the UPA has made to Shibu Soren to win his confidence.        
	The Left front called UPAs trade with JMM for its survival and the JMMs demand for a Greater Jharkhand immoral.        
	Without naming the JMM chief, Shibu Soren, Bose called the demand to carve out three districts of Bengal to form Greater Jharkhand and the shift of headquarters of Coal India and DVC to Ranchi as unjustified and unrealistic        
	The Left strongly protests such a demand and would organise a movement to foil any such move, he said.         
	CPM in Bengal, which had rallied behind Karat at the central committee meeting, seemed relieved at having avoided an election so soon after panchayat and civic poll setbacks.         
	The massive turnout at Mamata Banerjees rally on Tuesday, attended by former Congress heavyweight Somen Mitra, increased their worries. Predictably, the Left Front chairman, Bose, didnt demand a general election even as he accused the government of buying votes. Whether well seek fresh polls immediately will depend on a lot of factors, he said.        
	Prakash Karat yesterday spoke of a sad day for democracy after the trust vote result was out, but his Bengal colleagues didnt sound too sorry at escaping an early poll.

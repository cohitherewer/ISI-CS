          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 20: Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde has resigned as general secretary for allegedly being ignored on the appointment of party office-bearers in his home state of Maharashtra.        
	The immediate provocation for Mundes resignation, which was communicated to BJP president Rajnath Singh today, was the nomination of Madhu Chavan as president of the Mumbai unit.         
	He charged the leaders with taking a unilateral decision. Chavan was chosen by Maharashtra BJP chief Nitin Gadkari with whom Munde has had a running battle for the past three years.        
	Munde is the brother-in-law of the late Pramod Mahajan. Until Mahajans death in 2006, the duos writ ran over the Maharashtra BJP unit and nobody else was allowed to have a say. However, Mundes clout has since diminished as Gadkari grew assertive.        
	Sources said Munde wanted to appoint Mahajans daughter Poonam Rao to the post Chavan got. But Gadkari cited her inexperience.         
	Poonam had campaigned for Narendra Modi, her late fathers bete noire, in the last Gujarat elections.        
	Kaptan Singh Solanki, the organising secretary in charge of Maharashtra, confirmed that Munde had put in his papers. Asked if the resignation was accepted, he said: We wont take it.         
	Rajnath said: I have not received the resignation as yet but we will talk to Munde and Gadkari and sort out the issue. Asked if he was aware of Munde being sidestepped, Rajnath said: The party president cannot interfere in each and every state and district level appointment. Chavan was appointed after a committee, comprising senior leaders like Ram Naik, Ved Prakash Goyal and Balasaheb Apte, cleared his name.        
	It is believed Munde was not too happy with spokesperson Prakash Javadekars nomination to the Rajya Sabha either because he had rooted for Rekha, Mahajans widow.         
	Sources said it was time for the Maharashtra BJP to come out of Mahajans shadow. The entry of his immediate family member is bad news because there are too many unsavoury associations, said a source, recalling his murder and son Rahuls alleged links with drug peddlers. However, they admitted Munde was the partys only crowdpuller.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     JD(U) legislators hold dissent meet

	Patna, April 30: Twelve MLAs of the ruling JD(U), mainly ministers who were dropped or aspirants who failed to find a place in the Nitish cabinet, gathered at the residence of colleague Monajir Hasan today in what is being described as a bid to test their strength against the ruling establishment.         
	The legislators chose to gather a day after the JD(U) leadership served a showcause on Monajir Hasan, a dropped minister who recently resigned as the party vice-president, and Poonam Devi for speaking against the reshuffle on April 13. The MLAs gathered at my home to calm me and my other colleagues down. The meeting meant nothing more, said a cautious Monajir.         
	The sacked ministers are yet to reconcile to the chief ministers decision.         
	In the meantime, Nitish Kumar who left for New Delhi tonight clarified: The cabinet reshuffle takes place keeping in view the social and regional balance. I dont feel there is any need to speak on the issue as the states development is more necessary than deliberating on such issues.         
	Meanwhile, the rebellion against deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has refused to die down.         
	Most rebel leaders are camping in New Delhi where the senior party leaders are holding consultations to douse the flame in Bihars BJP.         
	The rebels have made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than Modis removal.

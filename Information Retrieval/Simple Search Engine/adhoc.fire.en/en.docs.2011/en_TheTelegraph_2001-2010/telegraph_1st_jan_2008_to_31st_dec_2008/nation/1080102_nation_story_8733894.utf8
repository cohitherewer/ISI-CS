     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 1: Four students returning from a New Year party died after their Ford Ikon crashed into a stationary earth-moving truck near Marine Drive early today.
    
	The accident also killed a civic employee.
    
	The dead students, part of a group of six travelling by the car, were between 17 and 22. 
    
	It is not clear if the car driver was drunk.
    
	The car was definitely being driven very fast and the driver did not even realise that a dumper was standing there. The car hit the dumper, killing four youths and one of the staffers working at the rear end of the truck, deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Brijesh Singh said.
    
	The civic worker has been identified as Sundar Sahoo, 35, and the dead students as Somil Surji Gaddha, Bhavin Pradip Gandhi, Nitesh Dinesh Damania and Yash Harish Shah.
    
	The two other occupants of the car  Umang Rajesh Taraiya and Aftab Akhtar Mujavar  have been admitted to hospital.
    
	Despite repeated requests from police, quite a few revellers flouted alcohol limits for driving. Till 5am on Tuesday, 338 people had been arrested in Mumbai for drink-driving. Mumbai police used breathalysers to nail them.
    
	However, the polices stringent measures to ensure safety for women seem to have worked, with no cases of molestation or abuse being reported. 
    
	In 2006, as thousands of revellers partied at the Gateway of India on December 31, a girl was groped and molested by over 70 men and her male friend was unable to help her.

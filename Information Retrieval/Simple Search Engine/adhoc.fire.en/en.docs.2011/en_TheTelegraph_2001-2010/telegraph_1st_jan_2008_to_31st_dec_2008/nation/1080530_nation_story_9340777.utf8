          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          Khan. (BNP)                                  
	Bangalore, May 29: B.S. Yeddyurappa is set to keep his promise of inducting a Muslim member into his cabinet when he takes oath tomorrow as chief minister of the BJPs first independent government in the south.        
	BJP sources said Mumtaz Ali Khan, a retired professor and one of the vice-presidents of the party, would be sworn in as minister on the steps of the Vidhana Soudha at 1.50pm, an auspicious time indicated by the chief minister-designate.        
	Khan, a social scientist, had contested on a BJP ticket in 2004 and finished second.         
	Although he opted out of the contest this time in favour of a friend, Khan is being rewarded as he is seen as a moderate representative of the Muslim community. The BJP is not untouchable. It takes some time to get rid of the mindset, Khan said.        
	At his two-storeyed home in Gangenahalli, people from all communities trooped in to meet him, including some Muslims who did not vote for the BJP.         
	We are happy that the community is being represented by professor saab, said Mohammed Yasin, who came to extend his good wishes.

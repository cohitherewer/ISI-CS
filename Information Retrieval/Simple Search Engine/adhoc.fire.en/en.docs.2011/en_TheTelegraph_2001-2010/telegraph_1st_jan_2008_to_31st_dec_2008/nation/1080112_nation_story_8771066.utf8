	Raipur, Jan. 11: Opposing a cultural programme cost a village sarpanch his life in Chhattisgarh.
    
	Irked villagers today reportedly burnt Bholaram Satnami esrly in the morning today after brutally bashing him up. Investigating officers said they would be in a position to comment on the matter only after the post-mortem reports, are made available. 
    
	Satnami, village sarpanch of Phooljhar under Suhela police station in Raipur, yesterday had a heated argument with a group of villagers over organising a dance show. The sarpanch was irked that the show was being organised without his permission. A section that organised the show contended that consent was not a norm, said a senior officer.
    
	Satpathy disrupted the show and said he would not allow it to go on. But police guards intervened and sent him packing. 
    
	A humiliated sarpanch, the next day, accosted the organisers with an axe, when he was attacked, too, with rods and lathis.

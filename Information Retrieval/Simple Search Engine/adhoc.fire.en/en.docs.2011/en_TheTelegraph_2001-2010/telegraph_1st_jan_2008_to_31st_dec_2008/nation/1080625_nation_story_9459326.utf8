	Srinagar, June 24: Violent protests against allotment of forest land to the Amarnath shrine board have claimed a life and spread outside Srinagar.        
	Protesters clashed with police at a dozen places in adjoining Ganderbal district after news came in that Feroz Ahmad Rah, one of three persons injured when the Central Reserve Police Force fired on a mob in Srinagar last evening, had died of his wounds. People also set ablaze a CRPF post at Bohri Kadal and hurled stones at securitymen. Thousands joined Rahs funeral early today.        
	On the eve of N.N. Vohra taking over as governor, schools, shops and businesses remained closed in Srinagar and traffic was largely off the roads. The governor heads the shrine board and Vohras predecessor, S.K. Sinha, had secured the allotment of 40 hectares of forest land to build camps at Baltal and Domail in central Kashmir for pilgrims.         
	The Baltal route, discovered in the 1990s, is being increasingly preferred by pilgrims as the return journey from the Amarnath cave shrine, a trek of 13km each way, can be completed in a day. The traditional route from Pahalgam, a trek of 44.8km each way, needs at least four days.        
	Leaders of the Hurriyat Conference, including hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, have been put under house arrest to prevent them from participating in the protests.

	Bhopal, Sept. 11 (PTI): Wrestler Sushil Kumar won a bronze in Beijing and was feted by the President, but Neelesh Malviya is behind bars for netting nine golds in Bhopal.        
	Malviya, 21, a national-level wrestler, and six others have been arrested for chain-snatching, police said today.        
	Nine stolen gold chains have been recovered and the gang is suspected to be involved in 50 incidents of robbery, the police added.         
	The head of the gang is a wrestler, Neelesh Malviya, who has won a silver medal at the national-level championship and took up crime to support his lavish lifestyle, said inspector-general (Bhopal) Shailendra Shrivastava.         
	The arrests were made yesterday.        
	Malviya gets a monthly diet allowance of Rs 800 from the department of sports and youth welfare, Shrivastava said.        
	His gang includes another sportsman: Sandeep Badodoa, 21, a judo player who has represented Madhya Pradesh.         
	The rest have been identified as Manoj, Israr, Altaf, Jacob and Sonu, the police said. The gang members had allegedly divided the areas of operation between them.         
	Sonu helped the gang dispose of the snatched chains, the police said, adding that all the recovered chains had been sold to a city jeweller.        
	The accused were arrested on the basis of sketches prepared by the police with inputs from victims at TT Nagar Stadium, additional superintendent of police Mahendra Singh Sikarwar said.         
	The police will also interrogate the jeweller who bought the snatched chains, Shrivastava said. The team that busted the racket will receive a reward of Rs 40,000.

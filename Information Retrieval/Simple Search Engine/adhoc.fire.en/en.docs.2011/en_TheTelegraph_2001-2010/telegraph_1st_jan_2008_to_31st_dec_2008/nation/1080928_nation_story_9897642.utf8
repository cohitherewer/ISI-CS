          OUR BUREAU                           The body of an alleged militant in Dhubri.   Eastern Projections                                        
	Dhubri/Guwahati, Sept. 27: A letter found on one of the seven suspected Bangladesh militants killed yesterday has revealed that the group was sent to teach India a lesson for the oppression of Muslims.        
	The army, which had gunned down the seven in Assams Dhubri district, claimed they were members of the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami who had planned a terror strike in Guwahati.        
	Army sources said the letter, in Bengali, was written by the commandant of the Harkats Kurigram district unit, whose name was not legible. It was addressed to a person named Salam. Kurigram in Bangladesh shares a border with Dhubri district.        
	The letter alleged that the condition of Muslims in India had worsened since the Babri Masjid demolition, according to the sources.         
	It said the condition of Muslims in Kashmir was going from bad to worse because of the oppression of the Indian government. We will have to teach Hindustan a lesson, and for that you are requested to send more trained and motivated persons to India, said the letter, which had no date.        
	The army said the person carrying the letter could have been the commandant and had died before he could send it.        
	An officer of the armys intelligence wing, who is examining the documents found on the slain seven, said some of them had been camping in the border villages of Dhubri for several days while the rest joined them a few days ago.         
	Bus tickets issued by Bangladesh travel agencies on September 20, 21 and 22 indicate that some of them had sneaked into Dhubri two or three days back, the officer said.         
	The seven were carrying cards issued by the Kalyan Party of Bangladesh, an indication they might have infiltrated the political party.

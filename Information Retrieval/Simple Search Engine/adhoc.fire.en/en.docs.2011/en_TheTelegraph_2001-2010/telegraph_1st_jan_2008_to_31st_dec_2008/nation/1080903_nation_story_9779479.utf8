          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kishore Mohanty                                  
	Sambalpur, Sept. 2: People extended a warm welcome to Kishore Mohanty, the newly appointed Speaker of the Assembly during his first visit to his home town in Jharsuguda today.         
	The celebrations started at Rairakhol and ended at Jharsuguda. The state highway-10 from Sambalpur to Jharsuguda wore a colourful look with people waiting on both sides of the road and welcome gates were erected almost at every 1km.        
	Both in Sambalpur and Jharsuguda, BJD supporters and common people were present in different places with mammoth welcome gates and garlands on hands to welcome their leader who is the youngest Assembly Speaker of the state and a popular political leader of this region.        
	However, most of the senior leaders of the party kept away from the procession. District president Bijay Mohanty, former president Md Mumtaz, HMS leader Gokul Meher and other leaders were present near the Jailkhana Chowk and they remained unseen there after. We got disheartened at the presence of a tainted and suspended leader of BJD remaining at the forefront during the welcome ceremony, a senior leader alleged.         
	Kishore also visited Ma Samaleswari Temple to have her blessings and there after went to MCL headquarters. In Jharsuguda, his place of birth, people cutting across party lines, praised Kishore for striding over a political career of student leader, then councillor and presently to the post of the Speaker.         
	Kishore said that he shouldered a big responsibility now as the Speaker. But I will never fail to serve the people my own place and reach up to their expectations, he added.

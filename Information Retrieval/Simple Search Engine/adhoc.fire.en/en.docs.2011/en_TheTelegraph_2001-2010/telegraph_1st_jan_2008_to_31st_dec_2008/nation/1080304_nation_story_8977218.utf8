	New Delhi, March 3: Renuka Chowdhury plans to transform Indias centuries-old symbol of perceived feminine weakness, the bangle, into a sign of womens empowerment for at least a few hours. 
    
	The women and child development minister has supervised the crafting of special empowerment bangles, which will be distributed to women at malls, hospitals and other public places for two weeks this month. 
    
	The bangles are part of the governments celebrations in the days leading up to International Womens Day  March 8  which were announced today by Chowdhury. 
    
	When men are challenged, they retort humne chudiya nahi pehni hai (we arent wearing bangles). It is a reference to the weakness they associate with women. Its time to change that mindset. We will wear these bangles, and men can try and take us on, Chowdhury said today. 
    
	The ministry is also planning to write to state governments to emphasise the need for compulsory self-defence classes for girls in school, Chowdhury said. 
    
	The minister unveiled a campaign where messages on the rights of women and girls will be showcased across the country for a month. 
    
	As The Telegraph reported yesterday, the campaign will try to tap the sensibilities of girls parents and families, while also warning law-breakers of the consequences. 
    
	Starting today, all railway tickets across India will carry these messages on the reverse this month. 
    
	Research across India has shown that people retain their tickets for at least two days. We are hoping that during the long train rides, when people are relatively free, they will discuss what they see at the back of the ticket, she said. 
    
	The ministry has also launched a conditional cash transfer scheme  titled Dhanalakshmi  which will offer parents money to immunise and educate daughters and ensure they get married only after they turn 18. 
    
	The scheme, which has been in the pipeline for several months, will be first implemented as a pilot project in 11 blocks in seven states  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa. 
    
	ITC Welcomgroup Hotels has agreed to train destitute women in housekeeping, Chowdhury announced. 
    
	In a year, 350 women from our destitute homes will be trained at the ITC hotels. The programme will be run across 10 hotels, Ashok Bhalla, the vice-president of ITCs training programme, said. 
    
	Vandana Luthra Curls and Curves (VLCC), a chain of fitness centres, will hold special health camps under the aegis of the ministry, Chowdhury said.

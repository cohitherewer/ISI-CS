	New Delhi, Nov. 11 (PTI): The government has put on hold the decision to curb benefits under the Employees Provident Fund pension scheme, bowing to pressure from unions.        
	At a meeting of the central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, all employees unions opposed the governments decision to reduce the benefits.        
	The government had earlier decided on the curbs to plug a feared deficit of Rs 42,000 crore in the pension fund.        
	Currently, we have convinced the government to put the implementation of the notification on hold with immediate effect, said W.R. Varadarajan, a board member representing Citu.        
	Had the notification been enforced, the part-encashment of pension would have been affected. It would also have limited the number of years for drawing pension and raised the rate of deduction in the event of early retirement.        
	Labour minister Oscar Fernandes said that as the chairman of the board, he would take a decision later on rescinding the order.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 26: The instant justice spree continued in Bihar as a Dalit man was beaten to death in small hours on Tuesday in Chapra.        
	Bharat Dom (45), a resident of Daulatganj under Bhagwan Bazaar police station under Chapra, around 100km from here, was caught while he was allegedly trying to steal a cow and a calf from his neighbourhood on Tuesday around 1.30am. Two other men were with Bharat.        
	Police said a neighbour woke up while the cow and the calf were being taken away and alerted the owner of the animals. Within half an hour around 100 people gathered at the spot and started beating up Bharat. His two accomplices, however, managed to escape.         
	People thrashed Bharat with sticks and rained blows on his face. The victim fell unconscious and was taken to Sadar hospital at Chapra, where he succumbed to injuries this morning.        
	The officer in charge of Bhagwan Bazaar police station, Sudhir Kumar Chaturvedi, told The Telegraph: The victim died of beating. The family and friends of the deceased have lodged a complaint but there seems to be no resentment as the man had criminal antecedents.        
	Chaturvedi added that as the incident took place around midnight, the police could not intervene in time to save the victim. Before Bharat could be given proper treatment, it was too late, he said. He said a murder case had been registered against unknown persons. No arrest has been made so far. The officer conceded it was tough to identify culprits in case of mob justice.        
	The Chapra case follows the suspected lynching of an elderly man from a Munger village. The old man was attacked by a mob after he intervened to save his grandson in a dispute over a love affair.

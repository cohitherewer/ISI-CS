          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, Dec. 28: Wagon breakers, and not terrorists, could be responsible for the loot and transportation of artillery shells, belonging to the Indian Army, that were accidentally found by the state police yesterday in a goods train and at a station.         
	Panic prevailed in the morning yesterday after the police recovered 14 live artillery shells  12 from an iron ore-laden goods train near Monnet Steel and Energy Limited (MSEL) railway siding in Mandir Hasud and two from a small railway station, Mandhar.         
	The shells recovered were 105mm ammunition used in medium-range projectile rockets with a firing range of 18km.        
	Investigating officers have received clues that thieves, and not terrorists or rebels, were behind the loot, a senior officer told The Telegraph.         
	He added that the incident has brought to the forth the gross negligence committed by police and railway officers.        
	According to sources, wagon breakers off loaded seven boxes containing army shells when a goods train stopped at Mandhar station  a smallish stop with nominal passenger movement  late on Friday night.        
	The train was carrying arms and ammunition for Indian Army from Badmal Ordnance Factory in Bolangir (Orissa) and was on its way to Central Ammunition Depot in Pulgaon of Wardha (Maharashtra).         
	The theft occurred when the train stopped at the signal for 20 minutes. Taking advantage of the prevailing darkness, thieves unloaded the boxes.        
	When they opened it, they saw ammunition and immediately loaded it on another goods train that halted at the station an hour later, the officer said.         
	The goods train was laden with iron ore and was on way to the Monnet plant.         
	However, in a huff, they left one box in the station that police later recovered. The remaining six were recovered when the ore was unloaded at the plant site in the morning.         
	The exact number of ammunition looted could not be established. However, army officials in Phulgaon are trying to ascertain the correct amount.         
	Senior army officials are also landing here to probe serious negligence of railway authorities as trains carrying ammunition are not stopped at outer signals or at deserted places.         
	But, railway authorities stopped the train for 20 minutes in Mandhar  a relatively deserted station, an officer said.         
	Railway officials, however, said two RPF personnel were guarding the train.         
	However, despite all security the broken seal of the rake was visible to the authorities only after the train had rolled some 100km from the spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yuppies wake up to need for union
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuppies wake up to need for union
          ANANYA SENGUPTA AND CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: To young, upwardly mobile Rumela Chakraborty and Spandan Sharma, union was merely the word that followed uninviting in the dictionary.        
	Till yesterday, that is, when the two Jet Airways probationers were laid off with 1,900 others and suddenly realised there was no one to speak for them. I now understand how important it is to have a union for cabin crew. I shall certainly be a member of a trade union in my next job, Spandan (name changed) said.        
	Spandan today shouted slogans outside the Mumbai Jet office with scores of others, led by the trade union body of Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). In Calcutta, Rumela joined a protest organised at the airport by CPM labour arm Citu.        
	Yesterday, when the Spandans and Rumelas were feeling helpless, Citu and the MNS had taken up their cause and called for all Jet flights to be grounded till the sack orders were revoked.         
	Spandans colleague Gunjan (name changed), a confirmed Jet employee unaffected by the lay-offs, said: Im in favour of a union. Efforts are being made to form one.        
	Shivendra Singh Panwar of Delhi, who works for a property dealer, another sector that lacks unions, agreed.        
	You are secure if you are part of a union, you know there is somebody to interface between you and the company bosses. You cant be laid off arbitrarily, he said. With huge cost-cuttings in all sectors, we are as vulnerable as the rest. Individuals cant fight the system, a union can.        
	The trade unions  repeatedly spurned by uninterested workers of the high-paying aviation, IT and BPO sectors  had a told-you-so air as they looked to cash in on the changed mood.        
	They are paying the price for refusing to form unions. BPO employees were under the illusion they werent like ordinary workers, said Gurudas Dasgupta of CPI labour arm Aituc.        
	Union leaders said they were especially eyeing the IT-BPO sector, which contributes over 4.5 per cent of the countrys economic output but is witnessing a slump. Many IT and call-centre workers said the Jet sackings had scared them.        
	Till six months ago, I didnt see any reason to be part of a union. But times have changed. I can be laid off without a notice its now necessary to have unions, a BPO employee at Gurgaon said.        
	The Left had eight years ago tried to form a union of software programmers in Bangalore but was rebuffed. A few small, state-level, apolitical organisations for IT professionals now exist in Andhra and Karnataka.        
	One is the IT Professionals Forum that has around 1,000 members and is affiliated to the Union Network International, a global alliance of 900 unions. Left leaders want to turn these bodies into a politically empowered union.        
	Under the law, no employer can prevent or threaten staff against forming a union. Ten per cent of an establishments employees  or 100 workers, whichever is less  are enough to form a union.        
	But IT and aviation workers say they dont want a traditionalist union that calls strikes at the drop of a hat. They know that if unions speak up for sacked workers, their militancy can also cause job loss by forcing factories to close down, as in Bengal.        
	We need a union that will not blindly oppose the management but try to solve problems through talks, said Vijay Rane, a former BPO employee in Bangalore.        
	Rumela too cant shed her allergy to politics so easily. I came to the Citu office only to get my job back. I dont want to take part in any political activity in the future.                    WITH INPUTS FROM SATISH NANDGAONKAR AND SANJAY MANDAL

	New York, July 13 (PTI): An Indian-American couple found guilty of enslaving two Indonesian maids were ordered to pay nearly $1 million as back wages by a US court.        
	The court has said that the housekeepers were entitled to double the unpaid wages that their millionaire employers, Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani, owed them.        
	Samirah and Enung deserved the money because they were beaten, tortured and subjected against their will as they worked 24 hours a day and seven days a week for the Sabhnanis, the court ruled.        
	Samirah, who worked at the Sabhnani home from February 2002 to May 2007, was awarded $620,744 and Enung, who worked from January 2005 to May 2007, $315,802.        
	The women had testified in court that they were beaten with brooms and umbrellas, slashed with knives and forced to take cold-water showers for their mistakes.

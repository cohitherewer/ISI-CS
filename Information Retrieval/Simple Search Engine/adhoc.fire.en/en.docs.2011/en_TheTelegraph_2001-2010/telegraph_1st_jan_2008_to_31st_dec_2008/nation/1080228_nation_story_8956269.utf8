          SANTOSH SINGH                          Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi                                  
	Patna, Feb. 27: A gender budget and laptops for all 243 legislators  Bihar chief minister would be sugar coating this years budget to suit all tastes.         
	Deputy chief minister and finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi managed to stump every one present at the post-budget media conference by saying that the government would present a separate gender budget  focusing only on welfare schemes for women  at the end of the ongoing session. As the deputy chief minister proudly pointed out, Bihar would be the first state to take this initiative.         
	Senior government officials later agreed that it was a nice way of presenting and packaging things.        
	An official, on condition of anonymity, said: After hogging the limelight for giving 50 per cent reservation to women in panchayat elections, the government probably wanted to draw more attention. Thus exclusive welfare schemes such as bicycles and uniforms for schoolgirls and marriage grants for girls have been lined up. RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak called it all denting and painting to hide failures in the fiscal management.        
	Nitish government had showed a glimpse of his corporate packaging skills with the publication of a report card  two years of development with justice  with two footprints on the cover suggesting progress.        
	The governments another corporate-culture move is to make eight departments paperless in two months time.         
	Modi said: A minister can now make queries, suggestions and even dispose files in principle through mails.         
	The decision to give laptops to all MLAs, though planned a year ago, is also being taken as a smart move to give an e-savvy image to legislators, many of whom are still not conversant with computers.        
	A senior bureaucrat conceded that there was nothing wrong with the move. He hoped that the expensive step delivered results.

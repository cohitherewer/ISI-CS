	Gaya, Nov. 11: The fate of more than 30,000 Part-III examinees of Magadh University from seven districts, including Patna, Nalanda and Gaya, hangs in balance as the results have not been published even six months after the examinations due to technical snag.        
	The universitys public relations officer Shamsul Islam attributed the delay to technical snag. The exam was held in May. According to the norms, the upper limit for publication of results is 40 days after examinations.        
	Admission to all the universities is closed now. Where will I go now? said Manish, one of the examinees.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A police vehicle set ablaze by protesting students in Motihari on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Oct. 23: Protests against Raj Thackeray singed Bihar for the fourth day today, prompting chief minister Nitish Kumar to urge Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene to ensure the rule of law in Maharashtra.        
	Students protesting the alleged killing of Pawan Mahto by activists of Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in Mumbai marched through the streets and clashed with police in Biharsharief. The town is the headquarters of the slain 25-year-olds home district, Nalanda, which today observed a bandh against his murder.        
	The protesters clashed with personnel and damaged our vehicles, forcing us to use batons. Some protesters suffered minor injuries, said Nalanda police chief Vinit Vinayak.        
	Student organisations have called a Bihar bandh on October 25 demanding murder and sedition cases be registered against Raj and his party activists.        
	Nitish appeared to blame the backlash on the Maharashtra governments initial failure to act against the Mumbai mobs that beat up railway board examinees from Bihar on Sunday.        
	Had appropriate action been taken against the lawbreakers in Mumbai, the situation would not have turned ugly in Bihar, Nitish wrote to the Prime Minister after reviewing the agitation at an all-party meeting. You should ensure (that) people from other parts of the country move freely and safely in Maharashtra.        
	The chief minister, however, warned the protesters against taking the law into their own hands, saying those taking part in violence would not be spared. Madness cannot be allowed to be used against madness.        
	The railways continued to bear the brunt, with hundreds of protesters setting fire to Motihari station in north Bihar and smashing the doors and windowpanes of ticket counters. A police jeep outside the station was torched, Motihari police chief N.H. Khan said.        
	Eateries and kiosks were damaged too, as was a fire tender that had come to put out the station blaze, prompting police to baton-charge the mob. The situation is under control now. The CRPF has been called and is camping at the station, Khan said.        
	The police also battled rampaging mobs in Gaya, Sasaram and Ara. Officials at the police headquarters in Patna said over 50 protesters were arrested across the state.        
	A rail blockade left thousands of passengers stranded days before Diwali, with more than 25 trains cancelled or rescheduled.         
	The protests disrupted train services from Calcutta and Guwahati, where railway authorities suspended several trains that pass through Bihar.

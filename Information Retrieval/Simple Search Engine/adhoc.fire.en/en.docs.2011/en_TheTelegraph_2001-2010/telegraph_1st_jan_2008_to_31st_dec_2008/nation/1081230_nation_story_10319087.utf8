	New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI): The Union home ministry today assured coastal states it would provide them help to secure the sea front and asked the shipping ministry to bring out a plan in 10 days for registering boats and issuing identity cards to fishermen.        
	At a meeting chaired by Jarnail Singh, the secretary (border management), and attended by representatives of the nine coastal states and four Union territories, the home ministry said adequate funds would be provided to procure high-speed vessels and naval equipment.        
	We have asked the shipping ministry to submit a proposal within seven to 10 days on how to have all fishing boats registered with the police department, to maintain a list of their owners and issue identity cards to fishermen operating in the high seas, a home ministry official said.        
	All coastal states and Union territories have different policies for registration of boats. But after the Mumbai attack, in which 10 terrorists took the sea route to enter the city, the ministry felt there was a need for uniform rules.        
	Bengal and some other coastal states had sought the Centres help for setting up coastal police stations and strengthening the marine wing of state police, sources said.         
	The Centre had also emphasised the speedy implementation of a coastal security plan that was formulated in 2005-06.        
	Over two years ago, the home ministry sanctioned the setting up of 73 police stations in the nine states and four Union territories under the plan. Permission had also been granted for 97 check posts, 58 outposts and 30 barracks.        
	However, the sources said coastal police stations were still being equipped.         
	Over 200 boats, 153 jeeps and 312 motorcycles were being procured for patrolling and operations.        
	The scheme is being implemented jointly by the Union home ministry and the defence ministry.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: The issue of farmers suicides rocked the Assembly today after the Opposition accused the BJD-BJP government of apathy.        
	Angry members went to the extent of calling the government and chief minister enemies of the farmers and a peasant killer. Here is a government that talks of mineral-based industries, but shamelessly ignores farmers, said senior Congress member Jaydev Jena while moving an adjournment motion.         
	If the government is indeed concerned about farmers, it should announce a waiver of arrears in agricultural loans, said the members. They staged a walkout when the government did not agree to the demand.         
	Jena reminded members of Pramod Sahu of Bargarh, who was forced to take his life, as he failed to repay a loan.        
	Instead of admitting its failure, the state is saying that the reason behind the suicides is not financial, said the Opposition and demanded a House committee to probe into the matter. Refuting all allegations, agriculture minister Surendra Nath Naik said the state has been protecting farmers interests.         
	Co-operative lending institutions were providing loans at an interest rate of 7 per cent, he added.         
	Minister of state for co-operatives Surama Padhy also denied charges and stressed that co-operatives were not adopting coercive measures. She said the state had re-phased loans in arrears or in distress and was adopting persuasive methods for recovery.        
	She assured punishment to any official found to have adopted coercive methods.

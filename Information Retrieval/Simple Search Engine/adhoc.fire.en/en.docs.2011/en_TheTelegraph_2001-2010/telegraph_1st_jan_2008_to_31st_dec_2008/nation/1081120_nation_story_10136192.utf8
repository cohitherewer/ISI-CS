                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indira peace prize after nuclear deal push

	New Delhi, Nov. 19: Mohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has been selected for the Indira Gandhi prize for peace, disarmament and development by an international jury chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	The prize is awarded every year on Indira Gandhis birth anniversary by an eponymous memorial trust headed by Sonia Gandhi.        
	A release issued by Suman Dubey, the secretary of the trust, commended ElBaradei (in picture) for being outspoken on nuclear proliferation and international security issues.         
	It also said he had carved out an independent approach free from bias for the IAEA and helped it reflect a wider balanced perspective in tune with todays world.        
	ElBaradeis role in pushing the Indo-US nuclear deal through a procedural maze was critical, especially as the process had to be completed within a tight deadline before it was voted in the US Congress.         
	He backed the India-specific safeguards agreement after which it was put up before the board of governors for its approval and ensured it sailed smoothly. I believe this agreement is good for India and good for the world and for non-proliferation, ElBaradei was quoted as saying.         
	Dubeys citation says how ElBaradei had consistently argued that nuclear weapon states should move away from reliance on nuclear weapons and advocated a collective, rule-based system of international security.         
	His contributions thus straddle peace, disarmament and development, causes for which Indira Gandhi strove assiduously during her lifetime, he said.        
	Congress sources said the main reason for selecting ElBaradei was to signal to Egypt  the country of his origin  that India was still faithful to the letter and spirit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), founded by Jawaharlal Nehru and carried forward by Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.         
	They admitted there was a perception that the UPA governments single-minded focus on the nuclear deal had reduced NAM to a dead letter. We want to correct this perception, a source said.

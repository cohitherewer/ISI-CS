          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Water woes                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 14: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India came down heavily on the Orissa government for the tardy progress of the irrigation projects taken up with Nabard assistance.        
	Against a target of completing five-medium and 143 minor irrigation projects (MIP) between March 2002 and2007, the water resources department could complete only one medium and 19 MIPs within the stipulated period, stated the report.        
	Nabard had sanctioned a loan of Rs 747.40 crore between 1995-96 and 2004-05 under the rural infrastructure development funds scheme for taking up 48 medium irrigation projects, including 10 new schemes involving a cost of Rs 496.01 crore, and 215 MIPs, including 121 new projects at an estimated cost of Rs 251.39 crore.        
	The performance audit carried out between November 2006 and May 2007 covering the period from 2002 to 2007 revealed that only one medium and 19 MIPs were completed within that time.        
	Out of the approved amount of Rs 291.42 crore for five medium irrigation projects, Rs 204.82 crore could be spent by March 2007 and one project was completed, while the rest four remained incomplete till May 2007.        
	Similarly, out of 161 MIPs, 18 were abandoned and 19 of the rest (143) were completed within the stipulated time. Other 52 projects were completed with a delay ranging between two and five years.        
	Non-completion of 23 minor irrigation projects due to non-acquisition of private and forest land led to an unproductive expenditure of Rs 64.54 crore.        
	There was a cost escalation of Rs 58.31 crore for four medium and 10 minor irrigation projects due to delay in execution because of faulty project estimates, improper planning, execution of projects without obtaining forest clearance or land acquisition and inadequate monitoring of projects.        
	It was also found that the water resources department was able to avail only 54 per cent of Rs 434.03 crore loan from Nabard due to slow progress in project progress.

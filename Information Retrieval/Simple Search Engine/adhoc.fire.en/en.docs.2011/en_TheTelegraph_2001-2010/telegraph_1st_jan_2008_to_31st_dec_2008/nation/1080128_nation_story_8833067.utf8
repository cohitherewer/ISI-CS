The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tell-all threat to Centre 
                                                                                                            Tell-all threat to Centre 
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Taslima Nasreen                                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The government may have to turn book reviewer to decide if Taslima Nasreen should be thrown out before August.        
	The Bangladeshi author has been told her six-month visa extension till August 17 was subject to a periodic review, implying it could be cancelled if she stepped out of line.        
	But a pugnacious Taslima has fought back, threatening to write a book on how she was being treated during her house arrest in India. Now its eyeball to eyeball, each waiting for the other to blink first.        
	The government, which extended Taslimas visa last week, has not assured her about a return to Calcutta, which she desperately wants.         
	This means the author must continue to live in her Delhi safe house under the current conditions of secrecy and anonymity, with severe restrictions on her movement.        
	The periodic review rider is clearly a threat to force her to keep quiet and not talk to the media. The government appears to be hoping that Taslima, who had applied for a permanent resident permit, would be so fed up with these stifling measures that she might decide to leave.        
	Taslima, however, has made it clear she will not be cowed easily. Last week, she threw a challenge to a visiting team of officials from the home and foreign ministries.        
	She said she would wait and see how long the government could keep her in this condition. She wanted to see if the government had the guts not to extend her visa and throw her out of the country, an official said.         
	She said she would write a book on the way she was being treated and made to lead a lonely existence without any friends.        
	Sources said the author was extremely unhappy about not being allowed to receive the Simone de Beauvoir award from French President Nicolas Sarkozy during his visit to India. The French have invited her to receive the award in Paris, but Taslima does not want to leave India now.        
	However, the news that her visa had been extended  it was to expire on February 17  brought a smile to her face, the official said.        
	The home ministry took the decision after discussions with the foreign ministry.        
	Lots of issues were discussed. The Centre could not be seen to be bowing to the wishes of a community that is set firmly against a lone woman, as Taslima has been portraying herself, the official said.        
	Besides, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had made a statement that guests are never turned away from India.

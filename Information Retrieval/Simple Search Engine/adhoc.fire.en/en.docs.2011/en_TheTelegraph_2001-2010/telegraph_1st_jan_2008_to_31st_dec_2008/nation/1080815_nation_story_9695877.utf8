	Mumbai, Aug. 14: Jade Goody is set to cross paths with Shilpa Shetty again, this time in India on Bigg Boss-Season 2.         
	The 27-year-old who grabbed headlines last summer with her racist barbs against Shilpa on UKs Celebrity Big Brother is to fly in here around Thursday-Friday midnight, said sources in Colors, the channel that will run Bigg Boss 2. She will probably go straight to the Bigg Boss house if the meeting (with the producers) is a success. The show starts from August 15, a source said.        
	Goody, who has made a career out of reality shows, has been offered nearly 1,00,000 (around Rs 80 lakh), all expenses included, for the two-week programme, the source said. She will be here for a last-minute meeting before signing on the dotted line.        
	The TV fortunes of Goody, a mother of two, have sagged, partly because of the outrage that had led to her being voted out of Celebrity Big Brother.         
	If channel insiders are to be believed, she will come prepared. She knows she may face a hostile audience and inmates but she feels it is worth the effort, the source said.        
	It isnt only her racist abuses that could haunt her on the show. Her apparent ignorance could also earn her plenty of jibes. On the UK show, she had shocked many by saying that Cambridge is in London.

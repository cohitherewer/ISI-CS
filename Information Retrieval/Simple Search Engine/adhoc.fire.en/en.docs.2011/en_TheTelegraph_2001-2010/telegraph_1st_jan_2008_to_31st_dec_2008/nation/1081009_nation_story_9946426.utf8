The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Garba feels market pinch 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Garba feels market pinch 
  - Shortage of sponsors as companies tighten purse strings        BASANT RAWAT                                           
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 8: What terror could not do, the markets have.         
	Revellers have overcome fear  and the stifling security  to celebrate Navratri, but organisers of Gujarats famed Dandiya-Garba shows have felt the pinch because of the financial uncertainty.        
	Many companies have withdrawn their sponsorship, something that did not happen even during the post-Godhra riots, said Himanshu Shah, head of SOI Entertainment, an event management company that has been organising Garba for the last 11 years and was the first in the state to corporatise the event.        
	The culprit is the recession, not the bomb scare, said Shah, who had just two sponsors this time against six major ones until last year. The situation, he added, was not this bad even during the post-Godhra riots and immediately after the Akshardham attack of 2003.        
	Adding to the concern is heightened security, which has pushed up costs. Most organisers have had to put in place costly security measures like CCTVs and sniffer dogs, steps seen as confidence-building measures to lure the people, the memory of the July 26 serial blasts that killed 59 still fresh in their minds.         
	Telecom companies used to be among the biggest sponsors and until last year, BSNL used to spend around Rs 70 lakh. But this year, it has withdrawn completely.         
	A senior official in BSNLs marketing division said the company had reduced its advertising budget. As a result, we are not sponsoring Garba this year. One reason is that we have not been getting a good response or any benefit out of sponsoring Garba.         
	No one was willing to let out the figures, but sources said a big Garba event costs between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, which ticket sales couldnt recover.        
	Shah pointed out that crowds could be deceptive as not all bought tickets, priced at Rs 100. Our event is usually packed, but in reality, only about 10 per cent of the people have bought tickets. Many get complimentary passes from the sponsors.         
	Shah said at least 35 per cent of the tickets should be sold, which is rare. Most organisers depend on corporate sponsorship, reduced to a trickle now.        
	Nirmal Kumar, an IIM-A graduate who runs an advertising firm in Ahmedabad, said the market slowdown had hit organisers hard.         
	Other than recession, I do not see any reason why telecom and other companies are not sponsoring Garba this year, especially when there is good visibility, and people take part with enthusiasm. It remains a good event to sponsor and advertise in, he said.        
	A marketing executive of an FMCG company pointed out many companies had preferred to tighten their belts after the market meltdown in the US, which has had a ripple effect on Indian bourses. Therefore, many companies have opted to stay away, he said.        
	Girish Dani, president of Karnavati Club, which can accommodate around 10,000 on its sprawling grounds, claimed after a lacklustre opening, ticket sales had gone up.         
	This year, we have not got sponsors as expected, he said, claiming that the club would still make a profit because it didnt have to incur extra expenditure for security.        
	Deval Modi, a Garba organiser at Aman Party plot in Paldi, is not as lucky as he has had to hire sniffer dogs and private security staff from Mumbai. I am staring at huge losses, he said.         
	Spoiling the party of many private players is Vibrant Gujarat Navratri, a Garba organised by the government at the Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation grounds, spread over eight lakh square feet. This event, to which entry is free, is sponsored by big guns such as Reliance, Essar and Torrent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Bands versus discs in slug fest    
	Live band operators are locked in a bitter war of words with those who run discotheques.     
	While both are illegal as the Karnataka police and excise departments have invoked archaic laws that lay down that dancing cannot be held where liquor is served, several discos continue to thrive on the outskirts of the city.     
	While live band operators are upset that police have cancelled their licences for over three years now, they allege that the discotheques are flourishing under official patronage.     
	To get even, they have threatened to send eunuchs to discos and put the law to test. But police know that discos are where youngsters let their hair down, while prostitution thrives under the guise of live bands where women dance as raucous men applaud and throw money around.     
	But police cannot clearly take sides as the law puts it plainly that dancing cannot go hand in hand with liquor.     
	The only solution, it appears, is for the lawmakers to clearly define the entertainment before the eunuchs spoil the party          
	Metro tips for Kochi plan  
	Delhi Metro added another feather to its cap when it was recently asked to carry out a survey on extending the Kochi project.    
	The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which changed the face of the capital in the past few years, is being increasingly asked to study plans for similar projects in other cities.    
	In Kochi, for instance, the plan is to extend the Metro corridor from Aluva, in the town, to the Nedumbassery international airport, over 60km away.    
	DMRC officials will submit the findings to the authorities in the Kerala government, who will then study the technical and financial feasibility of the project.     
	Initial indications suggest that the metro extension could be carried out in two phases, the first of which could be a 25km stretch.      
	Games guides  
	The foot soldiers of the 2010 Commonwealth Games have been spotted.    
	Civic authorities, who have to shoulder much of the responsibility for the sporting spectacle, have decided that youths will act as guides to help visitors and athletes.    
	The civic body (MCD) is forming core groups of youths. The plan is to involve Delhi youths in monitoring services like sanitation, horticulture, street lights, repair and cleanliness of roads, corporation standing committee chairman Vijender Gupta said .    
	Kicking off the initiative, the civic body will sign an agreement to rope in students of Shahid Sukhdev College as volunteers who will monitor basic services during the Games. Later, Gupta said, more colleges will join the fold.    
	The youths will also organise street plays, cultural events based on folk themes, entertainment programmes and other interactive sessions to showcase Indian culture to the large number of foreign visitors and athletes..          
	Jobless jitters  
	Unemployment doles are piling up in Tamil Nadu.    
	A sum of Rs 78 crore has been paid to over 3.53 lakh educated youths registered with employment exchanges since the DMK regime assumed power 20 months back.    
	The figures have alarmed authorities who believe this the apparent job crunch has come at a time when the Centre is pushing rural employment plans and trumpeting the 9 per cent growth.    
	The M. Karunanidhi regime is worried not only about the impact of the bloating compensation bill on finances but is also counting the political costs.

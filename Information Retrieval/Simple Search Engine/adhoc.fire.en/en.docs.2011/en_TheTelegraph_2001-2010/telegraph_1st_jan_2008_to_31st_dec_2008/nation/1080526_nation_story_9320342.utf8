	New Delhi, May 25: The Congress is worried that the BJPs Karnataka victory reflects successful social engineering  a way of widening a partys vote bank by stitching together a rainbow coalition of disparate and competing groups.        
	The BJP straddled the urban-rural divide, thanks to a campaign that played up B.S. Yeddyurappas pro-farmer image while the partys Bangalore MPs, notably Ananth Kumar, worked on city voters.        
	The Congress is also concerned by feedback that the BJP successfully reached out beyond Yeddyurappas Lingayat constituency. In bits and pieces, it secured votes from almost all other castes, including the Vokkaligas who are considered a Janata Dal (Secular) vote bank.        
	This is where we were caught napping, a Congress general secretary said. We thought there would be a reverse consolidation against the Lingayats in the second and third phases (of the polls). That did not happen.        
	To muddle the Vokkaliga vote  which is a sizeable 15 per cent, 2 per cent less than the Lingayat vote  the BJP gave tickets to some Vokkaliga leaders who had been dropped by the Congress.        
	These leaders may not have had state-wide influence but carried weight in the Vokkaliga-dominated old Mysore region. The turncoat tag couldnt stop most of them from winning.        
	In contrast, the Congresss attempt to dent the BJPs Lingayat vote by fielding M.P. Prakash, a JD(S) reject, came a cropper. Prakash couldnt win his own seat, let alone helping the party in other places.        
	The Congress had vested huge hopes in another JD(S) acquisition, Siddaramaiah, a leader of the Kurubas, a caste of shepherds whose votes count in south and north Karnataka. His perceived ability to deliver his castes votes was compared with Mayavatis grip over Dalits.        
	Sources said Siddaramaiah partially met their expectations. He gave the Congress a handy lead over the BJP and the JD(S) in south Karnataka (the old Mysore region) and was adequate in northeast Karnataka.        
	But he failed in northwest Karnataka, where the BJPs skillful selection of candidates from across the social spectrum, including the Kurubas, set up a saffron sweep.        
	The failure of S. Bangarappa and his warring sons to win a single seat suggests that the votes of their Iddiga caste (toddy tappers) went lock, stock and barrel to the BJP in the Shimoga and Chikmagalur regions.        
	The Congress had rejoiced at Bangarappas exit from the BJP, believing he had given his former party a cutting edge in central Karnataka in 2004. This time, the BJP would suffer, Congress sources had said.        
	However, by picking individually powerful Iddiga candidates, the BJP did not just retain its base but expanded it.        
	For the Congress, the biggest shock was the BJP winning most of the Scheduled Caste seats. Had the BJP regrouped the anti-Dalit votes that outnumber Dalit votes in most reserved constituencies? Or did the Congresss failure to project a Dalit leader turn off SC voters?        
	Sources said the Congress would analyse this. The party would also look at the BSP factor. Mayavatis party drew a blank but may have cut into the Congresss Dalit votes.

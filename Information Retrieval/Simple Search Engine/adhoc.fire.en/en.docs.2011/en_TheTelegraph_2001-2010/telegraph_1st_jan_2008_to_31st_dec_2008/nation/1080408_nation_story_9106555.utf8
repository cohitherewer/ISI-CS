          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Patna, April 7: Avenging the alleged rape bid on his mother, a labourer killed a 48-year-old man this morning at Motijhil under Town police station of Muzaffarpur, around 70km from here.        
	According to police, the incident took place around 10.30am today when the labourer, Krishna Nandan, and his friend Nazirentered the single-storey residence of the victim, Subir Kumar Banerjee, and slit his throat with a sharp knife.        
	Banerjee worked as a private munshi at the Muzaffarpur court. He was a bachelor with no immediate family and owned the house where he stayed. He had rented out some rooms of his house to shopkeepers.        
	The police, who have arrested Krishna Nandan and Nazir, both in their twenties, said Krishna Nandan believed that Banerjee tried to rape his 45-year-old mother, who was previously employed at the Motijhil residence as a domestic help, three months ago.         
	No rape case, however, was registered with the police at that time.         
	Krishna Nandans mother reportedly had quit her job soon after the alleged rape bid.         
	Muzaffarpur additional superintendent of police Chhatranil Singh told The Telegraph: It seems that the two youths had planned this for sometime.         
	As Banerjees home was 300 yards from the police station, the force reached the murder site and arrested the accused before they could flee. When we arrived we found Banerjee dead with his throat slit, said Singh, ruling out the possibility of a property dispute, as was alleged by the local Bengali association.        
	Krishna, who works as a daily wager, confessed to his crime before the police and stressed that he had no regrets.         
	A case of murder has been registered against Krishna Nandan and Nazir at Town police station.

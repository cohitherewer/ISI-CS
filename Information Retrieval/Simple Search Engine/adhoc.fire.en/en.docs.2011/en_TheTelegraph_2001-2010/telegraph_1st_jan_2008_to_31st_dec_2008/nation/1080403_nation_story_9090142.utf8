The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Call to retain CPM elders in politburo
                                                                                                               Call to retain CPM elders in politburo
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Coimbatore, April 2: The outgoing CPM politburo feels that patriarch Jyoti Basus presence is still required in the partys most powerful policy-making body.        
	The inclusion of Nirupam Sen, the Bengal industries minister, and Mohammad Amin, the Citu general secretary and former Bengal labour minister, in the politburo is more or less certain.        
	While Amin is expected to take the slot of Chittabrata Muzumder, Sens emergence as the chief ideologue of industrialisation in Bengal seems to have ensured his berth.        
	If more than two leaders from Bengal are inducted, state secretariat member Shyamal Chakrabortys inclusion is on the cards. Subhas Chakraborty may be accommodated in the central committee, which is less powerful than the state secretariat.        
	Although Basu has expressed his desire to step down from the politburo, the CPM leadership is not likely to clear his retirement.         
	Despite his advanced age, he is still active and we value his intervention in policy matters, particularly when we are locked in a stand-off with the Congress-led UPA government on the nuclear deal. He is still our tallest leader and considered an umpire in inner-party problems, a Bengal central committee member said.        
	At its last congress, the CPM had decided to retain both Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the two remaining members of the first politburo of the party after it split from the CPI in 1964.        
	The last congress had described them as living legends and wanted them to continue in the politburo as long as they are alive, the Bengal leader said.        
	Since Surjeet is ill, it was thought he would be dropped. But both are likely to be retained as the symbols of continuity of the partys history.        
	Party insiders recalled that E.M.S. Namboodiripad, the chief minister of the first communist government in Kerala and the former general secretary of the party, had died as member of the party politburo despite his inability to attend meetings regularly in Delhi.        
	A proposal was floated to retain both Basu and Surjeet as special or permanent invitees to the politburo. But opinion was divided on whether the party constitution needed an amendment, which would require a three-month notice for discussion.        
	There are grey areas in the party constitution on this, said a Bengal minister known to be close to Basu.        
	However, the final decision would be known after the meeting of the outgoing central committee tomorrow morning. The leadership, including general secretary Prakash Karat, is in touch with Basu to persuade him to stay on.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 10: The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad today moved a court for permission to question an Uttar Pradesh Hindutva leader in the Malegaon blast case.        
	Public prosecutor Ajay Misar filed a confidential application in the Nashik court of chief judicial magistrate K.D. Boche, but refused to divulge details.        
	Uttar Pradesh police sources said they were aware of the application. They claimed the person in question was possibly a former MP and a Hindutva leader based in Ayodhya.        
	The sources claimed the leader had been a foot soldier of the Babri Masjid demolition and had of late been getting threats from the banned Simi.        
	The leader was also associated with the Pune wing of radical right-wing outfit Abhinav Bharat, with which Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit  arrested in the case last week  is said to have links, the sources said.        
	The ATS application may set the cat among the pigeons as it appears to suggest that politicians with Hindutva links could come under the scanner of sleuths probing the September 29 blast.        
	There has already been some discomfort in the BJP over photographs of party president Rajnath Singh and Madhya Pradesh chief minister S.S. Chauhan seated alongside sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur at a meeting.        
	Chauhan and Rajnath have denied links with the sadhvi, also arrested in the case. But the BJP boss has been saying off and on that subjecting her to repeated questioning reeks of political conspiracy.        
	The ATS application was made when five of the nine accused were produced before the court for extension of remand. For the first time, public prosecutor Misar presented evidence on funds pertaining to Abhinav Bharats activities.        
	Misar claimed the outfits Pune treasurer Ajay Rahirkar, who allegedly handled the finances for the terror operation, had received Rs 10.72 lakh. Of that, he apparently gave Rs 95,000 to activist Sameer Kulkarni and Rs 1.95 lakh to working president Major (retd) Ramesh Upadhyay. Antique weapons dealer Rakesh Dhawade apparently received Rs 3.20 lakh and Dombivli-based Jagdish Mhatre Rs 3.98 lakh.        
	Misar said Rahirkar disbursed another Rs 5 lakh to people in six cities on Purohits orders. Where this money came from is not known.         
	He said another Rs 5 lakh was found in the Pune State Bank of India account of Ashok Chawla, a Jabalpur-based diamond courier who worked as Abhinav Bharats treasurer for Madhya Pradesh.        
	The court remanded all five in custody till November 17. Purohit has been taken to Bangalore for narco-analysis, brain-mapping and pol ygraph tests.

	New Delhi/Chennai, Dec. 24: Suspected Taliban militants have again abducted an Indian working in Afghanistan.         
	Paramanandan Simon, who belongs to Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu, was abducted along with his Afghan interpreter and driver in Herat province on October 13, official sources said today.        
	The 38-year-old, who went to the war-ravaged country a year ago, was working as a cook with Italian food store Fiano, which serves Italian soldiers in Afghanistan, the sources said.         
	The three were kidnapped while delivering food at the International Security Assistance Force camp in the Bagram air base, they added.        
	Simon is the third Indian in the past three years to have been abducted in Afghanistan, after M.R. Kutty, a driver of the Border Roads Organisation, and telecom engineer K. Suryanarayana. Both were killed.        
	Simons abductors are believed to have made a ransom demand of $50,000 (around Rs 24 lakh).        
	His wife Vasanthi has appealed to the abductors to release him, saying the family would not be able to meet the ransom demand. She also urged the government to ensure her husbands safety.        
	The kidnappers allowed Simon to talk to elder brother P.G. Subramaniam, who works in Kabul.        
	Family members in India said Subramaniam had been receiving repeated ransom calls over phone at his place of work.        
	Simon did not have any security unlike other Indians who have gone to Afghanistan through the government. Since he had gone through a private contract with the Italian firm, his security was the responsibility of the company, a source said.        
	The Indian embassy in Kabul and the consulate in Herat are in touch with top Afghan authorities who are trying to secure the safe release of the kidnapped trio. The embassy is also in touch with Simons company.        
	The sources said Simon was alive but did not give any details.         
	The Taliban have earlier carried out attacks on BRO personnel engaged in the construction of a key highway between Delaram and Zaranj.

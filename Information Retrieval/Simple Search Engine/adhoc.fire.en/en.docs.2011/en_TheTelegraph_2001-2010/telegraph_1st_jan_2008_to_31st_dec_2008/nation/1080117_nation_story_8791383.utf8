 - BJP leader holds forth on great nation China and takes a potshot at America
     SANJAY K. JHA
                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: L.K. Advani is carefully trying to dilute his hawkish image and speak a language that sounds almost Nehruvian.
    
	Having replaced the moderate A.B. Vajpayee as the BJPs Prime Minister candidate, his speech today at a conclave on conflict resolution in Asia was totally bereft of conventional Sangh parivar wisdom.
    
	The metaphors used by the Ram Janmabhoomi movement architect were peace, harmony, justice, respect for diversity and pluralism, co-existence and dialogue.
    
	Although the attempts at an image makeover have produced such controversies as the Jinnah episode, Advani has not abandoned that path. He is still going through the phase of transformation, perhaps trying to emulate Vajpayee who reflected the broad national consensus on the concept of India despite being the first Prime Minister from the Sangh parivar.
    
	Advani, who recently skipped the VHPs Ram setu rally in Delhi, spoke more like an Indian leader who believed in religious harmony and consensual politics.
    
	He stressed on the Hindu identity but did not try to communalise it. He held forth on the values of Hindu philosophy, but in terms of tolerance, not dominance. He spoke about ways to empower India with a statesmanlike approach, giving suggestions that almost sounded like an antidote to the RSS project.
    
	The BJP leader argued for complete normalisation of relations with Pakistan and China, made critical references to American foreign policy, stressed the need for economic inter-dependence among states, denounced religious extremism and hailed cultural and civilisational diversities.
    
	He said Asia need not look to Europe for solutions to conflicts as the rich historical experiences of Asia and the Hindu philosophy of tolerance and accommodation would provide all the answers. 
    
	A discussion on Democracy and Conflict Resolution in Asia must first of all recognise two factors about Asia: its rich historical experience and its proud diversity, which should disabuse us of the notion that we have nothing to learn from our own tradition of democracy and conflict-resolution and have to only learn from others, he said.
    
	Asia is the worlds largest, most populous and most diverse continent. It is the cradle of a majority of the worlds great and living civilisations.
    
	Hailing the evolution of India-China relations in recent years and the constructive bilateral approach to resolve the border dispute, he said: Fully normalised good-neighbourly and cooperative relations between the two great nations of Asia can become a reliable factor of peace, stability and progress, both in the region and globally.
    
	It has been my view that Pakistan should recognise the usefulness of the framework adopted by India and China for normalising and strengthening our bilateral ties, without holding them hostage to the resolution of the border dispute.
    
	In a veiled criticism of the American policy, Advani said: The term democracy is being manipulated in international relations discourse to suit the self-serving purpose of preserving ones global domination and preserving ones spheres of influence.
    
	All of us know that intolerant and extremist religious ideologies are being exported out of certain countries in Asia which are far from being democratic. Nevertheless, they are tolerated by those proclaiming to be defenders of freedom and democracy worldwide. This self-deception will prove costly to its practitioners and to the world at large.
    
	He was also critical of the Indian governments and communists role in Nepal. This has grave implications not only for Nepal but also for India, given the close nexus between Maoists on both sides of the border. Why has the UPA government remained a silent onlooker, with communists in India playing the role of a colluder, when constitutional monarchy was disbanded recently under the pressure of Maoists?
    
	Also, why did the Indian communists applaud when the identity of Nepal as a Hindu kingdom was erased even before the Constituent Assembly had discussed it? Would they demand that Pakistan or Bangladesh cease to be Islamic Republics?

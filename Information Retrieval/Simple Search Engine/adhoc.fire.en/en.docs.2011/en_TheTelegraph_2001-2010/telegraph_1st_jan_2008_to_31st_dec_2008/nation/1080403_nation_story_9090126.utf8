	New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): The Supreme Court has said the government cannot arbitrarily restrict the use of any land by its owner as it would severely curtail his right to possess property.          
	The ruling signifies that under the garb of revising a development plan, the substantial right conferred upon the owner of the land or a person interested therein cannot be taken away by the government.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): The Centre has said it would improve facilities for Haj pilgrims following complaints by state Haj committee members of inadequate arrangements and the indifferent attitude of some state-run agencies. Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee made the announcement at the Haj conference.                   
	Pathanamthitta (PTI): An eight-year-old girl has died here while enacting a suicide scene she saw on television. She shut herself in a room and tried to enact a hanging scene. Neighbours later broke into the room on hearing cries from her brother and found her hanging from an iron bar across a window.                  
	Ahmedabad (PTI): A family of three was burnt alive on Wednesday by unidentified persons in a village in Porbandar district, police said. The family was asleep when their home was doused with an inflammable substance and set afire. The police suspect family rivalry to be the cause.                   
	Srinagar (PTI): Three top Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants, including a self-styled district commander, have been arrested from a district of Jammu and Kashmir, police said on Wednesday. Ganai, the district commander, carried a reward of Rs 2.5 lakh on his head.                  
	 Udhagamandalam (PTI): The post-mortem of a panther, found dead at a tea estate near here, was carried out in public view following demands from an animal rights NGO which cited a Madras High Court ruling. The death was said to be from heavy bleeding and internal injuries, possibly inflicted by other animals.

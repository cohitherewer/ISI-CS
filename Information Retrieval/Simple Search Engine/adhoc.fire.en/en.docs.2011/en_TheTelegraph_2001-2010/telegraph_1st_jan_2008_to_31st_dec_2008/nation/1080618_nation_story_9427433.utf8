                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blind hunt for lost kids
  - Lack of photographs and callous cops impede search        ANANYA SENGUPTA                          The Telegraphs June 8 report on the missing children                                        
	Ghaziabad, June 17: For many parents of the 300 children missing from Ghaziabads villages since January 2007, the hunt for a photograph is the first challenge.        
	Mahesh, whose eight-year-old son Ravi went missing on March 6 this year, fears that his two other children, a daughter who is 6 and a son who is 10, will not recognise their brother: the family doesnt even have a picture of the kid.        
	I dont know how I am going to get my child back. When I tried filing a complaint, police berated me saying people like you dont know how to keep children safe, said Mahesh, who earns a living as a rickshaw-puller.         
	Weeks later, the police told Mahesh they had found the child living with a woman nearby but didnt explain why he wasnt brought back. Mahesh approached the lady, who accepted the boy had stayed with her, but claimed she didnt know where he went later.        
	When I said Ravi was not with the woman, the police said they couldnt do anything and didnt even register a complaint, Mahesh said.        
	He added that his son knew the complete address of their house and had told that to the officers who had found him. They did nothing.        
	Asked about Ravi, the officers claimed they had sent the child back home but didnt check with his parents.         
	The police inaction is startling given that court proceedings in the Nithari case of December 2006, where kids kept vanishing till one day drains in the Noida village threw up skeletons, are still under way. Nithari isnt far from the villages from where kids have gone missing now.        
	Weeks back, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked the Uttar Pradesh government for figures on missing children from every district.        
	Chief minister Mayavati voiced concern at the disappearances in Ghaziabad and its nearby areas during a meeting with senior police officers yesterday. They were asked to identify the officers who might be hand in glove with the gangs spiriting away kids.        
	But matters got worse after Mayavatis meeting. Local officers, under pressure from the top brass, are allegedly threatening parents, asking them not to file complaints.         
	The police asked me to sign a document that said the officers had done as much as they could to find my kid. When I refused, they threatened me, said Jagratan Arya, whose son Harinder, 9, went missing in February this year.         
	For day labourer from Bengal Amar Pal and his wife, their 11-year-old daughter Uma, missing since May 11, is as good as dead. The police refused to accept their FIR.        
	The Right to Information Act forced Ghaziabad police to reveal the figures: 177 children missing in 2007; another 121 in the last five months. Forty-six in April and May.        
	Yet, Ghaziabad SSP Deepak Rattan was dismissive: Only 24 kids are missing. They run away before exams and then come back.        
	Despite her promises of action, children seem low on Mayavatis list of priorities. Only 17 of the states 71 districts have juvenile justice boards. And, only eight child welfare committees are in place when the state should have 71.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER      
	Calcutta, June 13: Calcutta High Court today ordered a CBI probe into the disappearance of three teenaged sisters after the girls father alleged that police had not begun any inquiry into his complaint in two years.        
	Sabina Yasmin, 18, Mausam, 16, and Meherjaan, 13, apparently went shopping to a local market in East Midnapores Kolaghat on November 24, 2006, and did not return home.        
	Masroof Hossain, a state power board clerk, who conducted his own probe into his daughters disappearance in the absence of police help, said he suspected they were kidnapped for a girl-running racket.         
	My client went to the Kolaghat police station to lodge a missing diary on November 26. An officer took down the girls details but refused to lodge a diary, said Amjad Ali, the lawyer appearing for Masroof.        
	The father lodged an FIR the next day. He also started scanning the diaries of his daughters and found the mobile phone number of Raju Mohammed, a local motor mechanic, Ali told the court.        
	From Raju, Masroof apparently learnt that another motor mechanic, Sridam Das, had sent them to another state.         
	With some of his neighbours, Masroof traced Dass house in a nearby locality. Dass wife Sikha had confirmed that the girls were taken away in a Tata Sumo, Ali said.         
	Masroof then returned to the police and briefed them about their findings. The officer-in-charge heard everything and seized the diary comprising Rajus phone number. But he did nothing. We moved the court 13 months later, early this year, the lawyer said.        
	Ali told the court a judge had asked the police to appear before him with all papers relating to the case. They did not.         
	The judge then asked the OC to turn up a month later. But he did not.         
	The Kolaghat OC was not in court today either when Justice Dipankar Dutta ordered him to hand over all papers relating to the case to the CBI.        
	The agency has been asked to complete its probe by July and file a report in the court.

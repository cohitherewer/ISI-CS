                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Azad gets a week for floor test
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hindu activists shout anti-government slogans during a protest in Jammu on Monday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, June 30: Governor N.N. Vohra today gave chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad a week to prove that his depleted government still had the numbers even as protests raged across Kashmir over the Amarnath land transfer.        
	In Jammu, furious Hindu activists hit the streets over the decision to revoke the allotment of 40 hectares of forest land to the cave shrines board while separatist hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani led a procession of thousands chanting pro-freedom slogans.        
	A Raj Bhavan spokesman in Srinagar said the governor had in a letter asked Azad to prove his majority on the floor of the Assembly by July 7 in keeping with the established conventions of parliamentary democracy.        
	Azad, whose government has been reduced to a minority after ally PDP walked out over the transfer, had earlier written to Vohra that he was ready to prove his strength though he continues to enjoy the support of the majority of members.        
	Keeping with the highest traditions of parliamentary democracy and to dispel any misgivings, I am ready to prove majority on the floor of the House, the Congress leader had said after accepting the resignation of nine PDP ministers.        
	The Congress, which has 21 legislators in the 87-member House, needs 23 MLAs to stay afloat after the 19-member PDP quit the coalition.        
	The party has the support of eight Independents and, on Sunday, paraded four more: Usman Majid, Shoaib Lone, Ghulam Mohidin Sofi and Raman Matoo.        
	It is also banking on two CPM members and transport minister Hakim Yaseen, an Independent, who have pledged their support, but is still eight shy of the magic number.        
	Sources said efforts were on to woo four Panthers Party legislators, although the outfit has demanded Presidents rule in the state. The Congress, the sources added, was also trying to court some PDP rebels.         
	National Conference president Omar Abdullah said his party had decided against offering either covert or overt support to the government. We have been voted to remain in the Opposition, so we will fulfil our responsibility accordingly, Abdullah said.        
	In Hindu-majority Jammu, dozens of activists of the BJP, VHP and other Sangh parivar outfits burnt effigies of PDP leaders, raised slogans against the government and blocked the road at Lakhanpur, the entry point to the state from Delhi.        
	Police had a tough time quelling the mob. By afternoon, the protests had spilled over to other parts of Jammu, where the BJP had called a bandh to protest the decision to revoke the transfer of the land for erecting temporary shelters for Amarnath pilgrims.         
	The bandh was complete and everyone supported our call. We are meeting in the evening again to discuss further course of action to protest against the governments decision, state BJP chief Ashok Khajuria said.        
	In the Valley, too, life remained paralysed for the eighth day. Shops, government offices, banks and educational institutions stayed shut.        
	One more protester, Imtiyaz Ahmad, 19, succumbed to injuries suffered in police firing on Saturday, taking the toll to four.        
	Hurriyat hardliner Geelani, under house arrest for a week, led a procession in Srinagars old city. Thousands joined the separatist leader, shouting pro-freedom slogans and demanding that the government officially rescind the order.        
	Chief minister Azad issued a fresh call for peace as the controversy had been resolved. There was no reason for anybody to disrupt normal life in the Valley, which had witnessed violence during the past few days resulting in the loss of precious lives and bringing to a halt economic activity in Kashmir, he said.        
	A PTI report said a five-member official team, including chief secretary S.S. Kapur, director general of police Kuldeep Khoda and tourism director Farooq Shah, visited the Baltal and Pahalgam base camps to review arrangements for pilgrims. The government had yesterday said it was taking over responsibility for a hassle-free pilgrimage.

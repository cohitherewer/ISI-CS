                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Football pill to unite Nagaland militants
  - Delhi eye on match between warring factions and civil groups          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: A soccer match to be played on a Kohima playground on October 9 will be keenly watched in Delhi.        
	The two warring NSCN groups and a faction of the Naga National Council will come together for the match in which the rebels will take on a civil society team made up of groups such as the Naga Hoho.        
	We want to win again, said Naga Hoho president Kevileto Kewhiou, whose group had beaten the militants in a similar encounter in Thailand on August 20.        
	That matters little to Delhi, which will have its eyes peeled on the result off the field. The match is part of efforts by civil society groups and the Church to unite the militants.        
	The NSCNs two factions have been at war with each other since 1988, a situation that suits the Centre. Both factions are in a ceasefire with Delhi, which has also been holding peace talks with the bigger of the two, the NSCN(IM), since 1997.        
	But the militants have been under pressure in Nagaland to reconcile their differences and stop the fratricide. The civil society groups have been pushing them to come together since 2001, efforts that did not make much headway until last month.         
	It could have been the lure of Nagalands favourite sport  the Indian football teams first Olympics appearance, in London in 1948, came under the stewardship of Talimeren Ao, a Naga  or simply the pressure from the public to give up fighting, but the rebels have agreed to come together for the Naga Reconciliation Trophy.        
	The militants took on the civil society groups, who called themselves the Naga Parliament, on a remote ground in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on August 20 afternoon. The Naga Parliament won the match and wants a repeat.        
	Let us see how it goes. These things are very sensitive but there is hope in everything, NSCN(IM) leader Phunthing Shimrang said from Dimapur.        
	Hundreds of rebels have been killed in faction fights since the National Socialist Council of Nagaland split in 1988 into the NSCN(IM), led by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, and the NSCN(K), led by the Myanmar-based S.S. Khaplang.         
	The Nagaland Baptist Churches Council, the driving force behind the ice-breaking exercise in Kohima, is working hard to organise the game on the local ground, Khouchiezie. Chiang Mai and Kohima are quite different, of course, said Kari Longchar, the councils peace affairs director.         
	The civil society team will have four players from the Naga Hoho, the apex social body recognised by most Naga tribes, while the rest will be from NGOs. The Nagaland Christian Forum (NCF), involved in the effort to reconcile the groups since 2001, has framed the rules and chalked out a tentative schedule.         
	We will provide the jerseys and shorts but they will have to get the boots. Anyone playing without boots may be rejected, I have told them (the rebels), Zhabu Terhuja of the NCF said with a laugh over the phone from Kohima.        
	Terhuja has told the rebels they need to give the details of their players so the commentators can recognise them from their jersey numbers.

          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Omar Sheikh                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 18: Pakistans Presidents, former or current, seem to be just a phone call away from anybody. Hoax caller or death-row prisoner, they are all getting through.        
	Pakistani officials have claimed busting a plot to kill former President Pervez Musharraf, hatched by Omar Sheikh, the man sentenced to death in 2003 for killing Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, a newspaper reported today.        
	Omar apparently called up the former military ruler on his personal cellphone last month and said: I am after you, get ready to die.        
	Omar planned to get Musharraf eliminated by a suicide bomber, The News reported today quoting senior officials in the Sindh home ministry.        
	A condemned prisoner getting through to Musharraf, who lives under heavy security, may not surprise too many people after an alleged hoax call from Delhi recently prompted Islamabad to put its air force on high alert.        
	On November 28, during the Mumbai carnage, a mystery caller had apparently posed as Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and, after his call was put through to Pakistan President Asil Ali Zardari, used threatening language.        
	The News quoted officials as saying Omar called Musharraf from Hyderabad Central Jail where he has been held for over five years. Omar apparently hatched the assassination plot with militants of the anti-Shia Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.        
	The claim comes at a time Pakistan has been portraying itself as a victim of terror. The irony is, India had freed Omar, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar, in exchange for the release of the passengers of a hijacked Indian airliner.        
	That action by the NDA government in December 1999 returned to haunt L.K. Advani in Parliament yesterday at a time Delhi has asked for Azhar to be handed over for attacks in India.        
	Police found three cellphones, six batteries, 18 SIM cards and chargers in Omars prison cell, The News said. His phone records revealed calls across Pakistan, including several to former militants.        
	Omar was apparently in touch with Attaur Rehman alias Naeem Bukhari, a key Jhangvi operative arrested last year in the January 2002 Pearl murder case. The police seized a mobile and three SIMs from Bukharis barracks in Sukkur Central Jail.        
	Bukhari allegedly said the Jhangvi had been watching Musharrafs movements and planned to kill him during his travels between his Rawalpindi residence and his farmhouse near Islamabad. Alternatively, it were considering blowing up a bridge between Karachi and its airport during Musharrafs next visit to the city.

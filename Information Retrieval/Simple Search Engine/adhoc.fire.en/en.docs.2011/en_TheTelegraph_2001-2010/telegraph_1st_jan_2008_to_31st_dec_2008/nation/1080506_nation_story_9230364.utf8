          K.P. NAYAR                           Bobby Jindal                                  
	Washington, May 5: With Republican presidential aspirant John McCain beginning his quiet search for a vice-presidential running mate in November, speculation is mounting here that the partys choice could fall on Indian American Bobby Jindal, the recently elected governor of Louisiana.        
	Writing in The New York Times today, William Kristol, who speaks with authority on behalf of the Republican conservative constituency, revealed that in separate conversations last week, no fewer than four McCain staffers and advisers mentioned as a possible vice-presidential pick the 36-year-old Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal.        
	Kristol wrote that they are tempted by the idea of picking someone so young, with real accomplishments and a strong reformist streak.         
	Earlier, the Grand Ayatollah of American conservatives, influential radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, proposed Jindals name as an ideal running mate for McCain. He is the next Ronald Reagan, if he doesnt change, Limbaugh said of Jindal on his talk show which has a daily listernership of more than 12 million.         
	Bobby Jindal, the new governor of Louisiana, is the next Ronald Reagan. He is young. He was just sworn in for his first term. He is the guy that beat the liberal Democrat machine throughout Louisiana. He did it on 100 per cent conservatism.        
	Limbaugh has consistently opposed McCain as not being conservative enough to be the Republican candidate in the election to succeed George. W. Bush. But recently, he added a proviso for supporting the Arizona Senators campaign. If McCain chose him (Jindal), here is a Southern state; this is Louisiana, but I think he may be too conservative for McCain. That depends on who they think McCain will need or want.        
	For the record, Jindal has ruled out the possibility of becoming a vice-presidential candidate this year. But those denials have only reminded Americans that in the run up to the 2008 elections Hillary Clinton had consistently denied that she would seek the White House this year.        
	Even while denying his vice-presidential aspirations, Jindal has choreographed a series of nationally televised appearances in recent days to boost his name recognition and national profile.        
	Last weekend, he topped off these TV appearances, including one on a late night comedy, with a speech at the highly regarded National Press Club.        
	At the club, Jindal took pains, as usual, to distance himself from India and Indians. Asked by an Indian reporter how voters see him as the first Indian American governor, Jindal said people dont care about my age, or where my parents were from.         
	A leading newspaper columnist in his home state of Louisiana wrote after Jindals national effort to boost his media profile: If selected as the vice-presidential nominee, Jindal would provide regional, ethnic, age and philosophical balance for McCain. The drawbacks are that Jindal is very young, at only 36 years old, and has been in the Governors office for only a few months.        
	The columnist, Jeff Crouere, added that this prospect while flattering for Jindal has Louisiana Republican Party leaders less than overjoyed, because he won in a state that has strong Democratic credentials and any replacement may be vulnerable to Democrats.         
	Kristol and many others, however, consider Jindals age an advantage. Kristol wrote today that a Jindal pick might also be away to confront the issue of McCains age, 71, which private polls and focus groups suggest could be a real problem.        
	Choosing the young Indian American would implicitly acknowledge the questions and raise the ante. The message would be: You want generational change? You can get it with McCain-Jindal  without risking a liberal and inexperienced Obama as commander in chief. I would add that it was after McCain spent considerable time with Jindal in New Orleans recently, and reportedly found him, as he has before, personally engaging and intellectually impressive, that the campaigns informal name-dropping of Jindal began.

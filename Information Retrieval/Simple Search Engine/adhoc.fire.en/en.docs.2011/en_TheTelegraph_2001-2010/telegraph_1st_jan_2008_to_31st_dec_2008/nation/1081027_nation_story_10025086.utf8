          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: A man who killed someone during a temporary phase of lunacy cannot be absolved of criminal responsibility, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	Mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion, irresistible impulse or compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection, the court said on Thursday.        
	It said the legal protection for insanity extends to someone with a serious, non-temporary problem, such as a person who has been mentally challenged since birth or has been a psychotic for a long time.        
	The court rejected an appeal from a life convict in a Maharashtra jail who had committed a murder in 2002.        
	Siddhapal Kamala Yadav was already serving a life term for another murder when he was sent to the prison ward in a hospital for murmuring to himself like a lunatic. One day, he allegedly broke free of his handcuffs and battered a fellow prisoner, lodged in the same ward, to death with an iron saline stand.        
	The trial court and a high court had dismissed Yadavs appeals for leniency on the ground of lunacy. Since Yadav was already serving a life term, his only gain if he won the plea would have been to keep alive his chances of parole after 14 years.        
	But the apex court upheld the high court ruling. It said that just because an accused was odd, irascible and his brain was not quite all right, or that physical and mental ailments had left his intellect weak and affected his motions and will, he cannot be exempt from criminal responsibility.        
	The other grounds that alone cannot guarantee exemption are that the offender had committed unusual acts in the past, was given to recurring fits of insanity at short intervals or to epileptic fits, or that his behaviour was strange, the court added.

	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: The year 2008 will be remembered as one of the bloodiest ones in Orissas history.         
	The casualty count rose to 100 (and more) in the state as communal riots, Maoist attacks, murders and stampede occurred frequently.        
	The year began on a bloody note, as clashes continued in Kandhamal following a Christmas eve violence that continued till January 2008. The riots aftermath claimed three lives and injured 34.         
	The clashes destroyed hundreds of churches, prayer halls, schools, hospitals and houses.         
	The district simultaneously witnessed intense ethnic conflicts between Kandha tribal members and Dalits over reservation benefits enjoyed by the latter.         
	Former steel and mines minister Padmanabha Behera, a Dalit leader from the district, lost his post in the wake of the conflict.         
	Just as the state was recovering from the Kandhamal shock, a 500-strong cadre of armed Maoists sneaked into the sleepy Nayagarh town, just 100km away from Bhubaneswar, on the night of February 15.         
	They caught the sleeping personnel unaware and in a well-planned operation, swooped down simultaneously on a police training school, two police stations and an armoury.         
	In the ensuing gun battle where the sleeping personnel were greatly outnumbered, 14 policemen and a civilian were killed after which the rebels fled in a bus that they had earlier hijacked.         
	Subsequently, three more police personnel were killed in the combing operation launched by the police in the forests to recover the looted arms and ammunition.        
	On June 29, 32 elite Greyhound Commandos from Andhra Pradesh and one constable of Orissa police were killed in a Maoist ambush near Alampekka at Balimela reservoir of Malkangiri. The motor-launch that the team was travelling in sunk following grenade attacks by rebels who were lined along the steep hills that ran along the reservoir.         
	Seventeen commandos of Special Operation Group were killed after Maoists blasted an anti-landmine vehicle near MV-126 village in the same district on July 16.         
	On the night of August 23, senior VHP leader Laxmanananda Saraswati and four of his associates were killed at Jalespeta Ashram in Kandhamal, triggering large-scale violence in the district and elsewhere.         
	A 29-year old nun was allegedly raped and paraded naked at K-Nuagaon village in Kandhamal during a Orissa bandh called by Hindu organisations in protest against the murder. The same day, Rajani Majhi, caretaker of a missionary-run orphanage in Bargarh district, burnt to her death after a mob set fire to a residential school.         
	Subsequently, riots continued in Kandhamal claiming 40 lives and leaving 134 injured. In Kandhamal 38 were killed, while two persons died in Bargarh and Gajapati. An estimated 1,071 houses were completely damaged and 2,833 partially damaged in Kandhamal along with devastation caused to churches, prayer houses hospitals and schools.         
	The carnage was so intense that it drew international attention and forced the Pope to express his concern. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dubbed the violence a national shame and deputed more than 5,000 cental paramilitary forces to help the state police in maintaining peace and order.        
	In the evening of April 13, judo coach Biranchi Das was gunned down by two armed men. The murder brought to light a criminal-bureaucrat nexus when a close associate of gangster Raja Acharya, Chagala alias Akshay Behera, disclosed a plan made by senior bureaucrat Priyabrata Patnaik and album co-ordinator Jubuli Sundaray to kill the coach. The deal was allegedly struck in presence of police commissioner B.K. Behera.        
	On July 4, an auspicious event turned into a nightmare as six devotees, three women, were killed and 15 people were severely injured in a stampede in front of the Jagannath Temple (Puri) during the rath yatra.

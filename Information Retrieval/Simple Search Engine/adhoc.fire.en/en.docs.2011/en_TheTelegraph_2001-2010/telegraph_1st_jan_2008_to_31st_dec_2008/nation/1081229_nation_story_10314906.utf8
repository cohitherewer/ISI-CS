          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          National Conference leader Mubarak Gul after winning Eidgah in Srinagar. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, Dec. 28: Srinagar has sprung to the rescue of the National Conference, helping it emerge the single largest party in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly.        
	Had the NC not won all the eight seats in Srinagar, the Abdullahs could not have ended the day with an impressive 28 seats.        
	Of the 38 seats in Kashmir outside Srinagar, the NC could bag only 12 seats. In south Kashmir, it won a lone seat and in the north seven. But central Kashmir, of which Srinagar is a part, put 12 out of the total 15 in the NCs basket.        
	The NC used to have a vice-like grip on Srinagar but its downslide began in 1987 when the Muslim United Front (MUF) emerged as its rival. The NC defeated the MUF in an election that was widely seen as rigged.        
	For the past 20 years, the city has boycotted almost every single election. Even this time when Srinagar recorded a turnout of around 20 per cent, most of the votes were polled in the rural pockets on the outskirts of the city.        
	Observers feel that a majority of those who took part in the elections in Srinagar voted for the NC to avenge alleged discrimination meted out to the city by the Peoples Democratic Party.        
	The participation of Jamaat-e-Islami supporters in the elections in large numbers also played a role. Srinagar, though a separatist stronghold, has a very small concentration of Jamaat supporters. The high turnout reinforced the notion that the PDP was all out to empower the rural masses at the expense of Srinagar.        
	In the 2002 elections, the PDP had not won any seat in Srinagar but it opened its account in the city in a bypoll when Batmalloo was bagged by its leader Tariq Qarra, who as finance minister had stirred a controversy by demanding dual currency.        
	In Srinagar, Qarra had become the face of the PDP, otherwise considered a south Kashmir party.         
	Qarra, his wife Asifa and sister-in-law Asiya contested from three seats but all lost.

          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, May 22: The government today created new posts for senior officers in the Armed Forces Medical Services in what is probably the beginning of a cadre-restructuring move that has been pending because of differences between the army, navy and the air force.         
	The Cabinet Committee on Security has decided to upgrade 117 posts in the Army Medical Corps, Army Dental Corps and the Army Medical Corps (non-technical).         
	A hundred of the 117 posts are in the Army Medical Corps which will now get three at the lieutenant general or equivalent (air marshal or vice-admiral) rank, 15 major general or equivalent (air vice-marshal, rear admiral) and 82 of brigadier or equivalent (air commodore, captain) rank.         
	The creation of these new posts will mean that the Armed Forces Medical Services will now become more top-heavy but it will also lead to more promotions. The government hopes it will rid the organisation of stagnation in the middle ranks.         
	A committee led by former defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh has suggested a similar restructuring for the army. The first part of its recommendations was implemented two years ago and it covered officers from the ranks of lieutenant (and equivalent) to colonel (and equivalent).         
	But the second part of the recommendations for officers from the rank of colonel (and equivalent) to lieutenant general (and equivalent) was not implemented chiefly because the three services were making demands for posts that the government was finding difficult to accommodate.         
	The former army chief, General J.J. Singh, wrote to defence minister A.K. Antony last year, justifying why the army needed more major generals and lieutenant generals as a proportion of its force than the air force needed air vice-marshals and air marshals and the navy rear admirals and vice-admirals.         
	The issue was also taken up by his successor, the current army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, and by Admiral Sureesh Mehta and Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.         
	The defence minister asked the service chiefs to work out a compromise.         
	Defence ministry sources said today the compromise has been worked out and a cabinet note was being drafted.         
	The army has sought sanction for 20 posts of lieutenant general in addition to the existing 61, 75 posts of major general (in addition to the existing 199), 222 posts of brigadier (existing 824) and 1,484 posts of colonel (existing 3,389).         
	The air force has sought seven additional posts of air marshal (existing 22), 32 posts of air vice-marshal (existing 47), 158 posts of air commodore (existing 131) and 592 posts of group captain (in addition to 476).         
	The navy has asked for up to seven more vice-admirals (15 currently), 16 rear admirals (43 now) and 492 additional posts of group captain and commander (418 in each rank currently).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mulayam meets Mayavati after 13 years 
          OUR BUREAU                          Mulayam with Mayavati at the meeting in Lucknow. (PTI)                                  
	June 6: Mayavati and Mulayam Singh Yadav met after 13 years today, but neither side was telling what the two spoke about in the 90 minutes they were together.        
	 I am not going to say anything now. I will tell you after three days, the Samajwadi Party leader said as he left at 12.30pm.        
	Mulayam had driven to the chief ministers house at 11am, setting off speculation about a possible thaw in the ice-cold relationship.         
	The official reason, sources said, was to nominate the chairman and two members of the state human rights commission. As leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Mulayam needs to be taken into confidence.        
	Sources in the chief ministers office said the two leaders had a one-to-one meeting.        
	The last time they had made eye contact was in June 1995 in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.         
	On June 2, 1995, when it looked like Mayavati would snap her alliance with the Samajwadis and team up with the BJP, Mulayams men were alleged to have mounted an organised attack on her at the state guesthouse. She said she would have been killed had it not been for the BJPs Lalji Tandon who played knight in shining armour.         
	The day after, Mulayam was voted out as chief minister and Mayavati was voted in. He slumped into his seat and looked like he would collapse. Mayavati, who had the entire political establishment backing her, barring the CPM, beamed and pointedly came first to him. By then, he recovered a bit, enough to smile wanly and fold his hands in a namaste. She laughed all the way to her throne.        
	Mulayam often told his confidants this particular moment was forever frozen in his consciousness.        
	She wreaked her revenge all right for the guesthouse attack. Mayavati foiled Mulayams meetings and rallies, arrested his workers and virtually rendered him a persona non grata in his home state. Even as the countrys defence minister with the Centres resources at his command between 1996 and 1998, it was impossible for Mulayam to hold a meeting in Empress Mayavatis fief.        
	Realising that public opinion had turned against him, Mulayam rarely uttered Mayavatis name even as she spewed venom at him, saying he never said bad things about women.        
	To Mulayams credit, when he became the chief minister again in September 2003, he largely left Mayavati alone. He did spirit away most of her MLAs to shore up his majority though.         
	When she finally gave the state its first single party government in 18 years last year, Mulayam accepted the verdict in a fatalistic spirit. His Samajwadi Party remained the main Opposition and he was her prime adversary. Only this time, he made sure the equation was political and not personal.        
	Having reworked his rule of engagement with Mayavati, it was easier for Mulayam to accept her invitation for an official meeting in her residence today.        
	Amar Singh, the party general secretary, underplayed the visit and said Mulayam had fulfilled a constitutional obligation the way L.K. Advani did when Man- mohan Singh had consulted him before appointing a CBI chief.        
	But Samajwadi sources said if he really desired, he could have sent a party colleague. But we believe he thinks the past should be put behind, said a party MP.        
	Many Samajwadi leaders were hopeful of a possible rapprochement. It could mark a change in attitude since both are spearheading attacks on the central government in the wake of the oil and LPG price hike, said a former Samajwadi minister.

	Ahmedabad, July 31: A life convict in a Sabarmati jail said to be close to Pakistan-based fugitive Rasool Parti will be interrogated over last weeks blasts that killed over 50 people.        
	Police sources said grilling Gulam Mohammed, jailed under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in connection with the murder of Congress leader Rauf Valiullah, could help them trace the link to Pakistan, where they believe the blast conspiracy was hatched.        
	Five months ago, the crime branch had discovered that Mohammed was making phone calls from the jail to Pakistan and Dubai, where many absconding criminals from India are suspected to have fled.        
	Parti had fled the country after killing Valilullah, one of Ahmedabads senior Congress leaders. He had been working for Abdul Latif, Dawood Ibrahims Gujarat point man, who was killed in a police encounter.        
	The crime branch has applied in the Pota court for Mohammeds remand so that he can be interrogated about the anti-national conspiracy taking place from inside the Sabarmati prison.        
	Parti and Mohammed Asgar Ali, who had assassinated former home minister Haren Pandya more than five years back, are believed to have recruited more than 200 local youths for training in terrorist camps in Pakistan.        
	According to intelligence officials, Parti had been working as an undercover agent for Pakistans spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and is believed to have sent around 100 Muslim youths from Gujarat to the camps since the 2002 riots.        
	Investigating agencies are not revealing much about the blasts conspiracy, though Gujarat home minister Amit Shah said the probe was on the right track and we have got some leads.        
	The police are also looking into a possible Bangladeshi connection since thousands of immigrants from that country live in Ahmedabad.        
	The aim is to examine whether these settlers had provided local help to the militants to carry out the blasts.        
	Police teams from Karnataka and Rajasthan have been camping in the Gujarat capital over the past few days, hoping to uncover possible connections between the blasts in Ahmedabad and Bangalore that took place last week, and the explosions that had rocked Jaipur on May 13.

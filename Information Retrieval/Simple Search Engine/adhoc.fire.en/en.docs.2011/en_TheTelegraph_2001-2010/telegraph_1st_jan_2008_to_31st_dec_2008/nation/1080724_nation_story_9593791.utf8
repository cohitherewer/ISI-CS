Allies shy
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Karat during the meeting at Mayavatis house. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, July 23: Third front leaders today decided to launch a countrywide agitation against the Congress-led government at a breakfast meeting at Mayavatis home, but the zest in naming her as alliance head had clearly disappeared.         
	In fact, the alliance has neither been formalised nor christened  all that the partners would admit to was the existence of a force against the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led UPA.        
	We are going to work together to take up five issues. We will take future course of action after deliberations, CPM chief Prakash Karat told reporters, asked if the meeting had decided on a name for the front or a leader.        
	Others  among them leaders of the Telugu Desam, CPI, Forward Bloc, RSP, Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Dal, INLD and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha  kept mum.         
	In the run-up to the trust vote, Mayavati had hogged all the limelight before the BJP wrested back its space as the main Opposition yesterday.        
	Front sources said more meetings would be held before the alliance was formalised and a leader elected.        
	Later, at a separate media briefing, Desam boss N. Chandrababu Naidu denied naming Mayavati as the fronts candidate for Prime Minister.         
	That was your interpretation. I have never said that. I said we will sit and discuss, the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister told reporters.        
	TRS leader K. Chandrasekhara Rao, whose party wants a Telengana state to be carved out of Andhra, also attended the meeting but left early. Mayavati said he had some personal work.         
	Unlike Naidu, Rao has maintained that Mayavati could be the next Prime Minister.         
	JD(S) president H.D. Deve Gowda remained ambiguous. He said his party was ready for full co-operation.         
	As expected, the leaders slammed the ruling coalition. Karat read out a statement that said the Manmohan Singh government had lost its moral authority. The statement also made it clear that the parties had met at the invitation of Mayavati.        
	The leaders said their campaign would focus on relentless price rise, the agrarian distress, the nuclear deal, communal forces and misuse of government institutions like the CBI for political purposes, the last point a clear allusion to the cases against Mayavati.

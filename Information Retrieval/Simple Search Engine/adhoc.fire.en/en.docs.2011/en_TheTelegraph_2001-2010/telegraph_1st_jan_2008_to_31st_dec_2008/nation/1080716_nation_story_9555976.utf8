The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI hope for new ally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CBI hope for new ally
  - Go-slow buzz on cases against Mulayam amp; Amar         BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Mulayam                                        
	New Delhi, July 15: The CBI has apparently been instructed to go slow on cases involving Samajwadi Party leaders at a time Mayavati has been accusing the Centre of using the agency to target her.        
	Sources said Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and general secretary Amar Singh are the likely beneficiaries of the directive. The Samajwadis are the Congresss newest friends.        
	On July 10, the CBI filed a disproportionate assets affidavit against Mayavati in the Supreme Court just as the Samajwadi Party was swinging into action to gather support for the July 22 trust vote.        
	The agency is probing similar assets and corruption cases against Mulayam and Amar.        
	In October 2007, the CBI had told the Supreme Court it had enough evidence against Mulayam and his family, including sons Akhilesh and Pratik and daughter-in-law Dimple, to register a regular case against them.        
	The apex court had asked the agency to conduct a preliminary enquiry (PE) after a Congress activist, Vishwanath Chaturvedi, filed a PIL giving details of Mulayams wealth and properties.        
	The CBI had been going ahead with the case full steam, which was not surprising given the unpleasant relationship between the Congress and the Samajwadis. Sources said that was the time when cases against then UPA ally Mayavati were put on the back-burner.        
	However, things are different now. The case against Mulayam Singh is to come up in the Supreme Court in July-end. The CBI is not likely to take up the case with any persuasion. It is also not likely to register a regular case as it had conveyed to the court in October last, a senior CBI official disclosed.        
	The 2005 Lucknow land scam case, in which Amar is an accused, is listed for hearing in the Supreme Court on July 21. The CBI is likely to go slow on this case, too, the official added.        
	Chaturvedi, whose PIL set the ball rolling, hoped the CBI would not go slow on the Mulayam case. The matter is sub judice and I dont think the CBI can do much to stall the case, he said, adding he was determined to go ahead despite the recent alliance between the parties.        
	He said the date of hearing - tentatively July-end  could even be a week earlier. Dates for several cases are kept open-ended and then depending on the convenience of both sides, the date of hearing is fixed.        
	However, sources said it was also a convenient way of stalling the hearing indefinitely.        
	A senior official said the CBI had in its repertoire several ways of delaying cases. It would not be difficult to stall the Mulayam case, given the stage it is at. Since a regular case has not yet been registered, the first thing the CBI could do is delay the hearing itself on some pretext or the other, he said.        
	Then they could ask for additional time to carry out more investigations about something new that has come up. There are also several technical ways like not doing proper paper work and missing documents. Once both parties are working towards the same thing, so many things can happen behind the scenes.        
	In his PIL, Chaturvedi had furnished a list of movable and immovable properties belonging to Mulayams family which, he claimed, was worth Rs 100 crore at the market rate. Mulayam allegedly acquired the properties by misusing his position as public servant since 1977, both in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre.        
	But Mulayams counsel had claimed the net worth of the assets was Rs 24 crore, which was not disproportionate to the familys known sources of income.

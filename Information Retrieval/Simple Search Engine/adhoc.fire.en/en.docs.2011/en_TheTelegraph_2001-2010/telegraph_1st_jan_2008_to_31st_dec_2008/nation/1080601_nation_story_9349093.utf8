          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                         Burney                            
	New Delhi, May 31: The home ministry has said former Pakistan minister and human rights activist Ansar Burney was not deported yesterday but sent back because of inadequate travel documents.        
	The incident is regrettable and Burney is most welcome in India, the ministry added.         
	There have been reports in the media about Ansar Burney, a former minister of Pakistan, having been deported when he entered New Delhi on May 30. It is clarified that on his arrival from Dubai at Delhi IGI airport on Friday evening, Ansar Burney was denied entry, and not deported, by the immigration official on duty on account of inadequate documentation, a spokesperson said.         
	The inconvenience to Burney is unfortunate and regrettable and he is always welcome to visit India. This has also been conveyed to Burney by a senior officer who spoke to him today, the spokesperson added.         
	Earlier, the foreign ministry had sought details from the home ministry about the incident. Sources in the ministry said it learnt from the media that Burney had been sent back to Dubai.         
	The human rights activist, who ensured the release of Indian prisoner Kashmir Singh from a Pakistan jail, had come to attend a conference on terrorism. He is now pleading for mercy for another Indian prisoner, Sarabjit Singh, who is on death row in Pakistan.         
	During his visit to India last month, Burney had met the family of Sarabjit Singh in Amritsar and called on home minister Shivraj Patil and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon.

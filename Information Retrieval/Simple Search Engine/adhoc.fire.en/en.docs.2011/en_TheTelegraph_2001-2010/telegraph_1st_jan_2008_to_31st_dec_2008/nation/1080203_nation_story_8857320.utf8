     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: The India-specific safeguards agreement could take up to three more rounds of negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency, government sources said today. 
    
	The Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting in Delhi today where the status of the talks came up, the sources said, but did not specify the contentious points.
    
	The agreement hasnt come through... it could take two or three rounds more, a source said. We cannot renege on commitments made by the government in Parliament. 
    
	Nuclear analysts have long predicted that the toughest part of the negotiations in Vienna is likely to involve Article 5.6(c) that allows India to take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies. 
    
	The section specifies that India will place its civilian nuclear facilities under India-specific safeguards in perpetuity and negotiate an appropriate safeguards agreement towards this end with the IAEA. 
    
	But it is not clear what corrective measures India has outlined to the IAEA.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sangh guns for Singh and Sonia
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The RSS has launched a no-holds-barred attack on the Congress leadership for the Mumbai tragedy, leaving Pakistan completely out of its firing range.         
	The editorial in the latest issue of Sangh mouthpiece Organiser blames Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh for the tragedy.         
	It alleges that scapegoats are being found to save the two most powerful persons in the country who should have taken the entire flak for betraying the country and messing up its defence mechanism.         
	The tirade comes despite RSS second-in-command Mohan Bhagwats comments that political parties should not indulge in partisan fights in this hour of crisis.         
	The editorial asserts that all parties cannot share the blame for the Mumbai strike and maligning the entire political class was a ploy to save the Congress.         
	Describing the Prime Ministers decision to ask Islamabad to send the ISI chief as tomfoolery, it says: Only a weird and a conceited mind could have conjured up such a course of action.         
	The journal picks on Sonia in its front-page article, alleging she knows next to nothing and chooses her advisers primarily on her perception of who is loyal to her and their ability to promote the aspirations of her family.         
	The article also talks about the Congress presidents private religious prejudices.              
	 that the RSS believes led to the humiliation of Hindus and the promotion of Muslims and Christians.                     
	Other essays in the mouthpiece, too, gun for the Congress instead of Pakistan, the Sangh parivars preferred target.         
	With the BJP, too, refraining from asking for any military response to Pakistans alleged involvement in the Mumbai attacks, it is obvious the parivar does not want the focus to shift to Pakistan and away from the UPA governments follies.         
	The BJP has said it would support the Centres anti-terror initiatives but has spared no pains in pointing to its failures.        
	BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudi today asked why the government had not sought to build a consensus on fighting terrorism all these years. He said the consultation process now was aimed at condoning its own wrongdoing, and the BJP would not fall into that trap. Rudi hinted that the absence of L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh from the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister was intended to send that message.         
	The BJP leadership is determined to make the governments soft approach on terrorism its main plank in the next general election.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Praise but no politics in Presidents debut
                                                                                                               Praise but no politics in Presidents debut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Patil in Parliament on Monday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: President Pratibha Patil today told a joint session of Parliament that the government had succeeded in creating the architecture of inclusive growth.        
	Having cobbled economic development with welfare schemes for the underprivileged, the challenge for the UPA government now was to sustain the process in the face of external and internal threats, she added in her maiden address to a joint session.        
	The speech stood out for its apolitical content. The government stuck to the bare bones of policies and programmes, even the usual secular-communal rhetoric was missing.        
	The performance (in economic growth) is all the more creditable against the background of high international oil prices and rising commodity prices, including that of food. It will continue to be the endeavour of my government to sustain the growth while keeping prices under check. My government has endeavoured to insulate the Indian consumer from these global inflationary trends, she said.        
	The President talked about the substantial increase in allocations to the social sector and launch of mega schemes like the Bharat Nirman and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.         
	She also dwelt on special measures for agriculture, the weaker sections and minorities.        
	Special praise was reserved for the Prime Ministers new 15-point programme aimed at ensuring that benefits of development programmes flowed equitably to minorities.         
	A certain proportion of development projects will be located in minority-concentration areas and, wherever possible, 15 per cent of targets and outlays under various schemes would be earmarked for the minorities, she said, reiterating the resolve to implement the recommendations of the Sachar committee report.        
	Patil said the overall internal security situation was under control. My government is fully alive to the threat of terrorism and Left-wing extremism. The entire nation stood as one in condemning inhuman acts of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Assam, she said.

  - 32 dead in Jammu crash         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers and rescue workers at the accident site. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, May 8: A bus drivers attempt to avoid hurting a flock of sheep on a narrow mountain road killed at least 32 people in Jammu this morning.        
	As the driver swerved and lost control, the crowded bus fell 250 metres down a gorge, about 212km from Jammu town, strewing the Chenabs banks with bodies.        
	We have fished out 32 bodies so far and rescued six injured, four of whom have been flown to hospitals in Jammu, said Inayatullah, the district commissioner of Kishtwar where the accident happened around 11.40am.        
	We found the bodies on the river bank. We fear some bodies may have been washed away  they may be retrieved near the Baghlihar power project, which is several kilometres away.        
	The bus was packed with passengers, so we expect more bodies, an official added.        
	Inayatullah said the bus had encountered a flock of sheep, belonging to the nomadic Gujjars, on its way from Jammu to Kishtwar town, 220km away.        
	It met with the tragedy around 8km ahead of Kishtwar. Some eyewitnesses said the driver was trying to avoid the sheep but lost control. We are trying to find out if there was any other reason, too.        
	Many of the bodies were badly mutilated. When we arrived, we could see only a small portion of the bus from the road  the rest of it was submerged, an official said.        
	Twenty-seven of the bodies have been identified with help from the hundreds of local people who arrived to look for survivors.        
	Of the five unidentified bodies, one is headless, two are sadhus and one is a woman, the official said.        
	This is the second tragedy in Kishtwar district in the past one week. Boulders rolling down a mountainside had killed over a dozen people, mostly Border Road Organisation labourers, on May 1 at Chatru village.        
	Traffic accidents are common in Kishtwar, Ramban and Doda districts of Jammu because the roads, which pass through the treacherous slopes, are narrow and in poor condition.        
	A spokesperson said chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is on a tour of Karnataka, has expressed anguish at the frequency of road tragedies in the state.        
	He has asked the traffic authorities to take stringent measures to check recurrence of such accidents. The divisional administration has been directed to immediately rush rescue and relief teams to the site, the spokesperson said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          border vigil                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 27: Pakistani Rangers today allegedly fired at a BSF outpost in Jammu two days after a joint announcement by the Indian Prime Minister and the Pakistan President about stabilising the border ceasefire.        
	Officials said the Rangers sprayed bullets and lobbed a grenade across the international border at Chakphagwari in the Pargwal sector to try and push in militants.        
	Our men from 26 Battalion retaliated and thwarted the bid by militants to sneak in. We believe they were given covering fire by the Rangers, a BSF officer said.        
	The BSF deputy inspector-general (Jammu frontier), J.B. Sangwan, said the bullets came from behind a bund on the Pakistani side, some 20 metres from the border.        
	The firing continued for around 30 to 40 minutes. It stopped after we retaliated. We later held a commandant-level meeting to lodge a protest, Sangwan said.        
	We expressed our concern and, as usual, they denied their role. We told them we would retaliate more strongly if they fired again.        
	Sangwan said it was pitch dark and thus difficult for the BSF troops to ascertain if the Rangers were involved. But it happened under their nose and how is it possible that they would not know it? he asked.        
	Sources said the BSF had spotted around 12 militants trying to enter this side, adding there were no reports of casualties. A high alert had already been sounded in the area after intelligence reports said militants would try to sneak in, a BSF officer said.        
	He said militants had adopted a similar plan at Sambas Kanuchak on August 26. They had cut the border fence and entered a house in Chinore and taken its occupants hostage before troops killed all the three rebels and rescued the family.        
	More than 28 ceasefire violations have been recorded this year on the Line of Control and the international border. Two days ago, Manmohan Singh had met Asif Ali Zardari in New York, where they agreed to stabilise the ceasefire and said the two countries directors-general of military operations and sector commanders would stay in regular contact.

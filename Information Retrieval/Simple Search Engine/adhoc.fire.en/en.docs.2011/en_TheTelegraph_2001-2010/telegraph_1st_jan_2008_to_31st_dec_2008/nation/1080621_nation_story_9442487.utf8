          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 20: A senior Samajwadi Party leader today hinted that his party could consider bailing the Centre out on the nuclear deal standoff if asked to.        
	But he added that the Congress must make the first move and offer talks.        
	Unlike the Left, we are not against the US. We want good relations with the West, nor are we against nuclear energy. If need be, we will support them, the leader said.        
	Congress sources have said the government might offer to take the sense of Parliament on the deal  though it isnt required to  to isolate the Left in the House. Key to the plans success would be the support of the Samajwadis, who have 38 MPs and are allies of the CPM.        
	Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Sonia Gandhi, have called on Samajwadi leaders informally to discuss support for the nuclear deal, sources said. But the Congress has not approached Mulayam Singh Yadav, while Amar Singh is abroad, they added.        
	Relations between the Congress and the Samajwadis have improved in recent months but Mulayams party, keenly aware of its increased importance amid the nuclear deal tug-of-war, may play a little hard to get.        
	Party leader Shahid Siddiqui today set some conditions for support to the deal, such as a ratification by Parliament and revelation of the full text of the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).        
	He said he found it fishy that details of the deal were still not being discussed, nor were various concerns, especially relating to the Hyde Act, being cleared.        
	The Centre, however, says it cannot reveal the text of the agreement to parties that are not in government.        
	Siddiquis stand was echoed by another senior Samajwadi leader, Ramji Lal Suman, who said that once confidence was built, there could be a solution.        
	The two leaders denied that the Samajwadis friendly view of the Congress was a new development. They said that although the Congress had distanced itself from their party for some time, the Samajwadis did not support the BJP or its allies.        
	However, Samajwadi sources alleged that media reports about their partys support for the deal had been planted by the Congress to gain mileage with its allies.

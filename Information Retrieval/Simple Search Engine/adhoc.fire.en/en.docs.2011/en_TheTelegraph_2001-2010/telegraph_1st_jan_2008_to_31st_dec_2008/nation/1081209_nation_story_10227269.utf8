          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The silence at the Congress headquarters was telling. There were no firecrackers, no victory buntings or drumbeats.        
	The handful of officials who spoke to the media had to be cajoled to offer sweets.        
	The directive from Sonia Gandhi had been clear: any show of revelry would be improper and unjust to the memory of the Mumbai victims. The sense of restraint was reflected in what spokespersons said.        
	When asked if the 3-2 win would tempt the Congress to advance the Lok Sabha polls to February 2009, M. Veerappa Moily, the chief spokesperson, said: They are scheduled to be held in April-May. Our priority at the moment is to fight against terrorism, insulate our economy from the global meltdown and fight against communalism. Fighting elections is not our only priority.        
	In 2003, after the BJP had won three of the same five states, its key strategists had pressured Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani into calling an early Lok Sabha poll. The BJPs shock defeat is etched in the Congresss memory.        
	We cannot extrapolate on the basis of these results. Between them, these states have only 73 Lok Sabha seats. The big election will be fought on different issues, there will be anti-incumbency against the sitting MPs. There are too many imponderables, a Congress general secretary said.        
	Sources said that given Sonias instinct for caution, she was unlikely to risk bringing the polls forward, though the Prime Minister is said to be still keen on a February poll.        
	The Prime Ministers argument is that we should bite the bullet before the economy gets worse, because its still hard to tell how the meltdown is going to impact India. The Congress chiefs view is that things need to be straightened out first, they explained.        
	Those who, like Manmohan Singh, are looking at a February timeline also feel that with the BJP demoralised after the Delhi and Rajasthan setbacks, this is an opportune time to strike.        
	The UPA is intact, we are likely to sew up the alliance with the Samajwadi Party. The BJP is short of allies. It has lost Jayalalithaa, and Mamata (Banerjee) is still uncertain on remaining in the NDA. Its pet issues like terror and inflation havent taken off, a Union minister said.        
	But the dominant view in the Congress is that if the party yields to the temptation to play politics on one-off wins, it may face the kind of flak the BJP did for trying to milk the terror strikes.        
	They cited how Rahul Gandhi had told Congress Working Committee members after the Mumbai carnage that winning elections wasnt the only objective of parties and they had to think of the nation.        
	Poll timing         
	Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said today the Lok Sabha elections are likely to be held between mid-April and mid-May. We have no particular interest in advancing it unless there is an absolutely great need for that.         
	But he added there were no procedural difficulties in holding them earlier.

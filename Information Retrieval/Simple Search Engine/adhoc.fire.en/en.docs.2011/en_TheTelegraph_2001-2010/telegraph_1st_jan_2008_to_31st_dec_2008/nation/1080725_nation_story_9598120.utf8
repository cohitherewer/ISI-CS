          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The Centre will now try to enact pending, pro-reforms bills that the Left had blocked, but will tread with caution on the money bills among them.        
	According to parliamentary convention, if the government loses a vote on a money bill, it loses the moral authority to stay in office.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said eight major economic bills relating to banking, insurance and pension awaited passage. Sources said the government would try to push them through during the monsoon session of Parliament, which begins on August 11.        
	Many bills are pending in Parliament. Its important to find ways by which these bills can be taken forward, Chidambaram said.        
	But many senior Congress leaders said the task might not be easy, especially with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, pending since 2005. It looks to introduce a new system of defined contribution, which the Left did not want.        
	The bill has certain financial implications that technically give it the money bill status.        
	Yes, we are keen to push these bills but we will be extremely careful. We will not do anything that could threaten the stability of the government, a source close to the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi said.        
	My assessment is that each piece of legislation will be carefully examined and moved once we are sure of its passage.        
	The other reforms bills include the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2005, which seeks to remove the 10 per cent voting cap for shareholders. The SBI (Amendment) Bill, 2006, is also stalled because the Left would not agree to reduce the governments shareholding in the State Bank of India.        
	The insurance bill has been with a group of ministers (GoM) since the Left shot it down because it proposes to raise the FDI cap in the sector from 26 to 49 per cent.        
	Sources said the monsoon session may also see some amendments to the special economic zone act provided the GoM agrees to a finance ministry proposal to levy the minimum alternative tax (MAT) on SEZ units. The mines ministry is expected to move amendments to the Mines and Minerals Development Act.        
	Chidambaram is confident the government can muster the numbers to get the bills through.        
	Well have to reach out to parties which may have voted against us on July 22 on the nuclear agreement but may be willing to support us on economic reforms, he said.        
	Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi echoed him. We will try to accelerate the unfinished tasks, he said after a cabinet meeting, the first after the trust vote.        
	BJP willing        
	Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said his party would be willing to consider helping the government speed up economic reforms if the Prime Minister took the initiative, a PTI report adds.        
	If Manmohan Singh himself takes an initiative and contacts L.K. Advani with specific proposals, the party will examine them, Sinha, a former finance minister, said.        
	But Sinha could not be reached to confirm the remarks. BJP leaders were unwilling to say if the quotes represented the party view.

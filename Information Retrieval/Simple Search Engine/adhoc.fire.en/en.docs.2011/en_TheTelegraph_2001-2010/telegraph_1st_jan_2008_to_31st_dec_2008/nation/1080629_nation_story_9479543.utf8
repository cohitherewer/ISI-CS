                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Woman vanishes, finger at MLA
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, June 28: A woman college lecturer has disappeared from Agra after writing to police that a Bahujan Samaj Party MLA was threatening to kill her for rejecting his advances.        
	The father of Shital Birla, 28, lodged an FIR on June 17 alleging his daughter was kidnapped by a powerful person on May 17 but did not name him, apparently out of fear.        
	Senior officers too are reluctant to identify the politician, a leading property dealer in Noida who is wanted in 17 criminal cases including attempt-to-murder and rioting. As a key Brahmin leader from Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh, he is said to be crucial to Mayavatis caste coalition.        
	Shitals father Dinesh Chandra Birla, a businessman based in Etah, has received threat calls, family sources said.        
	Shital, who was doing her PhD in chemistry and taught at Agra College, met the politician at a college programme in 2006 when he was not an MLA. He kept visiting her at her rented flat in the Lohamandi locality.        
	In December 2006, Shital lodged a police complaint saying the politician had turned up at her flat with a bodyguard and asked her to accompany him on a holiday. When she refused, he shouted filthy abuses. Shital, however, withdrew the complaint after the politician apologised.        
	The BSP leader re-established contact after becoming an MLA in May 2007. On May 10 this year, Shital sent a fresh complaint to the deputy inspector-general (Agra), N.K. Srivastava, alleging the politician was frequenting her flat and harassing her. He has evil designs and I fear for my life, she wrote.        
	Calls at the MLAs residence and office in Lucknow went unanswered.        
	The politician, believed to own assets worth Rs 500 crore, once worked as a driver for former BSP minister Amarmani Tripathi, who is serving a life term for the murder of poet Madhumita Shukla. Shukla is said to have had an affair with Tripathi and had allegedly threatened to expose him after she got pregnant.        
	Tripathis is one of several sex-and-crime scandals involving the states politicians. In October 2006, Meerut college professor Kavita Chaudhary was murdered allegedly by some Rashtriya Lok Dal ministers from the then Mulayam Singh Yadav government who are said to have sexually exploited her.        
	On June 14 this year, former BSP minister Anandsen Yadav was arrested on the charge of kidnapping and murdering Faizabad college girl Shashi, 24, apparently after an affair. Yadavs sacking as minister and arrest have been touted as examples of Mayavatis zero tolerance for crime.        
	We have not received any report on the (Shital) case. But Mayavati has a clear stand on this. If proved guilty, the MLA has to be behind bars, a party general secretary said.        
	She (Shital) wrote to me before her disappearance and mentioned the name of a BSP MLA, DIG Srivastava acknowledged. I cannot identify the MLA since investigations are on. She had complained, among other things, that she was being stalked by the MLAs men and feared for her life.

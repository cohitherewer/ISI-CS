          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, May 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said he was still hopeful of seeing the nuclear deal through and that good sense would prevail on its opponents.        
	I am hopeful so long as we are discussing it, Singh said, a day after the government nudged the Left about the urgency to go to the IAEA board of governors for finalising the safeguards text.        
	I hope good sense will prevail, the Prime Minister told reporters in response to questions on whether the deal was dead. I am negotiating in good faith.        
	Singh was speaking on the sidelines of a military investiture at Rashtrapati Bhavan. His comments came amid the Centres renewed bid to enlist the Lefts support for going ahead with securing the India-specific safeguards agreement.         
	After yesterdays Left-UPA meeting on the nuclear deal failed to make much headway, the two sides decided to sit at the talks table again on May 28. The Left parties have said they would decide their strategy by May 23.         
	On the womens reservation bill, which saw Parliament turn into a battlefield yesterday, the Prime Minister said there was consensus in the cabinet on the legislation.        
	The statement indicated that Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal, one of the principal opponents of the bill, had agreed to the decision.        
	A broad consensus on the bill had been reached in the cabinet, Singh said, terming the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha a first step.        
	The bill has been referred to the standing committee including members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.         
	I hope that the standing committee will evolve a broad consensus, Singh said.        
	Hope was also the keyword in the Prime Ministers reply to questions about growing inflation. The current rate of 7.5 per cent will come down hopefully in the next three months, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 20: The BJP today launched a two-pronged attack on the UPA over the rising prices and the nuclear deal standoff.        
	The party suggested that the Congress-Left wrangling on the deal was a ploy to divert the countrys attention from the galloping inflation.        
	I do not think that the Congress is going to give up power it has enjoyed for four years, BJP chief Rajnath Singh said in an allusion to the perceived threat of the Left pulling the government down.        
	Later, in a media release, he credited himself with having foreseen that the UPA would lead the country to double-digit inflation.        
	Although Rajnath did not directly comment on the nuclear deal, about which the BJP is ambivalent, he hit out at the Left apparently for its opposition. The BJPs concern on inflation is completely unlike (that of) the Left parties who are more concerned about safeguarding Chinas interests, he said.        
	Party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy harked back to 1995 when inflation figures were high and Manmohan Singh was finance minister and P. Chidambaram the commerce minister. He said they had broken their past record.

	Patna, May 7: A mob thrashed a suspected criminal and poured acid into his eyes at a village in Purnea on the Bihar-Bengal border, 350km from here.         
	Confirming the incident, deputy inspector-general of Purnea range S.C. Singh said: Police have arrested all five persons involved and we have registered a named FIR.         
	Residents of Radhapur caught hold of Vinay Yadav alias Pappu Yadav, 30, and poured acid into his eyes after beating him up. The police said he had probably suffered permanent eye damage.        
	A police team rescued Vinay from the villagers and admitted him to a hospital.        
	Vinay Yadav was involved in cases of murder and abduction, the police said. He figured as an accused in a murder case in his (Radhapur) village earning the distrust of a section of villagers, they added.

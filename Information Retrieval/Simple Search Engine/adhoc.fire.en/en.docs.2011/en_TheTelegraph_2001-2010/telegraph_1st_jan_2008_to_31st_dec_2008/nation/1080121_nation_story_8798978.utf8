	Cuttack, Jan. 20: The Netaji Birthplace Museum will exhibit some never-before-seen photographs dealing with Subhas Chandra Boses political and personal life  from January 23.
    
	With the exception of a few, most of the pictures were never displayed before, said museum conservator and assistant curator Arundhati Mishra. Some of them photographs were chemically treated and restored, added the official. The photographs are snippets of an enigmatic life of the charismatic leader taken in a period between 1920 and 1940. 
    
	We plan to get a new room ready with more than 50 photographs along with five-decade-old household articles (mostly crockery) used by the Bose family, to mark his birth anniversary on January 23, Mishra said, while talking to The Telegraph. Captain D. Dasan and one Sanyasi Rao of Andhra Pradesh donated some of the photographs, while others were obtained by the museum from different archives. Several others were found among records, documents and photographs stacked in one of the rooms of Janakinath Bhavan. 
    
	Janakinath Bhavan, the ancestral house of Bose, is located in Oriya Bazaar. In 2003, the museum authorities took over the two-storied home from Netaji Seva Sadan Trust Board as a part of the joint-project of the Centre and state to convert it into a memorial.
    
	With state-of-the-art lighting system, innovative display system and strict security the museum is also coming up with an interpretation centre  which will have a touch-screen display giving all details to the museum visitors.

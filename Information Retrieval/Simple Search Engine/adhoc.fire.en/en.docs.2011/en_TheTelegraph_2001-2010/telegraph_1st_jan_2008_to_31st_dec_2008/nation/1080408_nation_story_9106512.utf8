          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Small Success                                   
	Raipur, April 7: Theres a lesson to be learnt in the small village  Saalthor  located some 10km from the district headquarters of Kanker.         
	In the past two decades the villages population has decreased, instead of increasing. According to the 1991 Census, Saathlor, a part of Pathod gram panchayat, had a population of 381. In the 2001 census, it registered a marginal change of 390.         
	According to a Census conducted last month, the population has again gone down to 366. Family planning programmes have been implemented in a positive way here and both husbands and wives seem equally aware of the benefits, said Asha Kushwaha, a health worker.         
	An interesting matter is that every family in Saathlor has a member who is a government official. This is the reason why the villagers are aware of government programmes and find such schemes useful, explained gram panchayat secretary Arun Nayak.         
	This is the model village which has redefined the slogan of hum do, hamare do, Nayak added.         
	Of the 70 families living in Saathlor, 50 have two children. The rest comprise either unmarried members or single-child households.         
	According to Nayak, people here have realised that they can take care of their children, if a family is smaller.         
	In fact, this awareness has paid dividends in other sectors, too.         
	The primary and middle schools in the village enjoy a cent per cent attendance and results that have made the teachers, parents and students proud.         
	This is no doubt a model village. The students here are alert and study. None have failed exams so far, said Anil Sharma, a schoolteacher.        
	Villagers state that the dip in the population graph has made the economic graph rise.

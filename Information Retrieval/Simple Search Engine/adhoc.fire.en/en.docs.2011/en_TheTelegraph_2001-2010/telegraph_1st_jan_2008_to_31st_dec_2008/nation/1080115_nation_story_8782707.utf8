	Mumbai, Jan. 14: Indian cricket broke a financial record today when over Rs 4,000 crore was paid for the telecast rights to a tournament.
 
	Sony and the Singapore-based World Sports Group, making a joint bid, bagged 10-year rights for the upcoming Indian Premier League at a record $1.026 billion (Rs 4,032 crore).
 
	Sony-WSG will pay the Board of Control for Cricket in India $918 million for the telecast rights and $108 million for the promotion of the tournament that starts this April.
 
	This is the highest amount paid by any broadcaster in India for the TV rights for a cricket tournament.
 
	The deal is marginally lower than the $1.1 billion paid by ESPN-Star Sports to the International Cricket Council in December 2006 for all cricket played under the world bodys banner for eight years.
 
	The Indian Premier league is the BCCIs official Twenty20 tournament, started in response to Zees breakaway Indian Cricket League, which was launched last April.
 
	Media planners called the deal overpriced.
 
	Its true that the ICC World Twenty20 win has made cricket red-hot for the advertiser again after the drubbing at the World Cup. Still, the deal seems overpriced and I wonder how the revenues are going to be generated, a senior executive from a top media-planning firm said.
 
	The ICL experience with Twenty20 cricket has met with cold viewer response hellip;. I feel the money is a bit too much for a virgin project like this.
 
	Apart from Sony-WSG, the bidders included ESPN, Neo Sports and NDTV.
 
	Announcing the deal, board vice-president Lalit Modi said bidding for the IPLs eight franchises or teams will open on January 24.
 
	The base price for owning each of the eight franchises is $50 million. Expect a lot of action on January 24 and February 7, when the players will be auctioned for the franchises, Modi said.
 
	Shah Rukh Khan, Vijay Mallya and Anil Ambani mdash; even Hollywood star Russell Crowe mdash; have said they want to own an IPL team.
 
	Each team will play all the others on a home-and-away basis, with the top four sides going through to the semi-finals. There will be 59 matches in all with a prize money of $3 million for the champion team.
 
	The winner and runner-up will qualify for the ICC-sponsored Champions League, to be played in October 2008.

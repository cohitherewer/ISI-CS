          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 18: This Ganesh puja, it will be devotion without drama here.         
	The Cuttack administration has clamped a ban on film songs in music programmes at 400-odd city pujas during Ganesh puja festival that begins from September 3.         
	The diktat was issued today on the basis of decisions taken in a pre-puja district administration meeting held on Saturday.         
	Cuttack collector Kishore Mohanty, who presided over the meeting, said he expected programmes to be restricted to devotional songs and no film music.         
	The district administration also rejected the plea to relax ban on the use of loudspeakers after 10pm. All programmes have to end by 10pm, Mohanty said.        
	The Supreme Court had banned the use of loudspeakers between 10pm and 6am in residential areas to check noise pollution.         
	Orissa High Court had issued strict orders for implementing the ban.         
	Ganesh Chaturthi in the recent past has gained commercial proportions with increasing number of mandaps presenting music and dance programmes. Around 432 pujas are organised in the city at present.         
	The administration has fixed September 26 as the deadline for immersion beginning from September 12.         
	A 65-decibel limit has been imposed on bands accompanying the immersion processions.         
	Only one speaker box and two microphones would be allowed with each procession, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dalai plea to Chinese kin
                                                                                                               Dalai plea to Chinese kin
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, March 28: The Dalai Lama today reached out to the large Chinese community across the world to find a way out of the situation in Lhasa and referred to an assurance on Tibet from Chairman Mao Zedong in 1954.         
	Referring to the Chinese as his brothers and sisters  wherever you may be  he issued a personal appeal in Delhi that stressed on an urgent need to seek a peaceful and mutually beneficial solution through dialogue. The Dalai Lama said that even at this juncture, he had expressed willingness to the Chinese to work together to bring about peace and stability in Tibet.         
	So far seen as mostly addressing the West, the Dalai Lamas new line of communication with the Chinese community, especially with the diaspora, could be a significant shift in strategy.         
	In the appeal, the Buddhist monk not only stood by autonomy for Tibet but also made an attempt to clear his name of Chinese accusations.         
	Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you I have no desire to seek Tibets separation. Nor do I have any wish to drive a wedge between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples, he said.         
	His secretary Chhime Chhoekypa explained that most Chinese do not know the state of relations between the Chinese and the Tibetan people. He confirmed that since most within China would not have access to the message immediately, the focus was on the many million Chinese diaspora from whom an understanding of the issue would be conveyed to people in China.         
	A support base of intellectuals within China is understood to have spurred the change in tack. At least 30 Chinese intellectuals have spoken for the Tibet issue. One of them, writer Wang Lisong, has written an article, A cry for Tibet from within China, Chhoekypa told The Telegraph over phone from Dharamsala.        
	The Dalai Lama said in the appeal that his major concern was to ensure survival of the Tibetan peoples distinctive culture, language and identity.         
	Even as Chinas accusations that he had masterminded the violence in Tibet continued, the Dalai Lama said: As a simple monk who strives to live his daily life according to Buddhist precepts, I assure you of the sincerity of my motivation.         
	Urging the Chinese leadership to exercise wisdom and initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan people, he appealed them to make sincere efforts to contribute to the stability and harmony of the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) and avoid creating rifts between the two nationalities.         
	The Dalai Lama said that despite his repeated support for the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese authorities have accused him of trying to sabotage the games. He accused Beijing of doing this with the intention of creating a rift between the Chinese people and myself.

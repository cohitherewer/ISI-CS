	Eyesores back in court gaze    
	They are ugly, too big for comfort and almost always illegal but Mumbais hoardings are back under court glare.    
	Bombay High Court has given the authorities four weeks to explain what steps they have taken to remove such hoardings. The petition has been filed by a Mumbai NGO, which has called the hoardings eyesores. The aim is to have them removed so trees can be protected and more open spaces left for residents.     
	The NGO, Janhit Manch, has pointed out that hoardings congratulating religious and political leaders on their birthdays or glorifying political parties often encroach upon public land and rob the citizens of open spaces. Trees are pruned and power stolen for these billboards.    
	Chief Justice Swantanter Kumar and Justice A.P. Deshpande issued notices to the state, Centre, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and the civic bodies of Thane and Pune.     
	The petition says those putting up illegal hoardings can get three months jail and be fined up to Rs 2,000 under the Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1995.         
	On radar: airport upgrade    
	Chennai airports expansion plan seems close to takeoff.    
	The public investment board recently cleared the Rs 1,808-crore project, work on which could begin by September.     
	Construction of runway, taxiway, parking bays is likely to be completed in 20 months, by April 2010. The terminal buildings should be ready in 26 months, by October 2010.    
	The Tamil Nadu Government has handed more than 130 acres, includes 21 acres of defence land, to the Airports Authority of India for the secondary runway.     
	The domestic terminals will cater to 16 million passengers annually, up from the present 10 million. They will have a peak hour capacity of 5,360 passengers, with 99 check-in counters, 10 conveyor belts and nine aero-bridges. The international terminal will be able to handle seven million passengers annually, up from three million.    
	Track record for helpline    
	Rail Sampark, the national enquiry for the Indian Railways, receives as many as 5 lakh calls a day, and answers most queries within two minutes of the first ring, the government revealed on the first anniversary of the service recently.     
	But officials in charge of the service have larger dreams  to popularise the helpline to a point where it registers 20 lakh calls a day, possibly by the end of this year.    
	It is a service that is a revolution in the making, with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporations Internet ticketing services already proving a runaway success, IRCTC chief Nalin Singhal said.    
	The Integrated Train Enquiry Services (ITeS) is available at the number 139. Most calls are answered within three rings and are attended within two minutes, Akashdeep Singh, chief operating officer of Bharat BPO, the joint venture that runs the enquiry service said.     
	The idea is to connect with masses. A service that is meant for all should be made effectively and easily available, Singh said.         
	Tech gripe    
	Indias Silicon Valley is sore over the lack of tech cradles.    
	Chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa recently expressed anguish at the central governments decision not to allot any of the new Indian Institutes of Technology to Karnataka despite having made several requests.    
	Not the one to give up easily, he said he had written to the Prime Minister and HRD minister pressing the case again. Being a technology hub, it was a surprise not even one of the eight new IITs had come Karnatakas way, he said. (PTI)

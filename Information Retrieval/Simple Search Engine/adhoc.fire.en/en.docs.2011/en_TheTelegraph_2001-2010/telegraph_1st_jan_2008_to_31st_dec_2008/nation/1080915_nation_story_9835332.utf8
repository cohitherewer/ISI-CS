	Patna, Sept. 14: The official death toll in north Bihar rose to 131 today with the recovery of 11 more bodies in Supaul.        
	As the toll rose, a state religious body  Anand Marg  decided to take up the task of disposing of carcasses of animals, especially cattle, killed by the torrential Kosi current.         
	The Anand Marg Universal Relief Team (Amurt) has so far located bodies and carcasses at Basantpur village in Supaul. It began its task after the district administration gave its nod for the task.        
	Anand Marg would carry out the job under the supervision of Vivekaranjanananda Avadhuta and Prabhat Kumar. The organisation and the individual are running 13 camps, an Amurt release said.        
	Sources in the state disaster management department at he capital confirmed that the administration recovered 10 bodies from Supaul and another from Araria, taking the toll to 131.         
	There is a possibility of more bodies being found, a department source said.         
	After showing initial signs of improvement, the situation in north Bihar turned grim yet again with heavy rains in catchment areas of Kosi in upper Nepal with Barah barrage releasing 97,277 cusec of water instead of 70,000 cusec on Friday.         
	The water is expected to rise by a foot in the five north Bihar districts of Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria and Purnea.         
	Relief operations are being carried out on a war-footing with the help of IAF helicopters and Indian Army boats, sources said, adding that over 29.65 lakh people in 1,000 villages of north-eastern districts still remained in the grip of the flood.        
	Over a million people have been evacuated so far to safer places by Indian Army, the navy and National Disaster Response Force personnel. More than 3.50 lakh have been provided shelter in 324 camps.

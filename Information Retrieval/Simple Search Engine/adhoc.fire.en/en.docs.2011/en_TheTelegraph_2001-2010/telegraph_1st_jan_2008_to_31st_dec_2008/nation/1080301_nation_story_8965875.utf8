	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 29: AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi will launch his Discovery India journey with a four-day visit to Orissas tribal heartland, one of the poverty-hit zones in India, from March 7.         
	He has chosen Orissa as the starting point of his nation-wide trip to understand tribal issues, farmers problems and Dalits agony better, said the National Youth Congress president, Ashok Tanwar, while briefing reporters here.         
	Tanwar said Rahul wanted to interact directly with the people to have first-hand knowledge of their problems.         
	During his visit, Rahul will cover 13 districts, most of which are tribal-populated. Party sources said Rahul had planned his trip in order to regain the Congresss traditional vote bank  tribals and Dalits  and win the support of youths and students, who constitute more than 50 per cent of the states population.         
	Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee president Jaydev Jena reminded all of the affection the states people had for Indira and Rajiv Gandhi. Sonia and her son wish to renew the old relationship, he added.         
	Rahul is expected to start his trip from Nuapara and travel through several other districts, including tribal-dominated Kalahandi, Koraput, Nowrangpur, Rayagada, Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Angul and Mayurbhanj.         
	Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had visited Kalahandi district in early eighties following media reports of starvation deaths and the sale of a 16-year-old Bonita by her sister-in-law. Subsequently, he had launched a number of anti-poverty programmes there.         
	National Students Union president Nadim Javed said Rahul would focus on students during the trip since they constitute 54 per cent of Indias population. His visit to Orissa would motivate youths and students of the state and help build a powerful movement.         
	The leader is scheduled to address a Save Forest Rally at Bhawanipatna in Kalahandi on March 7. He will also address rallies at Rourkela and Banki, along with a tribal and Dalit rally at Bamra, public meetings at Angul and Berhampur, a tribal youth rally at Karanjia and a college students meeting at Bhubaneswar. Besides, he will visit cholera-affected Dasmantpur area in Koraput and address a tribal gathering.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shah Rukh: Dont light up                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 26: The Centre today approached the Supreme Court to stymie a last-minute bid by cigarette companies to stop implementation of the ban on smoking in public places from October 2.        
	In its petition, the government said the general public would suffer immensely and irreparable loss and injury would be caused in case the notification dated May 30, 2008, is not implemented.         
	Several cigarette makers, led by ITC and Indian Hotels Association, had moved Delhi High Court arguing the notification made no distinction between private and public space. The rule was unjustified as it included private offices such as a lawyers chamber or an artists studio, they said.        
	After an earlier bunch of petitions filed by the companies, Madras High Court had stayed the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2006, under which the rules were notified.        
	The Centre urged the Supreme Court today to stay the high court order and permit it to implement the act and the rules till the issue was finally decided by the apex court.         
	The Centres petition will be taken up on Tuesday.

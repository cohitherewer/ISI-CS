The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mission stalls IIT exam plan in Singapore 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mission stalls IIT exam plan in Singapore 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: An IIT plan to take entrance exams to Singapore has frozen with Indias high commission in the island nation refusing to spare manpower for holding the test there.         
	The high commission in Singapore has written to the human resource development ministry that its officials will be unable to help conduct the exam, top government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	Singapore was expected to become only the second centre  after Dubai  outside India to host the IIT Joint Entrance Examination. Dubai held the exam for the first time this year in April  182 students appeared for the test there, and three of them qualified.         
	HRD ministry officials conceded that it would be next to impossible to conduct the JEE in Singapore without assistance from the high commission there.         
	Officially, the plan to hold the JEE in Singapore in 2009 is not yet off, it is just stalled. But it is next to impossible to hold the exam there unless the high commission helps us conduct the test, a higher education official said.         
	The request to hold the JEE in Singapore was motivated by a desire within the premier technology institutes to expand Indias top engineering school globally, an IIT director said.         
	The IITs are today also the best engineering schools in the region. There is demand from foreign students to join the institutes, and we want to capitalise on that demand.         
	The influx of foreign students will also help create an international atmosphere in the IITs, the director added.         
	Higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal has now decided to ask the standing committee of the IIT council (SCIC) to take a final call on the plan to hold the JEE in Singapore, sources said. The IIT council is the highest decision-making body of the institutes.         
	Last month, the joint admission board (JAB) of the IITs  the highest policy-making body for the JEE  requested the HRD ministry that the institutes be allowed to hold the test in Singapore from 2009, IIT sources said.         
	The HRD ministry wrote to the Indian high commission in Singapore, seeking its assistance in conducting the 2009 JEE. The high commission, in its response, bluntly refused to spare any staff for holding the exam, invigilation duties or any other JEE-related work, a government source said.         
	The island nation had earlier requested India to set up an IIT in Singapore to cater to foreign students from Southeast Asia.         
	But the Centre rejected that proposal arguing that it was already stretched setting up new IITs in India. The government has promised eight new IITs under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, of which six started classes this year.

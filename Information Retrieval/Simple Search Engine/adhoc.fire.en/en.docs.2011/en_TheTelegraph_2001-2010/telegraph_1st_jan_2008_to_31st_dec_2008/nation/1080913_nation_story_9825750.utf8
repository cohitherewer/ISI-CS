          NALIN VERMA                          Rahul Gandhi inspects the flood-hit area of Azamgarh on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Sept. 12: Rahul Gandhi came, waded through slushy streets, hugged people and went off leaving hope behind among starving people of Kosi-ravaged north Bihar.        
	Relief camp residents, who he met, were busy discussing how the scion was different from others of his ilk. He hugged my six-year-old, said Sushil Devi (35), from Jankinagar camp.         
	He (Rahul) was unique. He asked a girl, Jaya (12), to read out a story from her book at Bathnaha railway station camp. Afterwards, Rahul, too told a story to Jaya and her friends, who he hugged. Now, the children are waiting for home to come back, said a worker who watched the interaction. What won the hearts of the marooned millions was the Congress leaders common man-like approach. Unlike others, who confined themselves to an aerial survey, of Saharsa, Madhepura, Araria, Purnea and Katihar, Rahul landed at Bagogara airport by a service plane. Then he took a 250km journey by road frequently making stops to meet people on the streets and in 30 camps over two days.        
	For his maiden visit the scion visited six Muslim-Yadav dominated constituencies that had been the pocket borough of his grandmother. The Congress lost its stronghold in the region in the wake of V.P. Singh-sponsored Mandal Commission wave that swept Rajiv Gandi away from power in the region.        
	Observers are speculating if the young Amethi MPs visit will prove what Indira Gandis visit to Belchhi village in Patna in 1977 had proved.         
	Indira Gandi, it is said, had gone into a shell following her defeat to Janata Party in 1977. She began her political career afresh by a riding an elephant to inaccessible Belchhi where some land-less people had been massacred by the gentry. The visit is seen as a prelude to her comeback in 1979, as rural people chanted: Sukhi roti khayengein; Indira ko bulangein (We will eat dry roti, but will call Indira back).         
	Will Rahuls maiden visit bring similar fortune to the Congress here? Only time will answer that. But, for now the people look forward to his return once more.

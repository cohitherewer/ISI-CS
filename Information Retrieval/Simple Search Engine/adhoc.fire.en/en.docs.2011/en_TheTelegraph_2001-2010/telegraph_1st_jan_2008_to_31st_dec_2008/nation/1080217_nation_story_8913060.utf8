                                                                                                               Family feud rears head in TN cable clash
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Feb. 16: Former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran has accused police of trying to force members of a cable network to join a rival operator, which some claim has the blessings of his powerful estranged relative M.K. Azhagiri.        
	Maran, who looked after communications in the Congress-led central coalition before he fell out with Tamil Nadu chief minister and great uncle M. Karunanidhi, met the Chennai police commissioner today and handed over a complaint.        
	The DMK MP said operators of Sumangali Cable Vision, of the SUN Network group, were being whisked away by the police without assigning any reason and threatened with false cases if they didnt change their signals to Hathway Cable and Datacom Pvt Ltd.        
	It is a very pathetic situation for family members of these operators who have been frantically calling me all through the night to know the whereabouts of their husbands. I am unable to understand how a situation like this can prevail in a democratic country like ours, Maran, who owns the SUN network with brother Kalanidhi, said.        
	The SCV controls the states cable market and the turf war has come at a time the DMK regime has put on hold the state-owned Arasu Cable TV Corporation.        
	While some SCV operators claimed Hathway had the blessings of Azhagiri, Karunanidhis Madurai-based elder son, the developments were the latest in the standoff between Maran and the partys first family.        
	Last year, the Madurai office of Dinakaran was attacked after the Tamil daily, part of the SUN group, published a survey that showed Azhagiri enjoyed lesser popularity than other members of the DMK patriarchs family.        
	Maran today told the commissioner the police high-handedness was a clear violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and asked him to ensure the safe return of the operators who were picked up by the police.

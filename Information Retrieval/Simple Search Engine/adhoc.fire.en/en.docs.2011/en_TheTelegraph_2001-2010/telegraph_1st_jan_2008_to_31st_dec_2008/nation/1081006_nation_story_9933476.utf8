	Carve-up plan for civic body              
	The Chennai civic body could be pregnant with triplets.    
	Local administration minister M.K. Stalin recently said the government was considering a proposal to carve up the 320-year-old Corporation of Chennai into three entities.    
	Minister Stalin said an expert committee appointed by the government had recommended the body be split into three.    
	The panel suggested one body for the south, based in Tambaram, and the other for the north, to be headquartered in Ambattur. The main corporation will remain where it is.    
	A final decision on the split, however, will be taken before the next local elections, which are scheduled in 2011.     
	The corporation (previously Madras) is the countrys oldest. A charter was issued on December 30, 1607, by East India Company constituting the Town of Fort St George  which is how it used to be known then.    
	The population of the city has gone up from five lakh in 1921 to more than 42 lakh now, the corporation site said. The area has also increased several fold in that time. (UNI)      
	Say bye to parking pangs            
	Indias cyber city is poised to reboot its parking facilities.    
	The first of the changes is a pay-and-park system in four heavily clogged roads, the first such facility in the city. The new amenity is a joint venture of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and Smart Interpark India.    
	The system is being offered on four of the citys most clogged roads. These are in the Gandhi Statue (Secunderabad) stretch, Abids, Basheer Bagh and Ameerpet areas.    
	Interpark operates the system on build-operate-share-and-transfer basis. In all, 19 solar-powered parking meters, imported from France, are installed on these roads. These work between 9am and 11pm, Interpark said.    
	The parking fee for an hour is Rs 10 for four-wheelers and Rs 5 for two-wheelers. (PTI)      
	Houses shaky, promise firm            
	The ground is being cleared for a policy on shaky Mumbai houses.    
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh recently promised the new rules. The assurance came against the backdrop of 20 deaths when an unsafe Byculla building caved in last month.    
	The city is grappling with the challenge of reconstructing more than 19,000 dilapidated buildings, he said, suggesting the scope of the task would be daunting.    
	Also on the way are what Deshmukh chose to call five lakh rental houses. The dwelling units, which he said would come up in the next five years, are to be given out to the poor at rents ranging from Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 per month.    
	The reconstruction policy is being pitched as one of the many projects the chief minister has lined up for the development of amenities in the countrys financial capital.    
	Mumbai MLAs played an important role in making me chief minister. I will be keen on Mumbais development, Deshmukh said, to ripples of laughter at a Congress programme.      
	Fast forward              
	Delhiites tired of waiting for building plan approvals can cheer up  special camps have been set for the purpose.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has taken the initiative to speed up the process of clearing such applications for sanction and regularisation of the plans.    
	One such camp was organised recently when many of those who had filed their papers benefited from on-the-spot disposal of their applications. Many such camps were held over the past month. (PTI)

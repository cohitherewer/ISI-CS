  -   Cinema and sport mix in high drama
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta at the news conference in Mumbai. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: That hug was worth $9,25,000.        
	Team Mohali had just snapped up Irfan Pathan and it was celebration time for co-owners Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia.        
	It summed up the mood as the premier league drama unfolded, scene by scene, at the Hilton Towers in suburban Mumbai today.        
	The first scene was played out long before the curtains went up at 11 this morning. Shutters whirred and flashbulbs dazzled as the high-profile bidders  Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Vijay Mallya, Ness, Preity and Shah Rukh Khan  entered the hotel.        
	But the actual drama was played out in a room, away from the prying eyes of the media. Sources present in the room said as high-profile auctioneer Richard Madley took centre stage on a podium, the eight teams sat at their tables, four on either side of the man with the hammer.        
	While Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bangalore sat on his right, Mohali, Chennai, Calcutta and Jaipur took their place on his left.        
	Shah Rukh came with his wife Gauri. He seemed happy with the players he got and flashed a smile at his captain, Sourav, who sat a little distance away to the actors right.        
	Dravid, however, sat next to Mallya, who owns the Bangalore team. Keeping them company was commentator Charu Sharma, who was seen exchanging notes with the Kingfisher boss.        
	There were no verbal duels between the bidders, but emotions ran high.         
	As Mohali snapped up Pathan for a whopping $925,000, Preity and Ness embraced.        
	Preity, who wore a blood-red knee-length dress, came out twice to speak to the media, but didnt say much.        
	I am looking forward to great matches and a great tournament, she said, clapping like a child when IPL chairman Lalit Modi, who sat next to her, announced that Mohali had pouched fast bowler Sreesanth.        
	Madley, the central character in todays drama, played his part. He brought the hammer down ever so slowly, keeping the bidders on edge.        
	He wouldnt reveal the outcome till the last minute. Once he quipped that his hand was shaking, commenting on the huge sum that a certain player was sold for, making everyone burst into laughter, said a source.        
	Madley later said he had been firm, friendly but fair. Give me some credit. All the bidders went home with a smile on their faces, even after all the money they had spent. That doesnt happen often.        
	Shah Rukh was in his elements, too. I am passionate about sports, and if it hadnt been for an injury that I suffered when I was young, I would have been a sportsman. Its the passion for sports that has driven all of us to take up IPL, he said.        
	I dont know if it will do well, but I see this as a great opportunity to nurture talent and promote the game. I see this as a promotion of sports, not just cricket.        
	Mallya said the best thing about the league was its structure. It will give a chance to a large number of domestic players. The youngsters will have the chance to earn money. They will play along with international stars and this will improve their game.         
	Modi, who introduced the team owners to reporters, pointed to Ness Wadia of Bombay Dyeing. Then, turning to Preity, addressed her as Mrs.... before stopping and apologising to peals of laughter.

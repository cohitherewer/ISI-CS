	Bangalore, Oct. 19: The wife and children of a former Indian Air Force sergeant were found dead in their home this morning, their throats slit.        
	Police are quizzing D.S. Yadav, who said he left home around 7.30 when his family was asleep and found them dead when he returned three hours later. Yadav told the police he found the door ajar when he returned.         
	He said his 35-year-old wife, Anu, was lying with her throat slit in the kitchen. His daughter, Kirti, 14, and son Aditya, 11, were in the bedroom. Their throats had been slit too, he said.         
	The 42-year-old, who retired from the air force three years ago and works for a construction firm, said he had gone to Yeshwantpur station to get tickets.         
	The family was supposed to go to Haryana. Yadav said he went to the station to advance the travel date from November 5 to November 3.         
	The murder weapon has not been found. The police ruled out murder for gain as the jewellery on Anu and Kirti were intact. But Yadav later said jewellery worth Rs 30,000 was missing from the almirah as was a mobile phone.         
	The police suspect someone known to the family committed the murders. The three were killed by someone known to them after he gained entry into the house. Yadav is one of the suspects as he is the only one who saw them before and after the murder, an officer said.         
	He told us he left his Vidyaranyapura home at 7.30am for Yeshwantpur railway station, 6km away. He got back around 10.30am and found the house door ajar and the bodies with their throats slit. We are also questioning neighbours, the officer added.         
	The police are waiting for the medical report to ascertain the time of the murders.

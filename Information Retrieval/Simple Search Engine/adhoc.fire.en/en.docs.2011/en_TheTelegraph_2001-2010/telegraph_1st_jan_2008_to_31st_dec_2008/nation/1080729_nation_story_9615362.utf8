	Music, to break Bhopal silence              
	Sufi melodies and popular rhythms from one of the countrys best-known fusion bands at a single concert held with a unique aim: break the Prime Ministers silence on demands made by survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy.    
	Groups and individuals across musical genres performed one evening recently at Jantar Mantar, exhorting survivors of the worlds worst industrial disaster that a new dawn was close.    
	The performers included Indian Ocean frontman Rahul Ram and upcoming sufi star Dhruv Sangari.     
	Over 50 survivors had walked from Bhopal to Delhi on March 28, demanding a government commission to look into shortcomings in the rehabilitation of the victims.    
	Early on December 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide plant in the heart of Bhopal, killing over 3,000, according to government figures.     
	Tens of thousands suffered burns, including mutilations that havent spared even subsequent generations.    
	The survivors, including over a dozen children, also demanded that Dow Chemicals, which now owns Union Carbide, be punished.         
	US pat for animal cure              
	An American pat for Tamil Nadus vets  that recognition came recently for a state where an incident of a serial poisoning of dogs had occurred not long ago.    
	An all-girl group of veterinary students from the Michigan State University recently praised the way local vets treated animals in distress. The group of 11 was here under an exchange programme with the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. We saw an injured horse get the best treatment. It would have been allowed to die a natural death or given euthanasia in the US if it were of little use, said Amanda Audo.     
	Another student raved about the culture of India and the commitment of its vets. Vice-chancellor P. Thangaraju said 10 of his students would visit the US next month. (PTI)    
	Takeoff sign for airport              
	A green signal for Mumbais planned new airport is on the radar.    
	Paving the way for the Rs 9,970-crore project, in Navi Mumbai, is an amendment to the coastal management zone rules that forbid construction in areas close to the sea.    
	The state brass put forth its views on the amendments at a meeting with central officials in Delhi recently.    
	The draft sent by the Centre allows airport construction in the coastal zone, a senior official of the environment department said. The final draft is yet to be designed but, with the Union environment ministrys in-principle approval, no problems are expected.    
	A small portion of the land, about 150 of the 2,000 hectares required, has mangroves and falls under the area in which construction cant be undertaken. Airfield activities are not allowed in this zone, the official said.    
	A request has been to retain a clause supporting the airports construction in the final draft of the coastal management. The new hub, to be built through public-private partnership, is scheduled to be ready by the end of 2012.        
	Ration boost              
	Many more of Delhis poor could join the list of ration beneficiaries once a government plan to update records takes off.    
	Delhi food minister Haroon Yusuf said recently that 80,000 new ration cards would be issued to replace those that havent been renewed, either because of migration or a rise in the income levels of these families.    
	pplications will be invited from below-poverty-line families with annual incomes of less than Rs 24,200 soon. (PTI)

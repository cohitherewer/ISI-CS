          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Ahluwalia                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Montek Singh Ahluwalia has questioned plans to set up new central universities as world-class institutions, joining a chorus of concern at a concept mooted by the Prime Minister.        
	It will take 15 to 20 years for a new university to achieve world-class standards. And world-class universities require resources that are way beyond the scope of the government, the Planning Commission deputy chairperson said today at a Ficci meet on higher education.        
	According to the 11th five-year plan, India is to start 14 central government-run world-class universities  including one in Calcutta  with the specific mandate of competing with the best higher education institutions across the globe. The idea is part of the Prime Ministers vision to transform India into a global knowledge hub.        
	Ahluwalia urged the private sector to step in to help implement the project but admitted that setting up faculties of a world-class order would be a major challenge.         
	He pointed to the massive resource gap India faces and said it was a major roadblock to the governments plans for unprecedented expansion in higher education.        
	Ahluwalia cited the plan panels analysis of the wide gap between funds available and those required to meet the promises made by the government. The Telegraph had first reported this discrepancy late last month.        
	Ahluwalias comments reflect views expressed by a number of vice-chancellors at two meetings with the University Grants Commission earlier this year.        
	Ahluwalia cautioned industry against expecting major structural changes in the education sector soon because of impending elections.         
	Unlike the economic reforms, there isnt yet a constituency for education reforms. To that extent, education is really in a pre-reform environment, Ahluwalia said.

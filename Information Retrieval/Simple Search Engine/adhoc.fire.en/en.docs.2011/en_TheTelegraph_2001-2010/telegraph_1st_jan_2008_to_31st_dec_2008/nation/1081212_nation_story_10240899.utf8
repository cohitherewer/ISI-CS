          RASHEED KIDWAI                                          (From top) Jyotiraditya Scindia, Kamal Nath, Arjun Singh, Suresh Pachauri: Food for thought				                                 
	Bhopal, Dec. 11: His campaign meals were lip-smacking, but all that Jyotiraditya Scindia is licking now are his wounds.        
	None of the candidates fielded by the Congress MP from Guna, his constituency, has tasted victory.        
	While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and other Madhya Pradesh BJP leaders toiled day and night, Scindias focus wavered towards the dinner table.         
	Before the young royal would fly to a campaign site, his family cook Ravi Thapa would be there, preparing his meal. If it was spaghetti with ginger chicken in Chanderi, it was chicken in tartar sauce at some other venue.         
	Now, after the hurly-burly of elections is over, the sumptuous meals must have given way to food for thought.        
	The Congress lost in seven of the eight Assembly segments of a redrawn Guna after the delimitation drive.        
	The lone segment where the party emerged victorious was Pichore, but the winner was K.P. Singh, a known Scindia-baiter.        
	Gwalior city, too, almost turned its back on its former prince. Of the four Assembly seats in the city, the Congress bagged only one.        
	Unlike Scindia, Kamal Naths meals were spartan  chewing gum and diet coke. But the poll results  his nominees won just three seats in his parliamentary constituency Chhindwara  have given him something else to chew on.        
	Union human resource minister Arjun Singh was another veteran left eating humble pie. Of the 28 Assembly seats in his stronghold Rewanchal, the Congress tally read two, one less than that of the Bahujan Samaj Party.         
	Arjuns only consolation was his sons victory from Churhat. The minister, along with son Ajay and daughter Beena, had campaigned hard, but couldnt stop most of his associates from biting the dust.        
	State Congress chief Suresh Pachauris hometown Hoshangabad saw the party drawing a blank. Party leaders said Pachauris move to count on expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti to eat into the votes of her parent party was flawed.        
	 For the first time in Madhya Pradesh, we hoped to defeat the BJP counting on someone else rather than our own strength, a party leader said.        
	It was like baap maren to bail baten, he said quoting a Hindi saying, which roughly translates to counting on ones fathers death to stake claim to cattle. That was our approach. It lacked confidence and a cohesive strategy.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh fared slightly better. Two of his nominees emerged victorious.        
	Party leaders said they were worried. The parliamentary elections were round the corner and the state Congress, they said, needed inspirational leadership if it hoped to improve its 2004 tally of five out of the states 29 Lok Sabha seats.        
	V. Narayanswamy, the Congress general secretary in charge of the state, hardly commands the authority he should, the leaders said. At one meeting, Narayanswamy was heard addressing a state leader as sahib though he is higher in the hierarchy.        
	A joke doing the rounds at the state Congress office sums up the view about Narayanswamy.        
	A senior leader, the joke goes, was once asked about Narayanswamys political stature. It was so high, he replied, that regional satraps seldom asked him to sit down.

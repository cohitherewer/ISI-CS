                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     China talks cricket
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Yang Jiechi                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: India could teach China how to play cricket, visiting foreign minister Yang Jiechi joked today, trying to move away perhaps from questions on his country playing spoilsport at the NSG meeting in Vienna.        
	Since Yang landed in Calcutta on Sunday, he has been chased by questions on the not-so-positive role Beijing played at the Nuclear Suppliers Group meet that eventually granted India the waiver it wanted.        
	Delhi raised at the official-level talks yesterday the discomfort China had caused at the NSG. The media and academics also raised the question.         
	After a lecture on India-China ties, Yang, 58, was asked why Beijing hadnt lived up to expectations at NSG negotiations when there was so much talk of a strategic relationship. He said: I am surprised at these reports. Facts speak louder than reports. China played a constructive and responsible role.         
	The minister said he was happy to answer this question and had there been no question like this one, he would have answered on his own.        
	Indian leaders, too, have said that Asia is big enough to accommodate the rising China and rising India, he said, adding that Beijing looked forward to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs trip next month to attend the 7th Asia-Europe meeting.        
	Yang claimed he was not keenly following the NSG developments as it was a settled issue long ago that India has a right to peaceful use of nuclear energy and the international community hoped this would not come in the way of a non-proliferation regime.         
	There was no joint statement or news meet with his counterpart, but Yang was treated to a kathak performance at the dinner Pranab Mukherjee hosted.        
	At the lecture, he often diverted from the written speech. Indian Olympians made a historic breakthrough in Beijing by winning one gold and two bronze medals. The Chinese people share the joy of the Indian people and wish Indian athletes even greater success in the future, he read.         
	With a pause, Yang added: So Beijing is a lucky place for India. Now you should teach us how to play good cricket.         
	The minister, who had gone to the London School of Economics, added: I learnt English from England, but couldnt learn cricket.

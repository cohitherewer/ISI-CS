	Kathmandu, March 25: British rock star Sting is criss-crossing Nepal, exploring the possibility of championing a Himalayan environmental project.        
	Sting is in love with the Himalayas. He is keen on taking up some environmental project here, a source who organised the singers trip said.        
	The 56-year-old the Grammy winner, whose real name is Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, and his wife Trudie Styler are active in the Save Amazon Rainforest campaign.        
	He arrived in Nepal two days ago on a weeklong trip with Trudie, teenaged son Luke and an unidentified couple. On Sunday, he flew to the Khumbu valley in a helicopter and is scheduled to leave for Mustang tomorrow morning.        
	Today, Sting visited Thamel to shop, and then dropped in at the Pashupathinath temple.

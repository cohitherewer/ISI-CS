Turn a blind eye
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: A Tamil Nadu schoolteacher who was apparently caught napping between classes and given the boot has won his job back in a legal battle that went all the way up to the Supreme Court.        
	The Supreme Court has held that the teacher cannot be shown the door because he had taken a class scheduled before the break during which he had dozed off in the staff room.        
	He had already taken his class. Next you will say that judges cant sleep after 1pm (lunch hour), the apex court said, setting off peals of laughter in the packed courtroom.        
	The court threw out the review petition filed by the school against a high court order ruling that the teacher be taken back and paid back wages.        
	The school, however, claimed the teacher habitually slept even during class hours and had failed to do his duty. He had been found guilty after an inquiry, it said.        
	He was a bad example to the students and was also indisciplined and defiant, Guru Krishnakumar, the counsel for the school, a minority-run institution, claimed.        
	The counsel said the teacher had been reprimanded several times for his conduct before the January 31, 2001, incident, which led to his sacking.         
	On that day, the principal apparently found students of a particular class raising a ruckus while he was on his routine rounds. After enquiring whose class it was, the principal found the teacher snoozing in the staff room.        
	He then woke the teacher up and sent him to class, the counsel contended.        
	But the teacher claimed he had just been a few minutes late and was caught by the principal on his way to the class.        
	He said there had been a break after the Class XII industrial chemistry class, which he had taken despite a mild fever and cough. He claimed he had taken Benadryl expectorant during the break and dozed off.        
	Since he had been ill, he had taken casual leave the previous day, the teacher added.         
	The school, however, claimed that he had not furnished any medical certificate. So he was issued a memo asking for an explanation of his conduct and then suspended.         
	The teacher alleged his services were subsequently terminated. He accused the school of not giving him his subsistence allowance, but the school has denied the charge.         
	He went to the high court, which ordered his re-instatement on February 26, 2004. But the school claimed he could not go to the high court without exhausting other statutory remedies.         
	The school contended that under the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Rules, 1974, an appeal would first have to be made to the joint director of school education. But the high court held that the rules were not applicable in this case, as it was a minority school.         
	The school then went to the Supreme Court for a review. It claimed that since it was a minority institution, the appeal should under law go to a special tribunal and not the high court.         
	In the absence of a special tribunal, headed by a district judge, the only other remedy left for the sacked employee would be to file a civil suit, the school claimed. But the apex court rejected his plea.

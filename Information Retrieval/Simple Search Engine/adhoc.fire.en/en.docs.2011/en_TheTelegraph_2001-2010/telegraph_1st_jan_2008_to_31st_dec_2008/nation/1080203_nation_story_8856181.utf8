	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 2: Having failed to provide wage employment to four job seekers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the state government has given them unemployment allowance.
    
	State panchayati raj minister Raghunath Mohanty said two of the beneficiaries were from Kalahandi district, while one each hailed from Bolangir and Nowrangpur districts. The unemployment allowance paid to the beneficiaries amounted to Rs 62,000, he said.
    
	Mohanty said disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against the block development officers and panchayat officials concerned for failing to provide jobs. 
    
	By January-end, the government has been able to provide wage employment to 7.68 lakh families out of 7.84 lakh families who had sought work. But 7.30 lakh families joined work, he said.

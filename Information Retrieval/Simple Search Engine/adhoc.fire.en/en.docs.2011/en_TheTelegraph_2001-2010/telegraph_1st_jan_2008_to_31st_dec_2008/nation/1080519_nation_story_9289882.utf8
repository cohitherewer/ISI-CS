	Morning asanas before Assembly    
	Driving to the Assembly and back is not the only thing Tamil Nadu MLAs will do now when the House is in session. They will also do yoga, early in the morning and in the evening.    
	The minister for youth welfare and sports development, T.P.M. Mohideen Khan, has told the Assembly that yoga instructors would train the legislators at the MLAs hostel twice a day when the House functions.    
	The asanas and the tips, of course, will come for free.    
	The government will take the help of the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu and the Yoga Association to keep the MLAs in ship-shape.         
	Telgis life, with item songs  
	Watch out for Mudrank at the movie hall near you. It has four item songs, performed by Rakhi Sawant and Sambhavna Seth.    
	n case youre trying to guess what a movie with four item numbers would be like, heres the answer: its about the life and times of Abdul Karim Telgi, the stamp scam kingpin.    
	Mudrank, the title, means stamp. And its makers claim the film will expose the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals.     
	Telgis character is played by theatre actor Kailash Manav. The director is Shakir Shaikh and the music is by Bappi Lahiri.     
	Telgi himself was not too pleased with the movie and filed a case. The censor board also had objections. But now, a Pune court has just cleared it for the screening. It should hit screens on May 23.        
	Taj marble unscathed  
	Heres some good news for lovers of the Taj. A study on the impact of atmospheric pollution on Taj Mahal has allayed fears of any chemical reaction of airborne particles on the marble structure.    
	The study, undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as part of a Unesco-funded project, has proved that no calcium sulphate or calcium nitrate particles were found in harmful proportions in the Tajs ambience, sources in the ASI said.    
	The study was carried out in the air pollution laboratory of the ASI by an assistant super- intendent archae- ologist.    
	However, the study did not look into the impact of sand-carrying winds from Rajasthans desert that are said to have a sandpaper effect, damaging its smooth outer surface.

	Coin thieves   
	Railway police have nabbed three boys who duplicated keys to coin-phone boxes and robbed Tata Indicom of perhaps few thousands of rupees.    
	The boys were part of a gang. The police are still looking for two more of them.    
	After receiving complaints from Tata Indicom, whose coin phone booths were the targets, the police laid a trap near a platform at the Chhatrapati Shivaji terminus.     
	They caught one boy when he was trying to open the coin box of a phone installed near the platform.    
	The police have, so far, recovered Rs 1,676 from him.    
	His arrest led the police to the other two.

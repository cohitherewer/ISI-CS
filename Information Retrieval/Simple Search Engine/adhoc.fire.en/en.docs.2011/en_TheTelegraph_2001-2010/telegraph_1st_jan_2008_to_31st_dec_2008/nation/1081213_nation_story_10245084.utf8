          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Dec. 12: An eight-year-old boy waiting for his school bus was today kidnapped at gunpoint in Haryanas Panipat, yards from his mother who was buying wafers across the road.        
	Two masked men hustled Tejas Gabba, the son of an influential businessman, into a Honda Accord parked nearby. One fired a shot on the ground and threatened to kill his mother when she raised an alarm.        
	Police believe a property dispute could be behind the abduction of the Class III student of Delhi Public School in Panipat, but said all angles, including ransom, were being probed.        
	The family received no ransom call till tonight, Naresh Ahlawat, the officer investigating the case, said. We have dispatched teams across the state and to Delhi to catch the criminals. All districts have been alerted.        
	The incident took place around 7.30am in the Model Town area. Ahlawat said the kidnappers had been lying in wait for the boy.        
	The Gabbas had got one of their properties vacated recently, probably using force, the police said. But there could be other reasons as well, he said.         
	We are investigating the matter from all angles. The reasons include labour problems in the familys spinning wheel factory, ransom, personal enmity and property disputes, Ahlawat said.

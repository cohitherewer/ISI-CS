          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          One of the torched churches in Raikia                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 17: National Minority Front members today demanded immediate reconstruction and repair of all damaged churches from government funds.        
	The front, a conglomerate of national and state minority organisations, that assembled here to hold a conference titled Sadbhavana also demanded that NGOs and churches be allowed to carry out relief and rehabilitation work in affected areas.         
	Demanding compensation similar to those given to the 1984 riot victims, the body demanded adequate measures to identify and root out the anti-minority campaign and inhuman activities in Orissa.         
	Strict action against those forcibly converting Christians to Hindus was one of the demands brought forward by the body today.        
	Front members from across the country, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists, expressed their solidarity with the victims of violence in Orissa and condemned the killing of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and the violence that erupted thereafter.         
	The body also criticised the police for being mute spectators of the heinous act and refusing to register criminal cases against the culprits.         
	The body expressed distress over the inability of the Orissa government for failing to curb the inhuman and violent acts by communal forces against the members of the Christian community.         
	Political leaders should not use religion for political gain. The state ought to maintain the secular character as enshrined in the constitution of India and this should not be compromised with. Militancy and terrorism of any kind should be dealt with firmly, said Swarupananda Patra, the president of Orissa Minority Forum.         
	The delegation, which later met chief minister Naveen Patnaik and handed him over a memorandum held communal and fundamental forces like VHP, Bajrang Dal and RSS responsible for the spate of communal violence in Orissa and demanded a ban on these outfits. They demanded that the CBI conduct an inquiry to identify the militant unit engaged in recent riots.

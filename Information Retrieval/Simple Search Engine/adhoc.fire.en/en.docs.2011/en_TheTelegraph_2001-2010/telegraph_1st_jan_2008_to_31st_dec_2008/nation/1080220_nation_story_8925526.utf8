The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia touch softens Maya
                                                                                                               Sonia touch softens Maya
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: So Mayavati sounded soft yesterday? Thank Sonia Gandhi and her children.        
	Observers had thought a whopping increase in plan funds for Uttar Pradesh had softened Mayavati after her meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday. But it emerged today that the Congress president, Rahul and Priyanka had worked upon the chief minister when she called on 10 Janpath the day before she met Manmohan Singh.        
	The Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party had kept the news of Mayavatis date with Sonia under wraps. But both sides confirmed the buzz when prodded by reporters after they got wind of it.        
	A source close to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said she wanted to call on the Congress president ever since Sonia was hospitalised last December.        
	Mayavati, the source said, had left a few messages at Sonias office. Sonia later telephoned the BSP chief on January 15 to wish her on her birthday.        
	She said she would have liked to greet Mayavati personally but couldnt because she was still recuperating.        
	Mayavati told her she would visit her at the earliest. So, on Sunday, on her way back from Jaipur to Lucknow, she stopped by in Delhi and went over to Sonias house for a courtesy call that lasted nearly three hours.        
	Priyanka dropped in briefly while Rahul was around all the time.        
	Nothing political should be read into it, a Congress leader said.        
	But the first signal that the Congress might relent on the campaign kicked off by Rahul against the Mayavati government came when Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, called off his visit to Ramkola in the heartlands east.        
	Digvijay was to leave today to mobilise party workers against the neglect of cane farmers.        
	A source said the Congress might not pursue its demand for a separate Bundelkhand with the enthusiasm it had when Rahul put Mayavati on notice.        
	The reason, the source explained, was that Mayavati might land straight into the BJPs arms if pushed to the wall.        
	The source said it hadnt escaped his partys notice that neither Mayavati nor the BJP had attacked each other in the recent past.         
	Mayavati and the BJP have done business three times in the past (in Uttar Pradesh), he said. What is to prevent them from coming together at the Centre (after the 2009 polls)?        
	Also, for all the Congresss bravado about surviving on its own in Uttar Pradesh, party sources conceded that it couldnt afford to antagonise the 19-member BSP, or for that matter the Samajwadi Party, with the Left breathing down the governments neck in Parliament all the time.        
	The sources said in a hung Parliament, Mayavatis prospective support and role couldnt be ignored.         
	Not when shes expected to get 40 seats or more, said a source.

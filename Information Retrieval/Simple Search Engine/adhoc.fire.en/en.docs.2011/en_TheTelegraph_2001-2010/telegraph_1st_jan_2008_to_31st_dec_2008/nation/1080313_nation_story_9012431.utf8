The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U) plays minority card
                                                                                                               JD(U) plays minority card
  - Bihar chief minister continues his  lsquo;sops spree rsquo; for community
          NALIN VERMA                          Poll moves                                  
	Patna, March 12: Continuing with sop spree for the minority community, JD(U) today picked up two Muslim candidates for the biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha and legislative council.        
	The JD(U) would be fielding Ejaj Ali, the president of the Muslim Morcha, and party worker Harun Rasheed, as its candidates for the Rajya Sabha and the legislative council, respectively.        
	Other candidates to join the Rajya Sabha poll fray include JD(U) general secretary Shivanand Tiwary and vice-chairman of the state planning board N.K. Singh. Ramdhani Singh, Satish Prasad and Heera Bind are in the fray for the legislative council.        
	The JD(U), however, ignored veteran leader and chairman of the state minority commission Syeed Shahabuddin. Sources reveal that Shahabuddins hard-liner image proved to be his undoing, as Nitish preferred the relatively liberal candidate to broaden his base among Bihars largest minority community.         
	Similarly, the ruling establishment is believed to have noticed an upstart Naushad trying to get bigger than his boots and thus he, somewhat, fell out of favour.        
	By granting seats to two members from a backward community, a majority against the upper caste Muslims in Bihar, Nitish Kumar has demonstrated his intention to break the RJDs base.        
	The chief minister has been carrying out social engineering to broaden his base and has picked up a Brahmin in Shivanand and a Rajput in N.K. Singh for the Rajya Sabha.         
	As a balancing act he has also picked up two candidates belonging to the extremely backward community (EBC)  Satish Prasad and Heera Bind  to fortify his base among the EBCs, too.         
	Besides, he has fielded Ramdhani, a Kurmi, a community along with the Kushwahas that constitutes the Law-Kush nucleus of the JD(U) base. The BJP announced its candidates last night.         
	The party has fielded former Union minister C.P. Thakur for the Rajya Sabha replacing Shatrughan Sinha because Sinha has completed two terms as an MP.         
	As a convention BJP does not allow a third term to any member in the Rajya Sabha, said a party spokesman, adding that L.K. Advani had been the only exception.         
	The BJP has retained Giriraj Singh and Kameshwar Choupal as its candidates for the legislative council.

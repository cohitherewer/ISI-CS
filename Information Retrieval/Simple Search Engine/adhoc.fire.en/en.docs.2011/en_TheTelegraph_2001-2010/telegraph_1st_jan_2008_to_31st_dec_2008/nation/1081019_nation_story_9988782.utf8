	New Delhi, Oct. 18 (PTI): Amartya Sen is pitching for Barack Obama as the next US President because he feels the Democrat nominee will be able to infuse confidence in the American economy and turn around the ongoing recession.         
	The Nobel-winning economist attributed the US recession to the loss of confidence of the people in the economy. But the positive side is that just as it (economy) can decline by lack of confidence, once confidence comes in, it can also dramatically improve, he told a television channel.        
	Sen suggested that a change in government could infuse confidence in the US economy.         
	I am fairly partisan and I hope that Obama can win.... His coolness is an advantage in the time of financial crisis. He will not be in office till January but he can already start playing a major role and re-create confidence.        
	If the US put its house in order in a short time, India may end up not having a big economic disaster, Sen said.        
	The governments of India, China and Brazil have a lot of initiatives to take and if the US puts its house in order in a short time, then I think we may end up not having as big a disaster as we almost certainly will have if we did not do adequately what is needed to be done by the public leadership both in this country and in the developing countries.         
	Sen said developing countries like India had to be careful about not only the falling stock market but also the possibility of unemployment and slackening of economy.

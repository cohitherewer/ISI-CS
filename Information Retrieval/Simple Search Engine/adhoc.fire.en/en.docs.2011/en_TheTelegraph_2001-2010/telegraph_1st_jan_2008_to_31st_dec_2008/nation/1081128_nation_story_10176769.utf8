          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Sketches of the three men who visited Mumbai last year                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Thirteen months ago, three men and a woman in a burqa had hired a cab and gone around the city, visiting its historical and popular spots and spending as much as two hours at each.        
	Today, as commandos fought to flush out the toxin of terror from two Mumbai hotels, police sources said the recce in October last year may have prepared the ground for the deadly attacks that began last night.        
	The four came on the police radar by chance. The cabbie, angry at having to wait so long and uneasy with the suspicious behaviour of his passengers, had complained to the police.        
	Based on the taxi drivers descriptions, the police had then issued sketches of the three men. The anti-terrorist squad raided several places in and around Mahim and Meera Road. Many people were detained but the case reached a dead end.        
	The police sources said the driver, paid Rs 2,000 for two days, told the cops he took the four to religious places, a couple of hotels  the Oberoi and the Taj, the secretariat area, the locality around Regal Cinema in Colaba, the Gateway of India and the Siddhivinayak temple among other places.        
	In his complaint the cabbie said that on October 22, he had driven the group to Mahim dargah, Haji Ali dargah and the adjacent Mahalaxmi temple. The group spent two hours at each of these shrines and carried their travel bags with them while the taxi waited.        
	They returned to the spot in Mahim where they had taken the cab and asked the driver to pick them up the next day. On October 23, the group travelled to JJ Hospital in central Mumbai.        
	The cabbie told the police one of the men in the group was in his 40s while the other two were in their 20s. The fourth, he said, was the woman in the burqa.        
	Witnesses to the attack at Cama Hospital also confirmed seeing a woman among the three terrorists who had stormed in.        
	There were three people. One of them was very tall and had long hair, while the other was a woman. Although a patch of cloth covered half their faces, I am sure one of them was a woman. They seemed young, maybe around 25 years old, said Sona Desai, who said she had a clear view of the terrorists from her room in the quarters for Class IV staff where the terrorists had first escaped to, a fact confirmed by the police.        
	Police officers involved with the 2007 probe said the driver had specifically mentioned the woman who he claimed was aggressive and was the dominant member among the quartet.

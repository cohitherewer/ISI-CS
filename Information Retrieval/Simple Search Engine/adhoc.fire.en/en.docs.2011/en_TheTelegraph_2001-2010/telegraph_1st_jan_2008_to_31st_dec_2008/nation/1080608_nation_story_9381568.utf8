          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, June 7: Mumbai could get marooned again, if the pre-monsoon showers are any indication.         
	Today, just 15 minutes of rain led to such waterlogging that it took commuters three and a half hours to crawl from Borivli to Santa Cruz  a distance that should take an hour.        
	Local train services were also affected this morning, though railway sources claimed they were normal.         
	The monsoon has not hit Mumbai yet, said K. Sathi Devi, the deputy director of the regional meteorological centre in Mumbai. But weather conditions favourable for monsoon have been recorded and it is expected to hit parts of Konkan, Goa, central and south Maharashtra in the next two days.        
	Monsoon vigil has been stepped up after the cloudburst of July 2005 when Mumbai received a record 944mm of rain in 24 hours.         
	But with all road repairs not through yet and the monsoons arriving a bit early, there have been some problems. But they will be sorted out by Monday, Madhav Sangale, the additional commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, assured citizens of the countrys commercial capital.        
	Luckily for Sangale, he will be in Stuttgart, Germany, between July 14 and 21 when Mumbai would be wallowing in water. Sangale, along with the citys deputy mayor and 12 others, will fly to Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of Mumbais ties with its sister-city Stuttgart.         
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and chief secretary Johny Joseph have, however, cancelled foreign tours to battle the monsoon with the rest of the city.         
	The Colaba observatory today recorded 83.24mm rainfall while the Santa Cruz observatory recorded 161.7mm. The downpour saw many long-distance trains getting delayed on the Bandra-Mahim-Harbour line, said a western railway spokesman.        
	Flights were delayed by five minutes to half an hour. Two Kingfisher flights  Kolkata-Mumbai and Delhi-Mumbai  had to be diverted on Friday night, said Manish Kalghatgi, spokesman of the Mumbai International Airport.

	London, July 12 (PTI): Heenal Raichura of Indian origin is set to become Britains youngest doctor.        
	Daughter of Nalin and Shobhna Raichura, the 22-year-old got into St. Georges University to study medicine in 2002 when she was 16. Six years later, she has received her degree and will start work at University College London Hospital, where she hopes to become a surgeon.        
	Its quite a surreal feeling to actually, finally, become a doctor after six years of a degree. To finally come out at the end and say Im a doctor, my childhood dream, is an indescribable feeling, Heenal said.

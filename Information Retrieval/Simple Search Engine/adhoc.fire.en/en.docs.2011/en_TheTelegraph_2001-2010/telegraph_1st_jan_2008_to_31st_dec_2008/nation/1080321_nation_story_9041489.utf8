          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 20: Two doctors and a corporator allegedly gangraped a 10-year-old last evening at Lakhisarai, 180 km from here.        
	Police said the minor was lured to the house of the corporator, Subodh Mandal, in Chandni Chowk under Nawada town police station where his doctor friends  Jawahar Sahu and Suraj Kumar, husband of another corporator Sudha Devi  allegedly raped the girl.        
	Lakhisarai superintendent of police S.P. Shukla said the trio deserted the victim, a Class IV student at a government school in Punjabi Mohalla, by the roadside last night in an unconscious state. When the girl regained consciousness, she walked to her house in the neighbouring area and told her father, a rickshaw-puller, about the incident. Over 50 local residents stood by the father of the victim and later attacked the house of the corporator with bricks and stones, damaging windowpanes and house furniture.        
	The three accused, however, were unhurt as the deputy superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar reached the spot and dispersed the mob. The police have arrested the accused trio.

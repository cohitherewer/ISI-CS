  - Police intensify vigil   in Saranda forests        KUMUD JENAMANI                                          
	Jamshedpur, Oct 7: Police have reportedly moved additional paramilitary forces into the Saranda forests after an intelligence report pointed to a heavy presence of armed Naxalite guerrillas in West Singhbhums jungles.        
	Superintendent of police (West Singhbhum) Sudhir Kumar Jha confirmed the news. The sources also stated that such a large presence was reported after a gap of seven years.         
	Intelligence personnel suspect that the armed guerrillas belonging to CPI(Maoist) may be gathering at the spot for a meeting, however, they doubt the possibility of such a meeting, as the rebels recently observed an establishment week from September 21-28.         
	The rebels might be planning either to strike at Saranda or they might be assembling there for some training programme. Whatever may be the reason the administration has to be alert and take note, said the intelligence report.         
	Heavily-armed Naxalites have recently been spotted entering Saranda through Sundergarh in Orissa. They might have some plan, while operating in the Saranda, but we are prepared to thwart any attempts to create any violence in the district, said Jha.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, the superintendent of police stated that the number of rebels spotted were about 100 constituting two platoons already stationed at Saranda, a haven for the rebels.        
	Rebel platoon-22 and 39 belonging to Saranda and Porhat areas respectively, are already here. In each platoon there are 40 rebels, but there are 100 additional rebels coming in, making the situation a bit more sensational, Jha added.        
	Jha added that anticipating trouble, the West Singhbhum district administration has deputed police and paramilitary forces across Saranda. We are closely monitoring the situation and would like to drive the rebels out for which a strategy is being chalked out, he said.        
	Saranda had been an epicentre of rebel activities in 2001 and 2002. The rebels had successfully executed two major strikes on the police force then causing over 40 policemen to die.         
	That apart, rebels razed forest guesthouses and lodges across Saranda during that period. The third major strike that the rebels carried out in 2004 claimed over 24 policemen.

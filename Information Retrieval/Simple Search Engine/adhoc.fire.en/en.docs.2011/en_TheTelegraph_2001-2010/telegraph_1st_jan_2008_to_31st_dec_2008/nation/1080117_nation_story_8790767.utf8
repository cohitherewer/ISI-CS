 -Three villages lay stake over Ramgoolam name
      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 16: Before Nitish Kumar gets ready to receive the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, to unveil his father and predecessor, Seewoosagur Ramgoolams, statue  he better settle the controversy over the PMs rural roots first. 
    
	Though the chief minister today clarified that according to the Prime Minister himself, Hargaon, in central Bihars Bhojpur district, is Ramgoolam familys ancestral village, people from as many as three other villages in Sahabad district have staked their claim of being the original birthplace of the Ramgoolam family. 
    
	Nitish stressed that his office had received a communiqu from the Mauritius government that clearly stated that Hargaon under Bihian paragana in Bhojpur district was Ramgoolams ancestral village. However, villagers of Chhauttupur, especially one Deonarayan Ojha, yesterday sent a fax to the Mauritius Embassy at New Delhi stating that Seewoosagur Ramgoolam was the son of one Swayamvar Ojha who had been taken as a bonded labourer to the island nation in 1871 by the British.
    
	The document also has an inquiry report conducted by local civil officials appended with it. Also appended, is a report of a janata darbar that Buxar district magistrate organised to pronounce Chhauttupur as Seewoosagur Ramgoolams original home on November 18, 2007. 
    
	On the other hand, residents of Barka Singhanpura in Buxar are also claiming to know the Ramgoolam family. In 2007 they handed a packet of soil, from land where a deity worshipped by Ramgoolams family and the villagers is kept, to Nitish. The chief minister handed the packet of soil to Navinchandra Ramgoolam. 
    
	Then there is Keshopur in Buxar. Villagers there have staked their claim on the Ramgoolam family as well. They too have faxed letters to the Mauritius Embassy in New Delhi to support their claim.
    
	Last year when the chief minister visited Mauritius, he had formally invited Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam to unveil the life-size statue of his father and Mauritiuss first Prime Minister in February 2008. 
    
	At that time, Navinchandra Ramgoolam reportedly showed keen interest to find out more of his familys roots. Though Seewoosagur Ramgoolam never visited his village, his son wishes to do so.
    
	And since he is ready to offer financial help to boost development in his ancestral land, its not going to hurt to be a part of the Ramgoolam root, either. Thus, claimants are not ready to step down. 
    
	We are in touch with the Mauritius Embassy and will request Navinchandra to visit Chhauttupur and not go by false claims, said Deonarayan Ojha.

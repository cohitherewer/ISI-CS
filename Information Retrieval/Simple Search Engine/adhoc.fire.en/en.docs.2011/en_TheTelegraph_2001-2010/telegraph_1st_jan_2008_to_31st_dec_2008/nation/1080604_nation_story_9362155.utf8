	Jaipur, June 3: Thousands of Gujjar women squatted on the tracks connecting Jaipur to Delhi and Agra, cutting off the city from the rest of the country.        
	The Jodhpur-Howrah Express, Jaipur-Sealdah Special and the Guwahati-Okha Express were among the trains cancelled. The Sealdah-Udaipur Ananya Express has also been affected.        
	Over 45 trains have been cancelled, leaving at least 50,000 passengers stranded.         
	The state government is waiting for the cremation of the firing victims. Five bodies were cremated together at Pilupura while relatives took away the 11 other bodies to their villages for cremation, contrary to K.S Bainslas announcement yesterday that all bodies would be laid to rest together.

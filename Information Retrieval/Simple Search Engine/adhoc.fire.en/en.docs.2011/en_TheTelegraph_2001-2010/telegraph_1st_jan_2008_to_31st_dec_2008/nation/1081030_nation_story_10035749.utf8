The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister visits suspect home
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Minister visits suspect home
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Sadhvi Pragya                                  
	Bhopal, Oct. 29: Madhya Pradesh minister Kailash Vijayvargiya today visited the house of Shyam Sahu, an accused in the Malegaon bomb blasts, departing from the BJP policy to distance itself from the suspects.        
	The public works and information technology minister, who enjoys an unofficial No. 2 status in the Shivraj Singh Chauhan cabinet, called Sahu a dedicated party worker and promised his family in Indore legal help and moral support.         
	Sahu, along with sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and some other blast suspects, is in the custody of Mumbai polices anti-terror squad (ATS).        
	On Monday, Vijayvargiya had trained guns on the Congress for harbouring links with the firebrand sadhvi, who has often been seen in the company of BJP leaders.         
	Almost two years ago, I had met her at the house of Congress MLA Ajay Singh, the son of Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh. I feel she doesnt have anything to do with any form of violence. The arrests are a part of a conspiracy hatched by the Congress, he had said, breaking his partys studied silence on the case.        
	Vijayvargiya, the official spokesperson for the state government, said he believed Sahu was innocent. I do not know the facts of the case for which he has been booked. But I have known him as a dedicated party worker.        
	Sahu runs a mobile phone shop and is a part-time property dealer in Indore.        
	Vijayvargiya said he had known the 38-year-old Pragya since 2004. I met her during the Indore mahayagna held that year.        
	The state BJP and all organisations associated with the Sangh parivar have taken care not to acknowledge any acquaintance with the sadhvi and the others in Mumbai polices net.        
	A few days ago, Uma Bharti had mocked her former party for dissociating itself from Pragya, who she claimed was an active sympathiser of the BJP and also a member of its students wing, the ABVP.        
	Vijayvargiya also sought to give a clean chit to the Hindu Jagran Manch and other outfits on the Mumbai ATS radar.               
	But, he added, if by mere chance they are found to be involved in any kind of violent activities, the BJP should do atmachintan (introspection).

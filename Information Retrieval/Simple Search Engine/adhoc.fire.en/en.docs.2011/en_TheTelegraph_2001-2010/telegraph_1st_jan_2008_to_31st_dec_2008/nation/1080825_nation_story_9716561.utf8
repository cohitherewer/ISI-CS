	Sambalpur, Aug. 24: If the BJD senior leader Pyarimohan Mohapatra is to be believed, the department of higher education in Orissa is the most corrupt one.         
	But, the situation is worse in Western Orissa.         
	Most colleges under Sambalpur University face a de-affiliation threat, as most of them do not fulfil basic university norms, especially those pertaining to the number of teaching staff, their recruitment, availability and basic infrastructure.         
	The Sambalpur University can de-affiliate most colleges, if it desires.         
	Almost all colleges are now running at the mercy of the university, said a senior university staff, on condition of anonymity.         
	None of the Sambalpur colleges has a regular principal. An example may be taken of the Gangadhar Meher College situated in the heartland of western Orissa.         
	Out of the 119 sanctioned strength of teachers in the college, only 61 posts are functional. Rest are lying vacant, informed a college staff.         
	The college with graduation, post-graduation and MPhil courses runs with 50 per cent of its sanctioned strength missing.         
	The departments of chemistry and physics have only three and four teachers, respectively, out of the sanctioned strength of eight and 10. Zoology runs with only a single teacher, as does psychology.         
	The autonomy granted by the University Grants Commission to some of the colleges here is a mockery of the system, a sources commented. Mostly the districts colleges depend on contractual teachers  paid from the college development funds. The government has a norm by which it does not pay more than Rs 3,000 a month to teachers.        
	In March 2007 when the Sambalpur regional director for higher education office, carried a survey of the 31 government colleges under it, it found that of the 886 teachers post in 31 colleges, only 609 were functional.         
	The figure has deteriorated further, the office believes.        
	Syndicate members of Sambalpur University are now up in arms against the anomalies and apathetic attitude of the government.         
	We will raise the issue in the next syndicate meeting and will ask the university why it chooses to remain silent on this crucial issue, said Sumant Kumar Swain, a syndicate member.         
	Once the process of de-affiliation starts, government will be bound to appoint staff here, Swain and another senate member, Arun Kumar, said.

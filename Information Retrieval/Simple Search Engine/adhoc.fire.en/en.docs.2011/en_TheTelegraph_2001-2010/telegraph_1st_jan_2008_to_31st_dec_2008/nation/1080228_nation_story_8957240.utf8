	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 27: BJD-BJP MPs of the state today staged a dharna outside the Parliament protesting against the step-motherly treatment meted out to the state in the rail budget, while saffron activists squatted on rail tracks across Orissa voicing their protest.         
	BJD parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha B.K. Tripathy said protests would continue both inside and outside the Parliament.         
	BJD Rajya Sabha member P.M. Mohapatra said: Its unfortunate that Orissa, which revenue-wise contributes so much to the railways development, received such a shabby treatment when it came to its rail network development.         
	Senior BJP MP Aira Kharavela Swain voiced resentment over the poor allocation to Orissa by the UPA government and said his party would continue protests.         
	BJP state president Suresh Pujari said the rail minister had disappointed the people of Orissa. He has not sanctioned a single new line and has made a meagre allocation for the ongoing projects, he said.         
	While the NDA had attached topmost priority to the development of backward states like Orissa, the UPA has neglected them, he lamented.         
	Rail traffic was disrupted across the state as BJP activists squatted on tracks to protest against the Centres apathy.         
	Train services were affected at several places, including Puri, Khurda Road, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Balasore, Berhampur, Bhadrak and Balasore, due to the rail roko agitation, East Coast Railway sources said.         
	Bhubaneswar-Mumbai Konark Express was rescheduled, along with a passenger train. Long-distance trains like Coromandal Express, Prasanti Express, Konark Express, Hirakhand Express and Rajdhani Express were detained at different stations due to the agitation.

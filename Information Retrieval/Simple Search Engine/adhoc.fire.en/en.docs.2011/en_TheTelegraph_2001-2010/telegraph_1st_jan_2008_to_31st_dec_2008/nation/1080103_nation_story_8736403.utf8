	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: Describing the recent communal strife in Khandhamal as tragic, Union home minister Shivraj Patil today indicated hands of communal forces behind the carnage.        
	Majority of the people want peace and amity. But there are a few who have their own design, own ideology and views, which create problems at times, said Patil while talking to reporters this afternoon after visiting the riot-affected Khandhamal district.        
	Visiting the Barakhama, allegedly the worst-hit village, the Union home minister said: We could see with our eyes how things had happened there. What has happened there is very tragic. We are all very sorry. It should not have happened.        
	Its a country of all of us. Any person having different cultural and religious affinity should not be discriminated against. Orissa, a cultured state that understands the value of love and affection, should take steps to see that such things do not happen, said Patil.        
	The persons having hands in this dastardly act should be booked and punished. I understand some people have already been arrested and other culprits would be arrested, said Patil.        
	An inquiry commission has been set up by the state government, but investigations should start simultaneously, he said.        
	Earlier, Patil met chief minister Naveen Patnaik, senior state government officials, leader of Opposition and leaders of other political parties at the Raj Bhavan in the morning and heard their views. Later, he discussed with the representatives of NGOs about the measures for restoration of peace and normality and how to prevent such incidents in future.         
	Before leaving Bhubaneswar, the Union home minister said it was now the responsibility of both the state government and the Centre to ensure a proper atmosphere was created for restoration of normality. We all have to join hands to help the people who have suffered, he said.        
	It has been decided that compensation would be given to all surviving members of the riot victims. People whose residences have been burnt would be provided with house and financial assistance will be given for repairing partially damaged houses. Besides, the state government has been asked to help the injured get treatment, said the visiting minister.        
	During his visit to Barakhama village, Patil, accompanied by Naveen Patnaik, leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik and Union minister of state for rural development Chandrasekhar Sahu, visited a relief camp and talked to some victims, including Sabita Digal, whose house has been burnt. He assured that all the affected persons would be compensated.        
	BJP, however, attributed political motives behind Patils visit. BJP state unit president Suresh Pujari and former Union minister Juel Oram questioned the union home ministers neutrality. He only met the leaders of UPA at Raj Bhavan and visited only one village belonging to a particular community, they alleged.        
	Naveen declined to comment on this issue.

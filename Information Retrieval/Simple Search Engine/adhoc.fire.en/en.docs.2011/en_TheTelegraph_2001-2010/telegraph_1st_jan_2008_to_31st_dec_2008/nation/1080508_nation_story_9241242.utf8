	Srinagar, May 7: The BJP is trying to capitalise on Jammu and Kashmirs sex scandal in the Karnataka Assembly polls.        
	The BJP state unit has sent to its Karnataka and Delhi headquarters CDs containing the speech of Congress MP Madan Lal Sharma, who recently claimed party chief Sonia Gandhi and chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had saved the skin of two senior leaders  Speaker Tara Chand and former state unit chief Peerzada Sayeed  involved in the 2006 scam.         
	State BJP chief Ashok Khajaria said: We will expose the Congress leadership and play these CDs in election rallies there.         
	The main Opposition party National Conference has decided to stall the next Assembly session unless the Speaker comes clean on the issue.        
	We will rake up the issue to the point that the Speaker has to clear his position before he can take the seat in the House, said Farooq Abdullah, the NC patron and former chief minister.         
	Adullah threatened his legislators would boycott the Speaker unless he proved his innocence.         
	The Congress MP claimed during a public rally at Khour in Jammu on Sunday that Chand and Sayeed had figured in the sex scandal that rocked the state in 2006. Sharma also said their names were deleted from the list after he approached Sonia and Azad.         
	State Congress chief Saifuddin Soz yesterday issued a showcause notice to Sharma and asked him to reply within a week.        
	The state BJP would decide its future course of action after he submits his explanation, said Balbir Ram, the media secretary of the state unit.        
	The sex scandal surfaced in February 2006 when police seized a CD containing the pornographic clip of 15-year-old Yasmeena. She later revealed that top politicians, bureaucrats and security officers had exploited her.         
	Chandigarh High Court is hearing the case.

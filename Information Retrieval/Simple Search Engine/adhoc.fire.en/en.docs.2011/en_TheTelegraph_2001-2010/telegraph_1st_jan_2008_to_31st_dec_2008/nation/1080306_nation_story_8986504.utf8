The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hijack shame pits Singh vs Singh
                                                                                                               Hijack shame pits Singh vs Singh
          OUR BUREAU                                        Jaswant Singh    
	New Delhi, March 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today ripped into the BJPs pet theme of internal security, getting sucked into a clash with former foreign minister Jaswant Singh.        
	Some members have said that we have provided an easy legal regime for terrorists. This lie must be nailed once and for all. Legal regimes do not prevent terror. Draconian laws could not prevent the IC-814 hijack, he told the Lok Sabha.        
	Rubbing salt in the BJPs hijack wound, Manmohan Singh added: In fact, the signal that went out in this case was that if the terrorists were determined enough, the government would merrily succumb. We had the shameful sight of the then external affairs minister escorting dreaded terrorists to their freedom.         
	Jaswant Singh, the then foreign minister, later took strong exception in the Rajya Sabha. But the Prime Minister said his criticism should not be taken as a personal affront as he was only trying to prove the point that draconian laws do not prevent terror attacks.        
	Loan waiver defence        
	The Prime Minister said the massive loan waiver would provide relief to farmers, clean up banks balance sheets and might be funded from both tax and non-tax revenues.        
	We will make adequate provisions from tax and non-tax revenues over this period (of three years) to fund this package. Let there be no doubt that the banking system will not be constrained in any manner and there will be no contraction in liquidity, Singh said.        
	Analysts had earlier said the relief was likely to be funded through bonds and equity-linked instruments.        
	The debt relief scheme will be completed by June. It is an income transfer on an unparalleled scale, the Prime Minister said.        
	It will allow the fresh flow of institutional credit to farmers, it will clean up bankers balance sheets, it will stimulate economic activity in rural areas and I dont make any apologies on this, Manmohan Singh said. Banks will be compensated as and when the loans become due. The details are being worked out.        
	The Prime Minister said dues to the banks relating to loans for crop production and investment in equipment would materialise over three to four years.        
	The government will reimburse Rs 37,000 crore to co-operative banks. The share of regional rural banks and commercial banks will be Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 11,000 crore, respectively.        
	The Prime Minister said the government was committed to maintaining reasonable price stability at 4-5 per cent, but it would not be at the cost of farmers. Singh promised to take steps to contain the prices of foodgrain and vegetable oils.

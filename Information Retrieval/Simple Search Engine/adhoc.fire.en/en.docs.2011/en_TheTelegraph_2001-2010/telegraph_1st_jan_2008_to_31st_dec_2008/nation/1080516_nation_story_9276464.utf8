          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 15: The Supreme Court today told banks they could not hire musclemen to threaten and humiliate loan defaulters into paying up, a tactic that has led several of the victims to commit suicide.        
	We deem it appropriate to remind the banks and other financial institutions that we live in a civilised country and are governed by the rule of law, a two-judge bench said, months after the apex court had compared banks loan recovery bullies to goons.        
	The court dismissed ICICI Banks plea to delete Delhi High Courts remarks against the bank and its musclemen and goons over the suicide of a young defaulter in October 2005.        
	Himanshu Dev Sharma, 34, had hanged himself after the banks recovery agents allegedly humiliated him in front of his friends, neighbours and family, and took away the motorcycle he had bought with his loan.        
	The apex court today asked the bank to pay Rs 25,000 as cost of litigation to his widowed mother, Shanti Devi Sharma, within three weeks. It also directed that a deputy commissioner of Delhi police complete an investigation of the case against the bank within three months.        
	The court asked banks to stick to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines on loan recovery that banned undue harassment viz. persistently bothering the borrowers at odd hours, use of muscle power for recovery of loans, etc.        
	Shanti Devi had alleged that the recovery agents had forced their way into her sons bedroom, abused him for loan dues and taken away his motorbike in the presence of his friends.        
	Himanshu, who used the two-wheeler to transport vegetables to his small restaurant, was forced to carry the stuff on his back, exposing himself to neighbours derision. Hours before killing himself, he had told his wife he had never been so humiliated in his life.        
	The high court had ordered the police commissioner to probe the allegations and act against those who abetted the suicide. In addition, it made severely critical remarks against the bank.        
	The proximate cause that led him to commit suicide was on account of humiliation caused by the bank people from where loan was taken by him, the court said.        
	 The modus operandi employed by the banks like ICICI is extra-legal and by no stretch of imagination they can be permitted to employ musclemen and goons for recovery of their dues even from a defaulting party.        
	The bank sought deletion of the comments saying they would prejudice the police probe. The apex court let the remarks stand but clarified they would not be taken into account during investigations.         
	Loan recovery agents hired by banks have been accused of abusing defaulters in office and home  even of calling up their relatives, friends and colleagues  to humiliate and blackmail the customers into paying up. They have been charged with beating up defaulters and even kidnapping them or their children.

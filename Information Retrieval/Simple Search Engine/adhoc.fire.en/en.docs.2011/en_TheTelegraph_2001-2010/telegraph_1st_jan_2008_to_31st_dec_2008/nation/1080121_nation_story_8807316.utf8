	Mumbai, Jan. 20 (PTI): Narendra Modi today took a dig at Sonia Gandhi, saying the Congress president fell ill after the party lost the Gujarat elections and had to be hospitalised.
    
	Modi, who led the BJP to a stunning victory in the Assembly elections, appeared to take off from where he left during the heated poll campaign in Gujarat.
    
	After the results were declared, Soniaben had to be admitted to hospital. The whole of Gujarat had prayed for her recovery, the chief minister said at a rally organised by the Maharashtra party unit to felicitate him. 
    
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said Modi was as egoistic as ever and drunk with power instead of being gracious in victory.

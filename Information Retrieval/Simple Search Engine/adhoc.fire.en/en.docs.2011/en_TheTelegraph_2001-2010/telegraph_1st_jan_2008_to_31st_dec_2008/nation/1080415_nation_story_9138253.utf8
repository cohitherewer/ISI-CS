	Mumbai, April 14: Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has said state laws were not being implemented to discourage migrants, suggesting that the influx needed to be controlled.         
	We cant stop migrants from entering the city constitutionally. But we have laws that can be implemented to discourage migrants, Deshmukh told a meeting.        
	The comments come close on the heels of a controversy generated by Raj Thackerays campaign against migrants.        
	Migrants cannot misuse the citys infrastructure, which is meant for taxpayers, Deshmukh said. He had launched a slum demolition drive three years ago but had to halt it on Sonia Gandhis intervention.

	New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): A consumer court has asked Air India to pay over Rs 90,000 in compensation to the State Trading Corporations chairman-cum-managing director and his wife for the loss of their luggage on a return journey from the UK.        
	Failure of the airline to hand over the booked luggage in its intact position or without any pilferage amounts to deficiency in service and therefore entitles the consumer to reasonable compensation, commission president Justice J.D. Kapoor said.        
	The commission, however, held that the liability to compensate the consumer was a limited liability and was uniformly applicable irrespective of the value of the baggage.        
	It dismissed counter appeals filed by Air India and Arvind Pandalai and his wife Laxmi against a district forum order.        
	A south Delhi-based district forum had asked the state-owned airline to pay Rs 92,000 to Pandalai as compensation, including litigation cost.        
	Despite their efforts, the Pandalais could not get their luggage left behind at Heathrow because of the negligence of Air India staffers.

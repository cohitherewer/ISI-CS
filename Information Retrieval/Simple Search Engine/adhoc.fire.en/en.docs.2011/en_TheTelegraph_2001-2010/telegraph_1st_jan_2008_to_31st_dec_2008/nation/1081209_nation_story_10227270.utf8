The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM goes from one to three in desert
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CPM goes from one to three in desert
          JAYANTH JACOB AND RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Prakash Karat                                   
	New Delhi/Jaipur, Dec. 8: Ek se Anek (From one to many) was the CPMs slogan in Rajasthan, a little ambitious perhaps.         
	More so was its decision to field 34 candidates in a state where the party had one MLA in the 200-member Assembly.        
	Although three is not an impressive number, the CPM can still take pride in that this is its best ever performance in Rajasthan.         
	The CPM had focused on the states northern district of Ganganagar bordering Punjab and the eastern district of Sikar, adjoining Uttar Pradesh, putting its weight behind the farmers agitation for water and electricity.         
	The party fielded 25 of the 34 candidates in these two places, where the campaign was headed by central committee member Hannan Mollah, the MP from Uluberia in Bengal.        
	In 2003, the party had put up 18 nominees across the state.         
	CPM central committee member Amra Ram, who has won three consecutive elections from Dhod, had to shift to the neighbouring seat of Danta Ramgarh, where he won by a margin of 4,919 votes.         
	Dhod, now a reserved seat, was won by 3,145 votes by Prema Ram. At Anupgarh in Ganganagar, Pawan Duggal defeated Kuldeep Indora of the Congress by 21,570 votes.         
	Both Dodh and Danta Ramgarh are in Sikar district, once the bastion of the Congresss powerful farmer leader Balram Jakhar.         
	In the other seats the CPM contested in Sikar district, the party polled 28,000 in Laxmangarh, 17,500 in Sree Madhopur, 22,000 in Khandela and 22,500 in Sikar seat. It had led in Laxmangarh for several rounds but ended up third.        
	In these two districts, the party was at the forefront of the farmers struggle like the one for release of water from the Indira Gandhi canal. The work paid off, said politburo member S. Ramachandran.         
	Although the CPM got less than 1 per cent of total votes in Rajasthan in 2003, polling 0.77 per cent, the party was confident of gaining ground this year and a larger vote share.         
	Their refrain was that the Congress as the chief Opposition party had been passive for five years and had done nothing for farmers.        
	Mollah said: The two biggest movements on the issue of water and power for farmers were led by our party.         
	The CPM has a strong presence in the Shekhawati belt, which covers Fatehpur, Sikar, Lakshmangarh and Jhunjhunu districts. Its influence in the northern districts like Ganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner is also growing, he said. These districts account for nearly 40 Assembly seats.         
	Discontent of the people against both the BJP and the Congress is evident from the elections, the politburo said in a statement in Delhi. Whether it is price rise, agrarian crisis, unemployment or lack of basic services, both parties have been unable to tackle them effectively.

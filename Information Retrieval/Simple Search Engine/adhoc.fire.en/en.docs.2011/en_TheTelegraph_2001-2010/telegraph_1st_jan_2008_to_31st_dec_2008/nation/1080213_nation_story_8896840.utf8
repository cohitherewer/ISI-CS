          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          St Stephens College                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: Delhis St. Stephens College has laid down new eligibility conditions for principal that put former head Anil Wilson out of the running.        
	The new criteria, met by incumbent Reverend Valson Thampu, do not require the principal to meet standards fixed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).        
	According to the new conditions, the principal need not be a PhD. But he/she has to be between 50 and 60 years old, which puts Wilson, who recently turned 60, out of contention. Thampu is 55.        
	In an advertisement that appeared in a daily today, the supreme council of the college said the new principal would have to meet only its criteria, not those set by the UGC or Delhi University.        
	Less than a year ago, however, it had said it was mandatory for the new principal to meet standards set by both the bodies.        
	That advertisement was issued after Wilson left to take over as vice-chancellor of Himachal University. He has since shown interest in returning to St. Stephens as principal.        
	The UGC and Delhi University require all college principals to be PhDs.        
	Though Thampu recently got a PhD in theology from Allahabad Agricultural University, the National Council for Minority Education Institutions has asked DU to scrutinise the legitimacy of the degree.        
	The earlier advertisement, while inviting applications for the post of principal, did not lay down any age restrictions for applicants.        
	The changes have set tongues wagging at the college with those unhappy with Thampu alleging he was fixing the selection process.        
	The college, including the staff and students, are split over Thampus appointment, which has been held illegal by the national minority education council.

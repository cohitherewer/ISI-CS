The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Gas victims on justice march    
	 Survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, which killed thousands and maimed successive generations, are on a padyatra to Delhi, demanding the Prime Minister fulfil his promises.     
	The survivors and their families, joined by over 300 students and supporters, left home on February 20, and are expected to reach the capital by the end of this week. The yatra is to remind the government of its promise to help the victims. There is little evidence Manmohan Singh has delivered on the pledges, Shalini Sharma, an activist working with the victims families, said.     
	On December 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide plant in the heart of the town and spread to other areas.     
	Two years ago, on April 17, 2006, over 50 survivors had walked to Delhi. Unable to meet top officials, they went on a fast. But Singh met and assured them that he would help and do all within law to punish Union Carbide and Dow Chemicals, which has since bought the former company. The protesters say he hasnt delivered.          
	Luxury buses on more routes  
	One of Delhis most popular commuting options, the luxury low-floor buses, will hit one of the citys busiest routes.    
	The buses will soon ply on the Ring Road.    
	The Ring Road services will begin from March, Delhi transport minister Haroon Yusuf said earlier this week. Part of the fleet on the route will come from the 60 new buses expected to arrive from the makers by this month.    
	The minister expressed hope the services would be a big draw, just like they have been elsewhere in the capital.     
	These buses will be non-AC and we hope to get good response from commuters, he said, suggesting the fares wouldnt be high compared with other transport services. AC buses are planned within the next six months.      
	On quota overdrive  
	Andhra Pradesh cant seem to have enough of quota rhetoric.    
	Chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy recently handed appointment letters for jobs in a state power transmission company to seven candidates at his residence before TV cameras. The event was held amid promises to reserve seats in professional educational institutions.    
	The plan to set aside seats for OBCs in the community is in a legal jam, with courts blocking the move. Undeterred, the government declared it would go ahead with such quotas in more areas, come what may.     
	In another move aimed at minorities ahead of next years polls, the Wakf board, the custodian of properties owned by trusts and mosques, has been made a partner in the planned Electronic City. The board, which owns the 1,200 acres on which the project will come up, could earn Rs 300 crore each year  50 times its annual budget. The suggestion to hawk Wakf land and give the money to the Wakf board had come from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Akbaruddin Owaisi.          
	Terminal lapse  
	Off an international flight, and almost out of the domestic terminal.    
	Fifty-eight passengers on an Indian flight from Muscat were taken by their airline bus to the domestic terminal instead of the international one. They would have almost trooped out unchecked by immigration and customs but for their luggage, which was sent to the right place. The mistake was rectified but it took two hours.    
	The incident was a replay of a similar lapse at the Calcutta airport recently where fliers off an international plane were ferried to the domestic arrival lounge.

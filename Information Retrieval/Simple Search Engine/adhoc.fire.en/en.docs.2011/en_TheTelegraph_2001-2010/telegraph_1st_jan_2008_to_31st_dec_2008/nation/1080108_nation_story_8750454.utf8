	Dhanbad, Jan. 7: Improving power supply in Jharkhand could be in the hands of some enterprising men in the coal belt. 
    
	The men, comprising matriculates and graduates, had written to the Prime Minister and suggested a method by which the power situation in the state could be improved. According to the letter, residents of the state could get undisrupted supply, the government could generate revenue in crores and hundreds of youth would find employment if the proposal of the youths was implemented. 
    
	The letter suggests that appointing volunteers to guard the power supply line between the transformers and consumers would curtail pilferage and improve the situation.
    
	There is no power theft at the generation point or while transporting it from sub-stations to transformers. Most power thefts occur after electricity reaches the transformers, and this can be easily checked if volunteers are given the responsibility of looking after the transformers, said Salim Khan, a resident of Nayabazaar in Dhanbad. 
    
	Khan is the key person in designing the formula aimed at improving the power situation. Though a matriculate, Khan has been in the generator business for 10 years. He, along with some friends and business associates, claims to have studied the problem. I have seen how power is stolen and how the government loses money, said Khan. 
    
	Along with the self-devised formula, he bared the facts in an elaborate letter to the Prime Minister on October 5. 
    
	Khan said there are 16,000 transformers in the 22 districts of the state and each could be handed over to a volunteer.

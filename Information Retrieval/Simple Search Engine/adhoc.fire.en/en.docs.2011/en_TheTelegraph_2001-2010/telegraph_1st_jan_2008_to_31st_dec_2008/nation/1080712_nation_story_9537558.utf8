	Bhubaneswar, July 11: Orissa, one of the major riverine states, is exploring the potential of inland water transport sector, apart from going ahead with the Centre-backed plan to develop the Inter-state national waterway 5.         
	The state government has initiated steps to conduct surveys to identify river stretches having the potential for detailed hydro-graphic surveys and detailed project reports.         
	Rail India Techno Economic Services (RITES) has been engaged by the state government for conducting the studies, a senior official of the state commerce and transport department told The Telegraph.         
	As many as 13 rivers (see chart) were identified by the government for the studies.         
	Of them, a 12km stretch of Budhabalang, three stretches comprising a total of 63km in the Kharsuan and 9km of the Daya have been identified for further detailed hydro-graphic surveys and traffic studies to be conducted by RITES.         
	Also locations, for the provision of infrastructure, would also be identified in these stretches, officials said.         
	According to preliminary studies, the identified rivers have enough potential and economic viability to serve as an effective waterway.         
	RITES has, therefore, suggested the development of an inland water transport corridor comprising three stretches of the Kharsuan river from Rajnagar to Aul-Singhpur-Aetpur and extend it up to Jajpur along the Brahmani.         
	The body has proposed to develop another corridor on the Daya up to Balugaon on the banks of the Chilika lake.         
	At present, the state directorate of ports and inland water transports run passenger launch services in Chandbali, Chilika and Astarang.         
	Initiatives are being taken by the directorate to start motor launch service in reservoirs of major and medium dam projects.         
	A river project report for construction of jetties and waiting halls in navigational routes at a cost of Rs 5.34 crore, prepared by ocean engineering centre of the IIT, Chennai, has been submitted to Nabard for assistance under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund.

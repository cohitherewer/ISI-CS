          JAYANTH JACOB                                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: In these times of economic gloom, Indians working abroad have given folks back home something to cheer about.        
	Last year, they sent back $27 billion (Rs 1,35,000 crore) in remittances, the highest among all recipient countries.        
	Experts and officials said the current economic turmoil was not going to affect the remittance inflow, at least for some time.        
	The remittances mostly come from workers who send a certain amount back home every month. Since there is an emotional side to it, even in difficult times they tend to tighten their belts and send the same amount, an official said.        
	Minister for overseas Indian affairs Vayalar Ravi told the Rajya Sabha that the remittance from overseas Indians for the year 2007 was estimated at $27 billion. The minister, who cited Reserve Bank of India data, added that India was the highest recipient of remittances from abroad.        
	The amount in 2006 was $24.6 billion, more than twice the 2000 figure of $12.07 billion. (See chart)        
	According to ministry estimates, 40 per cent of the $27 billion came from unskilled and semi-skilled workers from West Asia.         
	Some 4.5 million Indians are estimated to be working in West Asia, most of them from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.        
	According to the World Bank, India outstrips China in the matter of remittances from expatriates.        
	A World Bank report titled Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008 shows India topping the remittance chart. It says that in 2007, China got $25.7 billion, Mexico $25 billion, the Philippines $17 billion and France $12.5 billion.        
	Government officials said there appeared to be economic as well as practical logic to the calculations that the overall remittance would remain unaffected for a while despite the global meltdown.        
	The global financial crisis shows the banking system collapsing in many places in the West. Naturally, Indians working abroad will find it safer to park their money in our banks. That feeling can result in sending more money homeward, said Girijesh Pant of the Centre for West Asian and African Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.        
	Many who go to the Gulf go for the short term, as do many software professionals going to countries like the US. They usually park their money in India, said S. Irudaya Rajan of the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, a consultant with the ministry of overseas Indian affairs on matters of immigration.        
	West Asia, Pant added, where the bulk of Indian workers who regularly send money home live, is yet to be affected by the global financial crisis.        
	Government sources said even the rupees fall against the dollar would help the remittance flow going up  a view with which both Pant and Rajan agree.        
	Rajan believes that even the doomsday scenario can help maintain, if not increase, the remittance inflow.        
	Consider this extreme case. There are job cuts in the US that result in those working there for three or five years losing their jobs. In that case, too, it is good news for remittance inflow in the short term.

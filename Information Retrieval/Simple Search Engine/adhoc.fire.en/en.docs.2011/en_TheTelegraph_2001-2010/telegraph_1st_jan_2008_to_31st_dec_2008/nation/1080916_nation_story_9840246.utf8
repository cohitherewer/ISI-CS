          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Two young boys took home Rs 50,000 each as reward for informing police of two live bombs they had found in garbage vats after the Saturday blasts.        
	The Delhi police said they were the departments informers, part of their eyes and ears campaign. But most of these eyes and ears had been tightly shut till terror struck.        
	Over the past few months, the police have been losing their grip on the informers. Many of them have given up the job because the pay ceased to be good.        
	One of them, Bunty, had left a biker gang he used to head to turn informer. But as his income dwindled, he returned to crime.         
	Another informer, who claimed she had helped the police trap a gang that had stolen ancient Mahavira idols, went to court saying she had not been given the promised cash reward.        
	The khabri, as informants are known in police parlance, said she had risked her life by acting as a decoy customer. But the police claimed the entire credit for cracking the case.        
	It took me over three months to convince the smugglers that I was a genuine customer. After this, I contacted a constable from Shalimar Bagh police station who informed a sub-inspector and finally the higher-ups. All this for nothing. I will never help the police again, she said.        
	Officers pay informers out of their own pockets, and are later reimbursed from police funds.        
	Khabris have been a goldmine of information for police departments across the country. They were the feeder line for Mumbai encounter specialists Daya Nayak and Pradeep Sharma.        
	Informers are important cogs in the wheel. No amount of technology, intercepts or tapping can substitute for human intelligence-gathering. But what needs to be understood is that these informers are not messiahs  they do it for money or for some personal agenda, said M.N. Singh, a former Mumbai police commissioner.        
	Its the duty of the police to sift through the information they provide. This transaction of information and reward, in the form of money and material, is a corrupt system  whichever way you look at it.        
	Over the years, informers have realised that helping the police has not only stopped being lucrative but is fraught with danger.        
	Police sources say instances of their information being used against them have driven many khabris away.        
	In February 2006, a person named Haji Ghulam Dar, who claimed to be instrumental in the surrender of more than 300 militants in Kashmir, was arrested in Delhi on the charge of helping the rebels.        
	He filed a petition in Delhi High Court and cited a letter signed by the Jammu and Kashmir additional director-general of police, which said he had been working with the state police to neutralise militants.        
	Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal launched his eyes and ears campaign this year, urging all citizens to help the force tackle terror. But the move hasnt worked to plan.         
	Its very difficult to fight terror in metros like Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore by tapping phones and intercepting messages, a senior officer said, adding that informers from small towns could be a big help as most plots are hatched there.         
	Keeping your ear to the ground at this local level  nuggets of information passed on through word of mouth or overheard at teashops  is whats needed to foil terror plans, the officer said.        
	Terrorists too are human. Over the months they take to plan an operation, they talk, mix with local residents and, in the process, leak information, he added.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 19: The ensuing monsoon session commencing tomorrow, though brief, is likely to be stormy with both the Congress-led Opposition and ruling BJD-BJP coalition training their guns against each other.         
	The Opposition Congress has decided to make the recently launched Rs 2 kg per rice scheme as the major issue.         
	The BJD-BJP government is trying to take all the credit out of the scheme, while it is the Centre that is providing the Rs 11 per kg subsidy and the government is contributing Rs 3, said Opposition whip Satya Bhushan Sahu.        
	The session will conclude on August 29 with eight sitting days.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has asked all ruling party legislators to be present in the House to give fitting replies to the Opposition offensive, said state parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty.        
	The Opposition will also attack the government for artificial scarcity of fertiliser, deterioration in law and order, mis-utilisation of central funds, irregularities in implementation of National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and polticisation of flood relief.        
	The ruling combine, on the other hand, will bring a motion against the UPA government at the Centre for its alleged neglect of Orissa, said parliamentary affairs minister.         
	Mohanty adding that the new national mineral policy and inordinate delay in the revision of royalty rates of coal and other minerals that causes huge revenue losses to Orissa would also be discussed.        
	Mohanty said the issue of note-for-vote during the trust vote in Lok Sabha would also be raised and discussed.        
	In order to snub the UPA government and the Congress, official motions will be moved protesting the spiralling price-rise of essential commodities and the UPA leaderships support to JMMs demand for inclusion of three districts of Orissa in the scheme of a Greater Jharkhand.

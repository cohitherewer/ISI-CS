	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Sonia Gandhi is ready for business, not bouquets.
    
	Eight Congress general secretaries walked into 10 Janpath to meet the party president for the first time this year, each carrying flowers.
    
	Sonia, who spent the first week of the year in hospital after an asthma attack, looked pale but the dimples were in place. She greeted her guests with a smile and a namaste. However, for health reasons, she declined their bouquets. 
    
	Within seconds of exchanging pleasantries, the leader was talking business. She asked each general secretary about the affairs in the states they were in charge of. 
    
	Gujarat figured too when someone pointed to a media report claiming the party had blown up Rs 450 crore on the elections. Sonia broke into laughter and joked with Ahmad Patel whether the party indeed had such funds. 
    
	Prithivraj Chavan briefed Sonia about poll preparations in Karnataka and Tripura.
    
	A quick assessment was given on Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi, which will vote in 2008. 
    
	Priya Ranjan Das Munshis likely appointment as Bengal Congress president was discussed. Munshi is also tipped to retain his place in the Union ministry.
    
	Patel, who is Sonias political secretary, was insisting the guests wrap up in 10 minutes as scheduled. But Sonia overruled him and the meeting continued past 20 minutes without a tea or coffee break.
    
	In the evening, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee called on her. 
    
	Earlier, Sonia was to meet visiting foreign dignitaries but cancelled these courtesy calls citing health reasons.

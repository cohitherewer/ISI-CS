                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     PM lands price-politics punch on Left     -  Scare-monger sermon after Karat team visit
          OUR BUREAU                          Prakash Karat                                        
	New Delhi, April 25: Manmohan Singh hurtled towards a fresh row with the Left today when his office warned parties against scare-mongering and politicising price rise immediately after a team led by Prakash Karat had met him on the issue.        
	There is no need to indulge in scare-mongering. The Prime Minister urged all political parties to eschew the temptation of politicising the misery of the people and warned against creating an environment of scarcity, which would only encourage speculators and hoarders, said a release from Prime Ministers media adviser, Sanjaya Baru.        
	Singh left for Jammu and Kashmir soon afterwards but in Delhi, angry Left leaders called the statement very unfortunate.        
	An embarrassed Congress refused to comment on the release officially but party sources  wary of opening a new front against the Left amid the nuclear standoff  termed the part about politicisation apolitical and unnecessary.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: By saying this, they (the Prime Ministers Office) are themselves politicising the issue. Government must eschew the irresponsibility of being callous towards the hardships of the people.        
	Yechury, part of the delegation that met Singh in the morning, emphasised that it was the duty of political parties to raise peoples issues.        
	A Congress leader almost echoed him, saying: If parties dont articulate peoples miseries, who will?        
	A source close to Singh, however, said the statement contained no hidden meanings. If the parties keep saying inflation, food scarcity day after day, what effect will it have on consumers? They will start hoarding and things wont improve.        
	Singhs meeting with the Left came on a day food prices stopped rising although inflation remained above 7 per cent courtesy a surge in mineral prices, led by iron ore.        
	The Left had six demands, such as cuts in customs and other duties on petroleum and its products, a ban on futures trading in all 25 essential commodities and strengthening of the public distribution system. Yechury said the Prime Minister promised to look into the suggestions.         
	Asked if the demands would have an impact on the passage of the finance bill, to be voted on soon, Karat said: There are one or two demands that are linked to the finance bill. The others are broader issues.        
	P. Chidambarams statement in the Lok Sabha suggested the Centre was not against taking hard measures but was unsure when inflation may subside.        
	The steps taken will take some time to have an impact. Every possible measure is being taken. We must be patient, the finance minister said.

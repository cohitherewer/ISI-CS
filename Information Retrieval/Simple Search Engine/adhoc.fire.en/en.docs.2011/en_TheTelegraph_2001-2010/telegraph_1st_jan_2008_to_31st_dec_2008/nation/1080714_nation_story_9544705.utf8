          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, July 13: The BJP has taken recourse to V.P. Singh model to define its new relationship with the Left.         
	The party today made it clear that it has no reservation against joining hands with the Left to vote against the confidence motion to be moved by the UPA on July 22 against the backdrop of the present political turmoil over the nuclear deal. Why the BJP will have reservation regarding the Left? The party earlier joined hands with the Congress in 1990 to vote against the confidence motion that toppled the V.P. Singh government, party spokesman Ravishankar Prasad told reporters today in the afternoon. We (BJP) are opposing the nuke deal, as it would cap Indias strategic capacities, Prasad said.

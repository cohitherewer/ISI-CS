          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: India today expressed grave concern and unhappiness at the growing number of casualties of unarmed Tamils in military action in northern Sri Lanka as well as attacks on Indian fishermen by the countrys navy.         
	Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi told the Prime Minister over phone that the killings were genocide.        
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan summoned Sri Lankan deputy high commissioner G.G.A.D. Palithaganegoda to express Delhis strong unhappiness and grave concern over the killing of Sri Lankan Tamils.        
	Narayanan also expressed concern over the continuing attacks on Indian fishermen.         
	A fisherman was killed yesterday in alleged firing by the Lankan navy in Palk Strait, off the Tamil Nadu coast.        
	The Lankans have denied the navys hand, saying: Upon verification, we learnt that our navy was nowhere in the vicinity of Kachchatheevu. We suspect the attack was orchestrated by third parties, possibly the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).         
	This incident came up during Narayanans meeting with the envoy. Karunanidhi, too, raised the issue of fishermens deaths with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	It was conveyed to Palithaganegoda that the attacks on fishermen were not in keeping with the spirit of the understanding between the countries.         
	Narayanan told the envoy that the Sri Lankan navy should cease such attacks and not lose sight of the humanitarian and livelihood dimensions of this issue, a foreign ministry statement said.         
	So far, over 30 Indian fishermen have lost their lives allegedly in Lankan naval firing this year and almost all the political parties in Tamil Nadu have flayed the state government on the matter.         
	During the recent Saarc summit in Colombo, Singh and Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse had discussed the matter of Indian fishermen after which Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation had announced that they could fish in the Palk Strait.

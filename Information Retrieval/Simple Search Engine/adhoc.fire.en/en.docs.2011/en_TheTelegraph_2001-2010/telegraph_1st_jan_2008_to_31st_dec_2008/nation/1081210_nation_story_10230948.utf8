          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 9: Union minister Md Taslimuddin has been accused of trying to extort Rs 2 crore from a Siliguri-based construction company.        
	The firm, BSJV, has lodged an FIR at Jokhihat police station in Bihars Araria, Taslimuddins home, superintendent of police M.A.A. Sidiqqui said today.         
	Jokhihat police sources said the minister of state for civil supplies allegedly demanded the money so the firm could carry out a project in the area.        
	Sidiqqui said: The investigation is in progress. We will tell you more only when we get the details.        
	Taslimuddin, an MP from nearby Kishanganj, couldnt be contacted. He was said to be out of home meeting people in the district on the occasion of Id-ul Zuha.        
	A Patna court had issued an arrest warrant against Taslimuddin in 2004, the year he was elected, over fraud charges. He had surrendered and secured bail.         
	Before that, he was dropped as Union minister of state for home from the H.D. Deve Gowda cabinet after being accused of rape and other crimes.

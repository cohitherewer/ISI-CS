          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Relatives mourn death of Kalinga Nagar firing victims. File picture		    
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: Parallel meetings and rallies marked the second anniversary of police firing that claimed 14 lives at Kalinga Nagar industrial complex in Jajpur district.        
	Vistapan Virodhi Jana Manch, the organisation spearheading the agitation against the proposed steel plant of Tatas, organised a maha samabesh (big rally). More than 2,000 representatives of various anti-displacement organisations from several places across the country, including Nandigram, Singur, Posco-project area, Lanjigarh, Kashipur, Kakinada, Polavaram and Ludhiana, attended the rally. They expressed their solidarity with the anti-displacement movement in Kalinga Nagar and vowed not to allow the Tata Steel project to come up.        
	On the other hand, hundreds of local displaced tribals held a parallel meeting and rally under the banner of Bisthapita Parivar Unnayan Parishad. We want industrialisation, peace and progress was their slogan.        
	Though the two meeting sites were just one-and-a-half km away, there was no standoff or clash between the anti-displacement protesters and pro-plant groups, much to the relief of the district administration.        
	More than 18 platoons of armed police forces were deployed in Kalinga Nagar today to prevent any untoward incident, said Jajpur superintendent of police D.S. Kutte.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Renuka: No takers                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Each of Indias 6.5 lakh anganwadis is to provide students fresh cooked meals over the next two years, the cabinet committee on economic affairs has decided.        
	The committee trashed a controversial proposal by women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury to provide pre-cooked meals at the anganwadis.        
	After a meeting on October 16, the committee announced its decision to set up a group of ministers (GoM) to study the alternative plan to feed the students packaged food.        
	The proposal had earlier been panned by the Prime Ministers Office and the Planning Commission, but officials at the women and child development ministry had attempted to portray the decision to set up the GoM as a victory.         
	However, minutes of the committee meeting  a copy is available with The Telegraph  reveal that the GoM had only been given the task of expediting a switchover to hot cooked meals in consultation with state governments.         
	The minutes also state that the panel directed that arrangements be made for serving hot cooked meals in all anganwadis under the Integrated Child Development Scheme within the next two years.         
	The ICDS, the worlds largest child care scheme, caters to over 80 million children under the age of six.         
	Chowdhury had argued that in the absence of proper kitchen facilities at many anganwadis, packaged food was a better option than cooked meals.

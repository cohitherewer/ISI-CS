          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 14: One Ajay Yadav (43), the son of former Khagaria MP Ramsharan Yadav, was reportedly shot by his cousin Ranbir Yadav, also the husband of Khagaria JD(U) MLA.        
	Ajay was shot in the chest around 11.10am by Ranbir, the husband of Poonam Devi Yadav, when Ajay and his supporters allegedly tried to claim possession of a 5katha plot at Chukti under Mansi police station of Khagaria, some 175km from here.        
	The officer in charge of Mansi police station, Tarkeshwar Ram, said Ranbir, a murder convict, shot at Ajay after objecting to the latters move that he saw as a step to possess his plot.         
	Ajay, in his statement to the police, however, have said: Ranbir fired at me after his wife provoked him.        
	Ajay suffered bullet injuries on his chest and has been admitted to Sadar hospital in Khagaria.         
	He is stated to be out of danger.         
	Ram confirmed that an FIR under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC has been registered against Ranbir.         
	Police, however, seem reluctant to name Khagaria MLA Poonam Devi Yadav as a co-accused in the case. I cannot comment at this stage, said Ram.         
	Ranbir has been on the run right after the murder charge was slapped on him. There are hit-and-run charges against him, too. He reportedly hit two people while trying to flee through Mansi market, the officer added.        
	Talking to The Telegraph over Poonam Devis phone, Ranbir said: I am presently at my Khagaria home and have not visited Chukti of late. How can I shoot someone there?        
	Ajay and I have been engaged in this property dispute for long. Our fathers property was divided, but not on paper, he said.        
	Ajay tried to hoist flags for Ram Navami on my land. I informed Mansi police to help me stop him from trespassing on my land. The police assured to help us but did nothing, he added.        
	According to Ranbir apprehending trouble he decided to stay back in his home and send his employee, Shankar, who was shot at by Ajays supporters. Shankar is out of danger but Ranbir added, a counter-FIR has been registered against Ajay for firing at Shankar. JD(U) MLA Poonam Yadav was not available for her comments.

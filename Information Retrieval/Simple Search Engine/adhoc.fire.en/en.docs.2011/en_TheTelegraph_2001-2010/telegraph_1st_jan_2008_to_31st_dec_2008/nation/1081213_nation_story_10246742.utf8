          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sorabjee: PIL heat                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to answer a petitioners charge that security forces had been left to fight terror without good weapons or equipment.        
	At least police must be better equipped. They still have World War II rifles (and lack) bullet-proof jackets, said Mukul Rohatgi, the counsel for former attorney-general and Mumbai resident Soli J. Sorabjee, who filed the public interest litigation.        
	Rohatgi argued that the police and other security personnel had so far been equipped only to deal with law-and-order situations. (Now) they have to be better equipped to deal with terror and other situations.        
	The petition quoted the managing director of MKU, the sole supplier of bullet-proof vests to the government, as saying: India has only 100,000 bullet-proof vests for police and paramilitary forces.        
	The rest were just issued with 5mm-thick plastic body protectors designed for riot control, the petition claimed.        
	The helmets used (by police during the Mumbai attacks) were (from the) World War II era, not designed for combat. Most of the police involved were carrying .303s or self-loading rifles like those adopted by the British army in the 1950s. Some officers said they were not given enough weapons training because of a shortage of ammunition and shooting ranges, the petition claimed.        
	Rohatgi also cited how it had taken the National Security Guard commandos nine-and-a-half hours to reach Mumbai to battle the attackers because they had no aircraft at their disposal.        
	He demanded that better-equipped forces like the NSG should be stationed at all public places. Their presence must be felt in railway stations, airports and other public places, he said.        
	The petition said the police needed modern arms and ammunition, including heat-seeking sensors and infra-red surveillance systems. Terror has become endemic and needs to be tackled at various levels.        
	It added: The petition has been filed to ensure that the police departments and security forces across the country are properly equipped and trained to handle situations of terrorism. It is apparent that the current levels of training and weaponry possessed by police are antiquated and unable to cope with the arms and technology employed by the terrorists.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan issued notices to the home ministry, asking it to respond to the petitioner.

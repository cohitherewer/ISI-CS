     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Over 100 Class XI students of the G.D. Birla Centre for Education at Ranikuthi were detained for nine hours after class today allegedly because they were watching something objectionable on a school computer.
    
	The boys had brought a CD and were watching it in class when their teacher walked in, sources said. Principal Bharati Bhattacharjee and teachers then held a meeting. The students were asked to stay back and several parents waited. The students were allowed to take the school buses home around 9pm.
    
	We learnt that some students were watching something objectionable. This was a clear breach of discipline, Bhattacharjee later said. However, its not possible to say anything before we find concrete evidence. We have set up a probe committee.

	New Delhi, May 21: Noida police today questioned murdered teenager Aarushis dentist parents while sources hinted a vital lead had come from her maternal uncle who, too, was grilled and cracked under pressure.        
	A special task force officer said the three were questioned from 10am to 5pm together and then individually.        
	A source said the disclosures of Aarushis uncle Sameer Tipnis, who had flown down from Dubai days earlier and was present at the Talwar house that night, helped connect several missing links in the murders of Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, 45.         
	His revelations also explained why Nupur and Rajesh Talwar would lock up their 15-year-old daughter at night.        
	The sources said what Tipnis had told the police had also revealed that Aarushi was killed first, and then Hemraj was disposed of as he was a witness to the murder.        
	While the police spoke about Rajeshs alleged affair with a lady doctor yesterday, the sources said she and her immediate family might be closely linked to the case.        
	Although the police have not revealed details of the interrogation, sources said they had already cracked the case and were waiting for political clearance, which they usually do in a high-profile case, before making an announcement.        
	A top politician happens to be a patient of Rajesh, a well-known medical professional at Fortis Hospital, Noida.        
	Additional director-general of Uttar Pradesh police Brij Lal said: The way in which the throat of Aarushi was cut points out that it is the work of a professional who could be a doctor or a butcher. Nupur, too, isnt above suspicion. She is said to have received and made 21 calls to a single number on May 15, the day of the murders.         
	Rajesh today told the media: I have no idea who killed my daughter and I have nothing do with the murder.

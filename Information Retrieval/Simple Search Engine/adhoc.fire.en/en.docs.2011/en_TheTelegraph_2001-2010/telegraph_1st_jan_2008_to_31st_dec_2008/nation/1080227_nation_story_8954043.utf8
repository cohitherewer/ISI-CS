 Bengal misses Lalu largesse

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Bengal got four new trains today, a fraction of what Lalu Prasad gifted election-bound Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.
    
	Three weekly trains  the Asansol-Mumbai Express, Radhikapur-Delhi Express and the Calcutta-Murshidabad Hazar Duari Express  and the thrice-a-week Malda Town-Patna Express are all that Bengal got, though the official list mentioned eight new trains. Officials later explained that even trains passing through the state were included in the list.
    
	The weekly Lokmanya Tilak-Howrah Samrasta Express has been made a bi-weekly. 
    
	Most of the new trains are from constituencies which are Congress strongholds.... Laluji seems to have ignored not only Bengal, but also the Northeast and Orissa, complained RSP MP Abani Roy.
    
	MPs from Left-ruled Bengal walked out of the House but their comrades from Kerala sat tight, happy with the gift of a railway coach factory. 
    
	Not everyone from Bengal was complaining, though. Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis constituency Raiganj was thrilled to get its first direct link to Delhi in the Radhikapur Express.
    
	Madhya Pradesh, which the Congress hopes to wrest from the BJP in the elections this year, got 13 new trains as did Delhi, where Sheila Dikshits Congress government faces the poll test. 
    
	Its an election express all right trains to all states where there will be elections, said Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi, who has served on parliamentary railway committees. 
    
	Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where too the Congress is eyeing a comeback, got eight and five services, respectively, which included new trains as well as extensions and increase in the frequency of existing trains. Karnataka didnt do too badly either, getting nine new trains. The state will vote this year.
    
	Elections or not, there was no beating Bihar  the railway ministers home state was the clear winner with 19 new trains. 
    
	Lalu Prasad, however, came out with a chart to show he was not being parochial, pointing out that even states with thin passenger traffic like Jammu and Kashmir had got new trains. 
    
	Tamil Nadu, where ally DMK holds the reins, got 12 new trains and three new railway lines.

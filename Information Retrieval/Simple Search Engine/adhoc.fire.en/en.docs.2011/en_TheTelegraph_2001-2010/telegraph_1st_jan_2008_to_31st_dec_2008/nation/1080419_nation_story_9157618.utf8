	Kanpur, April 18 (PTI): A first-year BTech student of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, today allegedly committed suicide because of exam stress.        
	Prashant Kumar, a city resident who was a electrical engineering student, locked himself in his hostel room in the hall number 2 around 12.30pm, IIT assistant registrar K.V. Satyamoorthy said. He said some of Prashants friends broke open the door around 4.30pm and found him hanging from the ceiling fan.         
	No suicide note was found, Satyamoorthy said, adding that Prashant was mentally disturbed and under medication. Semester examinations begin next Monday.

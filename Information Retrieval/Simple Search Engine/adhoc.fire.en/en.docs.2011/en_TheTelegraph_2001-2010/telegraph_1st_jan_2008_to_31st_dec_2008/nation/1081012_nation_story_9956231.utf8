          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 11: The prime accused in the nun rape case in Kandhamal was arrested today from Palakkad district in Kerala, state crime branch sources said.        
	The 25-year-old youth was arrested along with two others  one 23-year-old and another 40-year-old man  from MPS rice mill in Palakkad where they had been working for some time.         
	So far, eight persons have been arrested in connection with the nun rape case.        
	The 29-year-old nun, who has taken shelter at a church in New Delhi, had alleged in a complaint lodged at the Baliguda police station on August 26 that she was raped and paraded naked by a Hindu mob in Nuagaon village in Kandhamal the day before.         
	However, the police sat over the case for about a month and collected the medical examination report establishing the rape only by the end of September.        
	Meanwhile, the Orissa government has acted on allegations that the riot victims staying at relief camps in Kandhamal were being threatened with dire consequences if they did not reconvert to Hinduism.        
	According to a senior official of the state home department, it has introduced registers at every camp to record such allegations.         
	Adequate security cover, he added, had been provided at these camps with the help of central paramilitary forces.                           
	At present, 53 companies of central paramilitary forces  apart from the state armed police personnel  have been deployed in the strife-torn areas.        
	At the peak of the riots in Kandhamal, more than 23,000 people had taken shelter at various relief camps set up across the district. They constituted about 20 per cent of the Christian population of the district. The number of people at camps has now come down to about 13,000, said the official.        
	The state government has also announced a package for the rehabilitation of riot victims. It includes cash compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased, a house building assistance of Rs 50,000 for those whose homes were damaged completely, assistance for household articles and for restarting businesses.        
	An assistance of Rs 2 lakh has also been announced for public institutions such as schools, hostels, dispensaries and hospitals, which were damaged in the riots.        
	Claiming that the situation in Kandhamal has been normal and under control, an official release said there had been practically no incident of violence in the district for more than 10 days. There had been a significant decline in the number of clashes after August 27, it added.

	Patna, May 6: Over 200 detonators and crude bombs were seized last night near a dam at Polmahadeo village in Nawada, about 200km from here, from suspected Naxalites.        
	Sources said the police surrounded the area near the dam under Govindpur police station following a tip-off. Sensing the police presence, rebels hurled bombs and fired at the police team, which retaliated. The rebels eventually retreated. The police then carried out a search.

	Calcutta, Jan. 12: Blaze-ravaged Burrabazar might have got away with lesser devastation but a host of illegal buildings made things more difficult for firefighters.
    
	Civic officials said eight buildings in Tirpalpatti, the adjoining Kashiram block of the Nandaram market as well as the main Nandaram block were all illegal structures.
    
	All the structures affected today have been illegally constructed, said Gora Chand Mondol, the director-general of buildings, Calcutta Municipal Corporation.
    
	We broke portions of the Kashiram block on several occasions and demolished eight floors of the Nandaram block but couldnt demolish the entire market as the owners went to court.
    
	The Nandaram market complex was the tallest illegal building in Calcutta in the late 1970s.
    
	Civic officials said the authorities gave permission for only four floors but the owners went ahead and built a 21-storey structure.
    
	Mayoral council member (building) Dipankar Dey said the authorities later managed to raze the top eight floors as they were not occupied.
    
	Even today, at 13 floors, it is the citys tallest illegal structure despite five partial demolitions, the last of them in the late eighties.
    
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, however, insisted that even the first four floors were illegal as they deviated from the plan approved by the CMC.
    
	Bhattacharyya said the Supreme Court had in 2000 passed a demolition order but it could not be implemented as the building was fully occupied and the residents had driven out the CMC squad.
    
	No one from Brabourne Properties Private Limited, the buildings owner, could be reached for comment.
    
	This evening, after a discussion with Dey and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay, the mayor ruled out relaxation of building rules for reconstructing the markets. All post-fire reconstruction work can be allowed strictly in accordance with building rules only, he said.
    
	On Tirpalpatti, Bhattacharyya said he had spoken to police officers and it had been decided that tarpaulin traders will not be allowed to erect temporary structures encroaching upon the pavement.
    
	And, in no circumstances, will they be allowed to store their wares on pavements and the carriageway.
    
	Mondol, the CMC director-general for buildings, said the Burrabazar area  from Posta, Kali Krishna Tagore Street to Canning Street, China Bazaar and NS Bose Road and Ezra Street  had the highest concentration of illegal and unsafe commercial buildings in the city.
    
	Municipal commissioner Bandopadhyay has given orders to pull down buildings left unsafe by the fire.
    
	The pulling down of the unsafe portions will start after forensic experts collect samples from the site, said chief engineer (solid waste management) Arun Sarkar, ready with a 200-strong demolition squad, four payloaders and a bulldozer.

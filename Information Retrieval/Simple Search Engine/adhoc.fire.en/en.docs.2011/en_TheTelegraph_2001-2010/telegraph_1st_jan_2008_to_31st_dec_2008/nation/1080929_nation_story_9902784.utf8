                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     House okays, deal on hold in Senate
   White House pressure ruffles dissidents 
          K.P. NAYAR                          Bush: Vote bother                                        
	New York, Sept. 28: Despite a convincing vote in the US House of Representatives in favour of the nuclear deal with India, it may yet be a case of mission accomplished for the Bush administration.         
	Unless Harry Reid, the leader of Democrats in the US Senate, can persuade one or more of his dissident colleagues to lift a hold on the nuclear deal being voted on in his chamber in the next few days, the primary symbol of the new Indo-US amity may languish on Capitol Hill.         
	At least one senator has blocked the deal and under the complex procedures in the Senate, the hold can prevent the legislation operationalising the deal from coming to a vote. The hold can be anonymous and the Indian American community and other friends of India were today engaged in a major effort to find out the identity of the senator(s) who is blocking the deal.         
	US President George W. Bush issued a statement within minutes of the deals passage in the House of Representatives  which was widely anticipated  and urged the Senate to follow suit.         
	I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important piece of legislation before their October adjournment. Signing this bipartisan bill will help strengthen our partnership with India, he said.         
	Reid appeared confident last night that obstacles in his chamber to the deal would be overcome before the Senate adjourns for the November elections, possibly on October 3.         
	There is statutory time we have. We can run that out. At the end of that time, senators have 10 hours of debate time and then we vote. So there are very few hurdles we have to jump on that, he said in remarks to the media in Washington.         
	But Reid confirmed that there are several senators who have concerns about non-proliferation aspects of the agreement with India.         
	The concerns were reflected in yesterdays vote in the House of Representatives, where the number of legislators opposed to the deal rose by nearly 40 per cent from those who voted in 2006 against the Hyde Act that enabled the deal.         
	Sources on Capitol Hill said some of those who voted against the deal yesterday did so because they were resentful that an unpopular White House was pressurising them to approve the deal at break-neck speed at a time when even many Republicans are trying to distance themselves from Bush in the run-up to their re-election to the House.         
	The House vote yesterday was 298 for the deal and 117 against. In 2006, only 68 House members had voted against the Hyde Act. The Bush administration appeared confident yesterday that the deal could be operationalised before it demits office on January 20 next year, perhaps even next week.         
	But this White House has a history of misjudgements, the most glaring example of which was Bushs mission accomplished speech on US naval ship Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003, when he claimed that American combat operations had ended in Iraq. In fact, the worst in Iraq was yet to come.         
	Reflecting the administrations confidence about a quick Senate were plans being made yesterday for a visit by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to New Delhi to sign and seal the deal.         
	Although no dates for the visit by Rice have been officially announced, there is speculation that she may reach New Delhi by October 3 if the Senate approves the deal by then.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was told about the House vote yesterday, minutes before he addressed the Indian American community here. He said the journey President Bush and I embarked upon is nearing fruition.         
	Singh said once the nuclear deal becomes operational, India will be liberated from the constraints of technology denial of 34 years. It will add an important strategic pillar to our bilateral partnership. We will widen our clean energy options.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shamed Speaker steps down
                                                                                                               Shamed Speaker steps down
          SUBRAT DAS                                              Maheswar Mohanty        
	Bhubaneswar, March 31: Heads rolled today after a week of turmoil over allegations of sexual harassment against the Orissa Speaker.        
	While Speaker Maheswar Mohanty resigned this afternoon, information and public relations minister Debasis Nayak was sacked for his alleged role in fuelling the charges made by assistant lady marshal Gayatri Panda.         
	Last week, Panda had accused Mohanty of assigning her duty beyond working hours and out of her area of jurisdiction. He would make inappropriate gestures and send his driver and staff to persuade me to get into a physical relationship with him, she had said, adding that the Speaker had twice sent his official car to fetch her from her house around midnight.         
	Mohanty sent his resignation letter in Oriya to deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora this afternoon.         
	He said he was stepping down to uphold the dignity of the Assembly and the office of the Speaker. I am pained to see that some people tried to create an unsavoury situation out of the false allegations and others tried to politicise the issue.        
	Mohanty requested Dora to institute an impartial probe and take appropriate action against the guilty.         
	Reacting to the Speakers resignation, NGO activist Rituparna Mohanty, who had filed an FIR on Pandas behalf, said: This proves that no one is above the law.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik was more sympathetic to his Biju Janata Dal colleague. I understand Mohanty felt uncomfortable with the way a section of the House was behaving, he said.        
	Patnaik today recommended Nayaks dismissal to governor M.C. Bhandare, which he later accepted. I recommended his removal since he no longer enjoys my confidence, the chief minister said.         
	Mohantys supporters have alleged that Nayak had a hand in Pandas accusation. Some vernacular newspapers also published photographs showing Nayak in a room in a guesthouse adjacent to the one from where the marshal had levelled the charges on the night of March 25.

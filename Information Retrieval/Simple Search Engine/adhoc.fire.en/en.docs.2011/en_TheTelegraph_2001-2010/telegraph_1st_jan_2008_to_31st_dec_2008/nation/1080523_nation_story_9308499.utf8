	May 22: A 40-year-old gardener, Ramesh Chandra Sethi, had to be admitted to the Capital Hospital by IAS officer Ardhendhu Shekhar Sarangi yesterday after the latters son, Andy Sarangi, attacked him with a spade.        
	This is allegedly the second instance of Andy misbehaving with people. He was taken in police custody earlier and released on bail.        
	Sethi was later rushed to the neurosurgery department of the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. The head of the neurosurgery department, B.D. Lenka, said Sethi had sustained head injury and fracture.         
	He underwent brain surgery today and was under post-operative care and observation. His condition is stable, said the doctor.        
	Late last night, Sethis friends lodged a complaint at the Capital police station, following which police registered a case.         
	Leaders of State Low-paid Employees Association today demanded that the culprit be arrested immediately.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 20: Electrocution of a tusker in the state, less than three months after a mother and calf died under similar circumstances, has triggered concern among activists.         
	Negligence on the part of the Northeastern Electricity Supply Company of Orissa (Nesco) was evident in the tragedy. Wildlife department should sue the company for criminal negligence, said an exasperated J.B. Das, the secretary of Orissa chapter of People for Animals.         
	The elephant was electrocuted near Kumarmal village, 160km from Rourkela in Sundergarh. It had reportedly strayed from its herd, moving along the Gariamal-Bamra forest corridor, and had died after coming into contact with a low 33KV high-tension line.         
	The carcass, with one tusk intact, was found by villagers. Police and wildlife officers had ruled out involvement of poachers in the animal death.         
	The officers, too, cannot be absolved of negligence. Though they were aware of the fact that the area was an elephant corridor, they took no precautionary measure, Das fumed.         
	In May, a high-tension electric wire at Badrama Ghati range, along Sambalpur-Deogarh border electrocuted a mother and her calf.         
	The wire was just 6ft above the ground.         
	Both the animals died on the spot. The intensity of the shock was so high that it burnt and severed the mothers trunk, while trapping the calf holding on to her. On December 14, 2008, an elephant was electrocuted near Balakrushnapur under Dakshinapur in Ganjam.

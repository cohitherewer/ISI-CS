  - Development takes centre stage, Cong sniffs politics        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish Kumar, Ram Vilas Paswan and Lalu Prasad join hands to light the lamp for reconstructing Hindustan Fertiliser in Barauni on Wednesday.

	Patna, Nov. 12: Till date, leaders from Bihar talked unity in the aftermath of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)-led attacks on people from the Hindi heartland. Today, the trinity of Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan displayed solidarity for Bihars development and also to protect people from being assaulted in Maharashtra.         
	The trio got united to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on October 26 on the issue of Raj Thackerays MNS-led assault on the people of Bihar. Soon, they fell apart indulging in war of words.         
	While Nitish unilaterally got his partys five MPs quit the Lok Sabha on the emotive issue, Lalu Prasad dared him to quit the chief ministers post while offering that he would quit the Union cabinet along with other RJD ministers.        
	The acrimony among them escalated further with Paswan attacking Nitish for taking unilateral action of getting his MPs resign to reap political harvest.        
	But today in Barauni, about 120km from here, the bickering had gone with unity taking centre stage once again during the reconstruction ceremony of Hindustan Fertiliser, closed more than a decade ago.        
	Even as state Congress leaders sniffed vote bank politics in the public display of harmony, Lalu Prasad said how Rs 65,000-crore worth railway development projects were in progress in various parts of the state.         
	Paswan, the chemical and fertiliser minister, announced that the Union cabinet had sanctioned Rs 10,000 crore for setting up of a petrochemical factory in Barauni, a north Bihar industrial town in Begusarai district on the Ganga.        
	Nitish, while praising the two leaders for contributing to the development of the state, said: My government is ready to give land, infrastructure and other assistance to the Centre-sponsored projects in the state.        
	Nitish joined Lalu and Paswan in asserting: We are united for the development of the state and also on the issue of assault on people from Hindi heartland in Maharashtra.        
	At this, Paswan replied in his own way: We are united. But we must be united in our action too.         
	They have shared the common platform more with an aim to guard their respective vote banks in the run-up to the general elections rather than the purpose to strike a unity among them. Lalu Prasad and Paswan are all set to indulge in fierce fight against the Nitish-led NDA in Bihar, said a senior Congress leader, adding: Nothing much can be seen in this show of unity for a deer and a tiger cannot drink water on a same river bank.

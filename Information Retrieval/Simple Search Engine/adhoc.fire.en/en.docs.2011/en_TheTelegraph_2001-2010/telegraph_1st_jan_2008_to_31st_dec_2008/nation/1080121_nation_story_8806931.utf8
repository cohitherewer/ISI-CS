	New Delhi, Jan. 20: Plans to make travel to India hassle-free has again run into the home ministry hurdle.
    
	The keepers of Indias internal security, who had earlier shot down a proposal for a welcome service for foreigners, has now blocked a plan to introduce visas on arrival.
    
	The ministry of tourism had recommended that nationals of some select countries be offered the visa-on-arrival facility to attract more visitors.
    
	However, the home ministry rejected the suggestion citing security threats. It said India, being one of the prime targets of terrorism, could not afford to take chances.
    
	The tourism ministry wanted visa on arrival for visitors from 18 countries  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Finland, Spain, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, New Zealand, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Vietnam and South Korea.
    
	The tourism ministrys argument was that neighbours like Nepal and Sri Lanka were drawing more tourists than India because of their lenient visa laws. The visa-on-arrival option would prompt many tourists travelling to these countries to make a trip to India even if it was not on their original itinerary, officials pointed out. 
    
	It would also help those travelling on an impulse or in an emergency, they said. 
    
	But the home ministry has countered all the arguments. 
    
	Granting visa beforehand means that a passenger has been screened by the embassy or the high commission concerned. It will be difficult to screen passengers properly in case of visa on arrival. And, in the process, we may have to turn some of them away, causing unpleasantness, said a senior home ministry official.

	Kit to blow away touchdown fears     
	Scared to touch down in Mumbai during the monsoon? Dont worry. Chances are you will have a smooth landing.    
	The citys airport will soon commission the automated weather observing system, which will provide pilots weather-related data and help them with landings in driving rain.    
	The Met department has been conducting trials on runways over the past few weeks.    
	Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Amritsar and Guwahati airports already have the facility.    
	The system, with its 12 to 15 sensors on runways, will offer pilots information on visibility, weather conditions, wind speed and direction and sea pressure. Data from the sensors will be beamed to the Met control room by radio frequency. It will be analysed and wired back to air traffic control, airport officials said.    
	So far, pilots have had to rely on manually collected data, which was not frequently updated. With the new system, the information will be upgraded every 230 minutes in normal-weather conditions and five to 10 minutes during rough spells.        
	Patient updates on screen    
	Anxious relatives at a Tamil Nadu hospital no longer badger doctors and nurses for information about patients  they merely glance up at the display screen for updates.    
	The Rajaji Hospital in Madurai has come up with a novel way to address one of the most common complaints against hospitals, showing the way to others in the country.    
	Authorities at the government hospital had received complaints about the lack of information with allegations that some of its staffers were being tipped for the facts. Most of its patients are from the economically weaker sections.    
	We learnt that in some cases, our workers even misled relatives about the condition of patients, an official said. The idea to make information available easily came from one of the doctors who arranged for the information display boards in front of operation theatres.    
	Bus stops turn cash-spinners    
	Bus shelters can be more than places where commuters wait  they can be potential money-spinners, too.    
	The Delhi Transport Corporation expects to earn crores every month from a private firm building 400 such stops this year.    
	Under an agreement renewed last week with the corporation, the Jindals will construct, maintain and operate the stainless steel shelters that it promises will be sleek, durable and traveller-friendly. It will pay Rs 1 lakh per shelter to the DTC from its earnings through ads.    
	We have renewed the contract with Jindal Stainless to erect 400 shelters in the second phase of the build-own-transfer project, DTC general manager V.K. Bhatia said.    
	For the corporation, which will not have to shell out any money on the construction, it is a win-win situation. Jindal Stainless director N.C. Mathur said the company will pay the DTC money by selling space for ads.    
	The cash-starved corporation generated Rs 2 crore a month during the first phase of building the shelters. This year, the second stage, it expects Rs 4 crore.        
	Fee stand-off    
	The fee hike in Tamil Nadus private engineering colleges is turning into a tug-of-war between the DMK and its allies.    
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi insists the increase is limited to students admitted under the management quota and doesnt affect those who get seats kept for the government.    
	A panel has suggested raising the fee to Rs 32,500 from Rs 16,000. The chief minister claimed colleges were collecting more fees but handing out receipts for less. He said the PMK, opposing the move now, had been consulted.    
	MUMBAI: This Friday (June 20), watch Priti Kyal present her most recent collection of works, titled Ananda, at Jehangir Art Gallery from 10am to 7pm. The venue, a well-known Mumbai landmark, is at Kala Ghoda, opposite Elphinstone College. Call 22048212 for more information.

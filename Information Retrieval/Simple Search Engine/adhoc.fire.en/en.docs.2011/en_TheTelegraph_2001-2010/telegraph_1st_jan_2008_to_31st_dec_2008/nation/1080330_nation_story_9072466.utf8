The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bloc drops plan to fight poll alone 
                                                                                                               Bloc drops plan to fight poll alone 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 29: Wiser after its drubbing in the Tripura Assembly elections, the Forward Bloc today scrapped its decision to go it alone in the panchayat polls in Bengal.        
	The partys state committee meeting today decided to contest the elections as part of the CPM-led Left Front.         
	Considering the ground reality, we should fight the panchayat polls under the banner of the Left Front, despite our problems with the CPM, Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh was quoted as telling the partys Cooch Behar leaders, who resented the decision.        
	Five Cooch Behar leaders, including local secretary Udayan Guha, said they would not campaign for CPM nominees in the district, where five Bloc supporters were killed in police firing in February. However, they were made to toe the party line.        
	Dipak Sarkar, the MLA from Cooch Behar (North), said: Senior leaders wanted us to campaign for CPM nominees, treating them as front candidates, despite our reservations.        
	The party had broken away from the front in Tripura following a row over seat distribution and fielded candidates in 12 seats. All 12 forfeited their deposits.        
	Even before the Tripura debacle, the Bloc had decided to go it alone in Bengal after firing several shots at the CPM over the violence in Nandigram and its stand on industry and allowing private investment in retail. But it had made it clear at the same time that it could not afford to walk of the CPM-led government in Calcutta.        
	The session of the partys 64-member state committee in Calcutta today had been convened to discuss the stand on the rural polls.        
	Bloc sources said the ekla-chalo stand was reversed following reports from the districts about the partys prospects in the forthcoming elections. Barring pockets of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri in north Bengal and some panchayat areas of Howrah in the south, the party would not fare well. We were left with no option but to contest the polls under front banner, a Bloc functionary said.         
	A resolution on this score was adopted at the meeting, Bloc secretariat member Naren Chatterjee said this afternoon.        
	CPM leaders welcomed the decision. An aide said Jyoti Basu was happy that the Bloc had changed its stand.        
	Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose had requested the Bloc to take such a decision.         
	At a one-to-one meeting with Ghosh on Friday, he also promised to look into his demand for more seats for the May elections.        
	Another front partner, the RSP, has also threatened to fight the polls on its own if its demand for more seats is not met.

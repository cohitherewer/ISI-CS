	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Lauh purush Lal Krishna Advani has got a new identity on his 81st birthday  www.lkadvani.in.         
	The BJP no longer refers to him as the Iron Man, a label he wore proudly for decades. As he prepares for the race for Prime Minister, Advanis team  Sudheendra Kulkarni, Balbir Punj and Chandan Mitra are part of it  is trying to give him a makeover that will appeal to Young India.        
	At the launch of the website today, there was not one picture of the numerous rath yatras that have been the highlight of Advanis career. The photographs on display instead showed him reading, thinking, walking or sitting with family members.         
	Elections cant be limited to public meetings now. There will be 10 crore first-time voters in the next election and my party wanted to target them through Internet, Advani said.         
	Former governor General S.K. Sinha, during whose term in Kashmir the Amarnath controversy began, launched the portal.         
	BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu announced that Advanis next birthday will be celebrated at the Prime Ministers official residence.         
	But many others in the party are less than enthusiastic.         
	Its not the BJP. It is functioning like Advani party. The planning, strategies and decisions are taken by a coterie operating out of Advanis residence or a war room not located in the partys headquarters. Most senior leaders are not aware of the plans. We never saw this culture in the BJP, a senior leader said.         
	Advani knows it is possibly his last chance to become Prime Minister, sources said. His aides felt party president Rajnath Singh was not enthusiastic about working in the style and speed that Advani preferred and, therefore, a separate system was put in place.

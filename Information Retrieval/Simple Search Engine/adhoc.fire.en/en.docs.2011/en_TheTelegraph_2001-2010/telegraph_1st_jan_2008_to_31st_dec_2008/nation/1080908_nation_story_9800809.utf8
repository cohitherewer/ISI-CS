	Sambalpur, Sept. 7: As part of awareness and self-defence programme, the Rifle Shooting Club of Sambalpur organised a competition today on the Madnawati Public School campus where students from other institutions of the town took part.    
	The organisations president, Col Pravat Panda and secretary Pradeep Pradhan explained the aim behind such competition, especially for schoolchildren. This club in Sambalpur is the second one in the state. The first one at Talcher in Angul district is the oldest club in Asia, said Dillip Padhi, the clubs treasurer. The then kings of Talcher and the Gadjat states set up the club to make shooting popular among royal family members as well as common people, he added.        
	On the opening day, the participants  mainly students  aimed the target and showed wonderful performance, said Pradhan. Sambalpur superintendent of police Sanajy Kumar, who was present as chief guest, encouraged the shooters and said that he would provide better facilities to the boys and girls with .303, SLR and other sophisticated weapons at Burla firing range. Holding rifle not only works for defence, it also builds self-confidence, said Kumar.         
	He also distributed prizes to Damayanti Barik, Saumya Ranajn Das and Basudev Das for outstanding performance. Other participants were also given certificates.         
	I will try to achieve success in future, said Visha Munda a prize-holder.

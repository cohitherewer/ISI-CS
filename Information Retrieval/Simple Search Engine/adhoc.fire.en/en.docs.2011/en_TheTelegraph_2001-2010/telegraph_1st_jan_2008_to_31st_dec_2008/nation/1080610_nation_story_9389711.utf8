	New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): The Central Information Commission has asked a Delhi school to show a Class IX student his answer sheets after he failed his annual exams this year.         
	Since the school was late in replying to the RTI plea, a penalty was also imposed.        
	Information commissioner .P. Kejrewal said: We instructed the school to show the boy his answer sheets and also show him the answer sheets of his classmates. If he wanted photocopies of his answer sheets, then the needful has to be done. We did this to maintain transparency.        
	Mohsin, a student of Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Dilshad Garden in east Delhi, failed in three of six subjects in his annual examinations.        
	It was unbelievable that he failed in his class promotion examinations. My nephew had said he had done well. He was not even given his report card, said Arif, the boys uncle.        
	On April 1, Mohsin filed an RTI application requesting the school to disclose to him the marks obtained in all six subjects.        
	I also wanted to know that even if I failed, why was I denied a report card, said Mohsin.        
	He also sought information on the pass percentage of Class IX and the rules for granting grace marks along with details of students who were given the same.        
	The school did not respond but, after one month and eight days, it finally agreed to provide the information on the order of the commission.

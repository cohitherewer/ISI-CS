  - Creative classes for Kandhamal children          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              Children take lessons at the YMCA camp				                                       
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 23: Animation workshop, story-telling sessions, origami class, elementary theatre lessons  children from strife-torn villages in Kandhamal could not have asked for more.         
	Volunteers from various fields have been reaching the Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA) camp here to help them with some real engagements and let them come over their sense of loss. The efforts began since September 25 when we learnt that the relief camp houses about 100 kids, said Sujit Mohapatra, the secretary of city-based NGO Bakul Foundation.        
	The foundation arranged books donated by individuals, libraries and Unicef. We were amazed by the interest level among the children. There was a mad rush and they virtually pounced on the books and this encouraged us to do more for them, Sujit said.        
	The books served as the best icebreakers for the children who had no real engagement since more than a month at the camp. Moreover, the pictures and illustrations were enough to catch the imagination of many even though they could not read and understand the contents of the book.        
	The volunteers then decided to start some story-telling exercise by reading it out to the children. Some of them were made to act and deliver dialogues and they really enjoyed the activities. Parents too were happy to see their wards in different new activities, said Rudra Mahapatra, a volunteer.        
	The purpose is to help release the trauma from their minds and compensate for the loss of study during the period of violence, Rudra added.        
	Besides, the volunteers have been continuing with various fun activities like origami, papier mch, elementary theatre and wildlife workshops. An animation workshop conducted by Pacard was a huge hit among the children. I loved the animation workshop most. We were taught how to draw animals from various alphabetical letters, says Pinaki Digal, 12. Besides, foreign interns at different organisations in the city visit the camp to spend time with the kids. The foreign madams taught us dance too, says Rahul Pradhan, another child.

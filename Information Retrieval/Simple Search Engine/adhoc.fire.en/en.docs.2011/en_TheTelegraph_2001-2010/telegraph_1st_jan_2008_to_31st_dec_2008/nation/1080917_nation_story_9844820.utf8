	Bhagalpur, Sept. 16: Flood relief material worth crores are hardly reaching victims with a racket operating in a region ravaged by the Kosi for the past 28 days.        
	We didnt have proper foods for weeks but army men assured us that a group of social workers set out with truck-full of food. Finally on September 14, we have the information that some people looted the truck, Subash Yadav of Daparakha village in Supaul districts Tribaniganj block said.        
	We brought relief material from Calcutta. We were asked to hand over the items to some people who were standing on Dumariaghat-Saharsa road. Police personnel there also asked us to obey the people. But when we approached the social workers in Calcutta, they confirmed that the consignment did not reach to the right persons, said a truck driver, Harbindar Singh.        
	Reports from Madhepura, Khagaria, Supaul, Saharsa, Purnea and Katihar stated that private relief operators, along with many voluntary organisations from outside the state who were not familiar with the topography of the region, generally fell in the hands of such racketeers.        
	Sahab Akthar, the deputy inspector-general of police (Kosi range), confirmed such incidents and directed Khagaria superintendent of police to conduct inquiry into the alleged involvement of police in grabbing relief materials there.         
	R. Lakshmanan, the Saharsa district magistrate, also held discussion with his Khagaria counterpart. He said that the district administration had decided to arrange police escort to vehicles carrying relief material.

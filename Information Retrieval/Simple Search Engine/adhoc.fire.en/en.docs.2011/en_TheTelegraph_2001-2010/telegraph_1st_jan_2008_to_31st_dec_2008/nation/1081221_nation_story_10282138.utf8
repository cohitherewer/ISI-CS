                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     English row in Assembly
                            
	Ranchi, Dec. 20 (PTI): The Jharkhand Assembly was adjourned briefly today after commotion broke out in the House when an independent legislator asked health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi to read out a court order written in English.        
	MLA Inder Singh Namdhari allegedly boasted in the House that he was academically superior to Sahi and that he understood things better, angering state Congress president Pradeep Balmachu and other ruling bench MLAs.         
	The members rushed to the well protesting Namdharis remarks. Deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi said knowledge of English did not necessarily indicate the intellectual capacity of a person.

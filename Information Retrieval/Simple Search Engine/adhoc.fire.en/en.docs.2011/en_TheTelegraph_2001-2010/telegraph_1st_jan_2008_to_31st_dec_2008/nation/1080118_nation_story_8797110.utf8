             Mayavati: Double blow
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: The birthday bad tidings have spilled over: after the income-tax department, its the CBI that is in the queue to revive two cases against Mayavati.
    
	Two days after the income tax department decided to challenge a tribunals exemption on gifts worth Rs 64 lakh to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the CBI looks set to reopen the disproportionate assets and the Taj corridor cases against her.
    
	The agency had put both the cases on the backburner, but with relations between the UPA and Mayavati souring somewhat, it has decided to tighten the screws.
    
	It is now in the process of challenging governor T.V. Rajeshwars order denying the agency permission to prosecute Mayavati in the Rs 175-crore Taj corridor case.
    
	The CBI is also planning to seek his permission for prosecution in the assets case, now to the tune of over Rs 28 crore. The case appeared to have weakened after an income-tax tribunal exempted Mayavati, but the agency now plans to proceed again.
    
	Mayavati had gone on a property-buying spree in the capital between 2004 and 2006 and accounted for Rs 21.12 crore in cheque payments alone. This was the time the CBI had been finalising its assets case against her.
    
	The agency had even informed the Supreme Court that the value of her disproportionate assets was over Rs 28 crore. But it did not seek sanction for prosecution.
    
	Sources said the CBI was now in the process of seeking the governors sanction. In the Taj corridor case, it will challenge his order.
    
	The Supreme Court, hearing the Taj corridor case on October 10, 2007, had said it was not empowered to examine the legality of the governors order. But it had hoped the CBI would challenge the order before other courts, including Allahabad High Court. The CBI had, however, given no such indication.
    
	Government sources said the CBI also had the option of appealing to the governor himself for reconsideration of his order. But the agency had chosen not to do that either.
    
	Probably Mayavatis threat to the UPA to withdraw outside support, when the CBI questioned her in the assets case in May 2005, still hung heavy. She had threatened to pull out her 18 MPs if the agency continued to harass her.
    
	At a news conference here earlier this month, Mayavati had alleged the Centre was victimising her by ensuring that the CBI kept the assets case pending against her.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, June 17: The Supreme Court today appeared to criticise a five-decade-old law that granted Hindus the right to annul their marriage, blaming it for the flood of divorce cases.        
	The Hindu Marriage Act has broken more homes than uniting, a bench said in an observation that did not carry the legal force of an order.        
	It then referred to the time before the act was passed in 1955. In those days our forefathers never had such problems, it said, adding that marital disputes were then settled within the four walls of the home.        
	Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice G.S. Singhvi cited the impact of divorces on children  ultimately, the child suffers  but others in the legal profession were quick to defend the right to divorce.        
	Every modern marriage law has a divorce option; there will always be genuine cases where separation is needed, lawyer Arvind Sharma said.        
	India has one of the lowest divorce rates. In 2002, it was 1.1 per cent, compared with 54.9 per cent in Sweden.        
	In the metros and IT hubs, however, divorces have doubled or even tripled in the past five years, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.         
	The judges today remarked sarcastically that couples were now filing anticipatory divorce petitions even before marriage. They rued the misuse of the Hindu Marriage Acts provision for divorce on grounds of diseases like leprosy or mental illness.        
	The act had for the first time interpreted a Hindu marriage as a contract, overturning the older view of it as a sacramental union that could not be dissolved. It introduced the concept of divorce on grounds such as cruelty, infertility and lunacy, and was later amended to include irretrievable breakdown of the marriage as a ground.

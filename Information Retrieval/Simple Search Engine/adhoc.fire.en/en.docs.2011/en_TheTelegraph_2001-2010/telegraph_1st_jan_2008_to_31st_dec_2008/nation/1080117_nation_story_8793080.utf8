     RASHEED KIDWAI

	Bhopal, Jan. 16: Like Shivaji Rao (Anil Kapoor) in Nayak, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has been in a heroic mood of late, raiding government premises and sacking officials at will.
    
	On Monday, he sprung a surprise check on a Food Corporation of India godown and stumbled upon red wheat unfit for human consumption. In no time, he blamed the UPA regime for supplying substandard food to people below the poverty line.
    
	On Sunday, he made an unscheduled halt at Datia near Jhansi. After hearing the local people complaining against the district collector, he issued transfer orders to Ashok Shivhare by sundown.
    
	The pace at which Chauhan has been moving recalls Nayak, in which Kapoor is shown proceeding very fast on his one-day assignment as chief minister. In 24 hours, Kapoor allots apartments to slum-dwellers, gives jobs to the unemployed and suspends corrupt government officers.
    
	Likewise, Chauhan has been unusually belligerent over the past few days. During samadhan online, a once-in-a-month teleconference to redress peoples grievances, he was heard using harsh words with district-level officials.
    
	The Madhya Pradesh elections are due later this year. There are indications Chauhan may hold them around April-May.
    
	The Opposition Congress has dubbed Chauhans sense of urgency a gimmick. Its leader, Jamuna Devi, mocked the BJP chief minister for riding pillion on a motorbike in Datia whose driver was not wearing a helmet.
    
	Is Section 129 of the motor vehicles act not applicable in Datia? Devi asked, wondering how the chief minister expected citizens to abide by the law when he flouted rules.
    
	State Congress spokesperson Manak Aggarwal pointed out several irregularities in Chauhans attempts to provide clean administration. The chief minister reportedly lost his ring at a recent BJP meet but did not register a case, he said.
    
	In another incident, Shivhari Ahirwar, a Dalit teacher at a government primary school in Sagar district, committed suicide on Monday after district authorities failed to provide proper facilities for the school. Ahirwars school is part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and has hundreds of slum children on its rolls. 
    
	In several districts, the Chauhan regime has not distributed free bicycles to girls who have finished their elementary education. The scheme was launched over a year ago but most girls who have enrolled in Class IX outside the village have not got their bicycles.

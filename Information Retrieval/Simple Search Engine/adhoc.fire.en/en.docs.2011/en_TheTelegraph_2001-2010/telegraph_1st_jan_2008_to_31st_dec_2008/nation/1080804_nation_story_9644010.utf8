	Hawk-eyed kid derails disaster    
	He is only in Class VI but thinks big enough to stop a train from going off the tracks.    
	Maruthapandi recently averted a crash when he spotted cracks in a track near Madurai and told his parents who, in turn, intimated railway authorities.    
	What aroused the 12-year-olds suspicion was a loud bang when the Chennai-bound Vaigai Express crossed the point close to his home near Madurai.     
	Sensing something wrong, he took a close look and found bits of the track had come off.    
	The parents, told about the 90cm fracture, rushed to inform the staff at the nearest rail crossing. But before they carry the message, Maruthapandi noticed a Madurai-bound train hurtling down the line. He ran for yards, waving a red rag to alert the driver. The train stopped, just a couple of metres short of disaster.    
	A railway official said the density of traffic on the route had increased manifold, and so had the frequency of fractures in tracks.     
	However, the official said inspections had been intensified after the rescue act.        
	Power bias cry in Garden City    
	Bangalore is chafing at an apparent power bias for Hyderabad.    
	B.S. Yeddyurappa has written to the Union power ministry expressing displeasure over its decision to light up the Congress-ruled Hyderabad at the expense of the BJP-run Bangalore.    
	His specific grouse is that Karnatakas share of power from central power has been cut by 50MW, between 6 and 10pm everyday, so it can be supplied to Andhra Pradesh.    
	I find this action (the cut) unwarranted and illogical, Yeddyurappa said in his letter to Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. He pointed out the reduction has been made at a time Karnataka was facing a critical power shortage because of poor monsoon.    
	The Karnataka chief minister demanded that the states share of unallocated central power, generated by companies like NTPC and NHPC, be immediately restored to 290MW. (PTI)    
	Capital steps on the gas    
	The capital appears poised to pump up its CNG muscle.    
	At least 50 new filling stations will be commissioned soon to keep pace with the increasing demand for the green fuel.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit said 100 stations will come up in Delhi and the National Capital Region, including Noida and Gurgaon, before the 2010 Commonwealth Games    
	Dikshit, along with Union petroleum minister Murli Deora, toured CNG pumps last week to take stock of the fuel availability. The chief minister promised supplies for all public and private vehicles in ample quantities.    
	At a meeting with representatives of transport operators, she was told about the problems in getting CNG. Deora, too, assured transporters all assistance in ensuring CNG supplies. Average sales in Delhi are around 11.8 lakh kg per day, with a peak of 13.5 lakh kg per day.     
	Deora also said a scheme to provide insurance to CNG autorickshaw drivers, already in force in Mumbai, could also be introduced in the capital.         
	Road rage    
	Racing ahead, some Mumbaikars are going for the kill, literally.    
	Four persons were arrested recently for alleged involvement in a Navi Mumbai road rage incident that led to a murder. Rizwan Idris was allegedly stabbed with a screwdriver at a toll booth in Vashi after an altercation.     
	olice said a Ford Ikon had apparently overtaken Idriss cab after which the 24-year-old went to talk to the occupants of the car at the booth. Suddenly, one of the men in the Ikon stepped out and attacked Idris, apparently after he abused them, with the screwdriver.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dalai for political front
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dalai for political front

	Shimla, Dec. 17: Spiritual leader Dalai Lama today said the movement he spearheaded for nearly five decades needed a political front if the vexed Tibetan issue had to be solved.        
	The Nobel Peace Laureate said the Tibetan issue could no longer be solved on a religious front. Only a strong political front, he added, can find a solution to the problem.        
	The future course of the Tibetan movement will be decided by the elected government under Prime Minister Samdong Rinpoche.        
	The comment came three weeks after a conclave of exiled Tibetans declared they would be forced to demand full independence if no concrete results emerged.        
	The 73-year-old monk also hinted at his retirement but did not announce a date for stepping down. I am in a semi-retirement stage and have no political powers. I had already delegated my political powers to the de facto Prime Minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile. Samdong Rinpoche is now my boss.        
	The government-in-exile, however, said the Dalai Lama was not retiring. His holiness the Dalai Lama has been misquoted again by a section of the media. He is not retiring yet and has just said that he is in a semi-retirement stage, spokesperson Thubten Samphel said. There is nothing new.

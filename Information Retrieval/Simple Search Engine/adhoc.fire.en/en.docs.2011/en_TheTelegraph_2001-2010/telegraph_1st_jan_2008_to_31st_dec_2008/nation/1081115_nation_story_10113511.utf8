The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pandits Citi braces for pain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pandits Citi braces for pain
          ERIC DASH                           Vikram Pandit: Time of turmoil                                  
	New York, Nov. 14: After a year of red ink, a months-long plunge in its share price and a $25-billion government rescue, you might think the worst was over for Citigroup, led by India-born Vikram S. Pandit.        
	It is probably not.         
	Citigroup, which a decade ago set out to rewrite the rules of American finance, is bracing for still more pain now that a recession is at hand. Loans that the financial giant made to consumers in good times are going bad in growing numbers. For the moment, profits seem as elusive as ever, analysts say.        
	Once the most valuable financial company in America, Citigroup is withering along with its share price, which this week sank into single digits for the first time in a dozen years. The company is also shrinking in another painful way: by cutting, and cutting, and cutting jobs. Another round of pink slips is expected next week.         
	As Pandit completes his first year as chief executive, many analysts say Citigroup has lost its way. Insiders say the company is racked by office politics at a critical moment in its history.        
	Pandit is struggling to regain his grip on the company, which operates in scores of countries, after his attempt to buy Wachovia was upended by Wells Fargo. That mis-step left Citigroup grasping for a new strategy to lure deposits and build up its branch network in the US.        
	Citigroup has tried to put on a united front amid the turmoil. Richard D. Parsons, one of the companys most outspoken directors, said that the board was fully behind Pandit and Winfried F. W. Bischoff, its executive chairman, as it braced for a difficult 2009.        
	Pandit, for his part, led a group of Citigroup executives in buying 1.3 million Citigroup shares as the stock tumbled on Thursday.        
	It was the first time that Pandit, who had collected $165.2 million by selling his hedge fund to Citigroup before becoming chief executive, publicly disclosed using his own money to buy Citigroup stocks.        
	Christina Pretto, a Citigroup spokesperson, said the purchases reflect their belief in the long-term strength and growth opportunities of the company.        
	Jobs on line        
	Many Citigroup employees know their jobs are on the line. Executives said that as of the third quarter, the bank had announced plans to eliminate 40,100 jobs. That includes reductions resulting from the divestitures of the companys German retail banking operations and its Indian outsourcing franchise.         
	But Citigroup still needs to hand out pink slips to 9,100 workers to meet its goals, and bankers are bracing for much of the bad news to arrive early next week, according to executives briefed on the situation.        
	Investment bankers are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts. But back-office functions, like the banks legal and human resources divisions, are also expected to be hit hard.         
	Pretto, the spokesperson, said the bank was carefully managing its employee levels as it revamps the company to operate more efficiently in the current downturn. Nothing has changed, Pretto said.

  - Twist to traditional jewellery trend          OUR CORRESPONDENTS                                    
	Bhubaneswar, March 25: What was once looked upon as primitive, it has been redefined as modern and chic, churning crores in international markets, thanks to local artisans and NGOs promoting the products.        
	Orissas tribal jewellery is being exported to 13 countries, including Russia, the UK, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina, Switzerland, Canada and Spain  to name a few.         
	Currently, the state has 12 tribal communities whose handcrafted items are being marketed after certain value additions.         
	The products include necklaces, earrings, anklets, bracelets, hairpins, hair-clips, mangalsutras, rings and more.        
	And this trade involves some 2,500 young men and women in six districts of Dhenkanal, Rayagada, Khandhamal, Koraput, Nowrangpur and Sonepur.         
	Helping them out are organisations, such as Anwesha, which has been involved in this business since 1989.         
	And the groups secretary, Bipin Bihari Sahoo, believes that matters have greatly improved over the past five years  as a result the group makes an annual profit of Rs 1 crore.        
	The organisation employs as many as 5,000 tribal artisans in the jewellery trade.         
	The Orissa governments efforts have helped, but dearth of raw material poses a problem. The raw materials, including brass, copper, white metal and silver have to be procured from outside and supplied to us. We get raw materials from Delhi, Calcutta and Raipur. When there is a delay, we face problems, said Banu Nayak, an artisan from Phulbani.         
	Serving as a link between the artisan and the market are Calcutta-based organisations such as Sasha that exports to 13 different countries.         
	Nowadays most export products are tested at Jadavpur University (Calcutta) and certified accordingly.        
	The process started after European countries banned the import of goods with nickel and lead some three years ago, added Sahoo.

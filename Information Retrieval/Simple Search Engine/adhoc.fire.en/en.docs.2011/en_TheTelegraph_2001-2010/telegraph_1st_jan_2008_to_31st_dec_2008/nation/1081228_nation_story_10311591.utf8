The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Year of the double victim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Year of the double victim
          Governments have been quick to pay compensation to the next of kin. But not necessarily to the blast victims widows or children, report Charu Sudan Kasturi and Ananya Sengupta                          Yashoda Singh, who has been living on a Delhi roadside after her compensation   was hijacked, virtually with government connivance. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	Yashoda Singh pulls her dupatta tighter around her body and edges closer to the chulha fire as a chilling December draught blows in.        
	She shouldnt be squatting on the roadside, shivering without warm clothes: she is the rightful owner of Rs 15 lakh, already paid by the government. But the money flew past her cold fingers like a winter gust before she had a chance to see it.        
	What the 15-year-old has seen, from too close, is death. She was hanging out clothes to dry when the most destructive of the September 13 bombs in Delhi went off a hundred metres away.        
	The Ghaffar Market blast in Karol Bagh killed nine of Yashodas family, her parents and 25-year-old brother among them. Four relatives are still in hospital. But Yashoda survived without a scratch.         
	I have simply been maimed for life, she sobs, her hands kneading dough for the rotis she would make on the chulha to feed the family  two adults and 10 children apart from those in hospital.        
	For a poor family, if the breadwinners die, life for the living turns worse than death, she says.        
	Her aunt Chandrawati, who lost her husband and son in the explosion, kneels to comfort her.        
	But hasnt the Delhi government compensation  Rs 5 lakh for every slain victims nearest kin  made the two of them richer by Rs 25 lakh? Aunt and niece exchange glances and laugh.        
	Thats what everyone thinks. Why am I complaining then, why do we live like this when the money has already been paid? Chandrawati asks.        
	The family lives on the roadside, at the mouth of a narrow lane known as Gali No. 42 in Ghaffar Markets Beadonpura, surviving largely on the charity of neighbours and local shopkeepers.        
	Yashoda, her great aunt Krishna and Chandrawati have possibly been the best-known residents of Ghaffar Market since the blasts, jokes Satish Shukla, owner of an electronics shop across the street.        
	But they have no home, only an address.        
	The four men in the family were construction labourers, occasionally foraying into ragpicking. The family would find shelter at the construction sites where the men worked. With the men gone, so has any hope of shelter, says the aunt.                    Rahul of Jaipur who still has 30 pellets lodged inside his body. Picture by Surendra Jain Paras      
	Their possessions include the chulha on which Yashoda bakes rotis and cooks a watery dal, apart from four utensils, a broken cot, two discarded tarpaulin sheets and the clothes on their bodies.        
	Shopkeepers and people who live nearby give us atta and lentils, says Chandrawati, advising her niece to use less dough per roti and flatten it out thinner instead.        
	So what about the Rs 25 lakh? It has been paid but I havent seen a paisa, Chandrawati says. Her in-laws  Yashodas grandparents  have grabbed the entire sum and plan to build a house in Najafgarh, she alleges.        
	My father-in-law is 70. He is the only adult male alive in the family. The money came to him and he has refused to share it. He argues he was the common link between all those who died and deserves all the money.        
	Its a story being echoed across Indias bomb-hit cities, in Jaipur as in Delhi. The government is happy to pay compensation promptly to the family and wash its hands of the matter  it doesnt care which member gets the money.        
	Widows or orphaned girls are the easiest to cheat, and they are cheated by the men in their families, social activists say.        
	To claim the compensation, one must furnish documents such as the FIR or death certificate. Since its usually the males who go to the police station to file the FIR or to the hospital to get the death certificate, they are on a stronger wicket.        
	Or, as in Chandrawatis case, the government sent the entire compensation for the nine victims directly to the father-in-law, its clerks happy to be rid of the headache. A police officer delivered the amount in a single cheque for Rs 45 lakh at the Beodonpura street corner where the rest still live.        
	Chandrawati says even her father-in-laws grandchildren  Yashoda, Chandrawatis four children, and another six  cannot hope for any help from the evil grandparents. I had timidly asked my grandfather if he would at least marry me off, but he refused. He told me my place was here, by the roadside, says Yashoda, beginning to sob again.        
	The family is lucky that the four injured members are receiving free care in hospital. But they are last on the hospitals priority, the doctors only visit them once in four-five days, Yashoda alleges.        
	Her sister Sunanda still has a few pellets lodged above her abdomen. She keeps suffering infections and the doctors said she would be vulnerable all her life, Yashoda says. I feel bad that she is in hospital but at least she has a bed to sleep on and the doctors do attend to her once in a while. There is no way we could have taken care of her.        
	Jaipur boy Rahul too is assured free treatment in any government hospital  Rajasthans sop to blast victims  if only he could afford it. The 15-year-old was riddled with 70 pellets by the May 13 blast, and 30 are still inside him, three in the chest.        
	Often, government hospitals dont have the infrastructure for the treatment and patients have to move to private hospitals, says Kavita Srivastava, Rajasthan chief of the Peoples Union of Civil Liberties.        
	Rahuls family  his father has a small flower shop in a market  has received Rs 1 lakh from the state government, Rs 50,000 each for Rahul and uncle Surendra who has a pellet in the brain. The Centre has sent another Rs 50,000.        
	Rahul has had several operations and needs more. Even now, our medical bill comes to several thousand a month, says mother Radha.        
	The state needs to take responsibility for the injured. We need a policy of continuous medical attention, Srivastava says.        
	Rahul hasnt been to school since the blasts. His hands and wrists hurt, he cant lift anything, his bowel activity is severely affected. His sister, in her first year of college, has quit studies to take up a minor job.        
	Chandrawati believes rehabilitation is better than compensation. If all earning members of a family have died, the government should provide a job or regular dole to each survivor instead of a lump sum that can be hijacked.        
	Also, she wants the government to assume responsibility for educating victims children. Thats what I really want now, to give my children an education, she says.        
	Jagdish Parshad, whose son Pawan died in the Karol Bagh blast, has another worry. The state government has paid the Rs 5 lakh, but theres no sight of the Centres Rs 3 lakh. The blasts proximity to the Delhi polls, and the longer gap before the general election, arent lost on him.        
	I just returned from the office of the police special cell and they assured me the central compensation too will arrive, Parshad says, straddling his scooter. I hope we receive it before any government change, else there can be more delay.        
	In the days after the blasts, everyone visited us, recalls Chandrawati. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit came to her pavement settlement; so did the BJPs shadow chief minister, Vijay Kumar Malhotra.        
	We were made to believe they would take care of us. Look at us now, Chandrawati says, her face contorted half in grief, half in irony.

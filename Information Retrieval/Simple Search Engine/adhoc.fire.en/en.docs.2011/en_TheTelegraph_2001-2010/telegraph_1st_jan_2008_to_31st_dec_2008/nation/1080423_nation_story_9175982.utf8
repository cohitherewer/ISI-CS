          AMIT ROY                      Enoch Powell
  quot;As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see lsquo;the River Tiber foaming with much blood rsquo;.
  Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. We must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependents, who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre. So insane are we that we actually permit unmarried
  persons to immigrate for the purpose of founding a family with spouses and fianc eacute;s whom they have never seen. quot;                          
	London, April 22: Enoch Powells apocalyptic Rivers of Blood speech, in which the former Tory MP predicted grim consequences for Britains indigenous society unless the size of the UKs non-white immigrant population was drastically reduced, continues to be passionately debated 40 years after it was made.        
	As I look ahead, Powell had forecast in a doom-laden speech on April 20, 1968, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see the River Tiber foaming with much blood.        
	Powells speech was a more extreme version of comments made recently in India, for example by Raj Thackeray, who urged the expulsion from Mumbai of people he considered northerners.        
	Today, many Britons, angered by Islamic terrorism and disproportionate crime among sections of the black population, insist Enoch was right. Others believe that Britain has made a successful transition to a largely harmonious multiracial, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society.        
	For example, Powells biographer, Simon Heffer, wrote recently in his column in The Daily Telegraph: Sunday is the 40th anniversary of perhaps the most significant speech made in British politics since the Second World War: Enoch Powells Rivers of Blood speech.        
	Heffer argued that Powell, who died in 1998, aged 85, was not a racist because of his regard for India  in fact, Powells perfect job would have been Viceroy of India.        
	Powell had served in India in the 1940s. He fell in love with the country, its cultures and its peoples so profoundly that he wished to spend the rest of his life there. He learned to speak two Indian languages fluently. This does not stop point-scoring, spud-thick politicians accusing him of racism, bigotry and other vices, Heffer wrote.        
	He concluded: Powell was the greatest Conservative thinker in political life in living memory. He foresaw what were then unimaginable tensions caused by forcibly altering the character of a country. We should remember him tomorrow with enhanced respect. For he was right.        
	In a column putting forward the opposite view, Andrew Gilligan, a former BBC and Sunday Telegraph journalist, wrote in yesterdays Evening Standard: Forty years and one day after Enoch Powells famous speech about immigration, it is clear he was mostly wrong. The rivers are not foaming with much blood. Race relations laws have not thrown a match on to gunpowder. Powells prediction that whole towns will be occupied by immigrants has not come true.        
	Powells claim was also contested by Keith Vaz, a high-profile MP of Indian origin, in a speech after his appointment by the European Commission as one of its 10 UK ambassadors for cultural diversity for 2008.        
	This initiative will go some way in proving that the rivers of blood that he (Powell) predicted are far from being the reality that we see today, Vaz was quoted by PTI as saying.        
	Powell had intended to stir up controversy but perhaps got more than he had expected  his party leader, Edward Heath, considered the speech beyond the pale and sacked Powell from the Tory front bench, effectively ending his political career.

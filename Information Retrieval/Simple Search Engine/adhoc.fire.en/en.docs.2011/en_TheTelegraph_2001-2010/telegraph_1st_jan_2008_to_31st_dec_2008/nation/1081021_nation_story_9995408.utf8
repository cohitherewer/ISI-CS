          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 20: The police claimed to have busted a firearms smuggling racket with the arrest of three persons, including a woman, from a city hotel today.         
	Four country-made Mauser pistols, four revolvers, nine single-shot pistols and 90 rounds of ammunition were also seized.         
	A special squad led by Manglabag police station inspector-in-charge P.K. Jena caught the trio from a hotel in the Thoria Sahi area.         
	The trio had checked in as Rajesh Choudhury (27) and Meena Devi (24) as couple and Rajdip Ranjan Poddar (42) from Bihar on Saturday.         
	During interrogation, it was found that they were from Kasimnagar area of Munger in Bihar.        
	Cuttack deputy commissioner of police A.N. Sinha said: The trio are just a link in a well-organised illegal firearms nexus that connects Orissa to Bihar.         
	They had confessed to smuggling firearms into the city, twice before this.         
	The police are on the lookout for those who had bought them, Sinha said.        
	Regarding supply rates, the police said the Mausers and revolvers were being sold for anything between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000.         
	There has apparently been a rise in demand for country-made Mauser pistols among high-level criminals in and around Cuttack, said a senior police officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naxalite prod turns Bihar criminal into village reformer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Naxalite prod turns Bihar criminal into village reformer
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Sono (Jamui), May 7: Till a few weeks ago, arms and ammunition were Taka Majhis best companions. But today he is more into alphabets, thanks to a gentle prod from rebels.        
	Taka, a resident of Sneheltar Mushari village under Lalilabar panchayat in Sono block, 51km from Jamui headquarters, has a number of criminal antecedents.        
	The man with more than 120 criminal cases pending against him is now a member of a core group under the Sneheltar Mushari cluster resource centre (CRC). Taka, along with other men in the village is now helping the government to set up classrooms in the village.        
	Naxalites, who organise regular meetings here, would ask us to send our kids to school. When the government sponsored a programme for our village, the rebel leaders asked Taka to co-ordinate and help the CRC for the sake of the next generation, said a woman of Sneheltar Mushari.         
	Takas presence in the group becomes even more significant if one looks into his records. The man absconded from Jamui district jail in 1999 with noted criminal Thanu Das.         
	The death of Das, killed by Naxalites in 2000, and the arrest of Takas biggest rival Shankar Singh a month ago by a special task force, made him the most powerful man in Sneheltar Mushari. Takas father, Jirku Manjhi, no stranger to crime, is lodged in Jamui jail.        
	Like Taka, most men in his village are in the polices most-wanted list.         
	Kushbu (10), Takas daughter, was more familiar with her fathers arms till few days ago. But now a slate and a broken pencil are her dearest pals. She was the first among 69 girls (between 5 and 16 years) to enrol in the centre. Her friends, Asha, Jyoti, Sunaina, Buddha, Rinama and Lalita, who hardly used to spend time with their fathers, now are tutored by them. After school, our fathers assist us in learning and writing, said Asha.         
	After helping to set up a makeshift centre, Taka and his associates have now planned to develop a garden at the centre, said Binoy Kumar Das, the co-ordinator of the core group of CRC.        
	The other members in the group, Shanker Kumar, Joy Kumar Singh, Swaith Prakash and Mahashari Devi, all from the district, claimed that they knew nothing of Takas background when they started. But they soon learnt everything about him.        
	Within days people told us many stories. We were afraid to approach Taka, but he seemed fine with our proposal, Mahashari Devi recalled. But Takas only condition was that double game on the behalf of the police would not be entertained.         
	Sneheltar Mushari is not an isolated case in Munger. A few months ago, Naxalites influenced a village head Kabir Koda (of Gopalichalk, a Mushar dominated village in Dharhara block) to construct a 4km road to the village. Villagers, with active participation of Naxalites, constructed the road to connect Dackranala-Bangawa-Dharhara main road.         
	An officer rushed from the district headquarters to find villagers digging and armed Naxalites guarding them, recalled the former Munger divisional commissioner, Hemchandra Shirohi, presently posted in the rural department.         
	He also claimed that the rebels provided financial aid to villagers for the construction.

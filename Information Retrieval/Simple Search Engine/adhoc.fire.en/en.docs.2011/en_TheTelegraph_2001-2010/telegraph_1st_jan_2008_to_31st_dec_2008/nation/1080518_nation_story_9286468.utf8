          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, May 17: Five members of a family were killed in a clueless explosion today.         
	The victims, including two children, belonged to the family of special police official Haroon Ahmad and were killed in the explosion at Neel village in Banihal, 130km south of Srinagar.         
	We do not have any clue about how they got killed but we have despatched our team to the village, Jammu police chief K. Rajendra said.         
	The police are investigating whether the blast was accidental or the handiwork of militants.        
	The victims included two children  Haroons son Baker and nephew Saddam. The others have been identified as Abdul Rahman Suhail, a retired schoolteacher, Bashir Ahmad and Rubina.        
	Sources said the family had earlier lost another member, Tariq Ahmad, a police constable, to the bullets of militants.         
	In south Kashmir, six Jaish-e-Mohammed militants, including four foreigners, were killed in a joint operation by the army, police and the CRPF at Dudh Kalyan village in southern Tral.         
	Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai described it as a major success against militants in the region. It is one of the biggest successes achieved by forces in recent years.         
	Waseem, who was part of many militant operations against security forces in Srinagar, was among the dead.         
	Police sources said around 10 militants were hiding in the area and they opened fire on a CRPF patrol early today. The forces soon launched the joint operation in the adjoining forests as the militants took refuge there. While six militants were killed, four managed to escape. We are looking for them, an officer said.         
	Over three dozen top militants, mostly from Hizb-ul Mujahideen, have so far died in encounters and many more surrendered in the same area.        
	In another encounter at north Kashmirs Bandipore, the army and the police eliminated a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant, identified as Tanvir Ahmad, when their search parties were fired at in Kuta forests. The operation was on till the last report came in and the forces believed they had trapped a Jaish commander.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Patil stirs,   late as usual
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Patil stirs,   late as usual
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Shivraj Patil                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Shivraj Patils trip to Orissa tomorrow will be another of his belated visits to a trouble spot. But unlike most other times, he will be going alone and not trudging behind Sonia Gandhi.        
	The Union home minister is known to be inclined to despatch his deputy, minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal, to violence-torn areas.        
	Jaiswal visited Orissa last week and even said the situation was out of control. Yet it is well after the riots have spread to several other districts that Patil will arrive tomorrow, a week and a half after the attacks on Christians began.        
	His previous trip to Kandhamal came last January although communal violence had flared before Christmas.        
	When police firing killed nine persons in Orissas Kalinganagar in January 2006, Patil let nine days pass before he paid a visit, trailing along behind Sonia.        
	That, however, was not the only time the embattled minister has preferred to remain in the shadow of his party boss.        
	Whether it was in Mumbai after the July 2006 train blasts, or in Jaipur two days after the May 13 bombings this year, Patil was by the side of the Congress president.        
	Patil has been accused of letting the situation worsen in Jammu and Kashmir, and of failing to control law and order at a time the country is buffeted by Naxalite attacks, terror and communal clashes.        
	When the home minister led an 18-member team to Jammu, weeks after the pro-Amarnath agitation had begun, women banged utensils from rooftops and local journalists questions bordered on rudeness. Part of the anger was directed at Patils delay in showing up.        
	On February 22 this year, Patil had visited Kashmir after a spell of heavy snowfall  again with Sonia.        
	In Orissa tomorrow, he will do a spot assessment in violence-hit areas. Official figures say 16 persons have been killed; and dozens of churches and prayer halls have been torched by rampaging mobs.        
	Patil recently received a demonstration of how voters might feel towards a politician they believe has failed them.        
	Several members of the Dhargar community from Maharashtras Latur  from where Patil lost the 2004 polls  had arrived in Delhi but chose not to meet him. We are ready to meet anyone except Patil. He never helped our cause and well make him lose in Latur again, said a leader from the community.

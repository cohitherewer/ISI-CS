	Rambo goes for a break from action      
	At 62, Sylvester Stallone shows little sign of ageing, but Mumbais own Rambo is beginning to feel the pressure.    
	The citys star sniffer dog has been admitted to the animal hospital, located in Parel, after complaints of fatigue. And Rambo isnt alone. Two others are in the sick bay.    
	The dogs are overworked and dont get enough rest. Moreover, they are sniffer dogs. It has an effect on their lungs. If the dogs are healthy, they give good results, said vet J. Khanna, in whose care the canines are recuperating.    
	The dogs work not only for police but also for the central paramilitary forces. Animal experts said their workload has increased so much in recent years that they dont get rest.    
	According to regulations in the police department, the dogs are supposed to get a break from duty every seven months  much like the earned leave for the personnel.     
	But the constant stream of terror threats in Mumbai has meant their bosses hardly ever sanction the canines their leave.        
	Games projects on fast track      
	The Games are approaching and development has come into play.    
	Delhi recently approved four projects, including an athletics training venue for the mega event at Chhatrasal Stadium at a cost of Rs 83 crore. Plans related to the PWD department and education were also sanctioned.    
	Finance minister A.K. Walia said the training venue for the Commonwealth Games 2010 at Chhatrasal stadium had been approved by the Games organising committee.    
	After the Games are over, the facilities will be used for tournaments at the national, state and zonal levels. The amenities will be developed within 18 months over 17,646 square metres.    
	The minister said the government had been giving priority to all projects related to the event so that the capital was fully prepared to host the sporting spectacle. (PTI)    
	CM cash for Tamil trust      
	After the classical language tag, Tamil will now have an institute that deciphers ancient stone inscriptions.    
	M. Karunanidhi recently bequeathed Rs 1 crore in personal funds to Kalaignar Karunanidhi Semmozhi Arakkattalai, which will be part of the Central Institute of Classical Tamil.    
	The interest on the donation, which follows the Centres classical language declaration almost three years ago, will be used to support research into ancient inscriptions.    
	The status given to Tamil, one of the oldest human languages with its unique grammar and rich poetry, marks the fulfilment of a 150-year-old dream since the demand was first voiced by Suryanarayana Shastri, called Parithimar Kalaignar in Tamil, the chief minister said.    
	The state recently converted Shastris house near Madurai into a memorial and handed Rs 15 lakh to his family.     
	When I visited Shastris house, it was perhaps for the first time in my life I was given a heros welcome, Karunanidhi said.         
	Eastward ho!      
	An infrastructure blitz is on way in east Delhi, which has lagged other areas in development of civic amenities.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit recently promised a slew of projects that she said would turn the zone into one of the most developed areas in the national capital.    
	he promise came after she opened a community centre at Old Seemapuri and laid the foundation of another at Dilshad Colony. The Commonwealth Games village will be the pace-setter for the transformation, she said.

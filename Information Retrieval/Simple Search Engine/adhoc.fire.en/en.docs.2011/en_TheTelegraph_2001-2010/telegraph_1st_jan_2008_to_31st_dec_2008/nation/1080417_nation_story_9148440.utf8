          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 16: Delhi doesnt want Tibetan school students to protest against the Olympic torch when it lands here, but is anxious that Indian students cheer those who run with the flame tomorrow.         
	The Delhi government received a jolt early today with schools listed to send students to greet the torch expressing apprehensions over security and indicating that they were contemplating pulling out from the event, officials said.         
	By the end of the day, the Delhi education department had ensured that the torch run, already truncated for security fears, would not be abandoned by the schoolchildren.         
	But the students are unlikely to line the path of the torch run, as originally planned, an official of the Indian Olympic Association said. They will probably greet the torch at the end of the run at India Gate, the official said.         
	We received a call from the Delhi government around midday asking us to list all the security measures that have been taken. We are not the competent authority  the home ministry is  but we told the government what we knew, an IOA official said.         
	Details in hand, the Delhi government assuaged the concerns of school principals.        
	The students will participate in the torch run event tomorrow, Delhi education secretary Rina Ray confirmed late today.         
	India had issued a notification to its schools for Tibetans, urging officials to ensure that their students do not participate in any anti-China protest.

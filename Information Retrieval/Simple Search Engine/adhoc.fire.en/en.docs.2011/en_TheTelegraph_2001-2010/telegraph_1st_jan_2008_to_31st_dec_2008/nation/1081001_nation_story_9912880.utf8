The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalyan quit threat to BJP
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kalyan quit threat to BJP
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh is said to be looking for alternatives following moves by the BJPs central bosses to sew up an alliance with fellow heartland leader Ajit Singh.        
	Kalyan, who rejoined the party in 2004 after being sacked in 1999 over differences with the leadership, had been feeling slighted for a long time.        
	But the immediate provocation, sources said, was the move to sew up an alliance with Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh.        
	BJP leaders had planned to announce the tie-up after the parliamentary board meeting here last week, but Kalyans threat to quit forced them to defer an announcement.        
	Since then, top leaders have been trying to persuade him not to leave but the sulking leader hasnt been pacified yet.        
	The alliance moves are part of the BJPs hunt for partners to project the NDA as a strong force in the general elections due next year. Kalyan is a backward caste leader whose area of influence is in western Uttar Pradesh, also the stronghold of Ajit.        
	Kalyan isnt the only one resisting the RLD alliance. Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalraj Mishra, Vinay Katiyar and state party chief Rampati Ram Tripathi are also opposed to any truck with Ajit.         
	But L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley are pursuing the tie-up.        
	Kalyan had been sacked in 1999 after he locked horns with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He returned in 2004 but failed to turn the tide for his party, which lost power at the Centre.         
	Observers said the BJPs plight in Uttar Pradesh could worsen if Kalyan quits. The two-time chief minister is seen as a man who can electrify despondent party cadre.

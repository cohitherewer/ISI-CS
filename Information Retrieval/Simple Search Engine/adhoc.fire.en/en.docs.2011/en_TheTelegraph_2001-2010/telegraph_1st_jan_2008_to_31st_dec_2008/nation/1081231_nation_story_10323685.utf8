                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pranab and Pak in sparring match

	Islamabad/New Delhi, Dec. 30: Pakistan today asked India to reduce tensions by de-activating forward airbases and pulling back troops, but Delhi retorted that all the tension was being created by Islamabad.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee repeated Indias stand that Pakistan was creating the tensions to divert attention from its failure to act against the Mumbai attack plotters, and asked Islamabad to act on the terror infrastructure on its soil.        
	India should de-activate its forward operating airbases (FOBs) and re-locate troops to peacetime locations to resume the friendly atmosphere, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a televised policy statement in Islamabad.        
	We have not created any tension, Mukherjee told reporters in Delhi. First, there should be escalation from (the) Indian side, then the question of de-escalation will come. We have not escalated anything.        
	He said the Indian Army had made it clear that its movements were a normal winter exercise, done every year. There is no question of mobilisation or escalation of tension.        
	On Friday, media reports had said Pakistan was moving up to 20,000 troops from its Afghan frontier to its Indian border and had cancelled leave of operational personnel.        
	However, at the weekend, the two countries directors-general of military operations had a phone conversation, and yesterday the Pakistan Army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, underscored the need to de-escalate (tensions) and avoid conflict.        
	There have been positive developments during the last 48 hours, Qureshi said, welcoming Mukherjees recent statement that India had not given Pakistan any ultimatum.        
	Ultimatums do not help improve relations, the Pakistani minister said. The two countries must revive direct contacts and diplomatic channels for improving ties. Qureshi, however, insisted that Islamabad was yet to receive any evidence on a Pakistani link to the Mumbai attacks.        
	Mukherjee said Pakistan had always been reluctant to act on evidence in the past and cited the example of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, freed by India in a trade-off for the passengers of a hijacked plane.        
	The hijacking took place in Kathmandu, (the) exchange in Kandahar  how is he (Azhar) visible in Pakistan, then? Your (Pakistans) representative says weve placed him under arrest, then says hes untraceable. Hows this possible? Mukherjee said. Please fulfil your commitments and do the job you are expected to do.        
	For once, Mukherjee spoke of evidence that Pakistan must give India. Islamabad must act on the evidence provided by India, he said, and there has to be credible evidence that they are acting on it.        
	Mukherjee reminded Pakistan that under a UN resolution, it has to ban the activities of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front for Pakistan-based militant outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba whom India accuses of carrying out the Mumbai carnage.

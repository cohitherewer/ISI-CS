The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul in full flow, BJP blushes   Day young blood boiled
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Rahul in full flow, BJP blushes     Day young blood boiled

	New Delhi, July 22: In part Rahul Gandhis speech on the trust motion today was made by the many interruptions, often unsavoury, it attracted. But in greater part, it was made by the man himself.         
	His claim of being an Indian taunted in whispers from BJP backbenches, his choice of the simple tale of two rural women  Shashikala and Kalawati  openly and repeatedly jeered at, the young Gandhi stood his ground and had his say.        
	Eventually, Lalu Prasad would pick on what Opposition members had found laughable in Rahuls presentation and turn the joke on them. You were very happy mocking while Rahul Gandhi was talking about Kalawati, he railed at his adversaries. Do you know Kalawati is the kind of name we give to our sisters and daughters in this country? What would you rather have, Dumpy and Pumpy? The House collapsed in laughter.         
	But before that, Rahul himself had taken his battle to the Opposition. Making a strong case for the nuclear deal and the requirements of energy safety, he said that other than Manmohan Singh, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, too, should be credited with foreseeing the nations problems and looking for solutions.        
	Then, seeing his statement had done nothing to evoke reaction from the BJP benches, Rahul invited them to applaud. Ab to taali maar deejiye, he chided them, and extracted a weak ripple. The BJP had done worse with him today.        
	He started by stating he wanted to speak not as the member of any party but as an Indian. Italian, flew a barely suppressed hoot from the backbenches. Rahul just stood there, a little shaken, mother Sonia stony in the front, sister Priyanka impassive in the visitors gallery.        
	It was Speaker Somnath Chatterjee who responded to that. Chhi, chhi, he said to that unclaimed remark. Parliament is reaching its lowest point, its nadir. And you think you are very intelligent, haan?         
	But Rahul took the jeering and the invective full on as he progressed, even giving it back to those who found his repeated references to Shashikala and Kalawati worthy of mocking.         
	I am glad you find it funny, he said at one point looking at the BJP benches, because three years ago, Kalawatis husband committed suicide because their family was dependent on a single cotton crop. And that is why I want to talk about energy security. Shashikalas children still study under a lamp, Kalawati has had to seek survival for her family of nine by diversifying. She does three crops and, as insurance against adversity, she has dug a pond. That is what the nuclear deal is going to be for this country, insurance at a time when energy requirements are mounting and the sources dwindling.        
	He said he was extremely proud of the Prime Minister not because he has been able to identify the problems and solutions but because out of those he has secured an opportunity that is significantly larger than the problem this deal is not about 3 per cent or 6 per cent energy, it is about whether India can become a global power.        
	In a direct riposte to oft-raised fears of American hegemony from the Left benches, Rahul said: We are a young and confident nation. I dont count myself among the young because 70 per cent of India is younger than me. It is a confident country, brimming with self-belief. We should not be worried any longer about how the world will impact us, we should worry about how we will impact the world.        
	Repeatedly cheered on by the treasury, Rahul likened the nuclear initiative to his father Rajiv Gandhis IT revolution. Nobody thought at that time we will become the greatest IT power on earth, nobody thought how computers will change things for the poorest man. We were at a crossroads then, we are at a crossroads now and this decision must be taken.        
	Omars blast        
	Later, as the debate grew to a close, another young MP rose to silence the noisy House with a brilliant burst of rhetoric: Omar Abdullah, president of the National Conference.        
	He tore into the notion that Muslims were against the nuclear deal and said: Why must I as an Indian and as a Muslim be afraid of this deal? The enemies of Muslims, like the enemies of all Indians, are poverty, hunger and lack of voice. That is the fight to wage.         
	He flayed both the Left and the Right. I once sat with the NDA. I remained silent on the issue of Gujarat and my conscience will never forgive me for that. I will never make that mistake again, he said, railing against the BJPs espousal of forest land for Amarnath yatris.        
	You call me communal? You dare to? he said, pointing to the BJP benches. Has a single Kashmiri ever said he will not allow the yatra? I can tell you as long as there are Muslims in Kashmir, the yatra will go, I can assure you that. And you call me communal?         
	Even as applause was breaking from the UPA benches, he turned to the Left. And you members of the Left, you want me to vote against this government and along with people who were responsible for Gujarat? I will not do that. I am not a member of the UPA, nor do I seek it but I will vote for this government. More applause.         
	And, after the vote, an effusive handshake from Sonia Gandhi.

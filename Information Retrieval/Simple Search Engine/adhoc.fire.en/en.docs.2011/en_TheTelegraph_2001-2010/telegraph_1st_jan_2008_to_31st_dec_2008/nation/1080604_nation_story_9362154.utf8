                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Firing wont stop us: Gujjars 
   Leader says ST status must           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Gujjar women take part in the protest at Bandikui near Jaipur on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	Pilupura (Bharatpur district), June 3: Gujjar leader Colonel (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla has rejected the Vasundhara Raje governments proposal to the Centre for 4-6 per cent quotas for the community through a constitutional amendment classifying Gujjars as a denotified tribe.        
	The agitation spearhead has also trained his guns on the Centre directly for the first time, accusing the UPA regime of failing to intervene in the current crisis.        
	In an interview to The Telegraph at Pilupura, the site of the police firing on May 23 that left 16 protesters dead, a combative Bainsla (in picture by Rajesh Kumar) also said he wanted the Centre and the state government to know that the Gujjars would not budge till their demand for Scheduled Tribe status was met. Excerpts from the interview:        
	Q: You have been holding up the railway line connecting Delhi and Mumbai for 11 days now. How long can you sustain this agitation?        
	A: My friend, we can and will, if necessary, keep up the struggle here for a month and even longer if forced to.        
	Q: The Vasundhara Raje government has recommended to the Centre a 4 to 6 per cent reservation for Gujjars as a denotified tribe. Is this acceptable to you?         
	A: Our demand is for Scheduled Tribe status. We believe we deserve that. I would like to clarify that nothing short of ST status is acceptable to us.         
	Q: Are you saying no mean path can be found, that you will continue this agitation till Gujjars get ST status?         
	A: I am saying we will not budge from here, irrespective of the consequences, till the community is granted ST status.         
	Q: When you say irrespective of the consequences, you mean         
	A: We are prepared to lay down more lives. Thousands here will readily do that. Firing at us will not stop us.         
	(A group of sobbing women push through the crowd surrounding Bainslas jeep to touch his feet. Dont move from here, wails one. We will till the fields, adds an older woman. You lead the men in the battle. Some of them are wives and mothers of those killed on May 23.)        
	Q: Last year, after the death of 26 Gujjars in police firing, there were 15,000 people blocking the highway. Today, there appear to be fewer than 5,000. Some say BJP leaders Prahlad Gunjal and Avtar Singh Badana (former MLAs in Rajasthan who resigned after last years firing), and your former confidant, Roop Singh, are working against you. Is that a concern?         
	A: There is no decline in support for the movement. They (Gunjal, Badana and Singh) are politicking, but their activities, honestly speaking, are immaterial. They stand exposed before the community.        
	Q: How do you see the Centres role in the episode?         
	A: The Centre has not been positive. It was the call of the hour for the central government to intervene. It was their duty to do so. They did not. Instead, the Centre and the state government are passing the buck between each other.        
	Q: The BJP has accused the Gujjar agitation of being fomented by the Congress. How would you respond?         
	A: I can say I have no political affiliations with any party. I am apolitical in that sense. I am here only because of these (ordinary) people.         
	Q: Some in the Union social justice ministry say Gujjars do not fit the criteria for ST status. What would you say?         
	A: The Rajasthan government, in 1999, approved ST status for the community. But no one has acted upon it. The Centre possibly thinks we are illiterate and do not know our rights. But this time, we will not be fooled.        
	Q: But is this the way to go about getting your demand?        
	A: I want to ask you a question. Are Gujjars not citizens of this country? The community is being forced to resort to such measures to win what is a legitimate right. We, the Gujjars, have been staging peaceful protests. In return, we have been fired on.         
	Q: Is this not leading to competitive politics of quota?         
	A: You tell me, when the Meenas or Bhils say this is their quota, so they do not want to share it with others, what do they mean by their quota?         
	We have a strong case for ST status, or we wouldnt be wasting our time.         
	Q: The supply of water and electricity here has stopped. Cattle are dying. How will you continue your agitation?         
	A: The government has stopped water and electricity and even tried stopping our food supply. But let me tell you, I have been in the army and know how to ration supplies. If necessary, I will ensure three men share a bottle of water.        
	Q: How confident are you of winning your demand?         
	A: I believe we have a strong case. If our fight is justified and correct, then who can stop us?

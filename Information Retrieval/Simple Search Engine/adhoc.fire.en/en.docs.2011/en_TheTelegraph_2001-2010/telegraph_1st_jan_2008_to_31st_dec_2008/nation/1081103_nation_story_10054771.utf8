          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 2: The government is all set to submit in Orissa High Court tomorrow the DNA report in the sensational Rashmi Ranjan Mohapatra kidnapping case and lift the veil of mystery that shrouded the fate of the Keonjhar-based businessman since he had gone missing 18 months ago.        
	The report received from the Central Forensic State Laboratory, Hyderabad, has purportedly confirmed that the unidentified body, one of the two found near Ranchi in June last year, belonged to Mohapatra.        
	Sources in the advocate-generals office here said the DNA report received by the state police would be presented in the high court tomorrow.         
	The Orissa High Court had granted the government time till November 3 to submit the DNA report. The report, the sources said, confirmed that Mohapatra was killed within a week after he had been kidnapped for ransom from Bhubaneswar on the intervening night of May 26 and 27, 2007.        
	With the DNA report, the government would submit before the court that the businessman was killed after receiving a ransom amount. He was first shot dead. Later, his body was set on fire with petrol and abandoned roadside, the sources said.        
	On June 4, 2007, two bodies were found near Ranchi, which the police claimed to be that of the businessman and his driver. While the drivers body was identified by his family members, Mohapatras relatives said the body (charred beyond recognition) was not his.        
	Satyabhama (32), the missing businessmans wife, and her brother Dilip Kumar Behera had last month filed the habeas corpus petition and demanded a CBI probe alleging slipshod investigation by the police.        
	While hearing the petition on October 16, the high court had directed for submission of the DNA report by November 3 after the state counsel claimed that samples had been sent for DNA test.        
	The police had initially sent the sample to the forensic laboratory in Calcutta. But an incomplete report received after eight months said the sample was not suitable for DNA test.         
	Subsequently, a sample of the thighbone of the unidentified body was sent along with blood samples of Mohapatras parents to the Hyderabad laboratory.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Terror cloud off Godhra suspects
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                           Modi: SC blow                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The 131 Muslims accused of playing a role in the 2002 attack on the Sabarmati Express in Godhra will not be tried under the Prevention of Terrorism Act that the Narendra Modi government had invoked against them.         
	Gujarat had announced it would proceed under the now-repealed terror law even after the Central Pota Review Committee said there was no prima facie case for invoking its provisions.         
	The Supreme Court ruled today that the decision of the review committee was final.        
	Saeed Umarji, son of Godhra cleric Mufti Hussain Umarji who was accused of masterminding the attack, said people were happy the Supreme Court had upheld our contention that evidence was fabricated to frame and prosecute the Muslims of Godhra under Pota.         
	We are happy this (the ruling) will pave the way for the release of our people languishing in jail for nearly seven years, he added.         
	The Godhra accused will now be tried under the ordinary law of the land. Their bail applications will come up in the Supreme Court soon.        
	The review committee had recommended dropping Pota charges against the Godhra accused while clearing the trial under the terror law of suspects in the Akshardham temple attack.         
	Some relatives of Godhra train victims had moved Gujarat High Court against this recommendation. The court held on April 13, 2005, that the review committees recommendation would not lead to automatic withdrawal of the Pota cases against the accused.         
	Taking the cue from an earlier Madras High Court judgment, the court said the state would have to make a recommendation to the public prosecutor who would apply his mind and make a request to the court. The final call whether the charges under the anti-terror law could be dropped would rest with the court, it said.        
	This was challenged by the accused in the Supreme Court.         
	Today, a three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice clarified that once the review committee expresses the opinion that there is no prima facie case for proceeding against the accused, in cases in which cognisance has been taken by the court, such cases shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.         
	If the case was at the stage of investigation, even that would be deemed closed.         
	The only role of the public prosecutor in the matter is to bring to the notice of the court the direction of the review committee. The court on satisfying itself as to whether such an opinion was rendered will have to record that the case stands withdrawn, the Supreme Court said.         
	No BJP office-bearer commented on the ruling, but former Godhra MLA Haresh Bhatt described it as unfortunate. Neither the party nor the state government will keep quiet. We will fight it, he said.

	New Delhi, Jan. 15: BJP leader Lal Krishna Advanis public appeal to confer the Bharat Ratna on party colleague and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has put the home ministry in an awkward position.
    
	Sources in the ministry, which coordinates the administrative process behind the decision, say Advanis open support is embarrassing because, as leader of the Opposition, he would play a crucial role in choosing the person finally anointed the countrys jewel.
    
	Its traditionally been the Prime Minister, leader of the Opposition and the Vice-President who together decide who will get the countrys top civilian honour. However, with Advani having written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  and making it public  about his choice, it makes things somewhat uncomfortable, a ministry official said.
    
	The official said lobbying for Bharat Ratna had always been there, though the Prime Minister had the final word before the President was forwarded the chosen name for approval, more or less a formality.
    
	It (lobbying) always happened but behind the scenes, away from the public eye. Now, with Advani making a public request, all political parties have thrown their hat into the ring, trying to make noises louder than the others. It has made things all the more difficult for us.
    
	Among the names suggested through the much-publicised requests are that of Kanshi Ram, Charan Singh, Chandra Shekhar, Jagjivan Ram and N.T. Rama Rao.
    
	The sources said the home ministry did not have any real role in the Bharat Ratna and only coordinated files and meetings. It was in the Padma awards that the ministry exercised its real clout.
    
	Right now, the sources said, the ministry was in the middle of sifting through over a thousand applications for the Padma awards from across the country.
    
	We get applications and recommendations from all over  from central ministries, state governments, various departments, institutions, NGOs and from the public. Sometimes, people who want the award send their own applications, accompanied by pages and pages of good work they have done. It is a tedious task going through them all, processing them and short-listing the names for the Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri awards, explained an official.
    
	The screening is done at three levels. The basic sifting is done by an awards committee made up of senior home ministry officials.
    
	The selected names are discussed by a committee headed by the cabinet secretary. It also includes the home secretary and the principal secretaries to the Prime Minister and the President.
    
	The list is then sent to the home minister for his opinion before it is forwarded to the Prime Minister and, finally, to the President for approval before the names are announced on Republic Day-eve.
    
	To avoid embarrassment to the government later, departments and ministries that recommend a name are expected to take that persons consent that he or she would be willing to accept the award.
    
	There have been instances where the awarded person has refused to accept the honour. This time, strict instructions have been issued regarding this, an official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rally rollback egg on BJP face 
                                                                                                            Rally rollback egg on BJP face 
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The BJP was embarrassed today after L.K. Advanis much-hyped rallies around the country  to highlight deteriorating internal security  were cancelled allegedly because of a threat to his life.        
	When word first spread that the rallies would be scrapped because national security adviser M.K. Narayanan had briefed Advani about intelligence inputs on possible terrorist strikes against him, the party issued a denial.         
	Spokesperson Prakash Javadekar told reporters there was no question of cancelling the meetings. Only the Rampur rally scheduled for February 10 had been put off.        
	The BJP would never bow to such threats, he said, recalling how Advani had continued his yatra even after the February 1998 blasts in Coimbatore that killed dozens. Nineteen explosions had rocked the textile city shortly before Advani, then Union home minister, was to address an election rally.        
	Javadekar invited the media to a wonderful rally in Jabalpur tomorrow and promised to announce a fresh schedule for the Rampur meeting. He said 11 other rallies would take place as planned and slammed television channels for wrong reporting.        
	Other BJP leaders said off the record the party could not afford to scrap the meetings as that would dent the shadow Prime Ministers iron man image.        
	By evening, however, the partys core committee, which met at Advanis residence, had decided to cancel most of the meetings.        
	Senior leader Sushma Swaraj said the decision had been taken in the light of the threat from fidayeen (suicide) squads and the coming budget session of Parliament. She said only three of the 13 rallies would be held  in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi  and a new schedule worked out after March 20.        
	Sources in the BJP claimed Advanis security could not be the sole reason and pointed to other factors like the haphazard campaign plan and fears of a burnout. Top leaders, they said, always faced threats to their lives but rarely cancelled programmes.        
	The sources said Advani would not like to be seen as a coward but had agreed to abandon the tour as realisation dawned that the campaign had been planned in a haphazard manner.        
	Others said preparations for the polls next year had started a little too early and there were fears they might lose momentum.         
	There was also a feeling that the rallies  planned in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir  might shift the focus from poll-bound Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhattisgarh.        
	So the security threat, they argued, was just an excuse for the leadership to correct its mistake.

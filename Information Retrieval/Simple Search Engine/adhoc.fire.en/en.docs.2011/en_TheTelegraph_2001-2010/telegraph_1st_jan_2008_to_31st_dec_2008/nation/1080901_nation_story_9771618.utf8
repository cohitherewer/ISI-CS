	New Delhi, Aug. 31 (PTI): A software engineer was found dead in his rented home in central Delhi today, police said.        
	The decomposed body of Ram Pataria, who was from Madhya Pradesh, was found at his Old Rajender Nagar residence around 10am.         
	He worked for the company C-Dot.        
	The police were informed that something was amiss by Rams parents who came to the capital to see him.         
	A foul smell emanated from the flat that was locked from inside, so the Patarias called the police, sources said.         
	The man may have died four to five days ago as the body had decomposed.        
	Ram, it is believed, had a strained relationship with his wife. She lives with their son separately, the police said.         
	Earlier, his wife had registered a case of harassment against him.        
	A senior police official said initial investigations suggested suicide. We are probing the case and have sent the body to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital for the post-mortem, he said.        
	No suicide note was found. The police suspect Ram was depressed and took his life.

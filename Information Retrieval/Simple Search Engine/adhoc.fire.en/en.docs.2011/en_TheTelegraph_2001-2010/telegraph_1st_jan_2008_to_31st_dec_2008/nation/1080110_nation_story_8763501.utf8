   OUR CORRESPONDENT 
   
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: Now, there is a new haven for Royal Bengal Tigers in Orissa. 
 
	The government has finally notified Satkosia as a tiger reserve mdash; almost two years after the central steering committee gave its nod for the same. 
 
	The total reserve area will spread over 963.87sqkms, with 523.61sqkm as the core area, covering Satkosia and Baisipalli wildlife sanctuary on either sides of the Mahanadi River.
 
	The area will cover Angul, Cuttack, Nayagarh and Boudh districts. In 2000 the government had submitted a proposal to the Centre to declare Satkoisa as a tiger reserve. 
 
	The committee in 2005 declared so, however, the state took two years more before it issued the notification. 
 
	Sunabeda sanctuary, which has also been proposed for a tiger reserve, is still under consideration of the ministry, said chief wildlife conservator, S.S. Srivastav.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye on Britain? Get 24000 job before visa
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Eye on Britain? Get 24000 job before visa
          AMIT ROY                           Tamsin Dunwoody, seen here with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, is hoping to succeed her mother as MP                                   
	London, May 6: Skilled Indian workers will have to show they have been offered a job paying, at least, 24,000 a year, the UK national average, before they are even allowed to apply for a visa to settle in Britain, under a new point-based immigration system announced today by Gordon Browns embattled Labour government.         
	Applicants will be expected to speak a good standard of English, though many critics of the government have already pointed out that this requirement will keep out the chefs from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh needed to meet the acute shortage of trained catering staff in curry restaurants.         
	The Home Office also confirmed that from this year, low-skilled workers from outside the European Union would be barred from making Britain their home.         
	Brown will hope that a package of measures, including moves aimed at curbing immigration, will help to fight off calls for his resignation as Prime Minister following Labours dismal performance last week in the local government elections.         
	Analysts have said that in Labours worst performance in 40 years, the party managed to lose the high-profile mayoral election in London and came third in the local government polls, 20 percentage points behind David Camerons Tories.         
	Although there is mounting concern about the rising level of unrestricted immigration from eastern Europe, the government has admitted it cannot do much to check the inflow from within the European Union since free movement of workers is guaranteed by the rules of membership.         
	Announcing the crackdown on immigration from outside the EU, the government said foreign workers hoping to fill skilled vacancies in Britains labour market would have to meet strict new criteria.         
	British-based companies will have to prove they cannot fill skilled posts with a resident worker and must show that the job vacancy has been advertised in the UK, said the announcement.         
	It added: To qualify, skilled foreign nationals will have to earn a certain number of points before being allowed to work in Britain.         
	Employers will need a licence from the UK Bor der Agency to offer jobs to skilled workers.         
	Some commentators say Brown will come under renewed pressure if Labour fails to hold on to the Cheshire constituency of Crewe and Nantwich in a byelection on May 22. The vacancy has been caused by the death of 77-year-old Gwyneth Dunwoody, a veteran and doughty Labour MP who had represented the seat since 1974.         
	Demonstrating that India is not the only country where sons and daughters routinely follow their parents into politics, Labours candidate is Dunwoodys 49-year-old daughter, Tamsin Dunwoody.         
	There was a note of electioneering in the comment by Liam Byrne, the border and immigration minister, who said today: Our new points system means that British jobseekers get the first crack of the whip and that only the skilled migrants we actually need will be able to come.         
	The government also warned today that employers breaking the rules and employing illegal workers would face severe penalties.         
	It was, however, slammed by David Frost, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, who said: The fight for global talent means we must not shut our borders to those who can help our economy diversify and grow. Setting arbitrary quotas to try and fit British-born workers into jobs is not the way to manage migration.         
	He pointed out: As the vast bulk of migrant workers come into the UK from Europe anyway, this points-based system will only have a limited impact in achieving the governments objectives. What we need to ensure is that British workers have the skills they need, rather than creating a false environment that ignores the reality of a global economy.        
	Figures released by the Home Office show that in the first 80 days of the new illegal working regime  introduced at the end of February this year  137 businesses were issued with Notices of Potential Liability worth almost half-a-million pounds. Under the old regime, there were only 11 successful prosecutions last year.         
	Civil penalties were introduced to make it easier than ever to fine those employers who give jobs to people with no right to work without carrying out the proper checks.         
	Byrne said: Illegal jobs are the root cause of illegal immigration, which is why Im determined to shut it down. With the introduction of compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals later in the year, there can be no excuse for not checking the identity of those applying for jobs.

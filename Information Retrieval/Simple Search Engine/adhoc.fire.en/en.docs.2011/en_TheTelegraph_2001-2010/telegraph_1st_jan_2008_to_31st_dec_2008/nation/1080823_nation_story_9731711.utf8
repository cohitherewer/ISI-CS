	New Delhi, Aug. 22: Flying near-blind in the US, the Indian Air Forces frontline Sukhoi 30Mki fighters have been shot down in missions at the Red Flag wargames, the toughest combat aircraft exercise that the US hosts for its allies.         
	The Russian-made Sukhoi 30Mkis have been asked to fly in the exercise only after switching off a sophisticated radar and without recourse to a key shield against surface-to-air missiles, a senior air force officer said. The exercise in which the IAF is participating for the first time entered its most complex phase today.         
	Shooting down or getting shot down must necessarily take place in a wargame. In 2003, US Air Forces (USAF) F-15 Tomcat aircraft participating in an exercise out of Gwalior in India were similarly shot down.         
	Despite being hamstrung at the Red Flag games, the IAF contingent was getting invaluable training as part of a Blue force tasked to defend its territory against an aggressor Red force in the Nevada desert. The range over which the exercise is taking place has mock-ups of several targets that are mostly military establishments, air force spokesman Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani, who is with the contingent, told The Telegraph from the Nellis air force base.         
	The IAF is participating with eight Su-30s, two IL-78s (mid-air refuellers), an IL-76 (heavy lift transporters) and 247 men led by Group Captain D. Chaudhary. Frontline aircraft from the air forces of South Korea and France and, of course, the US are engaged both with the IAF and against it in the drills.         
	Captain Marcus Spike Wilson of the USAF Aggressors in his appreciation of the IAF has said the IAF is a world-class air force with great aircraft and great leadership, said Upasani.         
	The IAF Sukhois have been asked not to show the full capacity of their BARS II radar so that their signatures may not be recorded.

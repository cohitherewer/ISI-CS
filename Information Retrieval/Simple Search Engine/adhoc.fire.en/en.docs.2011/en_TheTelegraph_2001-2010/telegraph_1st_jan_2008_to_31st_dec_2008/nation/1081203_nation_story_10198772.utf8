	Dec. 2: A separatist group in Assam known to target the Hindi-speaking population today planted a bomb on a train that killed three people, including a five-year-old.        
	Two hours after the 8am explosion in Diphu, a militant of the Karbi Longri National Liberation Front, which claimed responsibility for the attack, shot dead two members of a Hindi-speaking family in Karbi Anglong district.        
	The attacks coincided with the first day of an indefinite blockade imposed by the outfit, which is fighting for a separate homeland for the Karbi community, scattered over Nagaon, Golaghat, Morigaon and Kamrup districts. Diphu, where the blast occurred, is the headquarters of Karbi Anglong district in central Assam.         
	The outfit had warned the government against running trains during the blockade.         
	Within hours of the blast, two more bombs were found  one near the local Congress office at Dokmoka, around 80km from Diphu, and the other near a passenger waiting shed in the same area.         
	On November 3, the same outfit shot dead three Hindi-speaking persons in Nagaon, bordering Karbi Anglong, about 300km from Guwahati.        
	Nityananda Goswami, the Karbi Anglong additional superintendent of police (headquarters), said the bomb  a powerful timer device  was in bogie number 8209 of the 901 Lumding-Tinsukia passenger which left Lumding around 7.10am. It took 45 minutes to reach Diphu.         
	The dead were identified as five-year-old Raj Debnath, Namita Debnath and Kamal Singh Teron. The blast occurred when the train had just stopped at Diphu station and people were jostling to get off.        
	The inside of the bogie is badly damaged so it is practically impossible to trace where the bomb was planted, Goswami said.         
	Fifty-year-old Pyarelal Majumder, a businessman from Dimapur whose right leg got severed, said: I was trying to catch some sleep.... All of a sudden there was a loud bang. The next thing I saw was my severed right leg on the floor of the bogie.         
	In the second attack, police said a militant of the Karbi outfit raided a cluster of huts around 10.15am and shot dead Ram Kumar Sonar, 27, a migrant labourer. The militant also killed Ruma Sonar, a 14-year-old girl, who tried to flee.

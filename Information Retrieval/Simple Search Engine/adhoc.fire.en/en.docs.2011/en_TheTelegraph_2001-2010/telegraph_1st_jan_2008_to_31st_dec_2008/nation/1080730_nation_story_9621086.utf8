	New Delhi, July 29: In Irans capital and at a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, Delhi will be garnering support for a treaty that is the symbol of its new closeness with Washington.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, in Tehran for the NAM ministerial meeting that began today, is to talk to representatives of several member nations whose backing could be crucial for the nuclear deal.        
	Some of the countries in the 118-strong grouping are members of the current board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).        
	Mukherjee is scheduled to talk with his opposite number from Algeria, which is on the 35-member IAEA board, and those from NSG members Cyprus and Belarus. Other NAM countries on the atomic watchdogs board are Egypt and Ghana, while South Africa is an NSG nation.        
	The Indian foreign minister, however, also has on his plate a project that lies at the opposite end of the diplomatic spectrum from the Indo-US nuclear deal. When he meets Iran foreign minister Manouchechr Mottaki, Mukherjee is expected to discuss the progress on the $7.4-billion India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline, which is being opposed by America.        
	A meeting is also likely with Tehrans chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, who recently took part in talks in Geneva over Irans disputed nuclear programme, foreign ministry sources said.        
	Mukherjee will meet Cuban foreign minister Felipe Perez Rogue, who is chairing the July 29-30 ministerial conference. From Tehran, Mukherjee will fly to Colombo to take part in the Saarc ministerial meeting.

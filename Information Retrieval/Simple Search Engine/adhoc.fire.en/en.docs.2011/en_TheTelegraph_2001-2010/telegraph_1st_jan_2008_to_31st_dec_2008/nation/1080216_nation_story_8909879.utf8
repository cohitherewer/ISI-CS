                                                                                                               Sharp jab at Raj in PM unity sermon
          OUR BUREAU                          Migrant labourers reach Patna on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said political parties seeking to divide people on differences in the place they belong to were inimical to the cause of national unity or national progress.        
	In an allusion to Raj Thackerays campaign against Hindi-speaking residents of Maharashtra  without naming the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena or its chief  Singh said: An internally divided and divisive society cannot project an external image of strength and power.        
	According to Singh, practical, pragmatic pathways to deal with these tendencies would have to be found to avoid their destabilising consequences.        
	In a functioning democracy, internal cohesion could not be forced or imposed, the Prime Minster said. That is not the way in which the Indian people wish to govern themselves.        
	Singh said internal cohesion  whether it was on the question of migrants, reform of personal laws, education, healthcare or local governance  would have to be arrived at through a consensus and based on the idea of social inclusion.        
	Speaking at the launch of India To Be A Global Power, a book authored by former Union minister Vasant Sathe, Singh said India did not face serious constraints externally, but its problems and challenges lay at home. The things that we do and the things that we do not do will have a profound consequence on our ability to emerge as a truly global power.         
	The Prime Minister also voiced his views on regional parties more sharply than in the past. He said governments had come and gone without posing a threat to Indias democracy.        
	He added that while some state leaders had empowered the marginalised sections, they probably have not been bred in the values of democracy, liberal democracy, and so often blurred the distinction between state and private property.        
	Singhs indirect rap on Raj came as hundreds of north Indian workers continued to flee Nashik by train, bus and car. Local industries have put their combined losses at close to Rs 400 crore.        
	There were reports that north Indians leaving on trains were being beaten up at Nashik railway station. So many frightened workers hired trucks and cars and left with their families via Daman and Vapi, said Ambed Industries and Manufacturers Association president Dhananjay Bele.        
	Even as I speak to you, a truckload of workers and their families are leaving in front of my eyes, Bele said over the phone.        
	He said more than 10,000 among the industrial belts 35,000-odd workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had gone back home. Yesterday, the district authorities had put the figure at 8,000, which means some 2,000 workers may have left today.        
	Bele said the industries would be hit hard. If there is a power failure, you can install a generator. You can get a tanker for water problems and loans for financial problems. But what solution is there for (a shortage of) skilled labour?        
	North Indians are estimated to make up 40 per cent of Nashiks industrial workforce.

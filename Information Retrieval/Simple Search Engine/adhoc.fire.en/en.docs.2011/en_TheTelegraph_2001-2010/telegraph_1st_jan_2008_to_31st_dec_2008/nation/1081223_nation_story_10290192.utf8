          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A reopened diamond unit in Surat on Monday. Picture by Chandrakant Joshi                                  
	Ahmedabad, Dec. 22: Some 4,200 diamond units reopened in Surat today, bringing hope to workers sitting idle since the forced Diwali vacation induced by the global meltdown.        
	The 1,800 cutting and polishing units that kept shutters down despite a stern labour department directive have told a monitoring panel they did not have supplies of rough diamonds to restart work.        
	There is nothing anyone can do about it unless the units can procure rough diamonds, C.P. Vanani, the president of the Surat Diamond Association, said.        
	The gems and jewellery export promotion council had put a ban on import of rough diamonds till December 25 because of the global financial turmoil. Exports too were hit hard with the US and the UK cancelling orders.        
	This had forced the units to shut shop from two weeks before Diwali in October-end to two weeks after it. While some reopened, there were reports of suicides among workers of units that didnt. On Saturday, labour commissioner Vatsala Vasudev ordered all units to reopen today.        
	Attendance has, however, been very thin among the units that reopened today and over the past few days.        
	Labour department officials on a recce of 28 major units found only 20 had reopened today. The remaining eight have cited non-availability of rough diamonds as the reason for their non-compliance but said they would reopen shortly.        
	Some 200 large units are yet to be inspected, deputy labour commissioner M.V. Jadeja said. Two units, Swati Diamonds and Money Exports, have promised to reopen in a few days.        
	Vanani, the Surat Diamond Association chief, said he hoped all units would get moving by January 1. Over a lakh workers are still idle. Labour commissioner Vasudev has threatened to deal with closed units with an iron hand next year.        
	Babubhai Jariwala, the Surat Diamond Workers Association president, has apparently threatened diamond manufacturers that they would have to pay workers Rs 2,500 regardless of whether their units reopened or not.        
	Sources said the Gujarat governments sudden flurry of activity was sparked by concern for its reputation.        
	It is keen to ensure all units reopen before Sparkle 2008  a three-day global gems and jewellery show  starts in Surat on Friday, they said.        
	Sparkle 2008 is part of the Vibrant Gujarat campaign and chief minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate it. Delegates from Belgium, Hong Kong, Israel, South Africa and the US are expected to attend.        
	Vanani said the idea behind the show was to explore the possibility of making Surat a global jewellery hub by creating the impression that its diamond industry was still sparkling.        
	Since Sparkle 2008 had been timed two weeks before the Gujarat Global Investors Summit in January, the success of the first would reflect on the second, sources said.        
	The Modi regime wants to give foreigners the feeling that the diamond industry is glittering even in gloomy times, a former Surat mayor said.

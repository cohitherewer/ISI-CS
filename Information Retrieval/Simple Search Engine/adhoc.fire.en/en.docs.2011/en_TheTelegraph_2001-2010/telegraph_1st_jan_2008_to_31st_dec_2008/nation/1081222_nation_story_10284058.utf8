	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 21: Temples in Orissa are no power defaulters.        
	There is a huge number of temples dotting the state, some 1,000 in Bhubaneswar alone.        
	And yet, there have been almost no pending electricity dues among any, according to the Central Electricity Supply Utility (Cesu), a private power distribution company of the state.         
	Barring stray cases, almost all big, medium and small temples pay their dues on time, records say.         
	For, over the past couple of months, police squads have brought forward as many as 2,000 cases of power theft. But not a single case among them was against the big temples in the state.        
	Cesu supplies power to about nine lakh consumers in Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Angul, Cuttack, Kendrapada, Nayagarh, Dhenkanal and Jajpur. With a distribution area covering 29,000sqkm, Cesu provides electricity to about one third of the states population.         
	All the major temples  including the Puri Jagannath temple, Konark Temple and the Lingaraj Temple  come under the Cesu         
	In many states small temples resort to theft or electricity hooking. But temples here are far more disciplined, said Cesu spokesperson Golak Bihari Sahu.         
	Despite no special provisions in the rulebooks, it would generally be a problem if temples take connections illegally. Even the department would find it hard to take action against them as they are religious institutions, but thankfully nothing like that happens here. Temples apply for connections officially and pay bills on time, said Sahu.         
	Among the big ones, the Puri temple administration pays a monthly bill of around Rs 30,000 per month. The Lingaraj Temple at Bhubaneswar runs up a bill of around Rs 15,000 per month borne by the temple trust while the state tourism directorate pays around Rs 40,000 for Konark Temple, said Cesu executive engineer P.N. Mishra.         
	The medium-sized temples in Cesus area of operation also make regular payments which come to around Rs 5,000 to 10,000 per month, he said.         
	However, small temples are not run that honestly. There are new temples everyday and its a huge number to be maintained.         
	Under Chandrasekharpur phase-1 of the periphery sub-division, there are reportedly about 11 temples, with pending dues.         
	Small temples consume electricity of Rs 400-500 per month but most of them operate with illegal connections. Officially, these temples have not been provided electricity connections, Sahu said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Foreign varsity bill on hold 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Foreign varsity bill on hold 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Centre may desist from tabling a proposed law allowing foreign universities to set up base in India, fearing opposition because of the financial crisis.         
	The human resource development ministry is yet to receive the political go-ahead for introducing the bill, listed for the winter session of Parliament, top government officials said.         
	The government, sources said, is not keen to introduce the controversial bill to open up Indias higher education to the world at a time the countrys economy is taking a beating from a global crisis.        
	Listed bills need not always be tabled. The Foreign University Entry and Operation (Maintenance of Quality and Prevention of Commercialisation) Bill had been listed before, but was not tabled. Following opposition from the Left, then a supporter of the UPA, the bill was placed in cold storage.         
	But within 24 hours of the UPA winning the July trust vote that followed the Lefts withdrawal of support, HRD minister Arjun Singh had said the government was keen to introduce the bill in the next session of Parliament.         
	The draft bill  cleared by the cabinet in 2007  was dusted and listed for introduction in this session of Parliament, the first since Arjuns statement.         
	But now, we are not so sure of introducing the bill in this session. The governments assessment is that this may be an extremely inappropriate time to table the bill, a senior official said.         
	The bill, if introduced in Parliament, will need the clearance of both Houses. While the government, with the support of new ally Samajwadi Party, has the numbers in the Lok Sabha, it is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha.         
	The government, though, had earlier been confident that the pro-reform legislation would attract support from enough members of the Opposition NDA in the Rajya Sabha, the sources said. But now it is not so sure.         
	Given the current global financial crisis, MPs are likely to support more protectionism, not more opening up. We are consciously going slow on the foreign providers bill, a senior official said.         
	The bill was first drafted in mid-2006 and was approved by the cabinet the next year. It was then listed in the Rajya Sabha for discussion but was withdrawn under pressure from the Left.         
	A redrafted form  the government claimed it addressed concerns of the Left  was cleared by the cabinet in end-2007. The Left was, however, still dissatisfied, and the government did not introduce the bill in Parliament.         
	The bill aims at legally balancing potentially contradictory policy positions.         
	Although India officially allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment in education, courses can only be offered by institutions affiliated to the countrys regulatory authorities.        
	Also, no profits can be earned from education. All profits made by investors  domestic or foreign  must be ploughed back into the institution.

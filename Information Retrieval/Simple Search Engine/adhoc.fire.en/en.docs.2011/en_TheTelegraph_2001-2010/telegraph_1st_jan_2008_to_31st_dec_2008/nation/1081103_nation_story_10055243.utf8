The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deshmukh gets longer rope
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Deshmukh gets longer rope
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                        Deshmukh: Safe                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Vilasrao Deshmukh will live to see another day  or perhaps another year  as Maharashtra chief minister.        
	Congress sources said he would not be touched despite Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reported unhappiness with the state of affairs in Mumbai and Deshmukhs perceived inability to get tough with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray for the attacks on north Indian migrants.        
	Although Singh had expressed his anguish in a letter to Deshmukh, the sources said the leadership had more or less decided to let Deshmukh continue as chief minister till the state went to polls in October-November 2009.        
	If he had to be replaced, it should have been done earlier, said a minister. If he is changed now, it may add grist to Thackerays campaign. Theres a danger of the Congress being projected as anti-Maharashtrian and pro-Uttar Bharati.        
	Another Congress functionary said: The strategy of the Maharashtra coalition (Congress-NCP) was to give Deshmukh a long rope to hang himself but hes run himself through the rope.        
	The sources said it was apparent that the Congresss inability to articulate a clear stand on the ethnic strife had emboldened its Maharashtra leaders to bat for the MNS or sound soft on Thackeray.        
	Leaders from Maharashtra who spoke out over the last two days  including Deshmukh, revenue minister Narayan Rane and Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel  explained away the crisis in cultural and linguistic terms while condemning the MNS-instigated violence. But none of them said a word against the parochial underpinning of the agitation.        
	Asked in a television interview what he would say to Thackeray, Deshmukh had replied: To have restraint and understand the culture of Maharashtra.        
	Told at a TV interview that party colleague and state minister Chhagan Bhujbal had agreed with Thackeray and said the government must protect the interests of the sons of the soil at any cost, NCP leader Patels first response was: What is wrong with that?        
	Patel also equated the MNS issue with Nandigram, Singur and Kandhamal. I can only tell you one thing. Until and unless you solve the economic issues of this country Raj Thackeray, Nandigram, Singur and Kandhamal and lots of other things will keep happening.        
	Rane, a former Shiv Sena leader still finding his feet in the secular Congress, said in Pune that while the Maharashtra cabinet had north Indian ministers, let (Bihar chief minister) Nitish Kumar cite one example where a Maharashtrian has become minister in his state.        
	Asked if the Maharashtra dispensations indecisiveness could cost the Congress politically outside the state, party spokesperson Manish Tewari said: The CMs instituting fresh cases against Thackeray under stringent sections (of the law). Ultimately, its his voice and not those of the others that counts.

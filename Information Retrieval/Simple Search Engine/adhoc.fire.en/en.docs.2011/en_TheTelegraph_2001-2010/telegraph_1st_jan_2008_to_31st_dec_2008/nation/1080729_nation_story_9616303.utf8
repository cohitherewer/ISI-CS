	 New Delhi, July 28: The Supreme Court today asked the government to explain why it should not pass an order to extend Haj-like subsidies to pilgrims of other religions.           
	The court was acting on a petition filed by former BJP MP Praful Goradia, who challenged the validity of extending subsidies to a particular religion in a secular state on the ground that it was discriminatory.           
	The government has indicated to the court that it provides similar facilities to Hindu and Sikh pilgrims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hemraj feared for his life: Social worker
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hemraj feared for his life: Social worker
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                           Rajesh Talwar                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: A social worker in Noida has claimed that Hemraj, the domestic help at Aarushis home, had sought her help days before his murder, saying he feared for his life and that of some others.        
	The social worker, who has worked with Nithari victims, said Hemraj had approached her on May 11. He came to me just four days before his death and asked me to spare an hour for him. He said he feared for his life and that of some others and wanted my help, she said.        
	I was very busy that day and asked him to come back later. He said he would come back on May 12. But he never turned up. The social worker added that the 45- year-old looked disturbed that day.         
	Her statement corroborates the claim by inspector-general, Meerut, Sudarshan Singh, who told a news conference earlier that Hemraj had feared for his life and had confided in his relatives and friends that he was in danger.         
	Fortis Hospital in Noida, where Aarushis dentist parents Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were consultants, has removed their names along with that of dentist Anita Durrani, who allegedly had an affair with Rajesh.        
	Rajesh, who was arrested on May 23 on charges of murdering his 15-year-old daughter and Hemraj, today kept himself busy by reading the Ramayan and an anthology of P.B. Shelleys poems in his cell in Dasna jail. Wife Nupur had got the books for him yesterday.         
	Rajeshs bail plea was to be taken up in court today but it was pushed back for a day because some lawyers struck work protesting the firing on Gujjars in Rajasthan.         
	The court has ordered the production of the warrant against him for tomorrow. The day would also see the prosecution and the defence clash over the police request for Rajeshs remand.        
	Talwar is in judicial remand for 14 days. Shortly after his arrest last Saturday, his lawyer moved two applications in the court.        
	The first said he was a patient of asthma and could collapse under stress and so should get proper medical attention. The second one was for bail.        
	The lawyer claimed the police had no prima facie evidence against Rajesh.         
	The Talwars counsel today said Rajesh was feeling claustrophobic in his overcrowded cell.         
	Jail authorities later confirmed that he had been shifted to a barrack that has a fan and a television set.        
	Police sources confirmed that a relative of the Talwars who was interrogated had turned a state witness.         
	It is believed that this is the reason for seeking Rajeshs police remand.        
	A source said the sleuths would ask for a long remand so that Rajesh could be put through a lie detector.         
	There were unconfirmed reports that Nupur, also a dentist, met home ministry officials today demanding a probe by an independent agency.         
	Sources said the police believe that Rajesh could have got outside help while allegedly killing Aarushi and Hemraj.        
	One of the outsiders possibly knew Hemraj well and the servant was probably persuaded to go to the terrace by Rajesh and the outsider.

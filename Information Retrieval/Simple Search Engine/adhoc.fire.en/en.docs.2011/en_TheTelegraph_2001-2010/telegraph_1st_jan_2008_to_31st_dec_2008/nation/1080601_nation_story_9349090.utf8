          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 31: Noida police are preparing to hand over all documents in the double murder case to the CBI by next week, sources said.         
	On Friday, the CBI got a letter from the Union personnel ministry seeking its view on the case. It is likely to take up the probe next week much to the relief of Noida police who have been under fire for their handling of the murder of teenager Aarushi Talwar and household help Hemraj, the sources said.        
	An official announcement is expected only after the CBI gives its consent, which the sources said was just a formality.         
	Aarushi and Hemraj were found with their throats slit at the teenagers Noida home on the morning of May 16. Aarushis father, Rajesh Talwar, is the prime suspect and is now in judicial custody.        
	But sources in Noida police said they only had circumstantial evidence so far. The murder weapon has not been found.         
	The police are counting on a narco-analysis test on Talwar to gather more information. The court has fixed June 2 for hearing the police application seeking permission for the test.        
	The Talwar family claims Rajesh is innocent and had demanded a CBI probe.

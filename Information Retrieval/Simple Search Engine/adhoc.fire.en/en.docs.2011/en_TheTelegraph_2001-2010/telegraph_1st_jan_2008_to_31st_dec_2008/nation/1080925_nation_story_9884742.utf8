The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oscar made to eat lynch sermon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Oscar made to eat lynch sermon
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Oscar Fernandes                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Labour minister Oscar Fernandes today apologised for describing the lynching of a CEO in Noida as a warning to managements to deal compassionately with workers.         
	I would like to put an end to this chapter by saying I am sorry, PTI quoted Fernandes as saying.        
	Emerging from a meeting this morning with senior ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and A.K. Antony, who had summoned him and counselled him to take back his words, Fernandes said his remarks were misunderstood.        
	I had expressed my condolences to the family of the CEO. I had just put my point of view before the media. I apologise if my statement has hurt anyones feelings, he said.        
	On Monday, L.K. Chowdhury, the CEO of the Indian subsidiary of an Italian firm in Noida, was clubbed to death by union members demanding reinstatement of sacked workers.         
	Yesterday, Fernandes told a news conference the incident should serve as a warning for managements. Hire and fire policy is not a peaceful way of workers functioning in an organisation, he said, in words that would be music to Left ears.        
	The statement sparked an uproar in India Inc. Ficci president Rajeev Chandrashekhar and Infosys CEO Nandan Nilekani were among industry leaders who said murder should not be condoned.        
	Fernandes was summoned by his party seniors today and told his remarks were distasteful, improper and uncalled for. A source close to the minister, however, denied the meeting had anything to do with what he had said yesterday.         
	The Congress felt that while sounding pro-aam aadmi in an election year was acceptable, it could not be at the risk of annoying the corporate sector traditionally thought to be softer on the BJP than the ruling party. Such utterances can impair Indias image as an investor destination, said a source.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, extremely sensitive on policy matters impinging on India Inc, would have frowned on Fernandes, the sources added. Singh is away in the US now.        
	When the statement attributed to Fernandes began scrolling on news channels on Tuesday, some of his Congress colleagues thought it was George Fernandes, the former Union minister who was once a feisty trade union leader, who had made it. Few suspected it was the mild-mannered Oscar, who measures his words before uttering them.         
	A leader from Karnataka, the labour ministers home state, however, was not surprised. I would have expected this from Fernandes because he comes from a working class background and never disowned it even after making it big, the leader said.         
	He was a clerk with Life Insurance Corporation and a union activist. He probably got carried away momentarily by the episode and his pro-labour instincts got the better of him, said Fernandess Karnataka colleague.        
	While agreeing with the drift of his statements, he said Fernandes should have stuck to condoling the death now and articulated his views some days later.        
	Another senior minister known for his Left-of-centre outlook commended Fernandes and said the Congress should have welcomed his balanced remark.         
	But Congresss Kapil Sibal, the science and technology minister, did not agree: Taking someones life is unacceptable.        
	Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the incident would not be allowed to mar Indias image among foreign investors.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 14: Border Security Force personnel have seized 12 deer horns worth Rs 10 lakh from an area near Valmiki Nagar National Park in north Bihars Bagaha district on the Indo-Nepal border, 250km from here.        
	The market value of the seized horns is estimated to be around Rs 10 lakh, said a senior forest officer. Valmiki Nagar is the only tiger reserve in the state. The personnel who seized the horns yesterday handed them over to the forest department today.         
	Forest officer Patanjali Choudhary told The Telegraph: Deer are protected species. Storing or dealing with deer horns, hide or meat is banned across the country. The officers received a tip-off about an international smuggling gang involved in the poaching. The animal parts are also used to prepare medicines in countries like China, Thailand and Singapore, an officer said, adding: The government of late has deployed paramilitary forces around Valmiki Nagar to protect wildlife.         
	Despite measures, the number of tigers in the Valmiki Nagar National Park has been decreasing, according to a latest report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The report stated there were 56 tigers in the park in 2002 and the number plummeted to 33 in 2005. The experts, however, dispute the report, arguing that the forest is spread over India and Nepal. Tigers keep moving, hampering a correct estimate, an expert said.

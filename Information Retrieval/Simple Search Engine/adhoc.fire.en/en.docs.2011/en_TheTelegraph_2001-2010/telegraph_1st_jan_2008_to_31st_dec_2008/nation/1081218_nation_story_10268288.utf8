	New Delhi, Dec. 17: A.R. Antulay, the minorities affairs minister, embarrassed the Congress today by raising questions over Hemant Karkares killing during the November 26 attack on Mumbai and talking of Hindu-Muslim terrorism.         
	Antulay, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Maharashtra, first told reporters he was unsure whether Karkare, who headed the Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad, was a victim of terrorism or terrorism and something.        
	Superficially speaking, terrorists had no reason to kill Karkare. Whether he was a victim of terrorism or terrorism plus something, I do not know, the 79-year-old politician said.        
	In a reference to the Malegaon blasts probe, Antulay added: Karkare found that there are non-Muslims involved in acts of terrorism during his investigations in some cases. Any person going to the roots of terror has always been the target.         
	The ATS, headed by Karkare, was inquiring into the role of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, a former member of the RSS student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Lt Col Prasad Purohit, an armyman with RSS leanings, in the Malegaon blasts.         
	There is more than meets the eye, Antulay said, calling for a probe into Karkares death.        
	Later, when Shiv Sena MP Anant Geete demanded a clarification in the Lok Sabha, the minister said: I did not say Karkare was not killed by terrorists. I said he sat in the same car along with other police officers which was against protocol and went to Cama Hospital instead of Taj and Oberoi. Who told him to go to Cama Hospital? I only want a probe into who sent him in the wrong direction.        
	The Congress quickly distanced itself from Antulays statement. Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: We do not accept the inference, insinuation and suggestion which appear to be underlined in the comments.         
	A member of the partys minority affairs cell called the remarks irresponsible at a time when the Centre was working hard to evolve a consensus on the fight against terror. The attempt to communalise the incident was dangerous, the source said.        
	The terrorist who is being questioned admitted to killing Karkare... There is no hint of a conspiracy. Its about terrorism and not about Hindus and Muslims, the source said.        
	Karkare memory        
	The Malegaon Municipal Corporation today unanimously passed a resolution to rename Bhikhu Chowk after Karkare. Bhikhu Chowk was the site of the September 29 Malegaon blast that the slain officer was probing before his death.

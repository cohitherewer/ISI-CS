	Mumbai, Jan. 11: A toy train trip turned into a horror ride for toddlers of a playschool when two bogies jumped rails and left 19 injured. 
    
	The group of children, most of them two-three years old, from Flower Dots Nursery in Kandivali East had been taken to the nearby Evershine Park for a picnic.
    
	The children were enjoying a ride in the toy train when the axle of one of the wheels broke, two bogies jumped tracks and then turned turtle, said P.S. Ingule, the police officer probing the mishap. 
    
	The driver has been arrested. The police are probing if poor maintenance caused the accident.
    
	The injured children were taken to nearby hospitals. While most have fractured their hands and legs, one dislocated a shoulder and another a hip. One child has to have an ear operation.
    
	My granddaughter has injuries on her head, legs and hands. She has been operated on. She was so keen on going for this picnic. Little did we know that it would turn out to be like this, said Ram Mishra as his granddaughter Nidhi cried, her eyes searching for her mother. 
    
	Its been a nightmare. I havent even been able to see if my child is fine. The only thing that the doctors are telling us is that she has a head injury, said Tribhuvan Vyas.

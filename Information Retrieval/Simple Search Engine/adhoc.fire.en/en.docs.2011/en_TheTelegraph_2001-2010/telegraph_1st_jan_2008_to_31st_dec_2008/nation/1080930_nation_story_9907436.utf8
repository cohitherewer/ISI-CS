                              Nicolas Sarkozy shares a laugh with Manmohan Singh at the India-EU summit in Marseilles on Monday. (PTI)                            
	Marseilles, Sept. 29 (Agencies): Manmohan Singh today weathered a gathering storm over the attacks on Christians and churches, assuring the European Union that India was committed to protecting the religious rights of all minorities.        
	I would like to re-affirm that the Government of India stands firm in defence of the secular values which are the foundation of the Constitution of India that respects all minorities to profess and propagate the religion of their choice, the Prime Minister said at the India-EU summit.        
	Last Wednesday, a European Parliament communiqu had voiced deep concern over the Christians plight in India and regretted the impact anti-conversion laws might have on freedom of religion in the country.        
	However, the EU today appeared reassured by Singh, who said the attacks had been a national shame as India was a secular, multi-racial and multi-religious country.        
	He told the summit India had taken a firm stand and sent its central forces to affected states  Orissa and Karnataka  to prevent any recurrence.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the rotating presidency of the EU, appreciated the strength and clarity in Singhs condemnation of the attacks.        
	He (Singh) is a great man and he proved it again, Sarkozy said at a joint news conference with Singh.        
	On the row over Sikhs wearing turbans in France, Sarkozy said: We respect their traditions and customs and I hope they respect Frances rules. The (turban) issue is not important compared to the massacre of Christians (in India).        
	Nuclear talks        
	Singh said Sarkozy and he could come to some kind of an agreement over a civil nuclear co-operation pact at their talks tomorrow.        
	India seeks co-operation with all countries of the world in matters relating to promotion of civil nuclear energy in our country. The US Congress is engaged in the process of passing a legislation that would promote co-operation between US and India.         
	Singh said that since the Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver in Vienna, India had been looking forward to working with France and other countries. We are having a summit tomorrow, I hope some good results will come out of this summit, he said.        
	Sarkozy said at a time the world was talking about climate change, it needed to be recognised that nuclear energy was the cleanest form of energy. He said he would discuss the issue with Singh and take a decision.        
	Singh said India would not like the emergence of a nuclear weapons state in its neighbourhood. There is no question of supporting the nuclear weapon ambitions of Iran, the French President said.

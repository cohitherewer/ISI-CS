  - Outsiders Jai Rajasthan cry fails to spin Jeetega Gujarat magic        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Vasundhara Raje watches an election rath being flagged off from the BJP office in Jaipur on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	Jaipur, Nov. 26: Narendra Modis war cry was Jeetega Gujarat. His neighbour is now hoping her Jai, Jai Rajasthan would see her through.         
	Vasundhara Rajes slogan is supposedly aimed at evoking remembrances of the states martial legacy, but state BJP leaders conceded it was not such a great idea after all.         
	Most of the battles, they pointed out, were fought by Rajput chieftains to kill each other, not an external foe.        
	Observers said the Rajasthan chief ministers biggest adversary was not so much the Congress as her own party, the BJP, and the RSS. Unlike Modi, who indulged those that mattered in the BJP and kept the RSS at bay, Vasundhara, they said, was floundering.        
	At the Jaipur BJP office, party workers were heard asking strategists how come they were suddenly being missed given Raje had carried on effortlessly for so long with her cabal of six, headed by a prominent cricket board official.        
	However, even her in-house detractors conceded that Vasundhara was decisive, had reined in a lackadaisical bureaucracy, pulled Rajasthan out of the morass of Bimaru states and swelled its revenue earnings.        
	When she started as chief minister, Vasundhara had everything the BJP asked for: she had lineage, a forward looking outlook on economic reforms, was articulate and diligent, and was a seven-time MP.        
	Now, five years on, her antecedents could come in her way.        
	A Sangh contemporary of former chief minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat explained that Rajasthans ties with its royalty had always been complex.        
	After Independence, we had a Dalit chief minister (Jagannath Pahadia), a backward-caste one (Ashok Gehlot) but never a prince or a princess. The Congress ruled the state for long because of the anti-royalty constituency it had forged out of SCs, STs and Muslims. While people may have voted us in to oust the Gehlot government in 2003, it was not a mandate for her, said the former state minister.        
	A police officer said unlike Modi, a true-blue Gujarati, people are asking why should we have a Maratha from Madhya Pradesh as our ruler? They are saying because shes not a Rajasthani, she doesnt understand the simple courtesies we practise.        
	A chief minister is supposed to keep an open house. If a clerk or a constable wishes to call on him at midnight for something urgent, he is not supposed to shut his door. But she (Vasundhara) was inaccessible after 8pm.         
	The BJP woke up to Vasundharas inaccessibility a year ago. Party chief Rajnath Singh replaced state unit head Mahesh Chand Sharma, supposed to be the chief ministers proxy, with the more hands-on Om Prakash Mathur.         
	Still, because of the disconnect between the leader and the workers, sources admitted there was no overt enthusiasm to propagate the governments achievements.        
	The other reason why the regional plank couldnt take off in Rajasthan was caste fault lines were never etched as sharply as now because of the manner in which Vasundhara allowed the Gujjar-Meena-Jat agitation to fester.

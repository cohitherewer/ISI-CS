The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish cabinet shuffles baffle NDA 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nitish cabinet shuffles baffle NDA 
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, April 15: There is an revolt-like situation in BJP following the exclusion of performer Chandramohan Rai from the Nitish Kumar-led NDA cabinet.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar replaced Rai by another Bhumihar, Giriraj Singh, who is known more as a rabble rouser in the states political circles. The exclusion of Rai and inclusion Singh has raised questions, of which there seem very few answers.        
	Singh has replaced Rai in BJPs Bhumihar quota of NDA ministers, though the former got a different portfolio. Singh is co-operative minister, while BJPs Nandkishore Yadav has been made the new health minister.         
	A reasonably calm Rai went to the extent of saying: The party (BJP) is sinking in Bihar because of one person and his own interest. Rais remark was explicitly directed towards deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who in consultation with Nitish Kumar, decides on the BJP quota of ministers.         
	Let Sushil Kumar Modi explain what is my fault, he added.         
	What has irked Rai supporters is the fact that Nitish Kumar has been all praises for Rai in the two-and-a-half-years of his tenure. The improvement in the health sector had been an important highlight of government report cards that Nitish Kumar had been issuing every year.         
	Even the states people have been mentioning the improvement in the district hospitals and of doctors attending primary health centres regularly in rural areas in all constituencies that went for the bypoll since Nitish Kumar took over.        
	Chandramohan Rai, seems baffled too. I am shocked, as I have been rated as one of the best performers among the chief ministers ministerial colleagues. I am trying to get my colleagues to explain my fault. Some people who dont have a reputation as good workers have been included. I have been a dedicated and disciplined party worker for my life. But, I have been shown the door, he rued.        
	Supporters of another ousted BJP minister, Janardan Singh Segriwal, also spoke against the leadership and staged dharna and demonstrations.         
	However, party leadership still has an alibi for Segriwals exclusion.         
	The axe fell on Segriwal, party sources believe, because he is close to the controversial BJP spokesman, Rajiv Pratap Rudi. Rudi off late earned the wrath of Chapra sugarcane farmers and embarrassed the party after he failed to start a sugar mill in Marhowrah after asking farmers to grow sugarcane over acres of farmland.         
	Segriwal and Rudi belong to Chapra, which Lalu Prasad represents in the Lok Sabha.

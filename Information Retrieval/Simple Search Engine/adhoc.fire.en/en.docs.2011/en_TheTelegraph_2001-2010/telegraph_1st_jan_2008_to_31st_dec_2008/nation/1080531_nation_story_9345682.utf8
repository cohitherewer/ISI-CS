	Theatre fights to keep show going    
	A theatre that once used to be the Marathi movie lovers favourite haunt is fighting to ensure the show isnt over for it.    
	The single-screen Bharatmata theatre that exclusively screened Marathi movies faces an uncertain future as the NTC land on which it has been built will be taken over by a joint venture formed between the state-owned firm and a private company.    
	Hope has arrived in the form of assurances from Union textile minister Shankarsinh Vaghela, whose department controls NTC, that the theatres half-acre land will not be acquired.    
	A proposal has been put forward to give the theatre on a 33-year lease to the Bhopatkars, the family running it for the past seven decades.    
	But, time is running out. quot;Verbal assurances are of no use, the need of the hour is to execute the lease and put everything down on paper, quot; said Kapil Bhopatkar, who looks after the theatre at present.    
	Bhopatkar pointed out that renovation at the loss-laden theatre couldnt be carried out as he didnt have the land rights.    
	Smart cards in HIV fight    
	Life might turn out to be a little easier for sex workers and the HIV infected in Andhra with plans to hand them quot;smart cards quot;.    
	The move, part of the drive to control the spread of HIV and AIDS, will make it easier for those suffering from the disease to get antiretroviral drugs and other assistance from the government.     
	 quot;We are issuing ID cards to sex workers and those with HIV so they can get access to government schemes easily and become eligible for the monthly stipend for the destitute among them, quot; said R. Chandravadan, the project director of Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society.    
	Those carrying such cards get 50 per cent reduction in rail tickets and concessions on state road transport buses. The cards also help them get self-employment loans and protect them against police harassment.     
	Send-off fund for monkeys    
	Some in Tamil Nadu are serious about their monkey business. So, they have thought of grants to send the straying herds back into wilderness.    
	Forest minister Selvaraj told the Assembly recently that the residents neednt worry as his department was working on a plan to ensure the animals didnt get too close to people and homes.    
	As an example, he cited the thick in Tiruvannamalai district, from where the hordes often make their way into neighbouring towns and settlements.    
	The monkeys were also emboldened by the superstitious belief of people who worshipped them as Hanumans and offered them food.     
	Selvaraj claimed such shows of compassion prompted more of their kind to leave the forests and head for the nearby towns.    
	DMK leader . Pannerselvam interrupted the speech, saying: Monkeys are our ancestors and we worship them only to ensure no harm is done to them.        
	Parking shot    
	A cure for the capitals parking pangs appears on the horizon with plans to construct 24 underground spaces soon.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has set the ball rolling by deciding to appoint a technical consultant for the project.    
	Funds for the plan will come from parking charges and a planned one-time fee on sale of new vehicles. Grants will be taken from the government if there are shortfalls.    
	Twelve automated multi-level parking lots are also planned. All these should be ready within two years of construction.

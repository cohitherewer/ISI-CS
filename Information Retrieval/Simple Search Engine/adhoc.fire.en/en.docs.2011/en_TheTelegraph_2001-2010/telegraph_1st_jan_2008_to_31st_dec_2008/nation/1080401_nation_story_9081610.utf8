The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amitabh taken to court for Rs 695
                                                                                                               Amitabh taken to court for Rs 695
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          Bachchan                                  
	Lucknow, March 31: Amitabh Bachchan has been charged with depriving Uttar Pradesh of the princely sum of Rs 695.        
	A revenue officer in Barabanki has filed a complaint in the district magistrates court, accusing the actor of not paying in full the stamp duty on land where a girls school in the name of his daughter-in-law Aishwarya is supposed to come up.        
	The complaint came on a day the Supreme Court rejected the Uttar Pradesh governments plea to order an investigation into the controversial Barabanki land deal in which the actor was accused of projecting himself as a farmer.        
	The additional district magistrate (finance) of Barabanki, Shirish Dubey, has issued a notice to the actor through his local lawyer Pradeep Roy and sought a reply by May 5.        
	The notice was issued on the basis of a report filed by the Barabanki tehsildar, Anil Kumar. The magistrate said the cost of the land was Rs 843,639 but it was shown Rs 6,000 less. Accordingly, the actor paid Rs 695 less in stamp duty, Dubey said.        
	Lawyer Roy dismissed the charge as baseless and alleged that it was an attempt to malign Bachchans image. A defamation suit will be filed, he added.        
	Roy said it was the responsibility of the district administration to assess the stamp duty.        
	On January 27, Bachchan, Aishwarya and Abhishek had gone to Daulatpur to launch the construction of the school in the name of Aishwarya. Bachchan had embarked on the plan to build the school after Allahabad High Court acquitted him of the charge of fraudulently acquiring land in Barabanki.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government then moved the Supreme Court, which rejected the petition today.        
	Reacting to the rejection of the petition, the actors close friend Amar Singh said: Bachchan was made a target of state terrorism by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati. The apex court order has proved that truth will prevail.

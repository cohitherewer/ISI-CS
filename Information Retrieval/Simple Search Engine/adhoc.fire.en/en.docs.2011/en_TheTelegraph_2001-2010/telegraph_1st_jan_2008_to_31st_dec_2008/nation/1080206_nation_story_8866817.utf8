	Patna, Feb. 5: One can only wonder what their classes would be like.         
	Almost a fourth of untrained teachers appearing for the 2007 teachers training examinations have failed to clear their tests. Of the 8,472 (approximate) teachers, only 5,648 could manage to pass. Worse, 111 of them were expelled for using unfair means.         
	However, not all teachers were resourceful and some (2,058) of the trainee teachers, however, did manage to procure a first division, while 1,068 of them were awarded the second division.         
	Those who failed (2,253 of them), would be given one more chance to appear in the same examinations before they can start shaping up the next generation. If they fail again, they would have to content with the status of untrained teachers receiving a salary of Rs 4,000 for the rest of their employed lives. A trained teacher, on the other hand, receives a consolidated salary of Rs 5,000.         
	The results of 446 teachers are still pending, while 14 others could not attend the examination. During the teachers training tests, conducted under the Bihar School Examination Board, questions on Hindi, English, mathematics and social sciences are asked.

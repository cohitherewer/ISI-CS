          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati outside Singhs house in Delhi on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: No respite from Rahul? Turn to the Prime Minister.        
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, under attack from Rahul Gandhi and state Congress leaders for not taking the Centres flagship schemes seriously, today met Manmohan Singh with a long wish list.        
	But except for a three-fold increase in plan funds, all she got were assurances with the warning that she pull up her socks and implement welfare projects like the rural employment guarantee scheme and the rural health mission.        
	A state government press release said the demand list included CBI probes into alleged scams during the Mulayam Singh Yadav and Rajnath Singh governments and an early go-ahead for the Taj International Airport in Noida.        
	The list also included a Rs 80,000-crore package for drought-hit Bundelkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh, over and above other fiscal contributions from Delhi, and SPG security cover because of terrorist threats to her life.        
	The BSP chief has had constant run-ins with the Congress ever since Rahul visited Bundelkhand and virtually got the regions Congress leaders to demand that it should be lopped off from the state because of continued neglect.        
	The Amethi MP also alleged that schemes like the National Rural Employment Guarantee programme were not being implemented and that central funds were either lying unused or were not being properly utilised.        
	A miffed Mayavati had retaliated by saying that her life was in danger and the Congress would have to take the blame if she was killed. She declared she would withdraw her support to the Congress-led central coalition before the budget session began.        
	Congress sources, however, said off the record she was building pressure on the Centre to withdraw the Taj corridor and disproportionate assets cases against her.        
	Asked if she intended to withdraw support, Mayavati said her party people had advised her to request Singh to consider their demands before taking any step. My meeting with the PM went off well. I am confident the outcome will be constructive.        
	A release from the Prime Ministers Office said while the total resources for Uttar Pradesh under the eleventh plan would be 3.5 times higher than that under the tenth plan, the requirements for Bundelkhands development and a new airport would be met. But no time-line was given.        
	There would also be no let-up from Rahul. The young MP will visit Bundelkhand in May to monitor drought relief.

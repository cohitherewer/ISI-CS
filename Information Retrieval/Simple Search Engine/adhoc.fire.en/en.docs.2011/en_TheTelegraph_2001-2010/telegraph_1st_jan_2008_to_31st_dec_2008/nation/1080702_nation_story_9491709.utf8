	Mumbai, July 1: A woman and her child died under their collapsed home and parts of Mumbai sank today as heavy rain and high tide threw life out of gear in the countrys commercial capital and its suburbs.        
	The incessant showers, the second heavy spell since early June, disrupted rail, road and air traffic and flooded low-lying areas like Bandra, Chembur, Parel, Ghatkopar and Andheri, as monsoon measures taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation floundered under the torrent.        
	BMC commissioner Jairaj Phatak said the civic body had installed pumps in these areas but till the high tide receded, the flooding couldnt be controlled.        
	The Regional Meteorological Observatory said it had recorded 214.4mm rainfall in Colaba and 203.7mm in Santacruz in the last 18 hours till 2.30pm, taking the seasons total to 935.5mm and 943.4mm, respectively.        
	In July 2005, when Mumbai went under, the skies had poured 944mm of rain on the city overnight.        
	This time, too, water entered Amitabh Bachchans Juhu bungalow. Yes, water has seeped in... the actor, whose house was flooded in 2005, said in an SMS.        
	Delays of up to 20 minutes were reported on the western and harbour lines, while central railway services between Dadar and Thane were affected for more than two hours in the morning. The disruptions and traffic snarls on key roads hit office attendance.        
	Most airlines reported delays as one runway had to be shut down for 15 minutes. International as well as domestic flights were generally delayed by 30 to 90 minutes during early morning as visibility was low due to torrential rain. That upset flight schedules, said M. Kalghatgi, spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited that manages Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA).         
	A Jet Airways flight took off two hours behind schedule and a flight from Dubai, scheduled to arrive at 03:25, landed at 07:35, the CSIA website reported.        
	A UNI report said a wall collapse in Thane killed a 45-year-old woman and her son. The body of a man was found in a nullah in Borivli.

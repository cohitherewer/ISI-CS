The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nargis alert was sent, say scientists
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nargis alert was sent, say scientists

	New Delhi, May 6: The heavy toll on human life in Myanmar claimed by the cyclone Nargis has surprised weather scientists here who say its path had been accurately predicted and conveyed to Myanmar.         
	Myanmars official media announced today that over 22,000 people had died and tens of thousands were missing after Nargis struck the coast of southern Myanmar on Saturday.         
	At least two days before the cyclone struck the Myanmar coast, scientists in the India Meteorological Department and other weather agencies had computed its eastward path from the Bay of Bengal, scientists said.         
	We had consistent predictions  from India and other meteorological agencies  that it was heading for Myanmar. We were so sure that we never alerted our own authorities, said Ajit Tyagi, director-general of the IMD.         
	Tyagi said the IMD, which also serves as a regional cyclone warning centre, never received any acknowledgement from Myanmar about receiving the alerts. We had sent warnings, but we were not getting any response. There was no acknowledgement.         
	It was a fierce storm, only one step below a super cyclone, said Devendra Pradhan, director of the IMDs cyclone detection radar centre in Calcutta.         
	Nargis had wind speeds exceeding 200kmph, nearly as strong as cyclone Sidr which crossed into Bangladesh in November 2007 with wind speeds of 220kmph, he said.         
	Cyclone warning specialists said standard procedures after a cyclone warning include evacuation of people from vulnerable areas near the coast and from homes likely to be destroyed by winds. Cyclones hitting the coast sometimes trigger storm surges  walls of seawater rising 8-10 metres high  that can destroy weakly constructed homes along the coast and sweep away people.         
	Satellite images of the cyclone as well as numerical calculations by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and the IMD had helped the scientists predict Nargiss landfall on the Myanmar coast.         
	Cyclone warning specialists, requesting anonymity, said after a warning comes in, ground action to protect a population and reduce the loss of human lives needs strong coordination and a communication infrastructure.

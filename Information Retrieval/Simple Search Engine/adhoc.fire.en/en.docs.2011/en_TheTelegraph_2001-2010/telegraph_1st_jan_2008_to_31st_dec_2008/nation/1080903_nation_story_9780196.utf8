The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Early-bird BJP looks to slow down
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Early-bird BJP looks to slow down

	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The BJP thought elections were round the corner and had taken off in a tearing hurry. Now its looking for excuses to slow down.        
	The party today cancelled a meeting of its central election committee because L.K. Advani had to lead an NDA delegation to flood-hit Bihar, but a senior leader revealed it was a ploy to put off the session called to announce some candidates.        
	The meeting was important because candidates for Uttar Pradesh were scheduled to be named. The situation in the state is still volatile and the party leadership has failed to reach a consensus on many seats.        
	A party leader said the trust vote had upset their calculations. We thought elections were round the corner and took off earlier than others. But the government won the vote and is determined to avoid elections till it salvages some of the lost ground. If polls are still far away, whats the point in rushing ahead?        
	The party had hoped to tie up with new allies but not one has come up so far. Though the third front led by Mulayam Singh Yadav fell apart, Mayavati stepped in to prevent smaller parties from joining the BJP.        
	Talks with Om Prakash Chautala had reached an advanced stage but the deal couldnt be clinched, while Jayalalithaa has kept the BJP on tenterhooks.

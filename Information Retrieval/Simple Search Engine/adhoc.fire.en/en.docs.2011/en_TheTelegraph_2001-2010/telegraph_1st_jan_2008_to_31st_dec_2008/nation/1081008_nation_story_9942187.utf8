          INDRANIL GHOSH                                                 Narendra Modi and Ratan Tata shake hands after signing the agreement to set up the Nano plant in Gujarat. (AP)       
	Calcutta, Oct. 7: Ratan Tata had a little joke to make today: I hope that there is a bad M and a good M.        
	The bad M, presumably, was Mamata Banerjee who had forced the Nano project out of Bengal. Left Front leaders watching on TV from Bengal would have enjoyed the joke a little more had the good M not been Narendra Modi.        
	CPM leaders acknowledged that losing Bengals showpiece project to their arch-enemy  a man they had dubbed a blot on Indias secular fabric after the 2002 Gujarat riots  hurt badly.        
	Khub marmantik ghatana (a heart-breaking development) CPM central committee member Benoy Konar said. Thanks to an irresponsible Opposition (here), Modi has walked away with a project that could have turned Bengals economy around.        
	Most Left leaders, including chief minister Buddha-deb Bhattacharjee, had learnt about the Nanos final destination from their own sources last evening, long before todays news conference.        
	If you can look at it in a dispassionate manner, you may choose not to react, a CPM state committee member said. But how can you be bereft of feeling when the project you had been staking your prestige on has landed in your ideological foes backyard?        
	You could almost see Modi and company thum- bing their nose at us after bagging the Nano which was to be ours, an RSP leader said.        
	It wouldnt have helped that Tata said the Gujarat chief minister has given us a new home with unbelievable efficiency.        
	A triumphant Modi avoided making any digs at the Bengal government but the victory would have tasted very sweet to him. Bengals leaders had in recent years never let go of an opportunity to embarrass him.         
	They had invited and rehabilitated Qutubuddin Ansari, a Gujarat riot victim, in Calcutta and turned him into the poster boy of the Lefts campaign against Modi.         
	The CPM and its allies sent teams to Gujarat to express solidarity with the victims of riots and police harassment.        
	Modi tried to pay the communists back in their own coin.         
	A few months ago, he questioned the Bengal governments secular credentials over the Taslima Nasreen controversy and offered to shelter her in Gujarat.        
	Konar let off steam by linking the two Ms. We lost the project because of Modis ally Mamata. Its the same Modi whom Mamata complimented on his electoral success but forgot to condemn for the killing of Muslims in the 2002 riots, the CPM leader said.        
	The Left had played the Modi card in polls, reminding Muslim voters that the Trinamul Congress chief had failed to condemn the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat.        
	Perhaps with that in mind, Mamata said it hardly mattered where the Nano had gone. I find nothing new in Tatababus decision to relocate to Gujarat.... But we dont have anything to do with that.                    WITH INPUTS FROM BARUN GHOSH

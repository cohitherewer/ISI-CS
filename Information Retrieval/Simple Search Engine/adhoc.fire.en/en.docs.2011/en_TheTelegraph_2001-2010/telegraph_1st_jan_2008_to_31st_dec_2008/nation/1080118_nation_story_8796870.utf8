	Raipur, Jan. 17: People living below poverty line (BPL) in Chhattisgarh may have to go hi-tech for food. 
    
	Chhattisgarhs department of food has decided to send SMS and e-mail to BPL people to alert them about the availability of stock in the respective public distribution system outlets located in their area. 
    
	I dont have a mobile nor I can afford a one. But, I have to purchase one to get the months ration now, said Ramesh Soni, a resident of Gudhiyari, who pulls a rickshaw in Raipur. One has to rush to the outlet as soon as the stock reaches, as any delay can result in the stock running out, explained Soni.
    
	Under the perfect plan, civil supplies corporation will send alerts through SMSs and e-mails to BPL cardholders after dispatching the load of foodgrains and other materials to the public distribution system (PDS) outlet of their area.
    
	The message would contain the time of dispatch from the godown; expected time to reach in the outlet and quantity of grain. 
    
	The hi-tech system is aimed to maintain transparency in the successful execution of the Rs 837 crore chief ministers food assistance scheme launched in the state today to grant a kilo of rice for Rs 3. 
    
	About 34-lakh families, which constitute 65 per cent of state 2.08-crore population can avail the benefits of the scheme. 
    
	A galaxy of BJP leaders, including party president Rajnath Singh, chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Modi and other national leaders including Murli Manohar Joshi, Venkaiah Naidu Dattatreya Bandaru, Arjun Munda, Gopinath Munde, and Ravi Shankar Prasad were present in districts to launch the scheme. 
    
	The ration cardholders will have to enrol their mobile numbers and e-mail ids with the authority concerned that would feed the details in the web site maintained by it. 
    
	The details of the beneficiary would be mentioned outlet-wise in the site besides the record of the outlet.

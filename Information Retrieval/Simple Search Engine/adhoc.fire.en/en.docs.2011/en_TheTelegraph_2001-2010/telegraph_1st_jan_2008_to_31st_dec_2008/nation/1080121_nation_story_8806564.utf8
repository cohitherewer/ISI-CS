     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 20: The additional director-general of vigilance, Neelmani, admits that in 2008 alone he has made six arrests of government officials in corruption-related cases. 
    
	The arrests and subsequent SMS about them to journalists since the past two years may be good news for the police and the media, however, the 250-and-odd cases and 47 gazetted officers, booked under Prevention of Corruption Act, does not leave a positive impression about the integrity of the government departments.
    
	Vigilance chief Neelmani might be rushing to take credit for launching CLEAN (Corruption-linked efforts for affirmative action), but the government departments are not delighted. Especially since Neelmanis current list of suspects include a former director-general of police and a drug controller. The top names have led the Bihar personnel department to try to get at the root of the corruption problem. 
    
	To do so, the department of late has started to circulate letters to heads of all 37 departments and heads of administration at commissionaries and districts  for them to declare official assets as soon as possible. 
    
	The joint director of public relations department Shiv Kapur Sinha told The Telegraph: We have learnt about the personnel department issuing circulars to all departments for the officers and officials to declare their assets, especially those who are being newly appointed. I believe that this department would soon receive a letter.
    
	While department personnel secretary Amir Subhani could not be contacted, a senior official said the circular was issued with a motive to bring about transparency in the system. Under the new format, a selected candidate will have to declare his or her immovable or immovable property in Bihar and outside the state. 
    
	The candidate then has to duly mention the roundabout gross income from landed property and agricultural produce. 
    
	The official said a new appointee would have to declare his liquid property such as bank deposits, shares and debentures and mutual funds investments. And just to bring about total transparency, a new employee has to declare how much jewellery his family owns. 
    
	Threadbare details are necessary. One has mention if one owns a car, a motorcycle, scooter, refrigerator, air-conditioner or even a radio, said an official. Mention of property (Rs 10,000 or more) has to be done. The possession of books and branded clothes also come for reckoning. Insurance and loan obligations also need to be detailed.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 17: The general manager of East Coast Railway (ECoR), Ajay Kumar Goyal, today inaugurated a web-enabled complaint redressal system on the ECoR website  www.eastcoastrailway.gov.in.         
	At the inauguration, Goyal affirmed Indian Railways commitment towards customers and their wishes. If complaints lodged by them are not properly received and acted upon, customers naturally would be upset. East Coast Railway has, therefore, focused on this aspect, he added. The redressal system was put in place by the commercial department of the ECoR with help from the IT wing. The service is a first-of-its-kind in the country, as far as zonal departments are concerned. Apart from being able to lodge complaints on-line, regarding lack of amenities on stations or on trains, customers would be able to check the status of complaints or grievances  again on-line.         
	The system was put in place after the zonal railways conducted a study of users requirements. The system has been designed on a three-tier analogy making usage easy.         
	By registering on-line, complainants would register grievances directly with divisional headquarters officials at Khurda Road, Sambalpur and in Visakhapatnam. The users would also enjoy privileges of being able to closely monitor the compliance action taken up by the railways.         
	Complainants would also enjoy exclusive access and can find out the status of their complaint by typing his or her name or the station and train names on search fields.         
	Santosh Kumar Patnaik, deputy chief manager (IT), while talking to the media believes that the system would boost customer-railway rapport further.

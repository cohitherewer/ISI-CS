          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 6: The 10 terrorists who attacked Mumbai last week were trained for a year-and-a-half at four locations in Pakistan by former Pakistan Army officials, police said today.        
	The interrogation of Mohammed Ajmal Mohammed Amin Kasab, the lone terrorist caught alive, has revealed that the Mumbai attack was the first such assignment for the 21-year-old from Faridkot village in Pakistan, while the nine slain gunmen had participated in terror strikes in the past.         
	Mumbai joint commissioner of police Rakesh Maria, who is heading investigations into the attack, said the Lashkar-e-Toiba gunmen were trained at camps in Muridke near Lahore, Manshera and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and a location near Karachi. Handpicked for the Mumbai attack, they were kept in isolation at the camps.        
	They were given detailed information about each of the four targets. They were shown still photographs of the approach roads and the interior of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on laptops, for example. They were given fake student identity cards and cash in Indian currency at Karachi before they sailed for Mumbai, Maria said.         
	The crime branch has seized a diary, which contains detailed duty charts in Urdu, from the fishing trawler Kuber that transported the terrorists from international waters to up to three nautical miles of the Mumbai coast.        
	Maria said the duty charts were for November 23-26 when they were sailing towards Mumbai and listed names for vigilance duties. On board Kuber, they kept vigil in teams of two and switched duties every two hours.         
	The group carried 10 bombs and all had been accounted for, the officer said.        
	Maria said the serial numbers on the weapons and ammunition seized clearly indicated they were manufactured in Pakistan. The police had seized 10 AK-47 assault rifles, ten 9mm automatic pistols, and grenades, apart from a satellite phone found on Kuber, and seven mobile phones found at different targets.         
	Maria said a crime branch team would go to Lucknow next week to get the custody of Lashkar operative Faheem Ansari, who had confessed to conducting a recce at five sensitive locations in Mumbai, including CST, in November 2007. He was arrested in February 2008 after the attack on the CRPF camp at Rampur.         
	Nagpur police have increased security at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh headquarters after a crude bomb was found in a hospital at Dhantoli. A bomb detection and disposal team removed the explosive from the outpatient department of Crescent Nursing Home and took it to a police firing range to be defused.

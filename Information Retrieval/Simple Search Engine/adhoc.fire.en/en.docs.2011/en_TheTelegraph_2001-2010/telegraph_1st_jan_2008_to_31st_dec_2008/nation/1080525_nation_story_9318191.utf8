	Shake a leg with dancer Jaya    
	A tribal village in Nilgiri district got a glimpse of the dancer in Jayalalithaa on Monday.    
	The ADMK chief, who has been holidaying in the Kodanad estate in the district, had gone to meet the local Badaga tribes in Koradamattam village.    
	To welcome her, the women of the tribe turned out in their traditional attire and danced for her. Jayalalithaa was so taken by the welcome, she danced with them for a few minutes.    
	Her ready-to-dance attitude, though, should not surprise. Before entering politics, a much trimmer Jayalalithaa was a famous actress who could shake a leg well for the big screen.       
	Rane looks beyond pav plate    
	The Congress, it seems, wants to snatch the Shiv Senas vada pav campaign.    
	The pav union was first suggested by Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray recently.     
	But Maharashtra revenue minister Naranayan Rane, who is in the Congress, has jumped into the debate  some would say as hot as the vada pav  by telling the Marathi youth to think beyond the humble bread- potato snack.    
	I dont want Marathi youth to sell only vada pav. This is a very old concept. In fact, they should have their own hotel instead of just a vada pav stall, Rane said.    
	alling the Senas scheme myopic, he said: If outsiders can become rich here, then why not our people.    
	The Sena plan for the Shiv vada pav outlets, however, has run into rough weather because of its name, which is a derivative of maratha warrior Shivaji.      
	Sena MP in Shivaji rage    
	Shiv Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire has made UPSC delete a question in its Indian history paper for the preliminary examination, saying it hints that the elder son of Chhatrapati Shivaji  Sambhaji  was corrupt and debauch.    
	In his letter to UPSC chairman Subir Dutta, Khaire said this was a very offensive allegation and a slur on a venerable Indian dynasty. He also asked Dutta to take action against the person who has set the question paper.    
	Another question involving the use of the phrase mutiny of sepoys for the 1857 War of Independence also angered the MP.    
	The UPSC immediately went into damage-control mode. Dutta said the commission regretted the phrasing of the questions and any hurt that might have been caused inadvertently to anybody.     
	These questions stand deleted, the UPSC said.

	Sealing notice    
	Shopowners in the capital living in fear of the MCDs sealing squad can breathe easy.     
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi will now give a 48-hour notice to the owner of any unauthorised commercial establishment in the city before sealing it.    
	Requisite instructions will be given to the officials involved in the sealing operation that a 48-hour notice should be served to the shop owners before any action is taken, mayor Arti Mehra said.    
	For those whose properties have been wrongly sealed, the MCD also has a way out. From now, all councillors will survey their areas and come back with lists of properties that have been wrongly sealed.

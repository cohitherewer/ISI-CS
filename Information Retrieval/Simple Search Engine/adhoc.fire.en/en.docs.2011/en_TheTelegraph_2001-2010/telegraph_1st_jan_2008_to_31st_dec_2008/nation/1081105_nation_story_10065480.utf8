          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              Moromis mother Sunita (top) at the Guwahati hospital; Moromi. (Eastern Projections)				                                 
	Guwahati, Nov. 4: Four-year-old Moromi had walked out of school at 11.25am on Thursday, holding her fathers hand. She was back at the school at exactly 11.25am today, a heap of flowers hiding her black, burnt, lifeless body.        
	As she was taken out of the hearse and placed on two benches joined together, many of her teachers, nursery classmates and their mothers broke down.        
	It was exactly 11.25 on Thursday morning when she left the school. Today her body has returned at that precise time. How can I accept this reality? her class teacher Nilima Kalita said.        
	Why was fate so cruel to her? To such a gentle, cute and obedient student?        
	Moromis classmates Anamika Sinha and Nisharani Haloi wept, dried their tears and broke down again.        
	An RDX-packed bomb, hidden in a car, had exploded at Ganeshguri just as Moromi and her father passed through the area on their way home on Thursday. Carpenter Sagar Sharma died instantly and his daughter was left severely burnt.        
	The only child victim of the triple Guwahati blast gave up the battle last evening at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. Soon after the post-mortem this morning, the body was taken to Dispur Government Junior Basic School.        
	My daughter was Moromis best friend, Purnima Sinha, Anamikas mother, said. Now she is in a state of shock after seeing the body. What can I tell her?        
	The school is grieving like a family that has lost a member. Classes were cancelled today. A condolence meeting will be held tomorrow, headmistress Anima Das said.        
	Moromi was buried at the Basistha crematorium this afternoon. Her mother Sunita, after four wrenching days at Moromis bedside, has been admitted to the same hospital. She fell unconscious after her daughter died.        
	Doctors said Sunita was in the psychiatric ward, being treated for acute trauma. She needs complete rest and counselling.        
	Back at the Sharma home in Guwahatis Basudeb Nagar, Moromis six-year-old brother Karan cannot understand whats going on.         
	Head shaven after his fathers death, he keeps asking everyone: Wheres father, wheres mother, wheres my sister?        
	Sunita had promised him she would bring Moromi back home soon. She wasnt there to watch her daughter return home alone today, only for a brief while, wrapped in the regulation white cloth.

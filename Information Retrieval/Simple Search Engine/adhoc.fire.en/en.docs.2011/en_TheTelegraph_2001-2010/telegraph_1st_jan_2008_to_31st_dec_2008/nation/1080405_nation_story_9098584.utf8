The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tender loopholes stall Lalus pet project
                                                                                                               Tender loopholes stall Lalus pet project
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, April 4: Lalu Prasad pulled strings to ensure land for a project in his home constituency only to see it stalled by loopholes in the tender.        
	The railway minister is said to be seething because the wheel-and-axle factory in Chhapra, which he announced in his first budget in 2004, is now unlikely to take off during his term.        
	The railway boards appreciation committee has cancelled the tender for the Rs 800-crore plant citing discrepancies in the tender process. It appears that the entire thing had been done in a great hurry, the committee said.        
	A board official said Lalu Prasad had been keen on the project and had used all his influence to take care of the hitches.        
	The last big problem related to land acquisition. He solved that by getting the government to issue an ordinance allowing the railways to acquire land for special projects without permission of the state concerned, the official said.        
	The ordinance came a week before this years railway budget, raising eyebrows.        
	Lalu Prasad promptly declared the wheel-and-axle plant a special railway project. But now theres this problem over the tender process  an issue Bihar is notorious for, the official said.        
	Board sources said the minister was livid and immediately ordered the transfer of the officials who made up the tender committee on the field.        
	The minister was really angry. He wanted to suspend the officials but was advised it would not be easy since the officials must be chargesheeted and an inquiry ordered. Things could get messy in an inquiry, the official said.        
	The tender committee on the field decides whom to award the contract and at what rate. Then the matter comes to the appreciation committee, which advises the minister.        
	The appreciation committee, headed by board member (mechanical) M.M. Rao, found grey areas relating to who the lowest bidder was. Sources said it was a race between Larsen amp; Toubro and Tata Projects.        
	The discrepancies could not be overlooked and cancellation of the tender was the only answer, the official said.        
	The move will impact two other projects in Bihar  bridges over the Ganga at Patna and Munger. Sources said the same committee had handled these two projects. Chances are that the tenders for these two projects, too, will be cancelled, the official said.

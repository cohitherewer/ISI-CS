The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia alliance skill passes House test 
                                                                                                               Sonia alliance skill passes House test 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia: Tactful                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: Sonia Gandhis coalition-management skills were tested in the run-up to the Rajya Sabha nominations when the UPA threatened to come apart in Bihar and Tamil Nadu while in Bengal, the Congress faced a choice between the Left and Mamata Banerjee.         
	This would have had an impact in Delhi, especially with the Finance Bill to be passed by May and the nuclear deal still hanging fire.        
	But not only did the coalition stay together in the three states, the Congress appeared to be getting the Samajwadi Party on its side in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan was initially keen on getting the Janata Dal (United)s surplus votes for his candidate, Ranjan Prasad Yadav, in Bihar. Chief minister and Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar, part of the rival NDA, played along because Ranjan was a red rag to Lalu Prasad.         
	Once extremely close, they had fallen out and the railway minister has never forgiven UPA ally Paswan for co-opting Ranjan in his party.        
	Lalu Prasad requested Sonia, who is the UPA chairperson, to intervene. Congress sources said she asked Paswan if he could think of another candidate. When Paswan came up with Shabbir Alis name, Lalu Prasad didnt think twice before backing him.        
	The minority factor cemented the alliance in Bengal, too. Congress sources said Sonias mind was made up when Saeed Malihabadi, the editor of Urdu daily Azad Hind, called on her earlier this week.         
	The Trinamul Congresss Dinesh Trivedi, who is seeking re-election, had tapped the Congresss Bengal leaders in Delhi for help. Sources said Sonia was clear that Mamata would have to officially pull out of the NDA before she even gave the matter a thought.         
	The state Congress leaders were not exactly enthused about backing Malihabadi. But Sonia decided it was politically sagacious to keep the Left on her side at a time the Congress wanted to consolidate the gains of the budget and the UPAs social agenda before the general elections.         
	In Tamil Nadu, she spoke to PMK leaders who were miffed with the DMK, which heads the coalition in the state, for refusing the party a Rajya Sabha seat and then with the Congress for choosing Jayanti Natrajan over its state unit chief N. Krishnaswamy.        
	Krishnaswamy is the father-in-law of Anbumani Ramadoss, the Union health minister whose father S. Ramadoss heads the PMK. Sources said Sonia spoke to father and son and stressed that the UPA shouldnt get weakened for personal reasons.        
	If Sonia bailed out Lalu Prasad in Bihar, the RJD leader helped her in Madhya Pradesh. He rebuilt bridges with Mulayam Singh Yadav over dinner last week. It appears that the Samajwadi Party might ask its five MLAs to vote for a Congress-backed Independent candidate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Medicos call off cease-work
                                                                                                               Medicos call off cease-work
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 28: The junior doctors of the three government medical college hospitals in the state resumed duty today after a nine-day strike.         
	The decision to call off the strike was taken on Wednesday evening following discussions between a joint forum of the doctors of the three medical college hospitals in Cuttack, Berhampur and Burla and the state health administration.         
	Reports suggest that a meeting of three junior doctors associations of Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital (Cuttack), MKCG Medical College (Berhampur) and VSS Medical College (Burla) on Thursday also left an impact on the decision.         
	Health department additional secretary, during talks with the doctors on Wednesday, had sought more time to come up with a reasonable hike in their monthly stipend. The director of the medical education and training was also present at the discussion.         
	Around 700 junior doctors had ceased work since March 19 demanding a hike in their monthly stipend.        
	The juniors had also sought work allowances of Rs 10,000.        
	 Our demand was a monthly stipend of Rs 13,000 in the first year, equivalent to the basic salary of assistant surgeons appointed by the Orissa government, followed by increments after the first and second year. So, we are prepared to wait and see what hike the Orissa government grants us, said Paresh Behera, the association spokesperson of a doctors group, while talking to the reporters today.         
	The state health administration, it is understood, has assured the doctors that the state would announce their new stipend within a week or two.         
	Orissas junior doctors presently receive Rs 8,819 in the first year, Rs 9,609 in the second year and Rs 10,398 in third year, which is 67 to 79 per cent of the basic salary of assistant surgeons. Their counterparts in Bihar reportedly get a monthly stipend of Rs 13,000 in the first year. In Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, junior doctors receive Rs 16,000 and 17,000, respectively, in their first year.         
	Treatment of both indoor and outdoor patients in the three government medical college hospitals was affected due to the nine-day cease work. The government had to press doctors in peripheral services to keep the situation under control.         
	The situation is expected to improve once the doctors resume duties.

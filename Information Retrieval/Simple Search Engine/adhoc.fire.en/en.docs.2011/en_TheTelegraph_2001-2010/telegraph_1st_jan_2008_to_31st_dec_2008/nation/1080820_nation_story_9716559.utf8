          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bihars river of sorrow causes floods in Nepal and India. Telegraph picture                                  
	Patna, Aug. 19: The Kosi barrage, located 12km inside the Himalayan kingdom on the Indo-Nepal border, has breached at two places inundating over 25lakh people on the Indian side and 30lakh people on the Nepal side.        
	Bihar water resources secretary Ajay Nayak talking to The Telegraph confirmed: The water has spilled from Nepal and has affected 18 blocks in the Birpur area of Bihar on the Indo-Nepal border.         
	We inspected the site today. We have taken appropriate measures to provide relief to the people.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar is scheduled to visit the breached barrage and flood-hit areas tomorrow.        
	He spoke to the external affairs minister, Pranav Mukherjee, today urging him to talk to the Nepal government.        
	Mukherjee reportedly assured the chief minister of all possible central assistance.         
	Nayak, however, said: The Indian officials are right now finding it hard to speak to the Nepal authorities and expedite the repair work on the barrage, as the Himalayan kingdom is going on with a state of transition.         
	The Nepalese officials are in a fix awaiting their Prime Minister Prachanda to take over.        
	The barrage is maintained by the Bihar governments water resources department in Biratnagar.         
	However, the sources in the disaster management department here said, according to an agreement between the two governments, the Indian authorities were treaty bound to engage only Nepalese contractors and workers, while carrying out the repair and maintenance work.        
	We can engage the Nepalese contractors and workers only through the assistance of Nepal authorities. But, the Nepal officials right now are waiting for the new order to take over, said a senior water resources department official.         
	Nayak said the situation was not alarming yet, as there was not much force in the water spilling from the barrage in the Bihar side.         
	We have already set up relief camps and have started operations among the affected people, he said.        
	On the other hand, the officials in Nepals bordering villages are blaming India after heavy rains damaged the barrage and triggered floods destroying thousands of homes and killing at least five people in Nepal.        
	Downpours on Sunday night made the Saptakoshi on the Indo-Nepal border swell ominously and lash the barrage over it, causing two supporting spurs to crumble.        
	The escaping floodwater created havoc in Sunsari district in Nepal, as well as in parts of Bihar.         
	Over 30,000 people became homeless overnight in Nepal due to the floods, taking refuge on the highway and in schools and government offices, a Nepal water resources official posted at Biratnagar said.        
	The east-west highway that connects Nepal with India was flooded in parts and vehicle movement came to a standstill.        
	A Nepalese local development officer was reported as saying that the Kushaha barrage, built with the assistance of the Indian government, had used inferior construction material, causing quick erosion of the spurs.        
	However, the state water resources minister, Bijendra Yadav, said the Indian government had been maintaining and repairing the barrage exactly on the guidelines of the Kosi Panel which the Union government and former Nepalese government had jointly formed to monitor the barrage in Sunsari district of northern Nepal.

	Chandigarh, May 31: An air force An-32 today landed at Daulat Beg Oldie, reopening after 43 years the worlds highest airstrip close to the China border in Aksai Chin in Ladakh.        
	The twin-engine aircraft carrying the Western Air Command Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, P.K. Barbora, landed on the unpaved 2.1km airstrip after flying in from Chandigarh.        
	We achieved a milestone in aviation history today, Barbora said.        
	At a height of 16,200ft, Daulat Beg Oldie, a forward military base, is located near the strategic Karakoram pass, close to the Line of Actual Control with China.         
	The need to land at Daulat Beg Oldie arose in February this year, primarily to airlift soldiers stationed there in winter and to provide regular supplies, Barbora said.         
	The temperature plummets in winter and all supply routes are cut. The only way out was through the air. Helicopters could only service little, he said.        
	A Packet, with three engines and a jet at the back, was the last fixed-wing aircraft to land on the airstrip 43 years ago. The strip was then closed down after an earthquake loosened the surface soil, making it unsuitable for landing a fixed-wing aircraft.        
	The airstrip was built during the India-China conflict in 1962. The IAF operated Packet aircraft from Daulat Beg Oldie between 1962 and 1965. The base has been serviced by helicopters and airdrops since then.        
	Todays achievement will enable the army not only to rotate fresh troops and improve the communication network but also serve as a great morale booster, Barbora said.        
	Apart from a crew of five, Barbora was the only passenger on todays trip.         
	Asked why the IAF had not attempted to land a fixed-wing aircraft on the airstrip earlier, Barbora said the requirements of the army had increased. Nothing else should be read into the landing. It has taken us a long time to achieve the landing and a lot of work has gone into the job, he said.        
	The L14 Corps General Officer in Commanding, Lt Gen. V.K. Ahluwalia, said the feat would help the army carry out its duties on the forward base with added vigour. The army has great advantage now in the region, he said.

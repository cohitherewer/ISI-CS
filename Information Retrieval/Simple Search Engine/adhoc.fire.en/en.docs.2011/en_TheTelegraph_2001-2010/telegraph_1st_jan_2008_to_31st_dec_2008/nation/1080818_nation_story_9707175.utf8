The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM versus CPM in Kerala land-industry tussle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CM versus CPM in Kerala land-industry tussle
          JAYANTH JACOB                           VS Achuthanandan                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 17: V.S. Achuthanandan, Keralas hugely popular chief minister, has once again come out in the open against the CPMs powerful state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan.         
	An official party release after the state committee meeting on August 9 that labelled as extremists those who had proposed a second phase of land reforms  an obvious reference to the chief minister  triggered the tussle.         
	Achuthanandan, who had described his drive against encroachers in the Munnar hills last year as the second spell of land reforms in Kerala, hit back on Wednesday saying opportunists and revisionists feared people with extremist views.         
	Frowning at the state committees criticism that he had failed to lead and control his ministers, Achuthanandan recalled how the CPMs central leadership had to reverse its early stand and field him in the 2006 Assembly elections.         
	Some said at the politburo that the Congress-led United Democratic Front will win the elections if I am fielded in the Assembly polls. After this I opted out. But later, in response to demands from the party committees, the people at large, and following media reports, the party fielded me, he said.         
	This is the first time a senior CPM leader  the chief minister at that  has publicly spoken about the controversy.        
	The party committees and even individuals can criticise me. Ive always accepted the genuine and rejected the rest, Achuthanandan added.        
	To a question whether the party had branded him an extremist, he said: I am now 85 years old. The people know me by now, whether I am an extremist or not during the past two-and-a-half years, Ive tried to do good for the people.        
	The spat comes less than a year after the CPM revoked the suspension of Achuthanandan and Vijayan for violating discipline.        
	But the CPMs state unit is projecting it as a clash of ideas on governance, rather than just an ego clash. Achuthanandan, 85, has a clean image and is popular with the people  a claim Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can also make  and like the Bengal chief minister, has ruffled feathers in the party over his stand on industry. Only, the two stand on opposite sides on the issue.        
	If Bhattacharjee has invited the charge of trying to bulldoze industrialisation and dragging the party into trouble in Nandigram, his Kerala counterpart is accused of being unreceptive to change.         
	Vijayan and most other leaders in the CPMs state unit have a problem with what a cabinet minister described as the obduracy of the chief minister who came up through the ranks.         
	Industries minister Elamaram Karim, who was a trade union leader, has been talking about the need to amend existing laws so that land can be acquired faster for industry.         
	We are not saying that land reforms are bad. We have to change and what we need is change in policies and outlook. Every society has to move from the agrarian phase to the industrial phase, and we cannot look the other way when every state in the country is vying for industries that will bring jobs in big numbers to the people, a state committee member said.         
	The question that the state party leaders are asking, in private, is how can the central leadership support industrialisation of one government  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees  while Kerala continues to inhabit the old world.         
	But Achuthanandan, who joined the undivided communist party in 1940 and is possibly Keralas most popular communist leader at present, could not care less. His outburst, coming as it does on the heels of open defiance of the party by Somnath Chatterjee and ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, has set off speculation whether he is planning an endgame, unable to tolerate steamrollering by the official faction.        
	The 85-year-old leader has chosen his moment to let off steam  right after general secretary Prakash Karats political misadventure in Delhi, trying and failing to topple the Manmohan Singh government, the forced camaraderie with the once-hated Mayavati and the disquiet in Bengal over Somnath Chatterjees summary expulsion.

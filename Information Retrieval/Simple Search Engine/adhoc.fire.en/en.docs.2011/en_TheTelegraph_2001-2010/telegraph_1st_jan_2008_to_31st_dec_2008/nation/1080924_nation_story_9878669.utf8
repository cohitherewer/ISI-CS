	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 23: Railway employees in the state are quite angry over forceful donation of a days salary for flood victims in Bihar even as their homes have been inundated in the past few days.        
	About Rs 90 lakh from their salary had been deducted without their consent, alleged Railway Mens Congress general secretary P.R. Mohanty. When we spend sleepless nights at our flooded homes, how can we help others? Moreover, they did not bother to take our consent for the days pay cut. The East Coast Railway has already cut the salary without our knowledge, said Mohanty.        
	Around 40,000 employees from the state work for the East Coast Railway.         
	Bihar has already received Rs 1,000 crore from the Centres kitty besides donation from other sources. Our hard-earned money should not be given for appeasing the vote banks in Bihar, he said. The association staged demonstration on the East Coast Railway zonal office campus today to mark their protest.         
	Describing it as a dictatorial step, the employees wanted their money back, which they were prepared to donate to victims closer home instead. We dont object if the money is sent for the benefit of flood-hit victims in our state, said one of the members of the union while protesting.        
	The Bihar flood was declared as a national calamity on the first day. We donate Rs 100 each to the Prime Ministers Relief Fund during any disaster of high magnitude in the country. But this time, we have been asked to contribute to the Railway Ministers Welfare and Relief Fund, said another employee of the coastal railway.        
	We need an explanation from the railways for this whimsical and dictatorial action, they said.        
	East Coast Railway officials, however, said that the employees had not been forced to donate the amount.         
	An East Coast Railway release stated today that a relief camp had been opened by in Jagatsinghpur district for flood victims.

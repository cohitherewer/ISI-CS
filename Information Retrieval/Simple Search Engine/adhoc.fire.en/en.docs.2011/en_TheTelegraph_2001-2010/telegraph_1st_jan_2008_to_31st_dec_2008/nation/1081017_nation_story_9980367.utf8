          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 16: Cases of loot were lodged today against four constables of Mokamah police station in Patna district for allegedly looting jewellery, cash and other belongings of a woman travelling on a local train.        
	The victim, Prashanto Devi (45), was going to Gaya from Mokamah few months ago when policemen looted her.        
	We have suspended the four constables in question and have asked the Mokamah police to go ahead with investigation against them, said D. N. Gupta, the superintendent of police of GRP, Patna.         
	Gupta has launched an operation against policemen looting and misbehaving with the train passengers.        
	The gun-toting constables robbed Prashanto Devi on June 2 this year at Mokamah while she was travelling on a train. Determined to get justice in the case, Prashanto Devi ran from pillar to post to lodge a case against the policemen. But she did not find anyone to listen to her plea against the police escort party members on duty to guard the passengers on trains till she met Gupta in September to pursue her case.        
	I listened to Prashanto Devi and began my investigation against the personnel on duty that day. After I found truth in her accusations, I suspended the four cops, Gupta said, adding that today he forwarded the case to the Mokamah police station for further legal action.

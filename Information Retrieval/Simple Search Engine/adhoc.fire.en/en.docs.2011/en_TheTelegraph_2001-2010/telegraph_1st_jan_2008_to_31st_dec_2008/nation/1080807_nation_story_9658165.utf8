	Mumbai, Aug. 6 (PTI): Tata Steel on Wednesday said it did not plan to suspend construction work on the Dhamra Port project in Orissa. A news release said a forged statement had been sent to the media saying the company was planning to halt work. The statement is false and has been done to malign the companys reputation.

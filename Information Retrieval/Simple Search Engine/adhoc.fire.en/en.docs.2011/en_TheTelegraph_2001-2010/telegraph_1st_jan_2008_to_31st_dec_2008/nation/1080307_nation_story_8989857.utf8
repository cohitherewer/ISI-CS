The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soak potatoes for safer chips
                                                                                                               Soak potatoes for safer chips
          G.S. MUDUR                           IS IT THE RIGHT COLOUR?                                  
	New Delhi, March 6: Soaking potatoes in water before theyre turned into French fries reduces levels of a potentially harmful chemical called acrylamide, scientists said today.        
	In attempts to find simple ways to reduce the percentage of the chemical in home-made food, the scientists in the UK have shown that acrylamide in French fries drops by up to 50 per cent in potatoes soaked for two hours.         
	Concerns about acrylamide in food surfaced in April 2002 after scientists in Sweden detected it in starch-rich foods cooked by frying or baking at high temperatures such as crisps, fries or potato chips.        
	The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified acrylamide as probably carcinogenic to humans.         
	While scientists are still trying to understand the implications of acrylamide on human health, experts have recommended efforts to reduce its concentration in food.        
	The chemical is produced when certain starch-rich foods are fried, grilled, baked or roasted, but is not found in boiled food.         
	We wanted to explore ways of reducing acrylamide in home cooking, said Rachel Burch, a scientist at the Leatherhead Food International, a research consultancy in the UK.         
	Burch and her colleagues found that on an average, washing reduced acrylamide by 15 per cent, but soaking in water for 30 minutes or two hours reduced it by 35 to 50 per cent. Their findings appear today in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, published by the Society of Chemistry and Industry.         
	The study also found that acrylamide levels depended on the variety of potatoes used to make the French fries.         
	The food industry has conducted research to reduce acrylamide in manufactured food, but until now few studies have addressed home-made food.        
	The researchers believe that the process of soaking removes precursors of acrylamide from raw potatoes, leading to a reduction in its concentration after the frying process.         
	But the study has also found that the removal of the precursors during soaking also leads to a drop in browning. The soaked fries were lighter in colour than fries made from plain washed potatoes.         
	The scientists have cautioned that if the soaked French fries are cooked long and allowed to reach the same colour as normal French fries (made from potatoes that are not soaked), they might regain the same level of acrylamide.         
	The success of this approach to the reduction of acrylamide in domestically prepared fries will depend on consumer acceptance of a lighter-coloured product, the researchers said in their report.

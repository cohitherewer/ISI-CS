          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 7: The Centres efforts to engage Amarnath agitators in discussions appeared to be paying off after the group spearheading the campaign said it was willing to hold talks.        
	We were never against talks if they came up with some concrete proposal, said Brigadier (retired) Suchet Singh, a senior leader of the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, which has been leading the battle against a scrapped land-allotment order.        
	The Jammu Sainik Colony resident, however, said they hadnt got any invite for discussions. Whatever we learnt is through the media, but if there is a proper invite we would certainly think over it.        
	Samiti leaders had earlier taken a tough stand on talks after the first round of negotiations last week failed to break the standoff that has led to Kashmirs economic blockade.        
	Sources said the Samiti would take a decision tomorrow whether to extend its 15-day strike in Jammu.        
	The agitation  against the state governments decision to cancel allotment of forest land in Baltal to the Amarnath shrine board  has cut off Muslim-majority Kashmir from other parts of the country and has already begun to bite the common man.        
	Fewer clashes were reported today between police and protesters though life remained paralysed in both Jammu and Kashmir as rival protesters enforced complete shutdowns.        
	Official sources said a high-level committee authorised by an all-party meeting in Delhi could visit the state on Saturday for talks with Samiti leaders.        
	Governor N.N. Vohra has already set up a panel to hold talks with the Samiti to try and restore peace. The four members on the panel are former state chief secretary S.S. Bloeria, retired judge G.D. Sharma, Jammu University vice-chancellor Amitabh Mattoo and principal secretary to the governor B.B. Vyas, who is also the shrine boards CEO.        
	Vyas, too, has written to the Samiti inviting it to visit the base camp at Baltal, one of the starting points of the Amarnath pilgrimage.        
	In Jammu, doctors from some hospitals joined the protests.         
	Sporadic clashes marked the fourth day of the strike in the Valley, where Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik, on a hunger strike for the past three days, was shifted to hospital after his condition deteriorated, the police said.        
	The strike had been called in protest against the Valleys economic blockade and alleged targeting of Muslims in Hindu-majority Jammu.        
	Vohra said the army would start aerial surveillance of the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, Kashmirs vital link with the rest of India, to ensure smooth movement of goods.        
	He denied any economic blockade of Kashmir and said only some disruptions had taken place.

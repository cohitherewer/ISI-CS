          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Panchkula, June 10: Two Haryana policemen accused of rape have been sacked, but their victim had to die first.        
	Sarita, a 27-year-old mother of two, committed suicide at the police headquarters here yesterday because no action had been taken on her complaint against head constable Balraj Singh and constable Tilak Raj who she said had raped her in a Rohtak police station in April.        
	Today, Haryana police chief Ranjiv Dalal described the incident as shameful and a sad day for the force.         
	It is time for the force to repent and do something for the two children, Muskan, 5, and Heena, 3. The additional director-general of police (crime), Sharad Kumar, has been handed the investigation and he will submit his report in 10 days, Dalal said, adding they would request a grant for the family from the state government.        
	A PTI report said Sarita had appeared at an open darbar held by Dalal in Panchkula about a week ago.         
	Today, Dalal said Kumar would look into the delays in the probe that caused Sarita to end her life. Nobody will be spared. It is very sad that bad elements are breeding in the organisation, he said.         
	After a marathon meeting of the police brass at the headquarters, directives were sent to all the districts to run a character check on personnel. We are working out a mechanism to prevent bad characters from entering the force and keeping tabs on the activities of those whose records are not so good, Dalal said.         
	The suicide has caused solid damage to our reputation, the police chief said.         
	Additional director-general of police (law and order) V.B. Singh was the last officer Sarita appealed to.         
	She came to my office at 12.10pm. When I saw her complaint, I realised I had marked an inquiry earlier and told her I will again look into the matter. I was taken aback when she told me she had consumed some tablets to kill herself. I immediately called women police personnel and sent her for a medical check-up. But her condition deteriorated in the civil hospital. She was referred to the PGI in Chandigarh where she unfortunately breathed her last, he said today.         
	Saritas husband Subhash, who had rushed to Chandigarh from Rohtak on hearing the news last evening, said she had not told him she was going to the police headquarters. He alleged that the policemen had connections in the ruling Congress.         
	Balraj and Tilak, accused of raping Sarita after summoning her for a case against Subhash, are missing after they went to Rajasthan to deliver summons in a case.

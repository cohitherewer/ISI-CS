          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 22: Former Orissa Speaker Maheshwar Mohanty today appeared before the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to place his statement before the bench in connection with the sexual harassment charges levelled on him by suspended lady marshal of Orissa Assembly Gayatri Panda.        
	During the interrogation, Mohanty repeated that he was innocent and denied all the allegations.        
	I have said all that I had to and the truth will prevail, said Mohanty while coming out of the commission office.        
	Last month, Gayatri had appeared before the commission after failing to turn up thrice.         
	She had brought sexual harassment charges against the former Speaker and the case is currently being probed by the SHRC. Police and state commission earlier quizzed the former Speaker.         
	After the suspended lady marshal had come up with the sexual harassment allegation against the former Speaker, the latter had to resign, while sports minister Debasish Nayak was dropped from the ministry.         
	Maheswar Mohanty had, however, dismissed all charges against him as baseless and a fallout of a conspiracy against him.

	Chandigarh, April 4: Former Pakistan human rights minister Ansar Burney said today that he would take Sarabjit Singhs case to the UN if the Indian was found innocent of terrorism charges, reports our correspondent.        
	Burney, a member of the UN Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, visited Sarabjits village Bhikiwind near Amritsar and collected evidence that may help prove his innocence.         
	It included the first police complaint filed by Dalbir Kaur stating that her brother Sarabjit had crossed the border in a drunken state in 1990.

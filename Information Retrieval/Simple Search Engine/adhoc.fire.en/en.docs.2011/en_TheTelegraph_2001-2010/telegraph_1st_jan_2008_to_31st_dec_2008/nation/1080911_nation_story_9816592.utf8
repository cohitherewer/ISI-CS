          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Mayavati has told Prakash Karat and N. Chandrababu Naidu they shouldnt hold rallies together until they finalise seat-sharing alliances in states where her Bahujan Samaj Party is eyeing a toehold.        
	She has, however, made it clear the tie-ups will not cover Uttar Pradesh, where her candidates will fight all 80 Lok Sabha seats.        
	A source close to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said she had set the terms when she met the CPM general secretary and the Telugu Desam chief two weeks ago. According to the source, the two leaders were apparently told the cart shouldnt be put before the horse.        
	We should not look like fools who appear on stage, raise hands and shout slogans. Whats the use of these shows if our alliances dont materialise? We will lose credibility before the fight begins, the source, present during the meeting with Karat and Naidu, quoted the Uttar Pradesh chief minister as saying.        
	Like Karat, Mayavati chose not to dub their loose alliance a front.        
	Apart from the northern states, the source said Mayavati was keen to make inroads into the Left bastions of Bengal and Kerala  especially in the latter where she believed Dalits wanted a party of their own. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat are also on her radar.        
	Her logic is simple. She thinks fighting an election is like running a 100-metre race in which the sprinters have a level-playing track to start with. The first past the post is the winner, irrespective of whether he is from a national or a small regional party, the source said.        
	The stands of the CPM and the Desam werent known but observers said given the BSPs hard-as-nails bargaining record, the going wouldnt be easy for them.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati wasnt ready to yield any seat to the Left because she had already picked her candidates. The Congress and the Samajwadi Party are grappling with the effects of the states redrawn political map after the delimitation process. BSP sources said she had analysed the changes threadbare, worked out caste equations and then chosen the nominees.

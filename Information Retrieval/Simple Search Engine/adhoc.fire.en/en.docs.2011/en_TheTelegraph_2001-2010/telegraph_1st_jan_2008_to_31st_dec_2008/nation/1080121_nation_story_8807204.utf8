     RASHEED KIDWAI
               
	Jan. 20: A senior executive of pharmaceutical major Nicholas Piramal went missing while being driven from Gwalior to Indore last night amid suspicion he may have been kidnapped by a highway gang.
    
	The Toyota Corolla carrying Ashwani Kumar Bhat, president (manufacturing) of Nicholas Piramal India Limited, was found abandoned this afternoon in Rajasthans Dholpur, a two-hour drive from Gwalior.
    
	Its rear windshield was smashed and there were bloodstains on the backseat.
    
	The cellphones of both Bhat and his driver, the cars only occupants, were switched off, police said.
    
	Bhat had been to Gwalior to attend the Madhya Pradesh governments investors meet and was returning home to Indore. Dholpur lies on the 400km route, and in the Gwalior-Shivpuri belt where many kidnapper gangs are active.
    
	Indore superintendent of police Anshuman Yadav said no ransom demand had been made till this evening. We are not sure if Bhat has been kidnapped but we are looking for him, he added.
    
	Gwalior SP Vijaykumar Suryawanshi said all police stations on the Gwalior-Indore route had been asked to check if any vehicle had been involved in an accident. Other than the smashed windshield, the Toyota Corolla had suffered no damage, officers said.
    
	The suspected abduction is a blow to the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, which is desperately seeking investments.
    
	To add to Chauhans problems, the incident came on a day the RSS No. 3, Suresh Soni, arrived in Bhopal to assess the state governments performance.
    
	More bad news came later in the day. In the communally sensitive town of Bhadnawar in Dhar district and in Ratlam, Muslims observing Muharram clashed with Hindus resulting in two deaths, arson and looting. The Bhadnawar clash took place between Sangh and Muslim processionists, with the local police blaming both groups.
    
	BJP sources said Soni, a vital link between the Sangh and the partys central leadership, might take a dim view of Chauhans grip over the administration. The chief minister is beleaguered by corruption charges against close relatives, and a party lobby has been asking for him to be replaced ahead of this years Assembly polls.
    
	Bhats family had informed the police when he failed to arrive this morning and calls to his and his drivers cellphones were met with the switched off message.
    
	In the afternoon, we got information that a vehicle matching the registration number of Bhats car had been found abandoned at Dholpur, the Gwalior SP said.
    
	We are taking all steps and working in all directions to trace Bhat, Piramal group chairman Ajay Piramal said.
    
	Bhat was in charge of the companys plant operations in India. Nicholas Piramal also has operations abroad, including Britain and Canada.

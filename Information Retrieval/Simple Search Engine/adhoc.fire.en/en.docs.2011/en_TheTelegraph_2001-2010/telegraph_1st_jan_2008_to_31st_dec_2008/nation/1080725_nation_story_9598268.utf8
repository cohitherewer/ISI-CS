          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 24: A group of women entered the chamber of a senior Orissa Administrative Service officer in Nayagarh today and painted his feet with alta and made him wear bangles after he refused to sanction the women a loan.         
	Saroj Moharana, the district welfare officer, was in his office when a group comprising sanitation staff entered his cabin this afternoon. The group was there to discuss a loan, supposed to be made available by the officer.         
	Moharana, however, refused explaining official restrictions.         
	The enraged women then reportedly abused Moharana and forcibly made him wear the bangles they had carried along. They said they would not leave without the cheque. The staff then made me wear bangles and painted my feet with alta. It was humiliating, said Moharana, who immediately lodged an FIR with the Nayagarh police.         
	The womens body, too, lodged a counter case against Moharana alleging misbehaviour.         
	The women panicked and ran out of the room because the officer misbehaved with them. He used abusive language. A person like him should never be forgiven, said Kamlini Patsani, a staff.        
	Patsani, however, denied that they had made Moharana wear bangles and alta.         
	Every year we receive a loan, but this time the officer told us that loans were available for a particular caste. That is why we revolted, she said The incident has been criticised in all quarters, including other civil officers.

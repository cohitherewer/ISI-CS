  - Suspect in MLA killing bludgeoned to death, Desam points finger at Congress          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                    
	Hyderabad, Nov. 9: The prime accused in a Telugu Desam MLAs murder was killed allegedly in a jail brawl today, weeks after he agreed to turn approver in the CBI case and raised the possibility of implicating politicians.        
	The Desam alleged that Julakanti Srinivas alias Moddu Seenu was bumped off in the Anantpur sub-jail because he would have named senior Congress leaders in the murder of MLA Paritala Ravindra.        
	However, in the evening, the alleged killer of Seenu claimed that a former Desam MP had offered help to make his wife a councillor  a charge debunked by the Opposition party.        
	MLA Ravindra was killed along with five others near a party office in Anantpur town on January 24, 2005.        
	Seenu had owned up to the assassination in a dramatic TV appearance, saying he had acted at the behest of Congress leader M. Suryanarayana Reddy. Suryanarayana is now lodged in the same jail after being convicted of a murder attempt on Ravindra in 1997.        
	Ravindras widow Sunita, a Desam MLA, accused chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy of being behind Seenus killing, a charge echoed by Seenus wife Rajya Lakshmi.         
	He (Seenu) could have spilled the beans on the opponents of the dead legislator who are in prominent positions in the Congress, a Desam leader said.        
	Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu demanded a judicial probe.        
	Seenus murder shows even an undertrial in a CBI case isnt safe in the jails of Andhra, he said, adding that the chief minister and the home minister should resign.        
	Chief minister Reddy denied the allegations, saying a probe would bring out the truth. We will get an inquiry conducted into Seenus murder and bring the guilty to book, he said.        
	Later, home minister Jana Reddy asked state police chief S.S.P. Yadav to conduct the probe.        
	Jail officials said undertrial Om Prakash smashed Seenus head with dumb-bells this morning. Om Prakash hit Seenu on the head with dumb-bells, killing him on the spot, an official said.        
	 Om Prakash claimed that the former Desam MP had offered to help his wife become a councillor in Madanapalli, near Anantpur. She had contested but lost the polls in November 2005.        
	Desam spokesperson M.V. Mysoora Reddy trashed the allegation tonight, saying his party had never made Om Prakash or anyone from his family any such offer.        
	A Desam team visiting the prison this evening said the post-mortem on Seenus body had been done in haste and in violation of procedures. The team included former home minister K. Shiva Prasad Rao and a former IPS officer.        
	Ravindra had first had a bomb thrown at him before he was gunned down as he emerged from a party office.        
	Earlier, the Penukonda legislator had allegedly sent a radio bomb that killed Suryanarayanas family members. Suryanarayana sought revenge by mounting an abortive car bomb attack on Ravindra on the set of a film in 1997. The blast killed 25 people.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Shakeel Khan laughed when reminded of the December 2000 police shootout near his engineering class that left an alleged terrorist dead and brought the Jamia Milia Islamia university to the front pages of most newspapers.        
	It seems quite long back now. We have all moved on. But it wasnt funny at the time. And it cant be easy for anyone at Jamia today, he said.        
	Promptly after the encounter, the police had declared that at least one of the accused terrorists was planning to seek admission to Jamia, Khan recalled.        
	Eight years on, Khan is now a successful software engineer with a Bangalore-based firm, but the university is fighting an unsubstantiated stain of terror links yet again.        
	On Friday, after shooting dead two alleged militants in Jamianagar, Delhi police declared before television channels that the men killed were students of the university.        
	Within hours, some officials conceded that the Jamia identity cards found on the men might have been forged.        
	A search by Jamia officials to trace any record of any Atif or Sajid  the two men killed yesterday  drew a blank.         
	The universitys vice-chancellor also said they were not Jamia students.         
	But the initial remarks by police officials have deepened an existing fear: repeated connections with terror could hurt the universitys reputation.         
	Today, Jamia issued a short, formal press release by an email titled disinformation campaign.         
	Vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan, the statement said, wishes to make it clear that the Jamia students are not involved in the unfortunate encounter yesterday. The incident occurred not on our campus but in one of the neighbouring localities.         
	Yesterday, Hasan had told The Telegraph: The police have not even once cross-checked with me (before announcing that the killed men are from Jamia). I categorically deny any link between the dead men and Jamia.         
	Khan was an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at Jamia in December 2000 when Delhi police, in an encounter near the university, killed a man they claimed was behind the attack on the Red Fort days earlier. Two others accused of involvement in that attack were arrested.         
	At that time, too, Jamia was unfortunately dragged into the controversy. These incidents tarnish the image of the university. The police should verify before making claims, Nisar-ul Haq, of the faculty of social sciences, said.         
	Some faculty members said the repeated mention of Jamia after such incidents could be because of its proximity to localities such as Batla House and Jamianagar, where both encounters took place  in 2000 and yesterday.         
	The proximity of the place where the encounter took place, and the fact that we share a name with Jamianagar, could be a reason, said Rumki Basu, the head of the political science department at Jamia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ranbaxy ban raises eyebrows 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ranbaxy ban raises eyebrows 
          K.P.NAYAR                              
	Washington, Sept 17: Six days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrives in the US, a mildly discordant note has been introduced into Indo-US commercial relations with a decision by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the imports of around 30 drugs made by Ranbaxy Laboratories.        
	The FDA said the ban was the result of manufacturing deficiencies at two Ranbaxy plants in India that have been detected by its inspectors.        
	The ban, announced yesterday, raises more questions than it answers and has spawned suspicions that business rivalry, notorious in the global pharmaceuticals industry, may be behind the US action.        
	The FDA is often accused of being in bed with the US pharmaceuticals industry and has been repeatedly exposed for a variety of questionable practices over the years.        
	Suspicions of business rivalry have also been spawned because there have been stories that smack of being industry plants in the US national media recently against importing pharmaceuticals from emerging economies  for that matter even from Canada.        
	Yesterdays ban is curious because even as the FDA banned imports of around 30 Ranbaxy products, its officials stressed that there was absolutely no risk to patients taking those very Ranbaxy medicines that are already in their possession.        
	In fact, FDA officials yesterday urged through the US media that Americans taking Ranbaxy drugs should continue to do so stressing that tests have shown that these imported medicines are not unsafe, not contaminated or below their specified potency.        
	A variety of medicines used for treating diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, allergies and acne as well as antibiotics and antivirals, are on the banned list.        
	The FDA said the ban was the result of its inspections of Ranbaxy plants in Dewas and Paonta Sahib. According to accounts here, the FDA had sent a warning letter two years ago drawing the companys attention to shortcomings at both plants and followed up on that with a second letter.        
	Sources here said a separate investigation by the US justice department is under way to determine whether Ranbaxy submitted fraudulent data to the FDA to get approval for anti-AIDS medicines purchased by the Bush administrations $15 billion Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.        
	The ban and the investigation come at a time when India and the US have been trying to put together plans to tie up in the area of health care and pharmaceuticals.        
	The latest controversy will bring in its wake adverse publicity in a week when the Prime Minister and US President George W. Bush try to push closer business links between their countries.

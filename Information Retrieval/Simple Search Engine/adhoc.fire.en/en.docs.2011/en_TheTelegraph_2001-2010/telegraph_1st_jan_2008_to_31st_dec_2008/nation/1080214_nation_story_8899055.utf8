          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: Police today started probing into the mysterious death of one Debraj Nayak (62), whose body was found in a house yesterday.        
	The police rushed to the house, where Nayak used to live with his widowed daughter-in-law and granddaughter on rent, after receiving a call from Mahtab Nagar on Tuesday morning and found his body lying in one of the rooms. The daughter-in-law and the granddaughter of the deceased were missing.        
	Investigating officer A. Mohanty said Nayaks neighbours first saw the body.         
	The retired engineer was reportedly strangled with a towel. The killers had tied both his hands with a jute rope before strangling him. He had shifted to the rented house with his daughter-in-law Namita (30) and granddaughter Sneha (3) two years ago when his younger son Sashidhar (32) and wife, Barnali (26), shifted to Paradip. Sashidhar worked as a train driver. A portion of the building where the family lived was rented out to a private computer firm.        
	Police suspect that two persons were involved in the murder. While one tied the victims hands, the other tied the towel around Nayaks neck from behind. It seems that the old man was killed in another room, where there is evidence of a struggle, and later the body was dragged to the other room, an officer said. There is probably more to the crime than what meets the eye. The motive is not clear, the official added.        
	The police have ruled out robbery as a motive. The investigating team has launched a search for Namita and her daughter.

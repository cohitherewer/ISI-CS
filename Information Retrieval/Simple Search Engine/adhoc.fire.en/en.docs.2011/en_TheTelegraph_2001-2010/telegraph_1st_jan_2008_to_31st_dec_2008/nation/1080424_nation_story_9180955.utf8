	Hyderabad, April 23: Police put up barricades to stop flow of devotees into a pilgrim centre on the Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu border after a stampede killed five persons at an ashram on Tuesday evening.           
	Over 150 people, including 35 women, were injured in the rush at godman Kalki Bhagawans ashram at Battupalem village in Andhra Pradeshs Chittoor district. The devotees have blamed the organisers for shoddy arrangements.                   
	Bhopal (PTI): The Madhya Pradesh government has decided to provide pension to senior citizens who have been evicted from their homes and are living in old age homes. Old widows who are dependent on others will be considered part of the same category.                  
	Phagwara (PTI): Two acres of wheat were charred in an accidental fire in a Punjab village on Tuesday. The villagers rushed to the site and doused the fire, saving adjoining fields from damage. A spark from an electricity pole had probably started the fire.

	New Delhi (PTI): The populations of three species of vultures have dwindled in India over the past few years because of the presence of poisonous substances in the food chain, the government informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

	 Jammu (PTI): Security forces on Wednesday foiled an infiltration bid and shot a militant dead near the Line of Control in Poonch district.

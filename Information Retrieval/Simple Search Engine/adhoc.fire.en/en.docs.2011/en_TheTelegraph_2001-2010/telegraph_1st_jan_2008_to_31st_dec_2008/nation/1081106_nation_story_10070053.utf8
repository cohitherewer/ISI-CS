	Excerpts from Barack Obamas victory speech                
	If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.         
	Its the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference. Its the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled  Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America.        
	Its been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.         
	Peoples victory        
	Our campaign drew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generations apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organised, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory....        
	Even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime  two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how theyll make the mortgage, or pay their doctors bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.                
	The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America  I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you  we as a people will get there.         
	There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who wont agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government cant solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation the only way its been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years  block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.         
	So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.         
	Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, its that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers  in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.        
	New dawn         
	And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world  our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down  we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security  we support you.        
	And to all those who have wondered if Americas beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.         
	For that is the true genius of America  that America can change.

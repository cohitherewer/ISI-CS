The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protocol first, lady later for babus
                                                                                                            Protocol first, lady later for babus
  - Ball in politicians court on status of visiting French Presidents girlfriend        BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          File picture of Sarkozy and Bruni in Cairo                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Carla Bruni will be hoping her charm works better on Indias politicians than its officialdom if she is eyeing First Lady status during this months visit with her boyfriend, French President Nicholas Sarkozy.        
	The babus of the external affairs ministry, who handle protocol for foreign dignitaries, have given their opinion: no First Lady status for the Italian singer when the couple arrive on January 24.        
	Now the ball is in the politicians court. A decision is likely after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from his China trip on January 16.        
	The bureaucrats said Brunis virtually official status as the French Presidents fiance didnt matter.        
	Sarkozy, 52, today said his relationship with the 40-year-old former model was serious but dodged giving a wedding date, Reuters said. Asked to comment on a newspaper report that the couple could wed on February 9, he said: Its serious. There is a strong chance that youll learn about it when its already happened.        
	We have given our opinion. The French have still not got back to us with what they want, a senior foreign ministry official said.        
	Left to us, we will go by the book and not be willing to give her First Lady status even if the French say so. But if the political bosses agree to it, we will go by it.        
	The bureaucrats, however, would prefer that the politicians stayed away from the matter. They promise to tweak the arrangements in such a manner that neither the French nor the Indian government has reason to feel embarrassed.        
	Even within the laid-down protocol, the possibilities are immense, the official said. We can put her in a room adjoining the French Presidents suite with a connecting door. At banquets, we can juggle the seating arrangements and ensure she is close to Sarkozy.        
	Its only on the dais at Rajpath (during the Republic Day parade where Sarkozy will be the chief guest) that she cannot expect to be treated like a First Lady, the official added.        
	Granting her the status would mean Bruni would share the dais with President Pratibha Patil, her husband Devisingh Ransingh Shekhawat, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his wife Gursharan Kaur, Vice-President Hamid Ansari and his wife Salma.        
	Bruni will then sit in the front row while the three service chiefs will be behind her, in the second row.        
	Protocol personnel say it would be awkward for those in the front row to have Bruni in their midst. Also, in such matters, it is best not to set precedents.        
	Many other countries dont relax protocol for anybody, the bureaucrats insist. An official recalled how Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was denied security when he visited the UK as Vice-President.        
	We were told that in the UK they went by their own risk assessment. They said they saw no threat to him and would not give him any security or escorts, the official said.        
	We told them that when their prince visited India, we gave him a Vice-Presidents status and provided him with security and the other trappings. We were curtly told that these things were not reciprocal.        
	Shekhawat had only his Indian security guarding him during that trip.        
	All other countries are particular about matters of protocol. The French must understand that we have ours and respect it, the official added.

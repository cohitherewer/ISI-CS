          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 20: As chief minister Naveen Patnaik laid emphasis on successful implementation of his Rs 2 per kg rice scheme and transparent public distribution system, district collectors have suggested issuing fresh ration cards to check bogus ration cards and abolition of storage system through agents.        
	Sources said the suggestions were put forth at a district collectors conference convened recently to discuss ways for effective implementation of the subsidised rice scheme.        
	The chief minister made the collectors accountable for the success or failure of the populist scheme announced eyeing the ensuing polls.        
	Collectors apprehended that benefits of the cheap rice scheme would go down the drains as scores of bogus ration cards are in circulation in districts.         
	They, therefore, suggested fresh ration cards to check the fake cards.        
	The chief minister also conceded that instances of BPL cards being kept with dealers had come to the governments notice and directed to stop such practice immediately.         
	Some district heads also suggested paying cash to beneficiaries instead of rice to prevent corruption.         
	Few others suggested that coupons be issued to simplify the procedures for Rs 2 per kg rice scheme.        
	Suggestions were made to stop supply of essential commodities by storage agents to prevent corruption and start direct supply by the state-run Orissa State Civil Supplies Corporation instead.        
	The collectors demanded powers to take disciplinary actions against the erring gram panchayat secretaries and executive officers where PDS materials are distributed through gram panchayats.        
	The heads of the backward districts of Khandhamal and Gajapati requested for inclusion of families living above the poverty line (APL) belonging to the two districts, as in case of undivided Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi (KBK) districts.         
	It was also decided At the collectors meeting that the scheme monitoring system would be strengthened by filling up of vacancies under the food supplies and consumer welfare department.        
	Retail and block level advisory committees would be activated for effective monitoring.        
	More mobile vans would be pressed into service to cater to the inaccessible pockets.        
	Subsidised rice would be distributed on two particular dates the fifth and 20th days of every month.         
	Steps will be taken to ensure that the subsidised rice scheme reaches inaccessible pockets, too. The government has accepted to bear the additional cost of transportation of rice to such areas, said a senior official of the state food supplies and consumer welfare department.

	New Delhi, April 14: Sex and stress hormones of financial traders could explain the behaviour that feeds stock market bubbles and crashes, a new study has indicated.         
	University of Cambridge researchers, who conducted the first study on how the bodys steroid hormones affect financial risk taking, have found that traders who have high testosterone levels in the morning make higher-than-average profits.         
	They also discovered that traders levels of cortisol  a hormone associated with stress  increased with volatility in the market. Their findings will be published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this week.         
	Our work suggests that (trading) decisions may be biased by hormonal factors that have not so far been considered in any detail, said Joe Herbert, a professor of neuroscience at the Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair.         
	Testosterone plays a role in sexual behaviour and competitiveness. Earlier studies have shown that it rises in athletes preparing for competition, rises further in those who win, and falls in losers.         
	Herbert and his co-worker John Coates at the Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, collected saliva samples from 17 male traders on a London trading floor on eight days at 11am and 4pm, measuring their testosterone and cortisol. They also analysed traders profits and losses on each day.         
	Traders with testosterone highs in the mornings had high profits. The researchers believe high testosterone elevates appetite for risk and confidence, and adds to the performance of a trader who had a positive expected return.         
	Coates first began to wonder about traders behaviour on Wall Street during the dotcom bubble of 1999-2000.         
	It wasnt just that they were investing in ventures unlikely to succeed. They seemed almost drunk. It seemed some chemical was involved in this irrational behaviour, Coates said over the phone.         
	When a trader makes money testosterone increases, if this happens to a number of traders at the same time, then we might see synchronised action... and this might exaggerate the upward movement of the market.         
	The researchers said their study had limitations  it sampled hormones for only eight days, was done during a period of low volatility and did not involve women traders.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Orissa High Court: Firm action                                  
	Cuttack, Sept. 7: With the Orissa High Court admitting the state election commissions writ petitions for timely civic elections in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, the government is in the dock for dilly-dallying in issuing final notification for conducting the polls.        
	The case assumes significance as the process for elections to 92 urban local bodies  out of 103 in total  in the state on September 19 had already started and completed the nominations filing stage.         
	The tenure of seven municipalities, including Belpahar, Burla, Balimela, Rerhakhol, Sunabeda, Paradip and Kendrapada, would expire during 2010-11.        
	But the state election commission had not been able to issue notification for elections for Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) though the terms of their present councils expire on September 29 and 30, respectively.        
	The commission has sought judicial intervention for timely elections for constitution of new councils of CMC and BMC.         
	The state government was not providing the necessary support and assistance by deliberately delaying completion of process of delimitation of wards and reservation of seats in both the municipal corporations, the commissions petition alleged.        
	Acting on it, the two-judge bench of Justices I.M. Quddusi and B.P. Ray on Friday granted the government time till September 8 to clarify its position. The court fixed the next day (September 9) for hearing the case.        
	The commission further directed the government to either issue final notification for conducting elections in CMC and BMC or alternatively allows the commission to conduct the elections on the basis of existing electoral rolls and reservation of seats. Article 243-U of the Constitution provides that elected bodies should be ready with fresh elections before the expiry of the term of the existing council, said commissions counsel Pitambar Acharya.

  - Dance performances set to wow crowds          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          In the spotlight: City organisation to push Odissi to the forefront                                        
	Cuttack, Dec. 21: While the Orissa government and gurus of Odissi music are still deliberating on ways to promote and popularise the form to reach classical status, Odishi Nrutya Mandal has chosen a novel method to give fresh impetus to the demand.        
	Odishi Nrutya Mandal, Cuttack, has invited Odissi vocal artistes to perform on stage  for the first time since the Barabati Nrutyutsav began in 2001  every evening from tomorrow.        
	Well-known Odissi vocal exponents Ramhari Das, Sangeeta Gosain, Soumya Priyadarshini and Sarmista Mohanty, Shyamamani Devi and Guru Pachimeswar Jena will perform for the next five evenings.        
	Our basic aim is to present the uniqueness and wholesomeness of Odissi vocal as an independent system in the domain of Indian classical music, mandal general secretary Ashish Kumar Das told The Telegraph.        
	Odissi vocal, like Odissi dance, is not only very ancient but has an uniqueness of its own and all the characteristics for being revered as a classical form.        
	The weeklong national festival of dance and music being organised in collaboration with the state tourism department and the Cuttack district administration this year began at the Killa Maidan here yesterday evening.        
	India Post released an envelope with special cancellation on the occasion, while an Odissi dance ballet by Odishi Nrutya Mandal and Chhau dance by Mayur Art Centre from Bhubaneswar amazed the crowd. A charismatic performance by Mamata Shankars dance group from Calcutta kept the audience glued to their seats on the wintry Sunday evening.        
	Lined up for tomorrow is a kathak dance by Upasana ballet troupe of Bengal, a ballet by Calcutta-based Sinjini Dance Academy, sattriya dance by Annesa Mahanta of Assam, bharat natyam by Ambali Praharaj group and a performance by Nupur Dance troupe from Calcutta. Altogether 13 dance troupes are participating in the festival this year.        
	Stalls have been set up by the state handloom and textiles department, Orissa rural development and marketing society, Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology and Jute Corporation of India.         
	The postal department is organising Uniculturepex-2008, a philatelic exhibition on all dance and music forms of the world during the festival.

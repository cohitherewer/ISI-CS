          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 12: Puri police today detained an army brigadier from Haryana and his security guard for allegedly violating a Jagannath temple tradition that bars non-Hindus from entering the temple premises.        
	Brigadier Vedprakash, with his non-Hindu guard M.S. Ratif, entered the shrine and had almost reached the sanctum sanctorum, when the priests intervened.        
	They took the duo to the town police station. Though no case has been registered, the temple administration performed a purification ritual. There was mild tension on the temple campus after the brigadier apologised.         
	I apologise before the lord, as well as before the authorities, he said.         
	He added that the temple guards, too, had not prevented him from entering the premises.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Jan. 23: A team of veterinary doctors from Orissa left for Bengal today to assist officials there to check bird flu, spreading in the neighbouring state. 
    
	We have sent a team of 10 for now. More teams would follow after we receive a feedback from the Bengal officials vis--vis requirement, said the state animal husbandry and veterinary services director Bishnupada Sethi while talking to The Telegraph today. 
    
	For now, Orissa has decided to send 20 veterinary doctors, in two phases, to assist Bengal officials till the flu is contained. 
    
	Meanwhile, in view of the situation, the government has initiated preventive measures against possible spread of the flu through clandestine transportation of poultry across the border. There is no cause for concern as of now, as no cases of avian influenza has been reported. But, preventive measures are being taken, assured the director of animal husbandry and veterinary services. 
    
	Sethi said police officials and revenue officials have been alerted to keep watch on unscrupulous traders in Bengal trying to pass on infected birds. Steps are being taken at village level, especially in areas bordering Bengal, to check the influx of birds, he added. 
    
	Wildlife officers are keeping a close watch over Chilika lake, Bhitarkanika Sanctuary and Nandan Kanan National Park where millions of migratory birds throng during the winter. This winter over 9-lakh migratory birds (approximately) have reportedly visited Chilika.
    
	Bird flu is suspected to have spread to Bihars Katihar district, from Bengals Malda, in six panchayats under Azamnagar. A team of 150 doctors have been sent to the site from Patna. 
    
	Confirming the news, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi who also holds the animal husbandry portfolio, said the suspected villages are Devgaon, Nikal, Kharsauta, Pipapatti, Amraripur, Gaighatta.

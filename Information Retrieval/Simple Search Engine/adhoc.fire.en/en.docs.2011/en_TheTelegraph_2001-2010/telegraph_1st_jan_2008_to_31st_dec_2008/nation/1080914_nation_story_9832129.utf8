	New Delhi, Sept. 13: A former head of the countrys premier investigative agency pointed his finger at local help behind todays blasts amid fresh calls to revive a tough law to curb the terror that had reached our bones.        
	Joginder Singh, who once headed the CBI, said blasts like the ones in the capital could never have happened without local intelligence.        
	More than one recce of each of these places was done. To strike such important places, it is inevitable that a lot of planning went into it. They would have had more than one team working on making these blasts a success, he said.        
	The former CBI chief also blamed total failure of intelligence for the explosions.        
	Former Maharashtra police chief Arvind Inamdar said the explosions had taken place despite investigations in Rajasthan and Gujarat, states where terrorists had struck earlier this year.         
	It indicates that terror has reached deeper right down to our bone and is eating at our marrow. All political parties should (now) forget their political differences and support not only the revival of a stringent (anti-terror) law like Pota, but create a federal agency to tackle terror.        
	Security experts in Mumbai agreed that crowded places were prime locations for triggering blasts.        
	Colonel M.P. Choudhary, a Mumbai-based security expert who trained commando squads of the city police, pointed to common observations about the blasts in Jaipur, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi.        
	First, all of them targeted crowded areas to maximise damage even with low-intensity explosives. Second, the increasing use of objects like bicycles, lunchboxes, garbage bins and stolen cars for placing the explosives. The third factor is the use of easily available, low-intensity explosives.

	New Delhi, May 29: When Rajasthan went up in flames after the Gujjar protests were put down by police a year ago, the Congresss response was  first cremate the dead honourably, compensate their families and book the guilty.         
	The core demand for Scheduled Tribe status was brushed aside as a larger issue, as a thing of the future.         
	Over the past week, as the events of May 2007 were replayed and the capitals borders came under siege from Gujjar protesters, the Congresss reaction seemed frozen in time.         
	We condole the deaths of the people. The larger question is complex. The immediate concern is to restore law and order and end the constitutional anarchy. If the Rajasthan government had promised ST status to the Gujjars, its savvy lies in the ability to handle the issue, party spokesperson Manish Tewari said.        
	Congress sources conceded that with the larger political implications of the Gujjars demand, they could not come up with a pat statement.         
	If the party is seen as siding with the Gujjars, it will risk antagonising the two dominant communities, the Jats and the Meenas  a suicidal situation to have in an election year.        
	Polls in Rajasthan are due in November and, as in Karnataka, the Congress will start with the handicaps of not having a clear chief ministerial candidate, no committed vote base and an overdose of ageing leaders at each others throat.        
	The partys best-known Gujjar face, Sachin Pilot, was cautious. It isnt a question of one caste or reservation. Its a human rights issue. People were killed in cold blood in 2007. No lessons were learnt. The entire episode is repeating itself with greater ferocity, he said.        
	Pilots constituency, Dausa, is the epicentre of the protests and killings. He could enter the place only a couple of times, advised by the district administration to stay away because of fears that his presence would spark a serious law and order problem.         
	I have heard of the living being punished, but in Rajasthan dead bodies are being punished, he said.        
	Justifying the Centres refusal to get involved in the demand for ST status, Pilot said Delhi could intervene only after the state clarified its position and declared whether it would give the Gujjars tribal status.        
	If a responsible party makes a promise and doesnt redeem it, people are bound to react, he said, referring to the BJPs pre-election pledge to grant Gujjars the status.        
	Congress leaders are watching how Vasundhara Raje Scindias divisive politics plays out. They believe she pitted the Gujjars against the Meenas last summer and against the Lodh-Rajputs this time round.

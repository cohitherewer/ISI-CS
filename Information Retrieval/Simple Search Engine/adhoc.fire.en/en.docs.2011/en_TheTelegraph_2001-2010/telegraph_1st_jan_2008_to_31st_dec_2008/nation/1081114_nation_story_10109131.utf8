          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Gandhi: Going by custom                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gand- his request for three names to pick his press secretary is a convention and not a rule that had been in vogue when Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Jyoti Basu were chief ministers, senior officers have said.        
	The convention means it may be difficult for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to turn down Gandhis request, though on paper the government has the final word on the appointment, the bureaucrats said.        
	Its true the government has the final word. But going by convention, it can be expected that the dignity of the governors post would be considered. Governors have asked for names or recommended them to the government for appointment as their secretary when Siddhartha Ray and Jyotibabu were chief ministers, an official said.        
	The governors move had raised eyebrows at Writers Buildings yesterday, with information secretary Dilip Chakrabarty saying he couldnt recall an earlier instance of any governor asking for a panel of names.         
	Gandhis suggestion followed the appointment of Apurba Chatterjee as his new press secretary, replacing Dhruba Basu.        
	Retired IAS officer Dipak Rudra, secretary to then governor Tribhuvan Narayan Singh, recalls that when he was leaving in 1980, he was asked by Singh to suggest two officers, one of whom could replace him. The Jyoti Basu government had agreed and Rudra suggested IAS officers Jayanta Sanyal and L.R.K. Prasad.        
	He selected the latter. There is nothing unusual with this practice, Rudra said.        
	A Raj Bhavan official recalled that former information secretary Dipak Ghosh had been selected by governor A.L. Dias as his secretary in 1974.         
	But Ray overruled the move. Siddhartha Ray had a long association with Dias and used to call him Tony. Dias accepted his friends rejection and there were no hard feelings, the official said.         
	Now, 34 years later, Ghosh agrees his was a different case. In this (my) case, the chief minister prevailed but the governors dignity was maintained because of the close relations between the two. I believe it is essential Gandhis dignity be maintained.        
	Retired IAS officer D. Bandopadhyay said: If a minister can select his department secretary, why not the governor? However, the government takes the final decision.

  - New options for secondary examinees        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Cuttack, March 5: The Board of Secondary Education (BSE) in the state has decided to seek special police protection against Naxalites during the 2008 high school certificate examination.         
	We will request the director-general of police (DGP) to make special security arrangements at the centres in the Naxalite-affected areas to ensure that the examination process is not disrupted midway, senior BSE officials said.        
	Nearly 3.75 lakh candidates are expected to appear in the examination. The BSE has declared 2,024 high schools as examination centres, of which nearly 200 are reportedly located in Naxalite-affected areas of the state.        
	From this year, students will appear in HSC examination under a new syllabus. The examinees will have two optional papers in addition to the three language papers, mathematics, science and social science. For those appearing in the 2008 HSC exams, scheduled from March 26 till April 5, BSE has increased the aggregate marks from 750 to 800.         
	Optional papers, withdrawn more than a decade ago, have been reintroduced under the new syllabus. Some of the optional papers unlike in the past have practical tests, said P.K. Samal, the BSE secretary.        
	Previously, students were permitted to write one optional paper selected from a limited range of subjects like mathematics, Sanskrit and physiology amp; hygiene. But for those appearing for the exam from this year, two optional subjects have been made mandatory.        
	Under the new curriculum, the students were given a wide range of subjects to opt for.         
	For the optional paper I they could select a subject from mathematics, agriculture, dairy amp; pisciculture and higher language (English/Oriya or Hindi/Sanskrit/Urdu). For the optional paper II they had to pick from science or computer education, environment amp; population education and basic commerce amp; home management.        
	Last year BSE had increased the duration of each test by 10 minutes from the earlier two-and-a-half hours. But no student was allowed to write anything during the first 10 minutes.         
	BSE officials said the additional time was aimed to help the students give more time in understanding the question paper and reduce stress to a considerable extent.

	Monroe, Georgia, Nov. 26 (Agencies): The Indian-origin man who shot his wife in a New Jersey church has said he would have killed everyone in sight if he had a machine gun, a prosecutor said.        
	In a video-taped confession, 27-year-old Joseph Pallipurath admitted to the shooting that killed Reshma James in St Thomas Syrian Orthodox Knanaya Church in New Jersey on November 23.        
	Assistant district attorney Eric Crawford said: He was very emotional and very animated.... during the course of the interview. The impression I got was he was waiting to talk to somebody and tell his side of the story.        
	Joseph, arrested on Monday, said he believed church members were blocking him from contacting his estranged wife. But he did not apologise or express remorse.        
	During a court appearance on Tuesday, he answered only in yes or no when asked about his charges and extradition process. He, however, agreed to return to New Jersey despite having no attorney.        
	Police have found his Jeep in a public lot several blocks from the church, detective Robert Rowan said. Inside it was a revolver believed to have been used in the shootings and an automatic handgun with many clips of ammunition.        
	I thought its lucky that we didnt have a mass murder on our hands, Rowan said.        
	Parish priest Rev. Thomas Abraham said: It (his arrest) is a big relief because of the fear factor. If he was still in the area, you never know if he might have come back.

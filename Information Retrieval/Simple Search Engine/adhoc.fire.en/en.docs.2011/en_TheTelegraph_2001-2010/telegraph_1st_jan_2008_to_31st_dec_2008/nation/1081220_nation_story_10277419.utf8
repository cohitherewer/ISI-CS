                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bill a friend but no dollars to donate: Amar 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Amar Singh today said he did not have the amount listed against his name on a list of donors made public by Bill Clintons foundation yesterday.        
	 I do not have the amount mentioned to donate, he said, a day after the veil was lifted on 200,000 donors to the Clinton Foundation. On the list, one of the names in the donation band of $1 million to $5 million is Amar Singh.        
	The Samajwadi Party leader, however, did not make any secret of his friendship with the Clintons. I do not have to comment anything on speculative stories. People know we have close relations with Bill and Hillary Clinton, he said in a statement to PTI.         
	The Samajwadi leader was initially reluctant to discuss the matter. A secretary, who spoke on his behalf today, said: He is unwilling to speak on the subject. Later in the evening, following several calls, his office informed that the leader was out of Delhi.         
	The Samajwadi Party has already distanced itself from Amars reported donation. Mohan Singh, Samajwadi veteran and Lok Sabha MP from Deoria, said it was for Amar to answer the questions. The party has not donated any such money, he said.        
	The bonhomie the party had with Bill Clinton in 2005, however, is not forgotten. The former US President had dinner with Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav at his residence in September that year. Three years later, again in September, Amar called on Hillary Clinton. The Democrats later supported the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The BJP today demanded a clarification on whether RBI clearance was granted for the donation and wanted to know the source of the money. The country is entitled to know if the RBI clearance was taken before making the donation, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	Prasad said since the payment made by Amar was in American dollars and was a substantial amount, RBI clearance should have been sought.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Dalbir Kaur                                  
	Chandigarh, May 5: Dalbir Kaur, who is fighting for the release of her brother Sarabjit Singh on death row in Lahore, wants to take up the case of Pakistani prisoners in India.        
	Most of the Pakistani prisoners in India have passports. I would want the government to look into their cases again and those not involved in heinous crimes should be released, said Dalbir, who had gone to Pakistan to meet her brother.        
	When in Lahore, Dalbir had met relatives of Pakistanis languishing in Indian prisons. I have letters from their relatives and would like the government to give me permission to visit them in jail here, Dalbir said. She added that she had requested Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi to help arrange visits for her to some jails so she could pass on the letters to the Pakistani inmates.        
	She said some Pakistanis had been behind bars in India for over two decades. Her own brother has been in the Lahore prison for over 17 years.        
	It should also be made mandatory to provide proper legal help (to prisoners) in both countries, Dalbir said. She said she felt the pain of the relatives in Pakistan who had their kin in Indian prisons and the time had come for both nations to shed their differences. Pakistanis and Indians languishing in each others jails should be released without any conditions, she said.        
	Sarabjit, whom Pakistan calls Manjit Singh, was sentenced to hang on charges of espionage and bombings in several Pakistani cities. Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had initially rejected his mercy petition on March 15, after which a death warrant was issued so he could be hanged at his jail in Lahore on April 1.        
	But the hanging was stayed after the Indian government sought clemency for him.        
	Dalbir today thanked former Pakistan human rights minister Ansar Burney for taking up Sarabjits case.        
	From Karachi, Burney said over phone that the Pakistan government is looking to turn all death sentences in the country to life term. The announcement is expected to come in a few weeks or even days.         
	 Burney had presented a summary to Musharraf seeking an end to the death sentence.         
	There are over 8,000 prisoners in Pakistan on the death row. Sixty per cent of those facing death sentence are innocent, Burney said.        
	He said that 29 of the 49 Pakistanis languishing in jails in Indias Punjab would be released, adding that his country was also looking to release Indian prisoners.

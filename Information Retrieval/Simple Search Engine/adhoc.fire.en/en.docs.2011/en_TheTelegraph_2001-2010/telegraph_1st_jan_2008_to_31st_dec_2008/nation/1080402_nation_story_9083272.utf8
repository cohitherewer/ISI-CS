	Bhubaneswar, April 1: Marathons, meetings, rallies and programmes marked Utkal Divas, the foundation day of the province of Orissa.         
	A separate province of Orissa was carved out on April 1 in 1936, following series of movements carried out by Utkal Sammilani, a group founded by Gopabandhu Das and Madhusudan Das.         
	On the occasion today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan and ministers reaffirmed his governments pledge to strive and make Orissa the premier state in the country. The chief minister made use of the occasion to remind the public of the schemes launched by his government out of its own resources.        
	The ministers speeches were followed by rhythmic beats of the drums and energetic dance performances including the traditional Dhumpa, Dalkhai, Chutkuchuta and Ranapa forms performed by cultural troupes. Then, artistes of Odissi Research Centre took over with patriotic songs.         
	The states capital was awash with colours today while important buildings, including the Assembly and the secretariat, were illuminated with colourful lights.         
	Earlier in the afternoon, a photo exhibition on the history of Orissa and the lives of the great sons of the state was thrown open for the public. In the morning, a procession, led by MP and noted poet Prasanna Patsani, was taken out by college students. As they walked, the roads echoed Bande Utkal Janani  as the students sand and walked through the capitals roads.         
	Other educational, social and cultural organisations also held marches, blood-donation camps, competitions and cultural programmes in parts of the city throughout the day.         
	Where most organisations treated the day as a celebration, Opposition parties observed it, as a day to protest against the failures and misdeeds of the Naveen Patnaik government.         
	Orissa Lok Dal activists staged a demonstration near the chief ministers residence, while Samajvadi Party held a fast. CPI activists took out a protest rally and staged a demonstration.         
	CPI(ML)-Liberation activists observed the day as a Save Orissa Day and took out a rally.         
	In Cuttack, Balasore, Sambalpur, Rourkela and Berhampur, rallies and meetings were also held and tributes were offered to stalwarts Madhusudan Das and Gopabandhu Das, who significantly contributed to the formation of a separate Orissa.

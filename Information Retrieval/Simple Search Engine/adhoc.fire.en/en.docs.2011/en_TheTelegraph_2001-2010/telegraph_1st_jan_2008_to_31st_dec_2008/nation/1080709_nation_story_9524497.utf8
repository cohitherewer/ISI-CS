          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shimla, July 8: The Kalka-Shimla toy train narrow-gauge track has chugged to the Unesco world heritage list.        
	The recognition follows the visit of a two-member team from the UN body to Himachal Pradesh last September. In its report, the team had dubbed the route an engineering marvel of the British era that is still alive with its old charm.         
	The Centre had declared the track a heritage site in July 2000, when Mamata Banerjee was railway minister. But the Unesco honour is expected to bring greater grandeur to the 104-year-old route.        
	The 96km track is the fourth Indian Railways site on the Unesco list. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway had achieved that status in 1999, Mumbai VT in 2003 and the Nilgiri Mountain Railway two years later.        
	The Kalka-Shimla track will now get world attention and tourism will improve, said P.J. Singh, a member of the Indian Steam Railway Society.

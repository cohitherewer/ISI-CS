	New Delhi, July 27: Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi today said all issues standing in the way of the $7-billion Iran gas pipeline project had been resolved but counterpart Pranab Mukherjee was more circumspect.        
	Sources said there had been some movement on the commercial aspects of the 2,615-km pipeline that would run through Pakistan, but security and Islamabads commitment on assured supply needed working on.        
	Although Qureshi sounded tentative after talks with Mukherjee and urged India to act quickly at the news meet that followed, he was more positive after meeting petroleum minister Murli Deora.        
	I am happy to report that as far as Pakistan and India are concerned, we have resolved all bilateral issues. There is no issue whatsoever that needs to be addressed now, Qureshi said.        
	Earlier, Mukherjee merely said India was hopeful all issues would be resolved. We have discussed the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline during my visit and during this visit.        
	We are hopeful that it would be possible to resolve this issue both on technical, commercial and all other aspects so that it contributes substantially to resolve the problem arising out of the high energy prices all over the world.        
	Qureshi said Pakistan was keen to move ahead and I would want to seek his input whether India is ready to fully engage with us or it would like to spend some more time thinking about it.        
	India had skipped the pipeline talks since August 2007 over the transit fees demanded by Pakistan for passage of gas through its territory.        
	But differences narrowed at a meeting of oil ministers in Islamabad in April. The oil secretaries of the two countries will meet in Madrid, as early as July 1, to evolve a strategy to deal with Irans insistence on a price revision clause in rates already agreed on by the three nations.

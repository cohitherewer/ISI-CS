	Srinagar, Dec. 23: Fear of Srinagar exploding into anti-election protests a day before the final phase of polling forced authorities to clamp an undeclared curfew on the city, barricading its localities and deploying thousands of uniformed men to maintain calm.         
	Eight constituencies in Srinagar, a long-tested stronghold of separatists, and 13 in Jammu will vote tomorrow. Srinagar is the only hope for separatists after voters across the state defied their boycott call and turned out in large numbers in the first six phases of polling. The city has always boycotted elections since militancy started in 1989. In 2002, the turnout was five per cent.

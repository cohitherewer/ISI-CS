The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Way to superfast bucks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Way to superfast bucks
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Lalu Prasad flags off a train at Sealdah. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 2: Deal or no deal, Lalu Prasad is not taking any chances and has hit the superfast track.        
	The railway minister has speeded up as many as 242 trains from July 1, a move officials said would fetch the railways an additional revenue of Rs 450 crore.        
	A superfast tag on a train means the railways can levy an additional surcharge of Rs 10 to Rs 50 on a ticket, depending on the distance and the class a passenger is booked in. On an average, the surcharge amounts to Rs 2 crore per train.        
	Lalu Prasad claims he is looking forward to presenting the railway budget next year, too, and has been announcing earnings of Rs 1 lakh crore. He is hoping the railways would at least help him get Bihar back, if nothing else, said a railway official.        
	At a railway event in Patna today, Lalu Prasad promised one railway job in each lane with projects now going on in the state and added that Biharis wouldnt have to go outside in search of jobs.        
	In India, for a train to be declared superfast, its average speed has to be 55kmph. For trains running on metre gauge, even a speed of 45kmph qualifies it to be a superfast.        
	Among the fastest trains on Indian Railways is the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani, which averages about 78-80kmph.        
	The railways have announced that the travel time of the train would be reduced by 45 minutes. The train will reach faster because speed restrictions on the route have been removed. In the Mumbai division, there were some bridges that needed to be replaced and repaired. Now that the work on the bridges is complete, the speed restriction has been lifted, said an official.        
	The railways have also announced that some other Rajdhani trains, like those between New Delhi and Calcutta, would reach 25 minutes ahead of their current schedule.        
	The Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani and Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani will reach 25 minutes and 20 minutes earlier, respectively. Here, too, some repair work was going on in the Sealdah division which has been completed, the official added.        
	A railway board official said ever since Lalu Prasad became minister, more and more trains had been included in the superfast list. In several cases, it has been done at the cost of safety. There are certain tracks and routes that cannot take trains running at a speed higher than what they have been doing. But Lalu Prasad has been urging the railways to push the limits to earn extra revenue, the official added.        
	The RJD leader has speeded up more than 400 trains into superfast category since he took over.        
	Officials have, however, been evasive about the revenue from the superfast levy.        
	In reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on the additional revenue generated by trains following their enhanced status, minister of state for railways R. Velu said last August that separate data of additional earnings from the levy of superfast charge are not maintained by the ministry.        
	The railway board official said it was a clever way of earning undue profit through the backdoor without providing any extra facility to passengers.         
	Declaration of an express train as superfast does not increase the operating cost of the railways so as to warrant imposition of an additional levy in the form of supplementary charge, the official added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rafi lives again, in Birmingham
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Rafi lives again, in Birmingham
          AMIT ROY                                     
	Birmingham, July 16: The line  An Evening in Birmingham  wasnt strictly in Hasrat Jaipuris lyrics when he wrote the title song for the 1967 film, An Evening in Paris, but Sonu Niigaam tossed it in, anyway, when he sang a medley of Mohammed Rafis golden oldies in Birmingham last night.         
	Niigaam, who was backed by the 75-strong City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), paid a warm tribute to the British musicians who came on stage in black tie or gowns with their violins and other classical western instruments, as did the almost exclusively and enthusiastic Indian crowd which packed the Symphony Hall, acoustically one of the finest in the world.         
	Niigaam, who arrived in Birmingham from Mumbai with an entourage of 18, sang 18 Rafi songs, starting with Yaad na jaye beete dinon ki, from the 1963 film, Dil Ek Mandir, and ending with An Evening in Paris.         
	The musicians faithfully followed scores written down in western notation by Tim Pottier, a former CBSO librarian who took the idea of this east-west collaboration to Saregama Plc and was recruited to be the arts producer for the three-concert project.         
	Judging from audience reaction, the partnership between Niigaam and the CBSO worked especially well with Aaj mausam bada beimaan hai from Loafer (1973); Baharon phool barsao from Suraj (1966); Kya hua tera vada from Hum Kisise Kum Nahin (1977); and Suhani raat dhal chuki from Dulari (1949) where the music was by Naushad and the lyrics by Shakeel Badayani.         
	For some songs, the orchestra momentarily forgot western restraint and appeared to be carried away by the joie de vivre of Hindi movies. One such occasion was for Tum jo mil gaye ho from Hanste Zakhm (1973), with music by Madan Mohan and lyrics by Kaifi Azmi.         
	Niigaam, whose white suit worn for the first half (he changed into a long gold coat for the second) contrasted with the traditional black garments of the orchestra, stopped at one point to say that since it was now more usual for him to have his recordings perfected electronically, I wish I was backed every time by the CBSO.         
	Although this was perhaps an example of Indian politeness, the CBSOs conductor, Michael Seale, appreciated the remark and several times reached over and thanked Niigaam.         
	This is a great collaboration between two cultures and two musics, enthused Niigaam, who began what was an historic and extremely challenging occasion for all concerned with a minutes silence in memory of Rafi, whose 28th death anniversary, he reminded the audience, falls on July 31.         
	The opening concert in Birmingham last night is to be followed by a second in the Manchester Apollo tomorrow and a grand finale at the London Coliseum on July 20.         
	The brochure for the concert produced by Saregama, the successor to HMV, gives a short history of the Gramophone Company of India. The beginning of recording industry in India started in July 1901 in Calcutta, the then capital city of India.         
	It adds: The first Recording Factory was started in 1907 in Beliaghata, Calcutta. It is interesting to note that the Calcutta factory is the first record factory outside the UK. The plant in Beliaghata in addition to pressing records assembles Gramophone with imported parts.         
	With the introduction of Gramophone and increasing demand for records, there was a need for larger premises and a suitable land was located at Dum Dum. The entire operation was shifted to the new location at Dum Dum in 1928. We are operating from the same premises today.         
	From Calcutta to Birmingham is a big cultural leap. Sir Edward Elgar, who conducted the CBSOs inaugural concert in 1920, might well have considered Niigaams presence last night as a leap too far but his Britain is not todays Britain when hundreds of Indians could take over the Symphony Hall for one evening.         
	Rafis grandson, Rizwan Rafi, 42, who is born and brought up in England and works in IT for an engineering firm, was present last night.         
	My grandfather, he told The Telegraph today, would have been very pleased. He would have loved to have sung at such a concert with live backing from the orchestra.         
	Pottier, who wrote the notation, believed Elgar would have been proud that the orchestra was serving so many people from their own city. It was an experience the orchestra enjoyed very much. They were energised by the audience clapping and cheering all the way through  something they are not used to. Actually, by now the orchestra know some of the songs pretty well.

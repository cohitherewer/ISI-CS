  - 54-year-old divorcee left penniless by Kashmiri she met in Goa                                       
	June 18: A divorcee who had a holiday romance in Goa with a man 25 years her junior has been left penniless and terrified after being conned out of more than 80,000.         
	Patrina Churm, 55, flew to the beach resort after the break-up of her marriage and the death of her father and fell for a toyboy lover who she first met on a beach holiday 16 years ago selling handicrafts.         
	She sold up her life in England and set up a home with him in Kashmir, but says he emptied her bank account, leaving her just 2.17, and then abandoned her for a local girl.         
	Mukhtar Ahmad Guroo was arrested after Churm contacted police, but she said she now fears for her life after his family allegedly threatened to have her killed if she did not drop a court case against him.         
	The divorcee from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, is the latest in a series of British women falling victim to young foreign men who prey on them in holiday destinations around the world.         
	Last month, in an identical case, Sarah Matheson, a divorced 54-year-old IT systems analyst, revealed she was conned out of 80,000 by a Kashmiri man she also met on a beach in Goa.         
	Churm said she had known Guroo, 30, since the early 1990s, when she first began visiting Goa. She said she fell in love with him during a 2004 holiday romance when he pulled out all the stops.         
	Im too bloody nave, she told The Daily Telegraph. My father had died, my marriage had broken up and I believed him and trusted him. It was a beach romance.         
	The couple bought a beautiful country house close to Srinagar, where they settled down together. He told her it had to be registered in his name, because foreigners are not allowed to own property there.         
	But late last year she said she discovered he had secretly siphoned off thousands of pounds from her British bank accounts using her cashcard and took more than 10,000 in cash which she had taken to India to buy a flat in Goa.         
	When she confronted him, he gave her a cheque, which bounced, and then a neighbour revealed that he had duped her and planned to marry a local girl later this year.         
	An investigating officer said Guroo then threw her out of their home after he had used all her money.         
	Im looking over my shoulder the whole time, Churm said. In India life is so cheap. His family are militants and for 125 you can have someone killed. Over a period of 12 to 14 months, he emptied out my bank accounts. There was 83,000 and now there is 2.17 in my account. He has bought enough land to build a house on, and I have nothing.         
	She added: I have no property in Britain or India, Im penniless and terrified.         
	Im depending on the goodwill of neighbours in Kashmir. Im living in their house, theyre feeding me, giving me clothes to wear and putting their lives in danger by helping me.         
	Guroo was arrested after his British lover complained to the human rights commission, which then alerted the police. He is charged with cheating, preparing fake documents, and conspiracy to cheat Churm out of money.

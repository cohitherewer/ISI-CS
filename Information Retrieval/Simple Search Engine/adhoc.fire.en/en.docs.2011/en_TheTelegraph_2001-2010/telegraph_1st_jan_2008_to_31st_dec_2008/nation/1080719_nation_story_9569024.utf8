	Bhubaneswar, July 18: Actress Anu Choudhary and husband Sandeep Mishra today appeared in the court of district sessions judge in Khurda for the hearing of their divorce petition.        
	On January 15, 2008, the couple had submitted a mutual divorce petition on grounds of difference of opinion and temperament between them. Both sides today presented their evidence.         
	The case of divorce will come up for hearing again next Friday.         
	The marriage of the duo, solemnised on March 12, 2006, apparently ran into trouble within a few months.

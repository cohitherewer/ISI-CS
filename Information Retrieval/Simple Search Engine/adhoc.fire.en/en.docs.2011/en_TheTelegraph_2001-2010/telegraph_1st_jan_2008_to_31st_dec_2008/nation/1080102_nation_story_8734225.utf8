   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI
   
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Union cabinet braved a chilly evening to discuss Nagaland, fuelling speculation that the Centre is veering towards Presidents rule in the state.
 
	A BJP-backed alliance is in power in Nagaland but Congress leaders have been camping in Delhi since last week, claiming that the government had lost its majority.
 
	Ministers who took part in the cabinet meeting said Nagaland was discussed but they refused to either confirm or deny that a decision had been taken to impose central rule.
 
	Rashtrapati Bhavan sources said at 10pm that no such recommendation had been forwarded from the government. However, sometimes when decisions are taken late in the evening, it is not unusual for the government to wait till the next day to formally inform the President.
 
	The issue had come up at an earlier meeting of the cabinet but no decision was taken then.
 
	The Nagaland government headed by Neiphiu Rio had survived a controversial no-confidence motion on December 13. The motion was defeated 23-19 in the 60-member Assembly after the Speaker barred three Independents from voting and declared invalid the votes of nine dissidents in the ruling alliance.
 
	The dissident legislators had sided with the Congress which demanded the immediate dismissal of the government. The BJP opposed the move, alleging that resignations of legislators were being mustered to topple the Rio government.
 
	Congress MLAs from Nagaland had met President Pratibha Patil on December 23 and demanded the dismissal of the Rio government.
 
	Coldest day
 
	The minimum temperature in Delhi today plummeted to 2.6 deg; Celsius, making it the coldest day of the season so far. 
 
	The chilly weather will continue for the next two days, an official of the Delhi Meteorological Department said. The winds sweeping across north India are responsible for the cold. 
 
	The maximum temperature also dipped two notches below normal to settle at 20 deg; Celsius. However, with the sun shining bright, most Delhiites didnt feel the cold during the day.

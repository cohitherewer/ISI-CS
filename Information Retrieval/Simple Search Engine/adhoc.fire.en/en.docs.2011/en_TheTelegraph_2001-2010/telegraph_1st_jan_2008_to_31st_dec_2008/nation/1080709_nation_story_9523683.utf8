          JAYANTH JACOB                              Mukherjee in Delhi (Rajesh Kumar); Yechury				                                 
	New Delhi, July 8: When the Left and the UPA parted ways, a child from the unhappy marriage also died  unwanted and unlamented  on the same day of the week it was born.        
	The UPA-Left committee on nuclear deal, as the 15-member panel was formally called, had held its first meeting on a Tuesday in September last year, days after its formation on August 30. Nine sittings later, the committee was given a formal burial today, also a Tuesday.         
	The Left saw no point in attending another session of the panel after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made it clear yesterday the Centre would approach the IAEA very soon.        
	Hours before the panels demise, the duo who were most associated with the committee  convener Pranab Mukherjee and Left leader Sitaram Yechury  had retreated to the shadows.        
	Yechury, the Lefts point man for talks with the Congress on matters ranging from the nuke deal to floor coordination, wasnt in the country when the last nail in the panels coffin was struck today with the pullout announcement. When he returns on Thursday, the Left will no longer be an outside supporter of the government.         
	Mukherjees letter on Monday proposing another sitting of the panel on July 10 was rendered redundant by the Prime Ministers mid-air statement that provoked the Left to pull the trigger.        
	And this evening, after it was all over, the foreign minister wrote another letter, perhaps the epitaph to the joint panel. The aim this time wasnt to persuade the communists but to contest their charge that they hadnt been shown the safeguards text.         
	Confidential briefing of texts summarising the contents of the agreement and the outcome of the negotiations were circulated to all members of the committee in all the three meetings in which the text of the agreement was discussed, the letter said.        
	At the end, it seems the government won the day  it ensured the Left was kept in check till it had support from others parties for the deal and for staying in power.         
	The Left had lost the chance to block the deal in November when it allowed the government to go to the IAEA with the caveat that it would come back to the committee. Then, the communists couldnt anticipate the political swings that have diminished their importance for the UPAs survival.         
	But another view is that the Left, unprepared for polls when the deadlock deepened last August-September, paid the price for not being able to go to voters.        
	Some of what happened at the committee could be of the academic interest, such as the exchange of notes on the Hyde Act and its impact on Indias foreign policy. These might have campaign value in the Left-ruled Bengal and Kerala.

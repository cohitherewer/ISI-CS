	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Lakshmi Niwas Mittal has not grown too big for his (Calcutta) boots! The first thing that the fifth richest man in the world did in town was to buy some chappals and sandals from the shoemakers he has trusted from his days in St Xaviers College.
    
	Then, the college student would go to the store on Short Street, but now the store comes to the steel baron. 
    
	LN arrived with wife Usha (in picture by Rashbehari Das) this evening to attend a wedding in the family at the Mittal House in Alipore. Several pairs from Trend Shoes walked into the presidential suite of Taj Bengal soon after. 
    
	Usha chose nine pairs of chappals and sandals  black, fawn and brown. The last time he was here, he had picked up a few pairs and so did his son-in-law, said Aakanksha Sahgal of Trend Shoes. The chappals and sandals are handcrafted and made of leather.
    
	The price range? Between Rs 1,695 and Rs 1,795.
    
	The last time he was here I had asked him, why our shoes? He had replied, The fact that I buy them, isnt that answer enough? added Aakanksha.
    
	And yes, 30 years and $51 billion later, LN Mittal remains a size nine.
    
	Buddha meeting
    
	On Sunday, Mittal will call on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Sources said the government is likely to pitch for Mittals participation in the chemical hub at Nayachar.

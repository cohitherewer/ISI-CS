The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Absurd rap on airline moustache sack
                                                                                                               Absurd rap on airline moustache sack
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Victor Joynath De                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: A cabin-crew member sacked by Indian Airlines for sporting a handlebar moustache got the Supreme Court to issue notices to the carrier today.        
	How can you dismiss a person for keeping a moustache? the bench wondered as it heard Victor Joynath Des petition. Its absurd and arbitrary, the court observed.        
	But Justices H.K. Sema and Markandey Katju also joked: You must have kept a Veerappan-like moustache, covering your entire face. covering your eyes. Its very difficult.        
	De, 62, however, prefers a comparison with the Maharaja mascot of Air India - with which the domestic carrier has now merged - and argues its almost an advertisement.        
	Indian Airlines had grounded De in 1998 and forced him to retire in 2001 when he was 55, three years short of retirement age.        
	De says he has been wearing his beloved moustache since he joined the airline as a cabin-crew member in 1968 and had been promoted to assistant manager, in-flight crew, in 1994.        
	His troubles began with a circular on July 10, 1998, that stated: Flight personnel should be clean-shaven (except Sikhs), with neatly trimmed moustaches not beyond the upper lip.        
	De claimed he wore his long moustache in keeping with family tradition and his spiritual faith. He said he regularly trimmed it.        
	The moustache, he said, was very much in keeping with the aviation tradition and drew attention to the Maharaja logo of Air India wherein a similar moustache was in view.        
	A single-judge bench of Calcutta High Court had set aside his compulsory retirement as arbitrary in August 2002 and ordered him reinstated. But this was overturned by a division bench in July 2007.        
	At todays hearing of Des appeal, his lawyer Sanjeev Sen argued that the dismissal was unthinkable in a democratic country.        
	The court then issued notices to Air India; its directors of in-flight services, operations and personnel; its manager and deputy general manager of in-flight services, and the secretary of the civil aviation ministry.        
	The Indian Airlines manual said moustaches must be trimmed above the upper lip, and banned sideburns.

	New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked the Centre and the Medical Council of India to respond to a petition seeking details of the degrees and colleges recognised by the MCI and those that arent.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan also issued notices to the Union Public Service Commission and all state governments.        
	The petition, filed by a group of postgraduate doctors, contended that MD/MS degrees awarded by some state medical colleges were not recognised by the MCI, putting the doctors under constant fear of criminal action.

	New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Samajwadi Party today kept up the momentum it has whipped up over the tussle in Maharashtra, urging the Election Commission not to recognise Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.
    
	The MNS is only a registered party and its application for recognition is pending before the poll panel.
    
	Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said the MNS should be barred from contesting elections as Raj does not believe in the Indian Constitution. 
    
	The Samajwadi Party seemed determined to spirit away north Indian votes in the state from the mainline parties, which are caught in a bind.
    
	The Congress and the BJP had bagged most of the migrant votes in the past. 
    
	The Congresss dilemma is that its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, represents the interests of Marathi-speakers from various castes. Sources said the party could not afford to lose these votes.
    
	But, they added, the Congress also had to think beyond Maharashtra and avoid alienating voters in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other north Indian states.
    
	The BJPs compulsions are similar. Sources in the party said it could not lose an ally in the Shiv Sena and could not, therefore, condemn Raj unequivocally. But the BJP, like the Congress, also had to pander to a larger Hindi-speaking vote bank outside the state.
    
	The official lines of the Congress and the BJP betrayed their sense of caution.
    
	Vandalism and violation of law and order by activists of Raj Thackerays party, supported by the Shiv Sena, are condemnable and totally unjustifiable, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.
    
	The BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad did not name Raj. He said: We are opposed to such cheap politics which disturb social harmony.

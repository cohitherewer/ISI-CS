	Bhubaneswar, July 4: The pilgrim town of Puri today turned into a sea of devotees, rivalling the Bay of Bengal roaring by its side, when (approximately) 10-lakh people assembled to witness the car festival.        
	Marring the days event, a frenzied stampede claimed six lives and injured 15, creating chaos for a brief period, said the working president of the temple managing committee Suresh Chandra Mohapatra, while talking to The Telegraph.         
	Despite the apprehension that this years yatra would be a less-crowded affair in view of the recent floods in Orissa and neighbouring Bengal and subsequent disruption of railway services, around 10lakh devotees reportedly assembled in the temple town today.        
	Frenzied devotees pulled the gigantic wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, his elder brother Lord Balabhadra and sister, the goddess Subhadra, on the 3km Grand Road amid chants of haribol and jai Jagannath and the beating of gongs.        
	Elaborate security arrangements including installation of closed-circuit televisions were made to ward off possible terrorist attacks.         
	For the first time CCTVs were installed at strategic places along the Grand Road leading to Mausima Temple starting from Singhadwar, the main entrance of the Jagannath temple and important places such as the bus stand and railway station, explained director-general of police Gopal Chandra Nanda.        
	Quick Reaction Teams, a group of specially trained police commandoes, were also deployed. Besides sniffer dog squads, bomb-disposal teams and rooftop snipers were posted to give the extra edge to the surveillance. Around 70 platoons of armed police were deployed under the supervision of inspector-general (law and order) Pradip Kapoor to maintain law and order and control the traffic.        
	Despite all the police and state control the stampede could not be prevented.        
	All through the day, Puri temple servitors were busy performing series of rituals before the main event that is the procession.         
	One of the prominent rituals was pahandi bije where the three deities were brought out one after the another in a colourful procession from the sanctum sanctorum of the 12th century shrine.         
	The three were then installed atop three wooden chariots, Taladhwaja, Devadalana and Nandighosha, parked in front of Singhadwar  the main temple entrance.        
	During the particular ritual, the stampede started, as devotees jostled with each other to catch a closer glimpse.        
	Around 4pm the three chariots started rolling down the 3km Grand Road towards Mausima Temple one after another, as the frenzied crowd cheered.         
	The three would return home after enjoying a nine-day retreat at the temple.

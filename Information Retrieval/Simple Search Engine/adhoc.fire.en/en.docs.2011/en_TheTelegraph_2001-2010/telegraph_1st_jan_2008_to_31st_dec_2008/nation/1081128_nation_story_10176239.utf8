          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    Kunlawala, (below) Narkar                                  
	How some bravehearts saved the lives of others risking their own        
	Bhanu Deo Narkar        
	The Cama Hospital premises wore a forlorn look today. Huddled in various corners, men were crying uncontrollably. They were mourning the death of a friend who had given his life to save theirs.         
	Bhanu Deo Narkar, a 48-year-old watchman at the hospital, died a soldiers death. The site where he was hit, even 12 hours after his death, was stained with blood. He single-handedly faced three armed terrorists with two lathis and alerted everyone, despite being hit by a bullet.        
	Narkar had come on duty at 9.30pm, just hours before a series of shooting broke out in the city.         
	If it werent for him, we would have been killed. I was on my way down to the porch when I heard him yelling and retreated inside the building, said a doctor.        
	Narkar, who had been working in the hospital for 26 years, was the only earning member of his family. He has a 24-year-old son and teenage daughters. He worked so hard all his life, but I couldnt give him anything in return. He was a good father, I will miss him, but I am very proud of what he did, said son Praveen.        
	Narkar was shot in the stomach twice and collapsed. He had saved at least 10 lives.        
	Deepak Kunlawala        
	Deepak Kunlawala had just returned from a shopping spree and was preparing to leave the Taj hotel for the airport to board a flight back home to London when the militants struck.        
	This trip to India was a retirement gift for my father, I could never have imagined that this would turn so ugly. We were dining when I saw a group of nine men in a paddle boat from the restaurant, which overlooked the harbour. The men looked shady and wore very dark clothes, and I felt a little afraid.... Then there were gunshots, and every minute the shots seemed nearer and nearer. I dragged my father out of the room and shouted at everyone to follow me, the 38-year-old said.        
	Then they entered the adjoining banquet hall, where the members of the UB group were having dinner. As everyone went in, Kunlawala locked the door. I hid our passports in the cushions of the chairs as we heard that they were looking for British passports.        
	I could hear footsteps approaching the door, so we moved to the next room.... Old people were so scared that they needed to go to the bathroom. We made a makeshift bathroom in the hall itself, he said.         
	Thats when Kunlawala decided to take action. I tied curtains and table covers together and made a rope and then climbed down the first-floor suite. People were afraid at first but many South Koreans and French nationals climbed down. My father ruined his leg, hope he gets well soon.        
	Kunlawala helped at least 60 people come out of the Taj.        
	Farrokh D. Italia        
	The 55-year-old karate instructor who had taught the art of self-defence for 35 years died while saving two children and many guests at the Oberoi where he had gone to attend a party.        
	He shoved the boy under a chair and took two bullets in his chest. Another bullet ripped through his intestines and he had 10 puncture wounds all over his body. He was also hit in the back when he tried to save people from getting hit, said an eyewitness.        
	Elder brother Bomi couldnt hold back tears as he recalled how all these years, the unmarried Farrokh had been like a son to him. He died like a braveheart. I wouldnt expect anything less from him.         
	Many of Farrokhs students gathered outside Bombay Hospital where he died. He was a fighter. Even in death he fought till the last, said Aditya, one of his students.         
	Italia saved at least 15 lives.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Jitu Jakesika (left) and Dodi Pusika address a news conference on the Niyamgiri issue. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 14: Members of the Dangaria Kandha tribals from Kalahandi have appealed to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, K.G. Balakrishnan, to hear them before delivering the final verdict on the Vedanta Groups bauxite mining project in the Niyamgiri hills.         
	Talking to reporters here today, Jitu Jakesika and Dodi Pusika, who belong to the Dangaria Kandha community, said they have faxed an appeal to the chief justice on behalf of both the Dangaria and the Jharania Kandha tribes along with other tribes living in Niyamgiri.         
	We came to know that a bench of the apex court is going to decide on the bauxite mining operation shortly.         
	We have prayed before the chief justice to hear us, the inhabitants of Niyamgiri, before taking a final decision, said Jakesika showing a copy of the letter signed by him and Pusika.         
	Hundreds of tribals from the region will fax similar letters to the Supreme Court, he said.         
	The apex court is expected to deliver its final verdict on May 16.         
	Vedanta Alumina set up a 1MT alumina refinery at a cost of Rs 4,000 crore at Lanjigarh on the foothills of Niyamgiri range.        
	The group had been allotted the bauxite mines on Niyamgiri, too, a move that environmentalists and tribals have been opposing.         
	Jakesika lamented that tribals, the original residents of the area, have not been given the chance by the apex court or by the state government to present their case.         
	If the mining project is allowed it will destroy our Niyamgiri and will ultimately lead to two major rivers and 36 perennial hilly streams to dry up, he added.         
	The bauxite mining project will not only destroy the livelihood of 20,000 tribals, it will also destroy the religious sanctity of Niyamgiri, our sacred place, said the Dangaria Kandha youth.         
	If Niyamgiri deposits are allotted to any company ignoring tribal protests, it will lead to a violent uprising like the ones in Kalinganagar warned Pusika, a tribal youth.         
	We have seen the plight of families displaced by Lanjigarh alumina refinery, one of them added.         
	Earlier, the Dangaria Kandhas had drawn the attention of AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi to the issue when the latter visited Ijurpa, a tribal hamlet on the foothills of Niyamgiri, on March 7 during his Discovery India trip.         
	He discussed the matter for more than 30 minutes. Incidentally, Jakesika led the delegation.         
	During his second visit to the state, Jakesika, with a few others, met Rahul Gandhi again at the airport last evening and asked him to intervene in the matter.         
	Rahul Gandhi reportedly has assured all support to their cause and asked the community to carry on their agitation to save their Niyamgiri hilly home.

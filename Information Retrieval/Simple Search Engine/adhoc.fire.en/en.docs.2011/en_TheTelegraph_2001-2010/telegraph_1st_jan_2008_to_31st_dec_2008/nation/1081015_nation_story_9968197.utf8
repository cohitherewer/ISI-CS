                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     March deadline to plug Kosi breach
  - More than one firm to be invited        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Flood victims leave Kusaha in Nepal                                        
	Patna, Oct. 14: Breaches in the Kosi would be plugged before March 31 next year to avoid repetition of this monsoons calamity.        
	A day before the official date to declare the end of flood season, the state government, in consultation with the Union water resources ministry, today decided to begin the work from the first week of November to plug the breaches in the Kosi that wreaked havoc in north Bihar.        
	Union water resources ministry secretary U.N. Panjiyar had a detailed meeting with state water resources secretary Ajay Nayak and senior engineers of the water resources department to formalise the measures to be taken up to plug the breaches and start the process to rebuild the embankment to avoid the catastrophe next year.        
	After the meeting, state water resources minister Bijendra Yadav said that the state government would invite bidding on October 21 to take up the project to plug the breaches through which water gushed out deviating from its natural course.        
	It will not be one company, he said, but many engineering and construction companies will be required for the biggest engineering exercise needed to plug the breaches and then rebuild the embankment  strong enough not to repeat the breach.        
	With the virtual end of the flood season, the work is already underway to create the pilot channels to send the river  which changed its course going on the rampage and displacing 35 lakh people in the wake of the breach in its embankment at Kusaha (Nepal)  on its previous course.        
	The work on the pilot channels blocking the rivers new-found courses and sending the water in the previous course is likely to be completed by the end of this month.         
	With the end of the rains, it will be easy now to press the men and machines on the ground to plug the breaches at Kusaha, Bijendra Yadav said.        
	The entire operation  including plugging the breaches, restoring the old course of the river and rebuilding the embankment  would be completed by March 31, according to the minister.        
	The newly created Kosi Breach Closure Advisory Committee headed by flood embankment expert and state water resources department former chief engineer N. Sanyal would monitor and provide the technical guidance to the gigantic engineering exercise.        
	The operation is likely to cost Rs 700 crore. The Union government has released the first instalment of Rs 40 crore for beginning the work.         
	The state cabinet too has sanctioned Rs 197 crore for the project.         
	In fact, the Centre will bear the entire cost of the project. But it will reimburse the money in instalments after the state government sends the details of expenses to it, Yadav said.        
	It is not yet clear about the measures that the government is going to undertake to rebuild the obliterated homes and villages and resettle about 35 lakh displaced people who have taken shelter in the relief camps in five worst-affected Bihar districts.        
	The breach could not be detected on time as the embankment gave way on August 18 rendering millions homeless.

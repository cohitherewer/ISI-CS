   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
   
	Bangalore, Jan. 9: Pro-Kannada activists are up in arms against South Western Railway (SWR) for allegedly preferring Bihar recruits and shunning locals for Class-D posts. 
 
	The issue gained momentum in the past few days with the activists disrupting two examinations held in the city and chasing away the outsiders and blocking trains in protest. They also met Union minister of state for labour Oscar Fernandes, who reportedly failed to sympathise with them. As a result, he was detained for over half-an-hour at a public function till police intervened. Today, the activists wrapped in red and yellow Karnataka state flags gheroaed divisional railway manager Mahesh Mangal and threatened to prolong protests if the railway continued with their step-motherly attitude towards local people. 
 
	Hubli-based SWR was quick to denounce the allegations but refused to submit a break-up of the candidate who appeared for the Class-D tests that are on. 
 
	Railways is a pan-India entity where any Indian can apply. When we called for recruitment six months ago, thousands applied. Those who qualified were called for the written and physical tests in Bangalore. There were very few who evinced interest from Karnataka, explained a senior officer, who did not wish to be named, while talking to The Telegraph. 
 
	Class-D posts are permanent posts of peons, safai karmacharis (sweepers), gangmen which are low vis- agrave;-vis pay scale and qualification.
 
	This month, the SWR has taken up the biggest ever recruitment to these posts following 4,000 vacancies. These candidates from across the country are currently appearing for physical and written examinations. Candidates have to pass Class VIII to qualify for the tests. Another railway official handling the process recruitment said SWR had followed the guidelines set by the railway board and advertised for the posts in employment exchanges, in regional papers and national English dailies six months ago.
 
	We dont have a quota for any state and it is wrong to say only applicants from Bihar are being recruited, he said. 
 
	Pro-Kannada organisations that have of late been taking law into their hands and acting as a culture and moral police are breathing fire. Three days ago we chased away all those who had come for the physical tests from Bihar. Yesterday, the written exam was held despite our protests. We are taking this issue seriously. As SWR is headquartered in Hubli, they should recruit youth only from Karnataka for the posts, fumed Narayana Gowda, Karnataka Rakshane Vedike. 
 
	Strangely, litterateurs, including noted writer L.S. Seshagiri Rao, are providing support to the activists. 
 
	Sensing a political opportunity, the JD(S) and BJP has also promised to join the agitation and are planning to disrupt trains over the next few days. The CPM, too, has jumped into the fray and urged the Centre to frame a national employment policy and asked SWR to offer jobs to Kannadigas first.

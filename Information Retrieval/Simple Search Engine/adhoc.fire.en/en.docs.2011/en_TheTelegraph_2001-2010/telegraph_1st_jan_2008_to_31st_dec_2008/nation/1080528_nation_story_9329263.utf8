          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhagalpur, May 27: Naxalites last night blew up tracks between Dharhara and Masudhan railway halts on the Jamalpur-Kiul loop of Eastern Railway hours before todays (east) Bihar bandh even as police foiled a similar bid between Jamui and Bhalui stations on the Patna-Howrah main section.        
	The rebels also killed an armed chowkidar, Shabuk Lal Paswan, last night at Kumarpur village under Ajmeri panchayat in Mungers Dharhara block. Paswans throat was slit and rebels left a note on the body calling him an informer.         
	The staff at Jamalpur SPs office confirmed yesterdays incident where tracks between Dharhara and Masudan (Munger), near bridge number 61, were blown up around 1.35am. Passengers of Farakka-Vhimani-New Delhi Express (both Up and Down), scheduled to cross the spot shortly after the blast, escaped injuries as villagers managed to stop the trains.        
	Sources from Jhajha RPF revealed that a patrolling party discovered a 3ftx1.5ft hole beside the tracks between Jamui and Bhalui this morning.         
	Rebels had dug the earth to fix explosives there but the RPF prevented it, Jamui police sources said.         
	Patna-Ranchi Hatia Express and Mokama-Howrah Passenger, scheduled to cross Jamui stations, were provided additional escort.         
	Meanwhile, todays dusk-to-dawn bandh called by the Maoists to protest the arrest of bidi workers, however, had little impact on Bhagalpur, Munger, Jamui, Banka and Lakhisarai, than it did on the rural pockets in Jamui and Lakshmipur.         
	Life was disrupted at Jhajha (Jamui) today as schools, colleges, markets and government offices were closed.        
	Taking a serious note of the closure, Jamui SP Vinay Kumar told the reporters that serious action would be taken against officials concerned for closing the institutions.         
	Gopaljee Verma, the manager of SBIs Jhajha branch, however, said the closure was imperative keeping in mind the employees security and that functions resumed after police provided security cover.

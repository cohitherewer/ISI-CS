                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi braces for Gujjar protest
          OUR BUREAU                          Gujjars at a rally in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	May 27: Gujjar protesters squatted on roads and rail tracks and fought with police as the five-day Rajasthan standoff over Scheduled Tribe status showed no signs of a thaw and threatened to spill over into the national capital.        
	In Delhi, the Centre braced for an onslaught as community leaders declared a bandh this week and said they might extend it to the rest of the country after the core committee of the All India Gujjar Mahasabha meets on June 1.        
	Core committee executive member Ram Saran Bhati said the protesters had been told that only bazaars could be closed but no blockades would be allowed.        
	Home minister Shivraj Patil held a meeting this morning with special secretary (internal security) M.L. Kumawat to take stock of the situation.        
	Sources said though the Centre was worried that the agitation might spread to Delhi, it wasnt willing to be party to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindias views.         
	They said Rajes request in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to convene a meeting of chief ministers of states with Gujjar populations was ridiculous as it was only Rajasthan that could decide whether to recommend ST status for community members in the state.        
	The Prime Minister is understood to have referred the letter to the law ministry.         
	In Rajasthan, Mahasabha representatives marched to the United Nations office in Jaipur to complain about human rights violations by the state government.        
	They have cut off supply lines and communication to the lakhs of protesters. The UN representative told us our submission will be forwarded to Geneva and that we should also approach the National Human Rights Commission, Bhati said.        
	Mahasabha state chiefs from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi met this evening to chalk out their future course. On June 1, 250 core committee members from across the country will meet in the capital.        
	Sources said after Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh would be the next state where Gujjars would demand recognition as a Scheduled Tribe, a status that would help them get government jobs and university seats reserved for disadvantaged groups.        
	In Bayana, agitation spearhead Kirori Singh Bainsla refused to budge from his demand even as he was served a high court notice for contempt and asked to appear in person on May 30.         
	The state government had filed an application yesterday, urging the court to take action against Bainsla for disregarding its order on September 10 last year not to organise rallies without the collectors permission.        
	Reports of blockades continued to pour in from different parts of the state. Police say protesters deflated tyres in places like Alwar, Bharatpur, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli and Udaipur.         
	The police used tear gas to disperse protesters in Kotputli on the Delhi-Jaipur national highway and near Uniyara on the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur highway.        
	Tonk SP Giriraj Meena said some policemen and two women were injured when protesters threw stones at the police.

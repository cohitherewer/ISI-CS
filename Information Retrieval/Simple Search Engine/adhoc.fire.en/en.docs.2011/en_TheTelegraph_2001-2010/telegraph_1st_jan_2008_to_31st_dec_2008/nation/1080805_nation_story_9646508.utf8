          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Orissa will benefit from new thermal power plants                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 4: The Orissa government today decided that thermal power plants coming up in the state would have to supply anything between 5 to 7 per cent of power at concessional rates to the state.        
	A cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today cleared draft policy guidelines for thermal power plants that are being set up either by private companies or by central government undertakings.        
	A coal-rich state, Orissa has attracted several private companies and central PSUs to set up thermal power plants, and 13 MoUs have already been signed.        
	As per the new policy guidelines, independent power plants (IPPs), for which MoUs have been signed and coal linkages given, will make available 7 per cent power to the state at a concessional price to be determined by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC).        
	In case of the power plants without coal block/linkages, they will share 5 per cent power with the state, said chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy.        
	Similarly, a nominated agency authorised by the state government will have the right to buy 14 per cent power from future independent power plants allotted with coal block/linkages and 12 per cent from those without coal block/linkages.        
	The purchase price and the power tariff will be decided by the OERC.        
	Apart from the 13 power companies who have signed MoUs with the state, the Centre has sanctioned a 4,000MW ultra mega thermal power plant in the state.         
	Central PSUs like National Thermal Power Corporation have also shown interest in setting up thermal plants in Orissa.        
	In case of the ultra mega power plant to be set up though competitive bidding by the Centre, the state government or its authorised agency will have the right to buy up to 50 per cent power.         
	The state government will get 10 per cent home state share from the thermal power plants to be set up by central PSUs like NTPC, in addition to around 20 per cent share on the basis of the Gadgil formula.        
	Besides, the CPSUs will contribute 5 per cent of their profit for periphery development fund.         
	However, they need not contribute at the rate of 6 paise per unit of power sent outside the state from the plant towards Environment Management Fund, said energy secretary S.C. Mohapatra.

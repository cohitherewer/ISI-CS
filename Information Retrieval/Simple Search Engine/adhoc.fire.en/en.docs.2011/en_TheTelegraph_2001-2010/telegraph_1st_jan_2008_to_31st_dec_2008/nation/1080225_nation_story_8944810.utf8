          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai/Calcutta, Feb. 24: Twenty-five Indian seamen are feared dead with their Panamanian cargo ship still untraced in the Black Sea six days after it went missing.        
	The last contact with MV Rezzak had been made on February 18, a day after it had left Russias Novorossiysk for Bartin, Turkey, with an all-Indian crew and a cargo of steel billets.        
	Nine of the Indians were from Lakshadweep and 11 others carried passports issued from Mumbai. Kishore Kumar Roy, 38, of Sonarpur on Calcuttas fringes, was the lone crew member from Bengal.        
	They (Turkey) are searching for survivors but have not found anyone so far, an official in the directorate-general of shipping said.        
	He added that a human could stay alive barely for 30 minutes in the Black Seas freezing waters even if he was wearing a life jacket.        
	Angry relatives today voiced anger at Mumbai-based Pelican Marine (PMPL), the company that recruits the ships crew, saying it had kept them in the dark.        
	Harish Sharma, cousin of ship electrical engineer Pritam Singh, had rushed here from Himachal Pradesh after learning of the vessels disappearance. But when the retired naval officer reached the Pelican office, he found the shutters down.        
	The company didnt bother to inform us that our relatives were missing; we got to know this from the media, Sharma said.        
	In Sonarpurs Natunpally, Roys family was trying to keep its hopes up. Pelican officials have said they might tell us something tomorrow, niece Soma said. Roy, a seaman for the past eight years, was a cook.        
	Udaynarayan Chauhan, from Wadala in western Mumbai, had arrived at the Pelican office hoping for information about brother Hridaynarayan, a welder.        
	Im angry that we were kept in the dark. My parents still dont know Im afraid to break the news to them, he said.        
	We informed the families immediately after learning that the vessel had gone missing, claimed Pelican director S.C. Biswas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Out of Valley, Muslims cool
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Out of Valley, Muslims cool

	New Delhi, Aug. 16: Muslims living outside Jammu and Kashmir are largely neutral to the raging violence and the states divisive politics and most blamed their Valley counterparts for bringing things to such a pass.        
	Leaders of mainstream community organisations said Valley Muslims neednt have raised the Amarnath land bogey and voiced fears of slipping back into the Babri era if the BJP joined local episodes with the larger political theme of Hindutva.        
	The Valley is basically against Indias secular ethos, said Maulana Khalid Rasheed, Lucknow-based president of the national Ulema Council, as he articulated a dominant view among clerics on the Kashmir crisis.        
	For decades, the government has been giving land and creating facilities for religious purposes for all communities, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board member added.        
	When crores of rupees were given for the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, did you hear a single protest from Muslims? When the state made arrangements for Bakri-Id and the Prophets birthday, did any Hindu object? Or when land was given to house Haj committee offices? The secular law that applies to the country must cover Kashmir as well.        
	The point Rasheed was trying to make was the protests over the land transfer to the Amarnath shrine board had reinforced the stereotype perpetuated by the RSS-BJP that this was how Muslims behaved towards Hindus in a state where they are in a majority.        
	Kashmiri Muslims with their distorted perspectives dont realise that disrespect towards a religion is un-Islamic, he added.        
	While the maulana, an influential voice among north Indias theologians, reflected what it felt like to be in a community under political and social duress, others sounded more blas about Kashmir.        
	Why should we stick our neck out for Kashmiri Muslims? said another law board member who didnt want to be named. They brand us Hindustani Muslims, they never sympathise with our problems. Issues like Ayodhya didnt move them. We cannot buy land in the Valley. They dont have social relations with us.        
	Kashmir is not represented on the board or in any major Muslim organisation. Nor have these groups ever taken up Kashmir-related matters. With their separatist mindset, we dare not induct them, said a cleric, unless a person qualified as a mainstream Muslim like central minister Saifuddin Soz, who was a member of the Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.        
	Majlis-e-Mushawarat chief Zafarul Islam said he had learnt from sources that Muslims living in Jammu were targeted because of their religion. So we cannot remain indifferent to such humanitarian issues, he said, but clarified that barring an expression or two of sympathy, his organisation was unlikely to do anything more.        
	Asked why Muslims didnt react to human rights violations in the Valley, Syed Nizamuddin, the president of Patnas Imarat Sharief, said this business is dicey.        
	There are violations on both sides, of civilians and security forces. Its a battle between the people of the Valley and the Centre in which we cant be expected to take sides.

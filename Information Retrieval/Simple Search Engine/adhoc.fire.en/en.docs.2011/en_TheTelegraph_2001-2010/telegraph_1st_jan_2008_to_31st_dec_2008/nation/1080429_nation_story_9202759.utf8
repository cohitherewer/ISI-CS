          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Krishna campaigns in Bangalore on Monday. (Bangalore News Photo)                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: The Congress has fielded a lightweight against S. Bangarappa in Karnataka, the first substantive indication that the party is willing to do business with the Samajwadi Party.        
	Bangarappa, a former Congress chief minister who switched to the Samajwadi Party, has filed his nomination from Shikaripur against B.S. Yediyurappa of the BJP.        
	Yediyurappa holds this seat and was expected to breeze through but for Bangarappas sudden move.        
	Our aim is to defeat Yediyurappa and we are willing to pull out all stops, said Vayalar Ravi, the Congresss special observer for Karnataka.        
	Late tonight, the Congress nominated Navalesh as the candidate for Shikaripur, where polls will be held in the second phase on May 16. May 2 is the last date for withdrawing nominations.        
	Sources described Navalesh as a dummy candidate. It is likely that he may be used as a bargaining chip to persuade Bangarappa to climb down and not pit his sons against each another so that Kumara, a Congress candidate, can focus on his campaign against the BJP and not get distracted by the presence of his brother, Madhu.        
	Congress sources said they hoped to bring Bangarappa around by the date of nomination withdrawal, May 2.        
	As a quid pro quo, Bangarappa will not insist that the Congress drop Kumara, who was renominated from Sorab that he had won in 2004.        
	The Bangarappas have been at daggers drawn since the father left the Congress and joined the BJP before the last Lok Sabha election. Bangarappa then joined the Samajwadi Party, and his son, Madhu, followed suit.        
	But Kumara remained in the Congress and defeated his brother narrowly in the last Assembly election. Madhu has not been given a ticket yet.        
	Congress sources said the party was not interested in the Bangarappa family soap but was focusing on bringing the secular forces together. It is a make-or-mar battle and every seat counts. Even if we cant get a majority, the aim is to become the single-largest par-ty, a source said.         
	Asked how such a scenario would play itself out, especially since a successful Bangarappa would compete for space with Congress heavyweights like S.M. Krishna, Mallikarjuna Kharge and Siddharamaiah, a source said: We will cross the bridge when we come to it. First things first.        
	The sources stressed that the Congresss understanding with the Samajwadi Party, if any, would not go beyond Shikaripur and Sorab.         
	Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has left it to Bangarappa to work out his terms and conditions with the Congress.        
	Krishna out of fray        
	Former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna is not contesting the Assembly polls.        
	The 75-year-old Congress leader was considered a front-runner in the chief ministerial stakes. No, I am not contesting from anywhere, he had said a few days ago. The decision became official today.         
	But the former Maharashtra governor is campaigning around the city.

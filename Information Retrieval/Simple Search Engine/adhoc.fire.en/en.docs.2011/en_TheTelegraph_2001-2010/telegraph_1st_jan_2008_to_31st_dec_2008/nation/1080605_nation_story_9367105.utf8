          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 4: Dock employee Jaiprakash Sawant and wife Madhuri saw a miracle in one simple word: aai.        
	Their 29-year-old son Parag, in coma for the past 23 months after suffering grievous wounds in the July 11, 2006, serial train explosions, called out to his aai  mother in Marathi  on Saturday and has now begun recognising his family.        
	Lodged in room 528 at Hinduja hospital in Mahim, western Mumbai, Parag was caught in one of the seven simultaneous explosions that rocked the citys commuter trains, killing 187 and wounding over 800.         
	After nearly two years of surgeries and treatment, he uttered his first words, giving hope to the family and the medical fraternity at the hospital.         
	On Saturday, physiotherapist Dr Amit Kohli entered Parags room for a routine check-up and casually asked him if he recognised his mother sitting in the room.         
	To the utter surprise of the doctor and the family, Parag said, aai looking at his mother. The senior Sawant and his wife, who have been spending entire days in their sons room, were overwhelmed with emotion.         
	Recovery is slow since Parag had a head injury. He has begun communicating and saying a few words like aai and papa. But there is still a long way to go, Dr Basant K. Mishra, the consulting neurosurgeon, told reporters at the Hinduja hospital today.        
	Mishra said that in the past month, Parag occasionally obeyed commands and also showed slight limb movements, and had begun communicating a few words since last week. He said the chances of recovery of a coma patient were higher if he showed some improvement in the first two years. The removal of the food pipe would help Parag to speak more freely, doctors said.        
	An assistant manager with a city construction firm, Akruti Nirman, Parag had been married seven months and was travelling to his residence at Bhayander to take wife Preeti, then six-month pregnant, for a sonography session when he was wounded. He was in a first class coach of a Churchgate-Virar local train and would have got down at Bhayander a few minutes later. But, an explosion occurred between Mira Road and Bhayander stations, injuring him severely.        
	Suffering brain haemorrhage, Parag underwent more than five neuro-surgeries and has been admitted to the Hinduja hospital since. His daughter, Prachiti, was born a few months later, but he failed to recognise her.

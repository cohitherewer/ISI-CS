          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Sonali Mohapatra    
	Bhubaneswar June 24: Earlier, she claimed to be unmarried. But now she is, albeit unhappily. Thus, actor Sonali Mohapatra today filed a divorce petition in the court of Puri civil judge.         
	The newcomer, who had claimed that she was never married to businessman Asim Amitabh Pattnaik and that the duo were just good friends, applied for divorce from the same man.         
	Sonalis lawyer Trilochan Panigrahi said: They were married and Sonali has sought divorce because she was being tortured by the Pattnaik family.         
	The actress had sought police protection fearing a threat to her life from her in-laws.         
	Asim had created a flutter on Sunday after he filed a complaint with Pipili police station claiming that Sonali was his wife and expressed a wish to reconcile with her. He said that they had married on July 22, 2006, in a Bhubaneswar temple and that the marriage was registered in a Khurda court on July 7. Asim had then presented documents and photographs of the duo.         
	Sonali had trashed the claims saying that the two were just good friends and added that her once-childhood friend had grown possessive. The matter became murkier when Pattnaiks parents approached the state womens commission alleging that their family was receiving threat calls over phone.

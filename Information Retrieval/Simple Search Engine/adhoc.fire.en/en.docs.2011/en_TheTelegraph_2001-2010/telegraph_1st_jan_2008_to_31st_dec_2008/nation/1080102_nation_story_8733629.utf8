        No smoking 
   
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 1: For those thinking of kicking the cancer stick this New Year, theres help. Five hotels in the capital are all set to get smoke-free zones from 2008.
 
	Hotel Swosti, New Marion, Ginger, Pal Height and Arya Palace are going to be the first five in Orissa to ban smoking in their premises. The drive was adopted to avoid tobacco-related health hazards, besides getting rid of the stench. 
 
	The health of our customers comes first. Its important to us that if they chose to they can find a smoke-free hotel, said R. Chanda of Arya Place. All the five have tied up with Voluntary Health Association of India (Vhai), which is initiating an anti-tobacco campaign in Orissa 
 
	As initial steps, No Smoking notices have been hung at lobbies and rooms. But, hotels are yet to decide whether they would like to fine erring clients for breaking rules. For now, the staff have been trained to warn customers when they are spotted smoking. We have decided to politely ask them to not smoke or usher them to the smoking zones, said Aditya Sahoo, manager of Pal Heights. 
 
	While preventing clients from smoking indoors might not be a problem, its going to be difficult to stop clients from smoking in the bars. For them provisions of smoking rooms are being mulled over.
 
	In hotels such as Swosti, the smoking and no-smoking areas have been segregated. 
 
	The hotels were initially reluctant to introduce the system because most customers have the habit of smoking. They thought it might affect business, said the project manager, Sisir Ranjan Dash, of Vhai-Aparajita. 
 
	We understood that smoke-free hotels were the in thing in developing countries. Foreign clients often check out smoke-free hotels and prefer them? Adding this smoke-free tag gives a boost to the hotels image, said Chanda of Arya Palace.

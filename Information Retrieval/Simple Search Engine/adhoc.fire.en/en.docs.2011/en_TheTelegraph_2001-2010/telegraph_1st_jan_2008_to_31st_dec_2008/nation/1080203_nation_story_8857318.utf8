	Lucknow, Feb. 2: Mayavati today hit back at Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeshwar for questioning the suspension of four senior officials who had glorified Rahul Gandhi, but said she had no hatred for anyone from the Congress MPs family.
    
	Defending the punishment handed out to the quartet for being associated with a book on Sultanpur, under which the Gandhi bastion of Amethi falls, Mayavati said the action was taken to make officers work honestly and without any political bias. 
    
	Rajeshwar had yesterday written to the government saying the suspensions should be revoked and called for a report.
    
	In her rejoinder to the letter, the chief minister said: It would have been better if the governor had talked to me prior to sending me the letter in connection with the issue.
    
	On Thursday, the government suspended Faizabad division commissioner Venkateswarlu, whose jurisdiction extends to Sultanpur, district magistrate Sanjay Kumar, chief development officer Dev Prasad Rai and assistant information director Pramod Kumar Singh. 
    
	The officials had contributed articles for a book produced by the central department of field publicity, which the state government said had glorified Rahuls contribution. Titled Sultanpur  Kal aur Aaj, the book was released six months ago. 
    
	While lashing out at the governor, the BSP chief said she had no hatred for any of the Gandhis. I respect both Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi. I have cordial relations with Sonia Gandhi but the action was taken to check the ways of the officials, she said. The book has glorified me, too, and my government. I dont like this either. The officers should avoid political bias.
    
	Ever since she took over as chief minister for a fourth time last May, Mayavatis relations with the governor had been cordial, unlike that of her predecessor. But of late, the ties had shown signs of strain.

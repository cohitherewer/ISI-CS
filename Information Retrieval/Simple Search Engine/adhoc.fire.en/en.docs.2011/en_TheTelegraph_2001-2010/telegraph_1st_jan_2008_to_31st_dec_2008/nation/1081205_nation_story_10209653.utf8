	Mumbai, Dec. 4 (PTI): Bombay High Court today issued notices to the Maharashtra government and the Centre asking them to file affidavits detailing the steps taken or to be taken to prevent terrorist attacks.        
	The directive came in response to two PILs filed in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. Please examine whether constitutional rights to life also cover right to live with safety, the court said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Staying Put                                  
	New Delhi, July 2: The Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has refused to re-admit nine Dalit students expelled amid allegations of caste discrimination, their performance in internal tests was the reason they were asked to leave.         
	But the expelled students said they had no plans to quit the IIT campus, and were likely to challenge the decision at Indias apex body for Dalit rights and, if necessary, in Delhi High Court.         
	The IIT today announced it had decided to take back two of 11 Scheduled Caste students expelled for poor performance early in June in view of the special circumstances they faced.         
	In all, 20 students had been expelled for poor performance, including a Scheduled Tribe student and eight from the general category.         
	The IIT today said it had also decided to take back one of the general category students on similar considerations.         
	Special circumstances, an IIT source explained, implies a serious medical condition or a tragedy in the students family that prevented them from attending classes.         
	Each course within any stream of engineering at the IITs carries a certain weightage, called credits. Students are required to obtain a certain number of credits at any point in time  indicating their success in clearing a minimum number of courses  or they can be asked to leave.         
	The Dalit students had last month approached the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, which ordered the IIT Delhi director, Surendra Prasad, to review the expulsion.         
	Prasad set up a special review committee to re-examine the cases of all expelled students. The committee held hearings between June 20 and June 25, and submitted its report on June 30, a statement issued by the IIT said. The decision to take back three of the students was based on the committees report.         
	But Ravinder Ravi, a BTech student who convinced the rest to approach the commission and who is among the nine not taken back, said today they would not leave their hostel rooms till justice is done.         
	The review committee was a sham from the start, and was set up to justify the earlier decision by the IIT, Ravi said. The expelled students had on June 26 held a protest on the IIT campus, alleging that the committee was biased.         
	Ravi said the nine Dalit students would decide on a course of action tonight. We will have to approach the NCSC again.         
	The IIT has also decided, on the basis of the committees report, to allow another three students to appear for a diploma exam. IIT guidelines state that students whose performance level falls just below the minimum standards required can be granted a diploma, considered significantly inferior to the BTech degree. IITs do not count diploma candidates as their students.

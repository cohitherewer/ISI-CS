          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, April 24: Orissa government may be committed to creating 142 new tehsils, however, Sundergarh residents would rather prefer that they concentrated on problems present in the existing ones.         
	Sundergarh is a tribal-dominated, backward district in western Orissa that fetches crores as revenue for the government from mines and industries every year. However, the revenue hub runs minus a tehsildar or an additional tehsilder mostly.        
	Parts of the town fall under Hemgir tehsil that is manned by a lone tehsildar who visit occasionally  as work keeps him mostly at his district headquarters.        
	Other tehsils are not in a good shape either.         
	Out of the nine tehsils in the area, three lack tehsildars, as district administration officials confirmed.         
	Rajgangpur is one such area. Previously, there were three additional-tehsildars and one tehsildar to run the show. Now, there are none.         
	District offices are somehow run with the help of makeshift arrangement, conceded a senior revenue officer.         
	Rajgangpur tehsil comprises three blocks under it and fetches a quantum of revenue  and lacks a boss at its helm. In Balisankara tehsil, too, there are no tehsilders to man the area.         
	When contacted, Sundergarh collector Kishan Kumar admitted that the problem was indeed acute.         
	We have apprised the government and some action would be soon taken, Kumar hoped.         
	Sundergarh enjoys a strong presence of PSU, with MCL running a sponge iron unit there. There is also a large presence of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, while Basundhara mines in Gopalpur, too, contribute to the state revenue.

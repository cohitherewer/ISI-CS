          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The India-specific waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group is likely to bolster plans by the Nuclear Power Corporation to start work at six new sites this year and prepare for imported reactors and fuel.        
	Jaitapur in Maharashtra, picked more than two years ago as a location for a nuclear power station, is a possible site for imported reactors from France while Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, is expected to get two more Russian-built reactors, NPC officials said.         
	Engineering work is expected to begin this year for two 700MW Indian-made reactors at Kakrapar in Gujarat, they said.         
	But the configuration of the imported reactors at Jaitapur is yet to be finalised, the officials added.         
	While American, French and Russian suppliers have already had exploratory talks with NPC officials, the next phase of discussions in the coming weeks or months is expected to deal with commercial specifics and help the power corporation finalise the suppliers.         
	Were likely to look for uranium fuel from multiple sources, NPC executive director Sudhinder Thakur told The Telegraph.        
	An improvement in fuel supply could lead to increased capacity and quick completion of three units that have been waiting for fuel, NPC chairman Shreyans Jain has said in a statement in the companys just-released annual report.         
	A shortage of indigenous uranium had forced the company to reduce power generation from some of its reactors over the past one year, leading to a drop in NPC profits for the first time in several years.        
	The NPCs revenues fell even though some units operated at availability factors of 80 per cent. But the NPCs rough patch is behind it, and good times are round the corner, Jain said.         
	The NPC has 17 operating nuclear reactors with an installed capacity of 4,120MW, and five are under construction  two 220MW reactors in Rawatbhata (Rajasthan), one 220MW reactor in Kaiga (Karnataka) and two 1,000MW Russian-built reactors acquired under an agreement finalised in the 1990s in Kudankulam.         
	India hopes to get two new 1,000MW reactors from Russia for Kudankulam and plans to offer the Jaitapur site for up to six imported reactors.         
	Jaitapur and Kudankulam are expected to account for a sizeable chunk of the installed nuclear capacity, projected by senior atomic energy officials to be somewhere between 20,000MW and 40,000MW by 2020.

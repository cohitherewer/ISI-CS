          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 23: Federation of All Orissa Traders Association (Faota) today decided to adopt a wait-and-watch policy before stopping the import of essential commodities to intensify agitation against the licensing system.         
	We will wait till July 10 for chief minister Naveen Patnaik to take a decision, said B.K. Mohanty, the federations general secretary. The ultimatum assumes significance as Orissa is primarily a consuming state and depends on stock imported from other states.         
	The federation representing nearly 2.5-lakh traders has demanded the withdrawal of the Orissa Foodstuff (Licensing And Storage) Control Order, 2008, notified by the food supplies and consumer welfare department.         
	The system came into effect from June 20. The traders have been opposing it as it mandates them to obtain licences to maintain stock of quantities. Traders had boycotted the system answering to a federation call and not applied for licenses so far.         
	Meanwhile, the price of nearly every commodity has shot up in Cuttack Malgodown, the largest wholesale market. Latest market reports state that prices of pulses had risen between Rs 300 and Rs 400 per quintal over the past two days. Mustard oil prices had gone up by Rs 10 per kg, price of coconut oil had increased by Rs 16 per kg.         
	Market intelligence sources attributed the price rise since Saturday to a gradual fall in the stock of essential commodities in the wholesale market. There had been a distinctly reduced import of essential commodities from outside and traders were meeting the demand of the retail market by exhausting their existing stocks.        
	We have no other option. The system, re-introduced after six years, has fixed the limit for stocking essential commodities, said Madhusudan Rout, the spokesperson of Cuttack Malgodown Traders Association. Under the system a trader is permitted to keep a maximum stock of 750 quintals of rice, 500 quintals of wheat, 500 quintals of edible oils and 500 quintals of pulses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Praise PM, slam Sonia 
                                                                                                               Praise PM, slam Sonia 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 3: The Nationalist Congress Party today sought to embarrass the Congress by appearing to draw a distinction between the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.        
	The government functions according to coalition ethics and morals, but this is lacking within the UPA (chaired by Sonia), said D.P. Tripathi, NCP general secretary and spokesperson.        
	He added that Singh was a true democrat but accused the Congress of being neither generous nor magnanimous towards its allies.        
	Days earlier, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had said that the UPA should contest the next general election under Manmohan Singhs leadership.        
	Tripathi alleged that the Congress had deliberately targeted Pawar, the food and agriculture minister, for the price rise. P. Chidambaram (the finance minister) is equally responsible, he said, adding that Sonia, as UPA chairperson, had violated the coalition dharma by not calling a meeting on price rise.        
	She is an educated woman and should be able to get the message, Tripathi said.        
	M. Veerappa Moily, the Congress spokesperson, said: Tripathi spoke of the government functioning with collective responsibility. What then is the course of action he wants? His counter to the complaint about Sonia not calling a UPA meet was: The right course of action by any UPA ally is to request the UPA chairperson to convene a meeting.

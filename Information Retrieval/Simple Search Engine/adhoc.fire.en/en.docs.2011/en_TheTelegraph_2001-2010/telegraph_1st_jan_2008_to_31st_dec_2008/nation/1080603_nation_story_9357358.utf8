The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Name setu after Ram, says DMK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Name setu after Ram, says DMK
          M.R. VENKATESH                              
	Chennai, June 2: Sethusamudram is a problem? How about Sethu Ram?        
	Central ally DMK today suggested that the stalled Sethusamudram project be renamed Sethu Ram to assuage Hindu sentiments and clear the way for dredging a shorter navigable route between the countrys west and east coasts.        
	A general council meeting here, on the eve of party boss and Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis 85th birthday, urged the Centre to go ahead with the project that would bring prosperity to the nation as a whole.        
	Opponents of the project say it involves cutting through the Ram setu, a chain of islets between Mannar in Sri Lanka and Rameshwaram, which many believe was built by Rams monkey army.        
	Those for the project say it would drastically cut sailing time as ships travelling between Indias west and east coasts now have to go round Sri Lanka, and insist theres no proof that the 30km-long partially submerged limestone shoals were manmade.        
	The general council, chaired by Karunanidhi, steered clear of the religious aspects of the controversy and in a resolution said the project was a 150-year-old dream of Tamils.        
	If need be, the project may be renamed Sethu Ram to help transcend the likes and dislikes over it, so that the country may benefit; this may well be taken as my birthday message, Karunanidhi said in a poem for the occasion.

	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 1: If Keralas Marxist chief minister can take two steps forward to show solidarity with Sabarimala pilgrims, he can only take one step back when it comes to praying before the deity.
    
	V.S. Achuthanandan became the first Marxist chief minister to make the 6km trek up the Sabari hills on Sunday. But his decision to return without worshipping Lord Ayyappa has angered the BJP.
    
	This is an insult to Hindu religious sentiments, said former minister of state and BJP leader . Rajagopal.
    
	Achuthanandans visit followed a barrage of complaints and corruption charges against the three-member Devaswom Board, which runs the temple on the governments behalf. The board is headed by C.K. Guptan, son-in-law of the late Marxist leader E.M.S. Namboodiripad.
    
	Since the start of the current pilgrim season on November 17, many devotees have stood in queues for more than six hours for darshan only to return empty-handed without the prasadam.
    
	The chief ministers visit was, therefore, an expression of solidarity with the devotees and a hint that he would not let temple affairs minister G. Sudhakaran, who is from the rival camp in the CPM, to mess things up any further.
    
	Achuthanandan, 85, walked up the hills, refusing the usual VIP privilege of being carried up in a sedan chair. He set off around 5pm and reached the top about 8.40pm, accompanied by a team of medical and other contingency staff.
    
	He also climbed down the hills on foot, arguably a more difficult task because the entire pressure gets concentrated on the knees.
    
	Rajagopal argued that as a Marxist and an atheist, Achuthanandan could well have chosen not to worship the deity; but as the chief minister, he should not have gone all the way up if he had decided not to bow before the god.
    
	Some others thought so, too. Millions of believers and non-believers observe a 41-day abstinence and climb the hills in self-flagellation, capping it with a darshan. Are our ministers greater than all the people who go there that they should turn their backs on the divine presence at the sanctum sanctorum? a devotee asked.
    
	Some analysts believe that Achuthanandan, on a downhill course in the party with his camp suffering in organisational elections, was perhaps eyeing some additional public support through the temple trip.
    
	But by refusing to put up a semblance of obeisance, he has lost the goodwill, a party insider said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 5: A representative of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment visited the National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research (Nirtar), an autonomous school under the aegis of the ministry, on Sunday to probe into the violence that led to the sine die closure of the institute.         
	Nirtar is located in Olatpur, 30km from here.         
	Purnima Singh, who is the joint secretary in the department, inspected the campus, hostels, classrooms and laboratories  some of which were damaged in last months daylong student protests.         
	Protests occurred when requests for better infrastructure, such as fans in hostel rooms and classrooms, were ignored by authorities.         
	Students also allege that during a demonstration being held outside the office of the director some students were attacked.         
	In this regard Singh quizzed institute director B.M. Pradhan and staff.         
	Pradhan alleged that students staged violent protests for a day and damaged nearly Rs 50 lakh property and left a nurse and a patient injured.         
	Sine die closure was declared and students were asked to vacate hostels after chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathys visit.         
	While Singh was not available for comments, Pradhan refused to comment on the matter.        
	Meanwhile, the All India Democratic Students Organisation (Aidso) has demanded immediate withdrawal of sine die at Nirtar, disciplinary action against the director and withdrawal of false cases registered against students.         
	The Aidsos Cuttack district committee had submitted a memorandum to the collector demanding improvement of infrastructure in the hostel and campus.         
	Nirtar students are also on a dharna to press for the demands for the past eight days.         
	The school director had lodged an FIR at a local police station in connection with the violence, while students lodged a counter-FIR alleging that the school staff assaulted at least 12 students.         
	Police arrested four students and two employees of the institute.

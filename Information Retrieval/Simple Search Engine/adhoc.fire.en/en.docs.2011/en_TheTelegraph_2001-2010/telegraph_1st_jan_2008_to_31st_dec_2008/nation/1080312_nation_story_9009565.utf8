The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong soldiers on: N-deal still alive
                                                                                                               Cong soldiers on: N-deal still alive
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 11: Nuke best bet  convey the impression that the deal wont be sacrificed at the Lefts altar.        
	An official-cum-party source today said the best course of action for the government and the Congress on the vexed nuclear deal would be to give an impression that they were somehow keeping it alive and were not about to dump it.        
	But that, the source conceded, was easier said than done because of the intricacies and imponderables involved in the processes that would take the deal through after nuclear watchdog IAEA was done with it.        
	The deal is expected to go into autopilot once a safeguards agreement with the IAEA is in place and it is handed over to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).         
	But a senior Congress minister said though India was not part of the 45-member NSG, it couldnt be out of the frame. How can India not figure in this? You cant have Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, he said.        
	The minister wouldnt elaborate, but the fact that India has been quietly lobbying the member-countries to push its case reflects the governments continuing worries.        
	The source conceded that the circumstances for clinching the deal in the UPA regimes lifetime were not exactly conducive, but said the UPA-Left joint mechanism on the deal would meet on March 17. Prakash Karat and other Left representatives would be shown the draft of the agreed text with the IAEA and given time to mull over it.        
	The Congress, the source said, anticipates the problems after this meeting. The catch, he added, was that the IAEA agreement was already frozen and if the Left sought amendments or deletions, India would not be in a position to carry them out.        
	The source also said the text would be informally circulated among the NSG members so they could start their work.        
	Asked if the Congress was set to present the Left with a fait accompli, the source said the Lefts veto power had, in fact, grown stronger.        
	Unless that veto power is withdrawn, we are cornered, he said. Domestically and globally, we cannot send the message that such an important policy has been held hostage to political compulsions. It will compromise the governments and the Prime Ministers integrity and prestige.        
	Some insiders said Manmohan Singh and the pro-deal lobby want early elections in the hope of cashing in on the loan-waiver euphoria.        
	But the earliest timeline could be October or November after the Jammu and Kashmir elections and after the Election Commission was done with the modalities of delimiting constituencies.        
	The sources said the deal shouldnt be sacrificed at the Lefts altar and if the issue of cobbling another coalition arose, the Congress could look at other prospective allies like the BSP or the Samajwadi Party.

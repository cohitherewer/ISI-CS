	Patna, May 26: A 14-year-old boy suffered severe damage to his eyes and burns on his face and chest as acid fell on him during a scuffle with a shopkeeper yesterday at Kahalgaon under Bhagalpur.        
	The incident took place around 2.30am on the intervening night of May 24 and 25 when Gautam Kumar Yadav was caught breaking the lock of a provision store by its owner Devendra Shah at Bishanpur village under Shivnarainpur police station, about 300km from here.        
	Police said the shopkeeper, sleeping in his shop, woke up when he heard sounds of a chisel and a hammer and caught Gautam. Gautam was referred to Sadar hospital at Mayaganj, Bhagalpur, last night. Doctors said he suffered serious injuries to his eyes. Shivnarayanpur police station officer-in-charge Rakesh Kumar said: It seems to be an accident and the acid splashed on boys face during a scuffle. Shah said that he had bought acid to fend off thief. Shah, however, did not explain why he had resorted to such cruel means to fend off a boy, who was already overpowered.

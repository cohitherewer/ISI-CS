	Mumbai, July 26: Police commandos threw a ring around the countrys commercial capital as the city, on high alert since yesterday, girded up after more than a dozen small bombs went off uncomfortably close in Ahmedabad.        
	We have beefed up security at strategic installations like the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. There are barricades on important road junctions and increased patrolling at public places, Mumbai police commissioner Hasan Gafoor said.        
	All entry and exit points to the city, including Mumbai airport and railway stations, are being closely monitored. Additional companies of quick reaction team commandos are being deployed in sensitive areas.        
	All police stations, he added, had been put on high alert.        
	Delhi, too, remained on high alert. We have beefed up security in almost all crowded places and deployed extra personnel to ensure peoples safety, said police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat.        
	In BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, police tightened security at railway stations, bus stands and shrines as authorities awoke to a frightening coincidence.        
	It is a coincidence but the last three serial blasts (in Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan) have taken place in BJP-ruled states, said a high-ranking police officer.        
	An alert was sounded all over Bengal, too, while Calcutta police teams were patrolling sensitive areas of the metropolis. An alert has already been sounded in the city and additional forces deployed in all sensitive and crowded points, Calcutta police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said.        
	In Mumbai, police commissioner Gafoor said the anti-terrorist squad had been asked to be on standby to assist Bangalore and Ahmedabad police.        
	Security has been tightened around places of worship, railway stations and bus terminuses.

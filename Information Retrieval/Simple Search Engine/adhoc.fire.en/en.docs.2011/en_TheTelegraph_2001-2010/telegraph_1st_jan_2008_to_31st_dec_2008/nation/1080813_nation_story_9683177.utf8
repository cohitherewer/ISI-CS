          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 12: The Federation of All Orissa Traders Association today warned that the unprecedented rise in sugar prices in the past few days in Cuttack Malgodown, the largest wholesale market in the state, could increase further if the inadequate flow of sugar to the open market continued.         
	Prices have increased nearly by Rs 300 per quintal. At present, the price of per quintal sugar is Rs 1,950, making sugar costlier at the retail level by Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg.        
	The monthly requirement of sugar at the retail level is between 40,000 and 50,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month, excluding the sugar distributed through public distribution system to BPL card-holders. But importing of the required stock has not been possible this month due to reduced inflow of sugar to the open market, the associations general secretary B.K. Mohanty told The Telegraph. The shortage is fallout of a dip in the release of sugar to open markets by millers since July following easing of export restriction on it by the Centre.         
	The association has urged the Centre to ensure release of entire monthly quota by the millers to the open market. If this is not done, sugar prices will rise further, he said.         
	Meanwhile, market intelligence reports said there had been a fall in the prices of essential commodities such as edible oils, rice and wheat flour since July at the Cuttack Malgodown. Prices of pulses, however, remained stable.         
	While prices of rice had gone down by Rs 30 to Rs 70 per quintal since July 15 there had been a fall in the price of wheat flour by Rs 39 to Rs 50 per quintal during the same period. Mustard oil per 16-kg tin was Rs 1,140 against Rs 1,220 in July, while refined oil (per 16-kg tin) was down to Rs 870 from Rs 990 during the same period.         
	The traders association attributed the fall in prices to the governments decision to keep in abeyance the imposition of stock limit on traders.

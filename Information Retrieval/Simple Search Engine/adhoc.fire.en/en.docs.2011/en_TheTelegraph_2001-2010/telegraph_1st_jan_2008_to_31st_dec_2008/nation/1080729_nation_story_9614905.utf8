The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Speaker silent in strong case
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Speaker silent in strong case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chatterjee                                  
	Calcutta, July 28: Somnath Chatterjee arrived in Calcutta this morning but despite being chased by the media all day, did not speak out against his former party.        
	Asked why he was keeping mum when CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has been justifying his expulsion, Chatterjee jocularly suggested that those with a strong case can afford to be silent.        
	This means my case is strong. I will speak at an appropriate time, he said, promising to bare his mind in a day or two.        
	The Lok Sabha Speaker is expected to meet CPM veteran Jyoti Basu before returning to Delhi tomorrow. Sources close to Chatterjee said he would decide his course of action only after speaking to Basu.        
	Soon after meeting his mentor, however, the Speaker would be Kuala Lumpur-bound to attend the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference from August 1.        
	Among Chatterjees former comrades, only Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim turned up at Raj Bhavan to meet him, apparently to fine-tune the details of their Kuala Lumpur visit.         
	Chatterjee visited an ailing sister at a private hospital this evening before driving to a second sisters home in Salt Lake. From there, late in the evening, he again said: Let me see what everybody (the CPM leaders) has to say. I will leave it to the people to decide (whether the expulsion was justified).        
	The CPM will be happy if he continues in this vein. A Marxist MP today hinted the party would not attack the Speaker if he didnt attack the party. What is the need for public acrimony; after all, he hasnt said anything against the CPM, he said.        
	Many Bengal CPM leaders feel Chatterjees expulsion could harm them, and the party has so far indicated it wants neither a public showdown nor a no-trust vote against him. A party leader said members had been told to distance themselves from the attacks on Chatterjee by the Forward Bloc and RSP.        
	Karat had yesterday described Chatterjee as a valuable comrade at the party state committee meeting.        
	A central committee member, however, suggested the CPM leadership had deliberately added Chatterjees name to the list of MPs handed to the President on July 9 despite getting a hint of his reluctance.         
	The committee member, who didnt wish to be identified, claimed Karat had called Chatterjee on July 9 morning and requested him to resign. Somnathda said he would give his opinion in writing.        
	After Karat submitted his name, he sent him a letter the same evening, stating his opposition to the partys decision and declining to step down.

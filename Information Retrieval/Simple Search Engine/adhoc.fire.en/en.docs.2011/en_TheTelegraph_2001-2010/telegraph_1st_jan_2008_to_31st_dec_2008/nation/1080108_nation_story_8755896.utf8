	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Supreme Court has reinstated a lineman who was sacked 13 years ago after he lost his eyesight, making it clear that protection for the disabled was not charity but a right as equal citizens.
    
	This case highlights the highly insensitive and apathetic attitude harboured by some of us, living a normal healthy life, towards those unfortunate fellowmen who fall victim to some incapacitating disability, a two-judge bench said.
    
	The ruling came on a petition by Bhagwan Dass, who joined the Punjab State Electricity Board in 1977 but lost his vision in 1994 while still in service. According to the board, the lineman was absent without sanctioned leave from January 18, 1994, to March 21, 1997. He was issued two memos to rejoin duty, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated for gross misconduct after he failed to do so.
    
	A year later, Dass wrote to the board explaining his absence and pleaded for the induction of his wife in his place. But the board used the letter to claim that he had sought voluntary retirement and terminated his employment.
    
	The Supreme Court, however, said the facts revealed the officers of the board were aware of the statutory rights of the appellant and their obligation. Yet, they denied him his lawful dues by means that can only be called disingenuous.
    
	The court restored his job and ruled that he would be entitled to all benefits, including annual increments and promotions, till the date of his retirement.
    
	The rights of an employee who becomes disabled are protected by Section 47 of the Persons with Disabi- lities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.
    
	The appellant was a Class IV employee, a lineman. He completely lost his vision. He was not aware of any protection that the law afforded him and apparently believed that blindness would cause him to lose his job, the source of livelihood for his family. In these circumstances, it was the duty of the superior officers to tell him about his legal rights. Instead, they threw him out of service by picking up a sentence from his letter completely out of context, the court said.
    
	The court added that the boards action reflected the old mindset that it was not right to spend good money on someone who is no longer of any use.
    
	The officers were duty-bound to follow the law, and it was not open to allow their bias to defeat the lawful rights of the disabled employee.
    
	The officials, the court said, also failed to realise that the disabled, too, are equal citizens of the country and have as much share in its resources as any other citizen.
    
	The denial of their rights would not only be unjust and unfair to them and their families but would create larger and graver problems for society at large. What the law permits them is not charity or largesse but their right as equal citizens of the country, the court said.

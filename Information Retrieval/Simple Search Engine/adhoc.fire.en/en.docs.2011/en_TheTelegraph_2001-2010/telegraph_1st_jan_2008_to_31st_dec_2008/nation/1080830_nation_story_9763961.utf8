          SHEENA K.                                             
	Raipur, Aug. 29: Naxalites killed six Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, including an officer, by detonating a powerful landmine in Narayanpur district this morning.        
	The incident occurred an hour before BJP president Rajnath Singh landed here with an appeal to the rebels to shun violence and return to the social mainstream. Violence is not a solution to any problem and Naxalites should give up arms and return to the mainstream, Singh said at a party event.        
	The five CRPF jawans of the 43rd Battalion led by company commandant R.S. Kang left to inaugurate a road in the interiors of Narayanpur, around 300km from here, this morning. The battalion drove into a well-planned ambush laid by the Maoists near Cheribedi, some 350km from Raipur, between Narayanpur and Kondagaon in the Benur police station area. The blast that occurred around 11.30am killed all the personnel on the spot.        
	According to additional director-general of police (intelligence) Girdhari Nayak, the blast was so powerful that the commander jeep in which the personnel were travelling in was ripped apart under the impact. He added that parts of the bodies were found hanging from trees.        
	After receiving the information, senior police officers from Narayanpur and Bastar rushed to the spot with additional forces and security personnel sealing off the Narayanpur-Kondagaon route.         
	The officers said that it was still not clear if the rebels had taken away the jawans arms and ammunition after the ambush. Once the officers return from the spot, the point would be clear, said an officer at the state police headquarters.        
	Villager shot dead        
	Armed Maoists gunned down a villager and kidnapped another at Itwachapachrukhi village in Bihars Munger district.        
	Deputy superintendent of police Arvind Thakur said that more than 40 heavily armed Naxalites wearing police uniform swooped down on the village late last night and shot Fantoosh Yadav dead and kidnapped another villager, Kamleshwari Yadav.         
	Thakur said both Fantoosh and Kameshwari had close links with a criminal gang headed by Vinodi Yadav.

          SHEENA K                          Firebrand: Prakash Karat                                  
	Raipur, Sept. 28: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will face CPM heat during her proposed visit to India in the first week of October to operationalise the nuclear deal.        
	We have come to know that Rice is arriving on October 3 or 4, and the party is planning to lodge a protest against her visit that is aimed to sign the 123 Agreement, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today.        
	The CPM will be calling a meeting of like-minded parties soon in New Delhi to give final shape to the strategy. After discussion with other parties, we will disclose the nuclear deal protest details, Karat said. The party would, however, not invite the BJP for the meeting.        
	The CPM boss said the protest would be nationwide and the party could observe a black day on the day Rice signs the agreement.         
	The CPM leader also added that he was hopeful that Tata Motors would decide to stay in Bengal and said that the ball was in Tatas court now.         
	Now, its not up to us. Tata Motors will take the final call, Karat said today, when asked that the party leadership thought of the Bengal agitation.         
	The Bengal government has done all that it could do, Karat said.         
	The CPM general-secretary said the Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was making last-ditch efforts to retain the project and had written letter to Ratan Tata, who had agreed for parleys.         
	The youth in Bengal are reeling under the unemployment problem, Karat said, adding that only big industrial projects, such as the Tatas Singur plant, could address the problem and the government understands that well.         
	Talking about the issue of land, the Left leader pointed out that in the past 25 years, the CPM government has distributed 11 lakh acres to the land-less people in the state.         
	It is because of the states strong land reforms that Naxalites did not get room to grow in Bengal. Now, the rebels are coming in from the neighbouring states; committing crime and then returning to their states, Karat said.

          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: Its testing times for the men in khaki in the state.        
	Inspectors under the police commissionerate system in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack would soon appear for a written test on the Orissa Urban Police Act, 2003.        
	Police commissioner Bijay Sharma, who wanted the tests be done as soon as possible, said it was important for a policeman to be well-versed with the sections and sub-sections of the act.         
	The new act  first-of-its-kind in the state  authorises the police commissioner with adequate legal power and authority to dispose of cases of its own. The act for us is like the Bible, Gita or Quran. But for reasons, including time constraints, many of the police officers havent been able to get into the nitty-gritty of the new act, said Sharma.        
	This has triggered the commissinerate to decide upon a written test so that our officers can internalise the act, he said.        
	The matter has been put at a high-level meeting and a formal notice would soon be sent to all the police stations.         
	Orissa introduced the police commissionerate system in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack since January 1. The urban policing system came into being following the adoption of a bill to this effect in the Assembly in December 2003 and subsequent presidential consent. Cash awards would be given to candidates who fare first, second and third.

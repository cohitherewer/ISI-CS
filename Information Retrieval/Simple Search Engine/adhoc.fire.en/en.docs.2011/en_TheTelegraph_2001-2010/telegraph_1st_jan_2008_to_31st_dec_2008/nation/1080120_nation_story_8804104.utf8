     CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The government should stop assigning schoolteachers to man election booths or collect data for the administration, the National Knowledge Commission will tell the Prime Minister.
    
	We have received complaints from teachers across the country that their assessment at work is linked not to their performance in class but outside it, said a member of the Sam Pitroda-led commission, which is finalising a white paper on school education.
    
	Teachers should not be expected to do poll duty. Else, their teaching will suffer, the member added.
    
	Last month, the Supreme Court had asked the Election Commission to ensure that teachers were not put on poll duty during school hours.
    
	The commission will also tell the government that public-funded institutions should form the backbone of school education, in contrast to its recommendation for greater private participation in higher education.
    
	Good government-run schools like the Navodaya Vidyalayas or the Kendriya Vidyalayas are what we need to ensure universal, quality education, the member said.
    
	Although the knowledge commission wants the government to de-regularise higher education, it will recommend constant evaluation of schools performance.
    
	Minimum common standards, including those for learning outcomes, should be prescribed for each level in both government and private schools. Key performance indicators (should) be developed for measurement, a draft of the plan document says.
    
	The draft asks the government to borrow the expertise of Navodaya Vidyalaya and Kendriya Vidyalaya teachers to train those in other schools. 
    
	It also recommends five IIT-level teacher training and research institutes.
    
	In its school education report, the commission has given the government a hundred out of hundred on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
    
	The commission, set up to suggest plans to transform India into a knowledge society, has so far addressed the administration of higher education at the Centre. But Pitroda said the body now planned to work increasingly with the state governments.
    
	Over the past two weeks, I have met the chief ministers of Orissa, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. Based on our research in these states, we are making local-level recommendations to these governments, he told a news conference today.
    
	The commission will hand the plan document to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in March, senior members said.

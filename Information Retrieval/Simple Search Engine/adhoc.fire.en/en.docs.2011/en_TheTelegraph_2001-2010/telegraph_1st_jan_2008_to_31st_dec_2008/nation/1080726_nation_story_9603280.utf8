          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Forensic experts collect evidence from a site. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, July 25: Technology titans scrambled to tighten security across their plants and facilities in Bangalore and other parts of Karnataka after a series of low-intensity blasts rocked Indias Silicon Valley today.         
	Companies like Infosys and Wipro said they had advised their employees  who came from various parts of the country as well as abroad  to exercise caution as they moved around in the city.         
	All our employees are safe and there has been no impact on our business operations, Infosys said in a statement today.         
	Bangalore has suffered bomb blasts across many locations today. The government and law enforcement authorities have assured all citizens that they will investigate and take all steps to apprehend those responsible. All of us support the government in this endeavour, it added.         
	Wipro said it was closely monitoring the situation. We have initiated enhanced security measures as per our standard operating procedure across locations. None of our employees or facilities in Bangalore has been affected, a Wipro official said.         
	Kalyan Mohan, vice-president and head of Cognizants Bangalore operations, said: It was business as usual at Cognizant Bangalore today. The company has more than 4,300 associates in Bangalore who work at the five facilities in the city and all of them are safe.         
	We have advised our employees to exercise utmost care and refrain from moving around in public places until the situation is normal. We have beefed up security at all our facilities and are closely monitoring the situation, Mohan said.         
	US technology giants Intel and Microsoft, which also have a strong presence in Bangalore, refused to comment on the blasts and the ripple effect on their operations.         
	However, officials at IBM  which recently said it had recorded phenomenal growth in its operations in India  said they were in touch with local authorities.         
	We will take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of our employees, an official said.         
	Bangalore is Indias information technology hub. Software exports from Karnataka touched Rs 19,500 crore in the first six months of 2007-08. Almost 90 per cent of these exports came out of facilities in Bangalore. The blasts could potentially damage Indias image as one of the worlds premier IT hubs.

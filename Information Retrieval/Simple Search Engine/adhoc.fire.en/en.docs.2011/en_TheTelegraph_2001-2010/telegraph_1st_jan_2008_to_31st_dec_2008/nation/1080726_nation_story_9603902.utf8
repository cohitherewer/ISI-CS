	 New Delhi, July 25: Amar Singh is keeping his cards close to his chest on whether the Samajwadi Party would join the government.        
	I am a humble party worker, Amar, who is the party general secretary, said. This question should be posed either to party president Mulayam Singh Yadav or to Sonia Gandhi, he said in response to questions whether his party would share power with the UPA.        
	Reports have been doing the rounds that the Congress wants the Samajwadis to join the government.         
	Amar had criticised petroleum minister Murli Deora and finance minister P. Chidambaram before the nuclear deal trust vote.        
	The criticism was taken to mean that the Samajwadi Party was eyeing the petroleum ministry.         
	After the trust vote, speculation has added the defence ministry to the partys alleged wish list.        
	When journalists repeatedly raised questions today, Amar said there had been no communication on the matter of portfolios with any UPA constituent.         
	We dont want any friction among coalition partners, he said.         
	Sources said Samajwadi Party leaders were in touch with the government discreetly to discuss mainly two matters.         
	First, about joining the government with the portfolios the party wanted. Second, review the progress the CBI had made in cases against Samajwadi leaders.         
	Today, asked about the defamation case that the party said it would file against three BJP members, who claimed in the Lok Sabha that Samajwadi leaders had tried to buy them, Amar said the statement was made in a fit of disappointment and sadness.         
	He said, contrary to the BJPs fascist tendencies of attacking MPs who had defied the party whip, the Samajwadi Partys workers had not reacted violently even when six of its members had broken away. We may formally expel them (the six) tomorrow, he said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Progeny priority for Cong tickets
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Sonia, Rahul				                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Sonia Gandhis call to end the quota system in ticket distribution in elections and Rahul Gandhis plea to do away with family networks in politics have been a given a go-by by the Congress.        
	The first list of candidates for the state elections in November and December suggests factional leaders continue to call the shots, irrespective of criteria such as winnability and competence that Sonia wanted. True to the Congress tradition, family connections also mattered.         
	Among the 35 names on the Chhattisgarh list were those of the progeny of the Congress national treasurer, Motilal Vora, and a former central minister, Arvind Netam.         
	Arun Vora was given a ticket for the Durg city seat despite losing the last two elections. Priti Netam was nominated from the Narayanpur Assembly seat even though her father had left the Congress some years ago  for the Bahujan Samaj Party first and then the BJP.        
	Sources said Priti was accommodated because of Arvind Netams influence, albeit limited, in tribal areas. Aruns claim was he was the son of a veteran loyalist of 10 Janpath.        
	The argument was that Vora senior was the fulcrum of Chhattisgarhs Brahmin faction which, by itself, was not capable of contributing many votes but could do irreparable damage if not obliged.         
	Vora and the former chief minister, Ajit Jogi, who wanted to lead the elections from the front, bought peace with the promise that Arun would get a ticket.        
	In Madhya Pradesh, the initial assessment was that even if the Congress had a chance of swinging the elections, its myriad factional heads could spoil the show.         
	The sources said that barring the state party chief, Suresh Pachauri, the other regional satraps, including Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Arjun Singhs son Ajay, were vying for a share of the ticket pie to bolster their chances or those of their nominees.        
	The sources claimed that the members on the Madhya Pradesh screening committee, evolved a formula of consensus. This meant instead of going by textbook attributes like winnability and merit, the seats should be equitably divided among the claimants so that the Congress could work in harmony.        
	In Rajasthan, Sonia and Rahuls proposal to give the Congress a youthful coat by denying tickets to the 70- plus was shot down by state leaders who pointed out that it did not apply to those in the Centre.         
	They asked why MPs who either lost the Lok Sabha polls (Shivraj Patil) or did not contest (Arjun and A.K. Antony) were rewarded with Rajya Sabha berths and ministerships.        
	Several Rajasthan leaders  state president P.C. Joshi and central ministers Sisram Ola and Namo Narayan Meena  are jockeying for tickets for their nominees as the former chief minister, Ashok Gehlot, backed by the general secretary in charge of the state, Mukul Wasnik, were determined to have their way.         
	For the record, Wasnik stated that proper procedures were followed.

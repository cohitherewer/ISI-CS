          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 4: The Opposition today lambasted chief minister Naveen Patnaik accusing him of shielding tainted ministers and corrupt BJD leaders.         
	According to the governments admissions, six of its ministers are accused in criminal cases, said the deputy leader of the Opposition, Narasingha Mishra, while initiating a debate on the budgetary demand for grants relating to the home department that also controls the police administration.         
	How can there be a rule of law here when one-fourth of our ministers are accused or involved in criminal offences? How can we expect better from our people? said Mishra, a former law minister.         
	Three criminal cases are pending against one of the ministers, he pointed out, stating that one of them was lodged by the ministers mother. She, he fumed, had lodged a complaint with the police alleging that the minister possessed illegal firearms.        
	The investigation into the case against the minister is yet to start even after a lapse of a year. And he has not yet been called for an interrogation, the Opposition leader said.        
	It appears that there is a separate set of law for ministers in this state, he said, while disagreeing with the chief ministers claim that his government believes in rule of law and has provided a clean and transparent administration.         
	Referring to the recent allegation of sexual misdemeanour of revenue minister Manmohan Samal, the Opposition leader alleged that the chief minister gave an incomplete statement in the Assembly yesterday regarding the matter and left it mid way.        
	Naveen Patnaik asked the members to place further evidence in the floor of the House. He could have asked the law officers to conduct scientific tests of the minister and the lady in question for his evidence, said Mishra, who also happens to be a criminal lawyer.         
	He also alleged that two other ministers indulged in sexual misdemeanour during their visits to Mumbai and demanded that the government start up an inquiry into the matter  if they wished to stop people from talking.        
	Alleging that Naveen was also shielding corrupt BJD leaders, Mishra reminded all of a Reserve Bank of India statement  pointing out to a Rs 33-crore scam in Orissa State Co-operative Bank and imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on it. But, he added, the vigilance department was sitting silent because the bank was headed by a general secretary of BJD.         
	Naveen Patnaik has closed his eyes to land scams in Bhubaneswar, funds misuse in Western Orissa Development Council and a Rs 38-crore water scam, he added.

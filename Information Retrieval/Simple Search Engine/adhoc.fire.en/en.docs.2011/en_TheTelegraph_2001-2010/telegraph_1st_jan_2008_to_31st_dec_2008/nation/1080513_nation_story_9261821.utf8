          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 12: An SDJM court today rejected the bail plea of Raja Acharya, the prime accused in the Biranchi Das murder case.        
	Raja continued to plead his innocence in the court and added that he was framed.         
	He alleged that former IAS official Priyabrata Pattnaik and actresses Leslie Tripathy and Bidhusmita had threatened to frame him in the murder of the coach, if he did not withdraw his threat of releasing a compromising MMS involving Leslie to the media.         
	We will appeal in the higher court, said Bana Mohanty, Rajas lawyer.         
	In yet another development, the home department today suspended a sub-inspector and a constable of Bargarh police station on charges of negligence of duty.         
	The two were responsible of taking Raja to the Capital Hospital yesterday. The gangster, before being taken to the hospital for medical check-up and before being produced in court, had spoken with reporters.        
	Meanwhile, the inspector-general (prisons), V. Thiagrajan, said that Raja Acharya was not someone too difficult for the jail authorities to handle.         
	He also said that the Orissa government had planned to set up two central jails with better facilities and higher security.        
	Today, meanwhile, was Rajas second day in Jharpada jail. The gangster has been lodged in a separate cell while his associates, Chagala and Tukuna, who have been given separate cells to avoid any untoward incident.        
	Earlier, Jharpada jail authorities had believed that the flamboyant gangster would be too difficult for them to handle.         
	Some 570 inmates, including more than 100 convicts, are lodged in Jharpada jail.         
	When Raja was arrested in connection with the Leslie harassment episode, the jail authorities had apprehended a gang war and shifted Raja to Khurda jail. Later, he was shifted to Dhenkanal Jail.        
	More than 30 dreaded criminals, including Hyder, Anil Chhotray and Raja, are lodged in the Jharpada jail now, besides Rajas brother Deepak, close associates Tukuna and Chagala.

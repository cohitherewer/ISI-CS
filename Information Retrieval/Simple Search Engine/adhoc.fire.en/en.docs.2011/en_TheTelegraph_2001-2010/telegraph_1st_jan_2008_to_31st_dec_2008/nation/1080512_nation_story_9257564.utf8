          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Purulia, May 11: Maoists today blew up a Border Security Force patrol vehicle on election duty, killing one jawan in Purulias Bandwan area.        
	Seven others who were part of the patrol and the driver of the truck were injured in the landmine blast.        
	Bandwan is a known Maoist hotbed. In December 2005, CPM district secretariat member Rabindranath Kar and his wife were burnt alive by rebels. On May 5 this year, suspected Maoists shot dead a CPM leader.        
	According to police, the blast occurred around 5.30pm when the eight BSF jawans of the 39th battalion were patrolling the densely forested area between Sirka and Gangamanna, about 15km from the Jharkhand border, in the truck.         
	The dead jawan has been identified as 45-year-old Ali Akbar Sheikh.        
	The injured jawans are B.R. Nehru, Pradip Kumar Singh, B.C. Lakhani, Swarup Singh, Jitendra Singh, Suresh Singh and Anil Singh. The driver, Ashok Mondal, is a resident of the area. They were all taken to the Bandwan block hospital.         
	Three of the injured jawans are in a critical condition and were shifted to the Purulia district hospital tonight, said Ramprasad Mondal, who was treating the injured in the block hospital.        
	Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: It is the handiwork of Maoists from Jharkhand. We have contacted our counterparts in Jharkhand and joint raids are being conducted in the area to arrest the culprits.         
	He said the government had apprehended that such strikes would occur during the panchayat polls that were held in Purulia today. That is why we have intensified vigil along the Jharkhand-Bengal border by deploying more forces.        
	Inspector-general of police, law and order, Raj Kanojia said senior police officials had rushed to the area. Inspector-general, western range, R.K. Gupta and Purulia superintendent of police Ashok Prasad have reached the spot.         
	Since 2004, the rebels have used landmines to target the forces.         
	In February 2004, seven policemen and a driver were killed when a landmine blew up a jeep in the Kankrajhor forests in West Midnapore.        
	In October 2004, six jawans were killed in a landmine blast in Bankisole in West Midnapores Lalgarh area. In February 2006, two policemen were killed when Maoists blew up their vehicle in Belpahari, West Midnapore.        
	Later today, two reporters and two photographers of a TV channel were beaten up by BSF personnel when they went to cover the blast. They were admitted to the block hospital.

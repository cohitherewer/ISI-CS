   OUR CORRESPONDENT
   
	Gaya, Jan. 15: Recent unholy developments in Bodh Gaya have led to observers questioning if the post of chief priest in the Mahabodhi Temple is jinxed.
 
	The manner in which three previous holders of the now-vacant post mdash; Bhadant Bodhipal, Bhadant Prajyasheel and Bhadant Gyan Jagat mdash; had to face early retirement has managed to raise eyebrows. 
 
	Former chief priest Bhadant Bodhipal faces charges of ordering a temple employee to cut a branch of the Maha Bodhi tree. His petition seeking anticipatory bail in this regard was rejected recently.
 
	The post began to see troubles a decade ago mdash; with Bhadant Gyan Jagat mdash; when he was called a VHP mole.
 
	Photographs of Gyan Jagat accompanying a VHP delegation, led by Acharya Giriraj Kishore to Bhutan, were flashed in the media and his name figured in the Marg Darshak Mandal of the VHP. 
 
	Neo-Buddhists, led by Bhadant Surai Sasai, a missionary who denounced his Japanese citizenship to promote Buddhism the land of Lord Buddha, converted the monks VHP-connection into an issue. 
 
	To Bhadant Gyan Jagats credit, the priest disappeared from Bodh Gaya and his whereabouts are not known till date. His unceremonious and mysterious departure started a war among monks to occupy his post. 
 
	Bhadant Prajyasheel, who was at the forefront of the anti-Gyan Jagat tirade, subsequently became the secretary-cum-chief priest of the shrine. But, things did not go well for Prajyasheel as well. 
 
	On November 5, 1999, a Malaysian pilgrim, Radha A.K.P.C. Panickar, wrote a complaint to the temple chairman levelling charges of misconduct against the chief priest (a copy of which is still with Gaya newspapers). 
 
	In her complaint, Panickar alleged that Prajyasheel had no control over physical pleasures and discarded the robe to spent time in Oshos ashram at Pune. Panickar added the priest did not have stable character. 
 
	Prajyasheel, while conceding that he had been to Oshos ashram, rubbished the other charges levelled by Panickar. In his defence he said that a monk from Sri Lanka had misled Panickar to write the complaint. Prajyasheel also said that he was at Oshos ashram to learn meditation techniques and had temporarily discarded his robe as the Ashram had its own dress code.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Pakistani army was alleged to have fired at a BSF post in Jammu and Kashmir today in the latest cross-border firing but Delhi was still expecting the conflict to be localised and the ceasefire along the Line of Control to hold.         
	This year, there have been more cross-border firing incidents, defence minister A.K. Antony said shortly after the report from Jammu. But it does not mean that the entire border is troublesome. Even now, I feel we have to hold on to the ceasefire.        
	The BSF today reported firing targeted at one of their posts in Poonch.         
	We are doing our best to ensure such things do not happen, Antony said. The forces have been asked to keep the border peaceful and prevent attempts at infiltration by militants. By and large, they are able to do it so there is no cause for worry.

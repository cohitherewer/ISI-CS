	New Delhi, Feb. 29: If the NDA saw India Shining four years ago, the Congresss theme song today was India Suffering. And the Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for farmers was at its centre.        
	The Prime Minister said writing off the loans was a very unorthodox response and patted his finance minister in the back for living up to his reputation.        
	We keep talking about the animal spirits of businessmen. But I think the farmers are the biggest businessmen of our country. They produce essential commodities required by us. If their animal spirits are depressed, it is not good for the country, Manmohan Singh said, according to PTI.        
	Sonia Gandhi praised the measure as a revolutionary step and her young MPs took the cue.        
	The budget has offered the largest-ever package to farmers in India. Earlier governments talked about giving debt relief  even the so-called pro-people V.P. Singh government. But nobody did it, said Haryana MP Deepinder Singh Hooda.        
	It is historic and proof of the moral conviction this government carries, Dausa MP Sachin Pilot crowed.        
	It was carnival time around the Congress headquarters and Sonias residence. Hooda herded a crowd of farmers to 10 Janpath.        
	Soniaji feels the pain of the Indian farmer in her heart, the Haryana MP said.        
	That the Congress chief was the centrepiece of Chidambarams budget didnt need underlining. Manmohan Singh drove to 10 Janpath to meet the farmers soon after Parliament adjourned.        
	While Hooda was marshalling Haryana peasants for the past couple of days, the Congress had asked its state units to organise farmers gatherings in the capitals to propagate the message of Budget 2008 from the start.        
	Asked if the budget contained the hint of an election ahead of schedule, a cabinet minister said: Its wrong to call it a poll budget. Its a consolidation budget. Our revenue earning has been phenomenal and with it we want to bail out farmers and build schools, hospitals and rural infrastructure.        
	Sources said the Congress was undecided about an early poll for several reasons:        
	The party needs time to ensure that the message of the budgets positive spinoffs reaches everywhere. Given that we arent adept at advertising our achievements, this will be a long haul, the minister said        
	Much depends on this years monsoon. If its a drought year, the positive impact of the budget could dry up        
	The Left and the allies would have to be brought on board        
	The Assembly polls will be fought on the plank of anti-incumbency against the BJP regimes. So its better not to bring the Centre into the frame, a source said.

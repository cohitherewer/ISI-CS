          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 5: Army headquarters was today perturbed after the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha singled out the army chief for criticism during the debate on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address.        
	BJP leader Jaswant Singh called to question a statement by army chief General Deepak Kapoor that disputes along the India-China border resulted from a difference of perception.         
	Such a statement, Singh said, is unwarranted and irresponsible. He added that Kapoor is not the authority to comment on border disputes. If you have given him that authority, you should revise it.        
	Army sources say Kapoors observation that the dispute arose because of differing perceptions is only a reiteration of government policy.

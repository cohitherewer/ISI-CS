          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: The BJP central leaderships attempt to distance itself from Pragya Singh Thakur, the sadhvi held for last months Malegaon blast, has sparked unease in the Sangh parivar.        
	The BJPs first reaction was that the Congress was conspiring to malign Hindutva outfits by weaving a false case.         
	But wary of being clubbed with those who supported the terror accused in the Jamianagar encounter in Delhi, the BJP altered its position.         
	Senior leader Yashwant Sinha told the media that the BJP wanted the law to take its own course.         
	BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudi said there was no question of defending the Malegaon blast accused. Pragya Singh Thakur left the ABVP long ago. She had no links with the Sangh parivar. The party has nothing to do with her, he said.         
	But the unambiguous stance of the central leadership was at variance with the position taken by the party units in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.         
	Even the feedback the party got from its cadre did not match its hands-off stand.         
	Sources said that a large section of Hindutva forces expected the BJP to be aggressive on this issue and did not want it to surrender before the secular forces who were eager to equate this minor incident with other instances of terrorism.         
	Middle-rung RSS leaders want the BJP to clearly articulate that retaliatory action was understandable in the wake of over 50,000 people falling prey to jihad in recent years.         
	One BJP leader said: There is no need to be defensive. We should learn from what Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi said and confront those who seek to equate Hindu and Muslim terrorism.         
	Joshi had argued that some Hindu outfits were feeling enraged because of the Congress-led governments inaction in fighting terrorism. Some sections of the BJP felt that the desire to be politically correct had confused the leadership.         
	The sources said the BJPs plan to launch a massive campaign, timed with the approaching Assembly polls, on the support given to those accused in the Jamianagar encounter could be the first casualty of the confusion.        
	A Nashik court today gave permission to investigators to carry out polygraph and narco tests and brain mapping on the sadhvi.

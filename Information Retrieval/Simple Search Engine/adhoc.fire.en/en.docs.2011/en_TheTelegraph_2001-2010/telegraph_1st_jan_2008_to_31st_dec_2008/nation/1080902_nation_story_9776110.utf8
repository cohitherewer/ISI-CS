          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Supreme Court today upheld a controversial Maharashtra legislation to check organised crime, clearing the way for several states planning tough laws after the lapse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.        
	Gujarat has already passed its organised crime act for the second time and sent it to the President for her approval. Similar laws framed by Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra and Madhya Pradesh are either waiting for presidential assent or for approval before they are introduced in the state legislatures.         
	A three-judge apex court bench headed by the chief justice ruled that Maharashtra was well within its powers to enact the tough Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, which is already in force. The court also upheld certain controversial sections  13, 14, 15 and 16  of the law that allowed state police to tap oral or electronic communication.        
	Phone or wire intercepts are recognised as corroborative evidence under the Evidence Act but are admissible as independent evidence under special laws like the MCOCA.        
	Bombay High Court had in March 2003 struck down these sections following an appeal by diamond merchant Bharat Shah. In his petition, Shah, who had allegedly threatened certain Bollywood actors through underworld don Chhota Shakeel to act in a film he had financed, said these provisions already existed in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1955.        
	The state government then appealed to the Supreme Court against the high court judgment, which said only the central government was empowered to draw up such special laws like the organised crime act.        
	Todays verdict could impact the trial in the 7/11 train blasts and the Malegoan explosions as phone, wire or oral taps will be treated as admissible evidence.

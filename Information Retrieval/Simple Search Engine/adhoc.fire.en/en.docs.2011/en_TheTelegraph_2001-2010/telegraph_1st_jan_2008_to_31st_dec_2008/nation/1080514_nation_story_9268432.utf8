          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, May 13: Delhis youth have little to say cheers to. Their government has decided that the official age for sipping alcohol will not be lowered from 25 years.        
	The government does not want to appear soft in front of the BJP before the general elections, sources said, but Generation Now is miffed.         
	If you can marry at 21, why cant you drink? asked Karan Nayyar, who has just graduated from college. Even now, most places dont ask for an identity card if you look old enough. If they had lowered the age, then at least people would have respected it (the law) a bit more.         
	It is difficult for the youth in Delhi to stay away from booze, synonymous with a good time and loud music, when their counterparts in other cities can guzzle their first beers at an earlier age. In Calcutta, the freedom comes at 18.        
	Punjab and Haryana youths, however, are as unlucky as Delhis. They, too, have to wait to turn 25 if they dont want to break the law.        
	According to rules, those below 25 in Delhi can buy booze, and serve it, but cant take a swig.        
	The president of the Delhi Wine Club, Subhash Arora, said: It is a completely political decision.         
	Arora would like the bar to come down to 18. I think people should be allowed to drink at 18 and if there is a parent present, it should be 16.         
	Psychologist Rajat Mitra said the governments refusal to lower the age would only encourage the youth. All over the world, it has been seen that such laws make the young rebel more. The age of experimentation is 18 to 20, when kids first taste freedom. They associate alcohol with this. You need to have control mechanisms than just these laws.         
	Last year, the Supreme Court had lowered the age of bartending from 25 years to 21 and allowed women to be employed in bars. But chief minister Sheila Dikshit has now said the age limit for women bartenders will stand at 25.         
	This (the law) is stupid, said Samira Sood, a publishing industry professional. People have been drinking anyway. The law hasnt stopped them. The government may think it is pleasing voters, but the young people voting for the first time will not be pleased.

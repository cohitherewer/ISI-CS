          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Clever language might be used to overcome the trouble encountered by the draft proposal to exempt India from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) rules for civilian nuclear trade, a senior nuclear scientist said today.        
	The 45-member NSG met in Vienna on August 21-22 but failed to agree on the draft proposal it had received from the US on a waiver agreement to facilitate nuclear trade with India. A small number of NSG countries want the waiver to address their views on non-proliferation and have expressed their resistance to a blanket waiver.         
	If this goes through, it will only be by fixing language (of the waiver document), said A.N. Prasad, former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, who has been among critics of the proposed civilian nuclear deal.         
	What happened yesterday was no surprise at all, Prasad told The Telegraph. It would have been stupid to expect that all the NSG member countries would agree to unconditional nuclear supplies (to India), he said.         
	Prasad said even if subtle changes acceptable to all the NSG members and to India were introduced in the waiver document through language fixing, the non-proliferation intent would remain. The intent is to get India to give up the testing option, he said.         
	We walked into a trap, said P.K. Iyengar, a physicist and former chairman of Indias atomic energy commission. It should have been obvious that some NSG countries have their own perceptions about non-proliferation.         
	Iyengar said Delhi should have pursued civilian nuclear trade through bilateral pacts that would have allowed India to negotiate with each nuclear supplier. What nuclear supplies do Austria, Ireland or New Zealand have to provide? he asked.         
	In a statement that appeared to echo these sentiments, the CPM politburo today described the NSG waiver as another surrender in the offing.         
	Whatever wording the US will make in a revised draft, as in the case of the 123 Agreement and the IAEA safeguards agreement, the NSG waiver will be in conformity with the unacceptable conditions of the Hyde Act, it said.         
	The whole attempt is to see that a text of the waiver is so drafted that will allow the Indian government to claim it has virtually got a clean waiver, the CPM politburo said.         
	Non-proliferation analysts have argued that supply of foreign nuclear fuel to Indias civilian nuclear plants would free Indias limited domestic fuel supplies to be channelled into its nuclear weapons programme.         
	This would be inconsistent with NSG commitments not to assist in any way the nuclear weapons programme of another country, Daryl Kimbal, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based think tank, had said earlier this month in an analysis of the draft waiver document.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussie apology to sex-slur actress
                                          
	Melbourne, June 8 (PTI): Tania Zaetta, the Australian actress in Bollywood who was accused of having sex with Australian troops during an entertainment tour in Afghanistan, has said the scandal not only tarnished her image but also affected her health.        
	In an interview to OK! magazine, Zaetta said she was ill and had lost weight since the rumours were published on May 22. Ive never felt so sick to the stomach. I could not eat and felt like throwing up for four days.         
	The head of the Australian defence force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, confirmed there was no substance to the allegations in a leaked defence briefing paper and sent her a personal letter of apology on Friday.        
	Zaetta said she had yet to receive an apology from fellow-entertainer Angry Anderson, the source of the allegations, or Sydneys The Daily Telegraph, which ran the hot issues brief detailing the second-hand claims.         
	The 37-year-old, who has been trying to build a career with bit roles in Bollywood productions and had starred in the recent release Mr. Black Mr White, said she still did not know how the scandal was allowed to erupt.         
	Who will make up such a vicious rumour? I also want to stand up for the special forces soldiers and their wives and families, they have been unfairly defamed as much as I have, throughout all this, The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Zaetta as telling the popular lifestyle magazine.         
	Her agent, Max Markson, has estimated that the sex slur could cause the actress a loss of $1 million in earnings from Bollywood.        
	She is trying to get away from all the stress of the past few weeks. We will plan the rebuilding of her career. I know she would love to get a radio gig or return to a role on television, he added.

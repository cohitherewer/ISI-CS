	New Delhi, May 6: Connaught Place, the capitals commercial hub, turned into a seething mass of students today as hundreds hit the streets against the move to reserve seats for Other Backward Classes in institutes of higher learning.        
	The protest, meant to be a silent demonstration in the form of a human chain, took a violent turn after the students refused to lift the blockade.        
	Students from various colleges began assembling at Central Park around 2 this afternoon, shouting slogans against HRD minister Arjun Singh and the Congress-led government. Some burnt effigies of coalition chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Arjun while others blocked the roads.        
	Police rushed over hundred personnel to the protest site and used water cannons to disperse the students, who numbered more than 700. More than 200 were detained.        
	The main demands of the students were no reservation in postgraduate courses, specifying the duration of the reservation policy and a minimum cut-off for admissions in the OBC category.        
	We are not against the reservation policy. We want the government to review the antique census figures of possible beneficiaries and ensure that the deserving get the benefits of reservation, said Anirudh Lochan, one of the protesters.         
	The protesters also demanded that a right to education law be enacted to ensure free and compulsory education for children between six and 14.         
	If it really wants to raise the standard of living of the backward classes, the government must ensure quality education at the basic level and ensure a level playing field for everyone, said Abhishek Bansal, who heads the students union at Maulana Azad Medical College. The Supreme Court has laid down guidelines and were demanding nothing more than the governments compliance with those guidelines.        
	The government is planning a news conference tomorrow to clarify its stand on reservations in postgraduate courses.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 23: A doctor from Bihar, Dharmatma Singh, was allegedly abducted from Siwan, a district town in north Bihar, 140km from here today. 
    
	Police suspect five unidentified men to be involved in the act. The doctor was kidnapped from Tarwara Chowk on the outskirts of Patna. The police believe that Singh was pushed into a vehicle while on his way to his chamber around 11am. Singhs wife (name withheld) received a call from her husband soon afterwards where he confirmed the news. That call was followed by the kidnappers who asked the wife to pay up.
    
	The doctor has a good bank balance. Give it to us, otherwise we will kill him, she was told by the voice at the other end. Superintendent of police, Siwan, confirmed the incident. 
    
	He, however, said: There may be some foul play involved and we are looking into all angles.

  - Swarms of mosquitoes leave Bihar babus at wits end        SANTOSH SINGH                                                  
	Patna, April 15: If you hear a hum in Bihar government offices this time of the year, it may not mean work has taken on wings and files are flying off desks.        
	Rather, employees say, the hum relates to the biggest obstacle to work: mosquitoes on the prowl.        
	Come March and the stings-on-wings emerge from every dark corner of the dingy, cluttered offices, presenting a stubborn new enemy to babus fabled for spending their workday swatting flies.        
	So, enter any of the 50-odd halls at the old and new secretariat, Vidhan Sabha, collectorate or the other government buildings along Bailey Road, and you can see smoke curl from under the rows of tables.        
	The 20,000 employees below section-officer rank would rather forget their lunch but not their mosquito repellent coils.        
	We ask our wives to be sure to pack a coil or mat in our bags along with the tiffin boxes. The repellents are wrapped in polythene or paper to protect the food, Anil Kumar (name changed), a clerk at the agriculture department, said.        
	You may laugh at us but its impossible to work without repellents, especially between March and May and then between September and October, when the temperature is just right for the mosquitoes to become most active.        
	Ajay Kumar, who has been working at the Vidhan Sabha secretariat for 15 years, said high-profile buildings, such as the chief ministers home, were routinely fumigated but the rest merely received occasional DDT sprays before the rains.        
	The government talks of motivating people to work hard but see how much discrimination exists in the offices, an education department employee sounded indignant.        
	The gazetted officers work in air-conditioned comfort, shielded from the heat and mosquitoes. And see how we work in these huge rooms crammed with old cupboards and tables and stacked with files. Why shouldnt mosquitoes thrive here?        
	A senior health department official said the premises of government buildings were sprayed with DDT twice a year.        
	Yes, the chief ministers residence is routinely fumigated but I have no idea about such measures in government departments, said the public relations officer at the chief ministers office, A.K. Choudhary.        
	Bengal PWD minister Kshiti Goswami denied any mosquito menace at Writers Buildings, saying the clean-up of the Circular Canal had reduced breeding by the insect in the area.        
	We have never received complaints of staff not being able to work because of mosquitoes. The secretariat usually winds up by 5.30pm, which is too early for mosquitoes.        
	Bihars babus say the Sixth Pay Commission should have recommended a mosquito repellent allowance.        
	Why should we bear the daily cost of mats and coils while doing the governments work? one of them asked.

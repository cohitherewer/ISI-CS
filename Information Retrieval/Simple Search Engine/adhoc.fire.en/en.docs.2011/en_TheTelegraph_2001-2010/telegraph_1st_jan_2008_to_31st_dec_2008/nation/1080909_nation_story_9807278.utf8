          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 8: For students in tribal pockets of the state, it is a battle between the language spoken at home and the one of instruction in school.        
	Literacy of tribal population in Orissa has remained a major challenge because of multiple issues  the major one being the problem of the gap between home and school languages.        
	According to the Orissa Child Census-2005 conducted by the Orissa Primary Education Programme Authority, there are 11,479 schools having each more than 20 students of linguistic minority group.        
	The census indicated that 11 districts contribute towards nearly 80 per cent of the total out-of-school Scheduled Tribe children in 2005. The districts include Mayurbhanj, Nabrangpur, Keonjhar, Koraput, Rayagada, Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Sundargarh, Balasore, Gajapati and Kandhamal.        
	The survey found that the districts had over 90 per cent of children speaking various tribal languages clearly indicating that the districts with linguistic diversities have most out-of-school children. The State Tribal Advisory Committee on Tribal Education had decided in July 2006 that Orissa would take up multilingual education programme (MLEP) in schools in tribal areas.        
	The State Language Committee under the school and mass education department recommended the use of mother tongue in schools by the linguistic minority community. Depending on the community demands, 10 tribal dialects were selected for mother tongue medium of instruction in the first phase. They comprise eight major tribal languages, including Saora, Santhal, Kui, Kuvi, Oram, Kishan, Koya, Munda and two endangered dialects  Bonda, and Juang.        
	The procedure is to connect mother tongue with the state language and foreign language to ensure reading and writing with purpose and meaning, said Mahendra Mishra, the director of MLEP. Today, on the occasion of the World Literacy Day, Orissa can boast of 495 schools in tribal districts teaching students the way they can learn better.

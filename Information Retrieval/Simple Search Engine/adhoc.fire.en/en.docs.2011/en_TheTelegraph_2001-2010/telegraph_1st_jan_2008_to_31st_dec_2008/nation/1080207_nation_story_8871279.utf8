          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 6: Over 24 people were injured when police fired at a mob that attacked Jainagar police station in north Bihars Madhubani district on the Indo-Nepal border, 300km from Patna, today.         
	The mob attacked the station after reports of the death of local boy Sheetal Mukhia (32), due to police excess spread. The residents also observed a bandh in Jainagar today to protest the death.         
	Jainagar deputy superintendent of police Surendra Panjiyar said a New Delhi police team had come to town to search for one Jairam Mukhia, a domestic help at the residence of New Delhi-based trader, Ashwini Dhingra. Jairam had disappeared after stealing Rs 1 lakh from the Dhingra residence.         
	The New Delhi and Jainagar police, accompanied by Dhingra yesterday, went to Goriari Tola, a village on the outskirts of Jainagar to search for Jairam, who was from there. The party failed to trace Jairam.         
	In the process of inquiry, they managed to irk villagers. Angry residents of Goriari Tola soon attacked the police party, injuring the sub-inspector, Sashibhushan Singh, and took Dhingra hostage.         
	In the fight to free the trader, the police allegedly beat up the villagers, fatally injuring Sheetal Mukhia, who succumbed to his injuries later.         
	According to police sources, people from adjoining villages, soon gathered at Jainagar and burst into the station with traditional weapons. The police then resorted to lathis, teargas shells and gunfire to quell the mob  leaving 24 people injured.         
	Four of the villagers have been admitted to the local hospital with bullet injuries.         
	Madhubani superintendent of police Shivraj Thakur, however, assured that the worst was over.        
	He said: Additional forces have been deployed at Jainagar. The situation is under control now.

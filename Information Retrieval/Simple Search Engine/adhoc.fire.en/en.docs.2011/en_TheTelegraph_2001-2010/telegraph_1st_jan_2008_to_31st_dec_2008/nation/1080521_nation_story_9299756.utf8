          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, May 20: A retired official of the Geological Survey of India was pronounced dead and kept in the mortuary of a government hospital for two days, his heart beating all the while.         
	Gulshan Lal (57), who retired as director of GSI, was admitted to Osmania Hospital on the morning of May 15 after he complained of low blood pressure. Lal, who was being treated in the ICU, was pronounced dead that evening and a death certificate was issued.         
	Hospital officials, who did not wish to be named, said Lals family members requested that the body be kept in the mortuary as they would wait for other relatives to come in from Chandigarh and Delhi.         
	Lal was kept in the mortuary of Osmania Hospital till the morning of May 17, when his relatives landed. The family was handed over the body around 11am.         
	They took him to the Amberpet crematorium for funeral rites. To the relatives surprise and shock, they noticed movement in the fingers of his right hand. They rushed him to a corporate hospital, where doctors said the man had died only about half an hour ago.         
	Had he been brought to us at least half-an-hour before, we could have saved him, said a doctor at the private hospital.        
	But doctors at Osmania Hospital pinned the blame on Lals relatives, who, they claimed, wanted the authorities to rush through with the discharge procedures. Even when we asked them to wait for a few hours after removing the respiratory apparatus and oxygen pipes, they did not listen, a spokesperson for the hospital, who also preferred anonymity, said.        
	Lals family members could not be reached for comment as they were out of Hyderabad.         
	But other doctors scoffed at the hospital defence. How can the hospital possibly pass the buck to the relatives as the doctors there would have to first declare someone dead? It is a case of utter medical negligence, said a senior doctor.         
	This is the third such incident to occur at Osmania Hospital since January. The last to suffer was a pregnant lady who was declared dead after delivery. But she came out of a coma after spending eight hours in the mortuary.

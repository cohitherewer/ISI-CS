                              Sarabjit                            
	Islamabad, Oct. 28 (PTI) Sarabjit Singh, the Indian prisoner awarded capital punishment in Pakistan, has been shifted from a death-row cell to one for political prisoners, raising hopes that he might be spared the hangmans noose.        
	Sarabjit has been on death row since he was convicted of triggering four blasts in 1990 that killed 14 people. The 42-year-old has spent 17 years behind bars.        
	There has been no official word on the cell shift yet. However, sources said the jail department of Punjab province has informed the federal interior ministry that Sarabjit has been shifted to a cell for political prisoners in Lahores Kot Lakhpat jail.         
	Two prison employees will guard Sarabjit, the sources said.        
	The development comes a little over a fortnight after law minister Farooq Naek met Sarabjit on October 6 to examine his case so that President Asif Ali Zardari could decide whether to pardon him.        
	Naek had pointed out that with Pakistans Supreme Court having dismissed Sarabjits mercy petition, only the President had the power to grant him clemency or remit his sentence.         
	Naek had also urged Indian authorities to repatriate Pakistani prisoners on humanitarian grounds as a reciprocal gesture.        
	Sarabjit was originally set to be hanged on April 1.         
	After the Supreme Court turned down his plea, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani had intervened in the case, which led to the Pakistani authorities putting off his execution indefinitely.        
	Pakistani human rights activist Ansar Burney, who had played a key role in the release of another Indian prisoner, Kashmir Singh, recently asked Islamabad to commute all death sentences, including that of Sarabjit, to life term, saying most death-row prisoners had been wrongly convicted.

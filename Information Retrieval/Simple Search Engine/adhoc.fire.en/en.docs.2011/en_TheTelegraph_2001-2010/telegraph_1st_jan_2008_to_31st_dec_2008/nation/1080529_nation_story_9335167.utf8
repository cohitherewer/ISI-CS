	Mumbai, May 28: Wanted, an election ticket for Munnabhai, the fictional MBBS, who now wants to be an MP in real life.        
	A section of local Congress leaders in Mumbai have been goading Sanjay Dutt to fight the next general elections.         
	The star of the Munnabhai series, convicted in the 1993 Bombay blasts and freed on bail pending an appeal in the Supreme Court, is also learnt to be eager to contest for the Lok Sabha.         
	At a recent event to celebrate the birthday of an MLA from sister Priya Dutts constituency, Sanjay indicated he would not mind fighting an election. Asked which constituency he would contest from, a beaming Sanjay told a news channel: Pehle ticket toh milne do (Let me first get a ticket).        
	The family has had a long association with the Congress. Sanjays mother Nargis became the first film personality to be nominated for a Rajya Sabha berth during Congress rule and father Sunil Dutt was elected five times to the Lok Sabha from Mumbai Northwest. Priya was handed the constituency after her fathers death, but local Congressmen are cut up with her because of her aloofness.         
	A section of state Congress leaders now wants to propose Sanjays name for the seat instead of Priyas in the 2009 election. But party sources said it would be tough to convince the high command to give a ticket to Sanjay, given his run-ins with the law.         
	Sources close to the Dutt family said that at the heart of Sanjays political ambitions is his growing rift with sisters Priya and Namrata over his marriage to Maanyata.         
	(A Mumbai sessions court today declared the marriage valid and dismissed an appeal filed by Meraj-ul Rahman, Maanyatas former husband.)        
	The sisters had thrown their weight behind Sanjay during the blasts trial but, sources said, they felt slighted when their brother married Maanyata secretly.        
	Priya maintained a stoic silence last week when asked about Sanjays absence at a camp organised to mark the death anniversary of Sunil Dutt.         
	The sisters resent the fact that Maanyata, a twice married, B-grade Bollywood actress,calls the shots in his life, said an MLA close to the family.         
	All three siblings have always denied suggestions of a rift.         
	Priya won the Mumbai seat by 1.7 lakh votes. But she has not been able to win over the local MLAs fully since she is known to be distant and aloof. She believes in doing her work quietly. Also, her proximity to the powers-that-be in Delhi alienates her from local Congress leaders, said an MLA from the constituency.        
	Sanjay, on the other hand, enjoys backslapping camaraderie with MLAs in his sisters constituency, many of whom were loyal to Sunil Dutt.         
	Even if the Congress doesnt give Sanjay a ticket, he can have one from the Samajwadi Party. Party leaders Amar Singh and Abu Azmi met him today. The Samajwadi Party will welcome Sanjay into its fold if he wishes to contest elections, Azmi said.        
	Sanjay is due to leave for the US with Maanyata to meet daughter Trishala, 20, who too is unhappy with the marriage.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shifted secretary cries corruption in UGC
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 23: A senior bureaucrat removed from the post of secretary of the University Grants Commission has written to the Prime Minister alleging that he was asked to leave because he threatened to expose corruption.         
	Raju Sharma, formerly a joint secretary in the cabinet secretariat, has told the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Appointments he was targeted because he pointed out problems with the implementation of a key UGC project, top officials said.         
	Sharma is learnt to have written to each member of the CCA, including the Prime Minister.         
	Parliament is expected to discuss the case tomorrow.         
	Sharma was appointed secretary of the UGC earlier this year, but was divested of his responsibilities on April 17 at an emergency meeting of the commission.         
	The UGC has told the CCA and the human resource development ministry that it asked Sharma to leave as he was not in a position to complete a full five-year tenure as secretary.         
	Though the UGC Act requires the secretary to have a five-year term, Sharma, a 1982 batch IAS officer, was to be repatriated to his parent cadre  Uttar Pradesh  in a year and a half.         
	But Sharma has informed the CCA that the decision to remove him came after he objected to irregularities in the Rs 230-crore e-governance project of the UGC.         
	The project is aimed at increasing transparency in the process of awarding deemed university status to institutes, by allowing the institutes to monitor the progress of their applications online. Institutes seeking recognition for courses are also expected to benefit from the e-governance project.         
	The Telegraph has learnt from top government sources that Wipro, a bidder for the project, has complained to the Central Vigilance Commission alleging bias by the UGC in favour of a rival.         
	CVC sources confirmed that the governments vigilance wing had sent two letters to the UGC for an explanation.         
	HRD officials said the ministry, the nodal agency in charge of the UGC, was not investigating the case.         
	UGC sources claimed that at least one action of Sharma could fall into the category of conflict of interest. His wife, Sangeeta Luthra Sharma, teaches at Delhi Universitys St Stephens College and was at the forefront of an agitation at the college to remove former principal Valson Thampu.        
	The National Commission for Minority Education Institutions, while hearing a case challenging Thampus appointment, had asked the UGC whether a college principal needed a PhD in a subject taught at the university.         
	Sharma, the officials alleged, responded to the query, indicating that Thampus appointment was illegal, without passing the relevant files on to the office of UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat.        
	A Sharma family member denied the allegations, saying all documents produced before the NCMEI carried Thorats signature.

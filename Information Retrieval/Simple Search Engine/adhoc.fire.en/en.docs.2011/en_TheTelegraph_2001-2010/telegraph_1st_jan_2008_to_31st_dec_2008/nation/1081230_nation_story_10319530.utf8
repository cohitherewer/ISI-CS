          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mohammed Mukarram                                  
	Dec. 29: Bangalore police have ordered a probe into yesterdays fatal shooting of a student by army guards after he ran into a brigadiers house to escape police chasing him as he drag raced friends on his bike.        
	The army, too, has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the killing of Mohammed Mukarram at Brigadier P.S. Ravindranaths residence after the 20-year-old ignored calls to stop.        
	Army sources said the probe would be conducted by a colonel and was expected to be completed within a couple of days.        
	In Bangalore, police chief Shankar Bidari said additional commissioner, law and order, M.R. Pujara would head the investigation team and a report would be ready within 90 days.        
	City police said Indias tech capital, famed for its pubs and notorious for its traffic jams, had also emerged as the unofficial capital of drag racing, where participants in cars or bikes race each other on a short strip, Dhoom- style.        
	Officers said the newly laid four-lane highways around Bangalore were the perfect playground for speed demons.         
	The weekend nights on these roads can be perilous for other road users as the drag racers virtually take over the roads. Even long-distance bus drivers are wary of their dare devilry, said a police officer.

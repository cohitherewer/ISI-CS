The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong not for shadow CM
                                                                                                            Cong not for shadow CM
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Congress will not name a candidate for chief minister in the Karnataka Assembly polls, likely in April.        
	Senior leaders said the party would not break with its convention despite the Gujarat defeat being blamed largely on its failure to project a credible face against Narendra Modi.        
	The Karnataka Congress teems with would-be chief ministers, including state unit chief M. Mallikarjun Kharge, former deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah, Veerappa Moily, S.M. Krishna and Margaret Alva.        
	Krishna is governor of Maharashtra but is said to be keen on stepping down and joining the leadership race in Bangalore.        
	The party, however, believes that projecting a shadow chief minister could intensify factionalism whereas the time-tested policy of keeping everyones hopes alive until well after the results has many advantages.        
	Besides, the Congress central leadership likes to have the final say, keeping in mind caste, loyalty and other political factors.        
	The party is also wary of inducting the leaders of the breakaway Janata Dal groups, especially the one headed by M.P. Prakash.        
	Having split the Janata Dal (Secular), Prakash is in talks with Congress general secretary Moily.        
	But the Congress is said to have learnt that Prakash is simultaneously talking to Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United).        
	Besides, former Union minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief has warned the party leadership against favouring migrants and granting them poll tickets in preference to loyal and original Congress members.        
	Karnataka could become the first state to go to polls according to the revised list of constituencies drawn up by the Delimitation Commission.

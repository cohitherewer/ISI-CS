	New Delhi, March 6: Enemy oilfields and industries close to the border along a wide front in the desert are among the objectives assigned to troops for an army and air force exercise that began this week in the Rajasthan desert.         
	The choice is between penetrating deep along a narrow front or to go shallow along a wide front, a senior officer said. In this exercise, we are operating along a wide front in the desert.         
	Indias military completes the first cycle of trials for its new cold start war fighting doctrine adopted in 2004 with the Dakshin Shakti exercise that will culminate with a firepower demonstration called Brazen Chariots on March 19.         
	With Exercise Dakshin Shakti, all three strike formations of the Indian Army  the 1 Corps, 2 Corps and the 21 Corps  are completing drills that are shaping the tactics of a cold start for a hot war. The 1 and 2 Corps exercised earlier with the drills named Sanghe Shakti, Ashwamedh and Vajra Prahar in 2005, 2006 and 2007.         
	The cold start doctrine was adopted drawing on lessons from the military standoff with Pakistan in 2001-02 and from US-led forces speed-charge into Iraq in 2003.         
	The army concluded that it may have lost windows of opportunity to attack Pakistan because it took nearly three weeks for the strike corps  the extra-large formations that integrate infantry and armoured troops with the air force  to mobilise.         
	Cold start implies that the strike corps should be able to get into a brief, hot war in the shortest possible time.         
	An official said the blue (friendly) forces would factor in a nuclear threat from red (enemy) forces and troops would be equipped with protective gear for a nuclear, biological or chemical weapons strike.

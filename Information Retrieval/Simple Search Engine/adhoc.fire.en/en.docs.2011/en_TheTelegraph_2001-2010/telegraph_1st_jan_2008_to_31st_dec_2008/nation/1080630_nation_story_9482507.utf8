          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 29: The Centres unilateral decision to replace R.S. Gavai by R.L. Bhatia as governor has left the Nitish Kumar-led ruling establishment seething in anger.        
	After all, what was the reason to replace Gavai three years ahead of completion of his tenure? Gavais stint marked the best-ever relationship between the government and the governor, said JD(U) national spokesman and MP Shiwanand Tiwary.        
	It is understood that Nitish was extremely upset at the Centre, which, according to decorum, should have consulted him before replacing the governor. Nitish shared a very cordial relationship with Gavai who was also popular in the state for initiating some extraordinary measures to improve the higher education.        
	The ruling NDA leaders argue that as per the Sarkaria commissions recommendations, a governor should not be replaced before completion of five years of his tenure unless there is an extraordinary situation. But the Centre has violated the Sarkaria commissions recommendations in Bihars case, Tiwary said.        
	Gavai has swapped place with his Kerala counterpart R.L. Bhatia though Bhatia is yet to formally take over as the governor here.        
	Gavai, an educationist, had initiated innovative measures to improve the states higher education. Gavai appointed R. Krishna Kumar as his officer on special duty and initiated the process to inspect higher education institutions.         
	The move yielded results with Krishna Kumar finding many of the top-notch politicians, bureaucrats wards enrolled as teachers but bunking the institutions for months and years.

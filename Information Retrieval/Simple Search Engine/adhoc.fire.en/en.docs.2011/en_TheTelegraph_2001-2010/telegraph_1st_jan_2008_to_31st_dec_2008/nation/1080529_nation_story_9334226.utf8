          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Patil: Development tips                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: The rural job, housing and road-construction schemes must be intensified in Naxalite-affected areas to counter the rebels sway, Shivraj Patil has suggested.        
	The home minister, reviewing the threat with various ministries today, proposed an increase in the average number of days work is offered under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the countrys 33 Naxalite-affected districts.        
	The average employment in these areas is now less than half the 100 days fixed in the scheme. The rural development ministry, which steers the plan, has been asked to carry out the changes.        
	The job scheme came under the glare earlier this month, when Lalit Kumar Mehta, an engineer-turned-activist for the plan, was killed in Jharkhand. Mehta had also uncovered irregularities in Indira Awaas Yojna, meant for the poor.        
	The minister stressed that housing was a key element of development and asked state governments to give priority to the Naxalite-affected districts in the scheme.        
	The rural development ministry was asked to ensure that the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna reach the rebel-hit zones as soon as possible.        
	Roads in the tribal and forest areas of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which the home ministry says accounted for two-thirds of the Naxalite killings last year, must be built on a priority basis, the home minister said.        
	MPs from the affected districts should set aside funds under their local area development scheme to set up hostels for students in residential schools, Patil said.        
	Reviewing the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana in the Naxalite areas, the home minister said non-conventional energy sources were a better option in these sparsely populated zones since the hamlets were often separated by a few hundred kilometres.         
	Patil suggested setting up mobile phone towers, often targeted by rebels to snap communication, in police stations and in camps of paramilitary forces. Communication ministry officials had complained that it was tough to find secure sites in these trouble zones.

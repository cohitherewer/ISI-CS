	New Delhi, Aug. 14: The pay revisions cleared by the Union cabinet mean higher cash outgo for the government  the total pay hike and arrears bill works out to Rs 37,344 crore in 2008-09.        
	But this years payout will be limited to Rs 22,131 crore because part of the arrears will be paid next year.         
	The pay panel had slashed the number of tiers in government service from 34 to around 20 and introduced five running pay bands that cover all ranks, except secretaries and cabinet secretaries. Each civil servant had also been given a rank pay, besides the basic salary. These changes have been adopted in toto.         
	The government also announced an assured promotion scheme. Civil servants will get three assured promotions at an interval of 10 years each.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the impact of revised pay scales on inflation was taken into account when the government cleared the recommendations.         
	The new pay scales wont have much impact on inflation, they may lift it by 0.2 per cent. But the extra cash could push up sales of consumer goods which have been performing badly, said D.K. Joshi, the principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil.

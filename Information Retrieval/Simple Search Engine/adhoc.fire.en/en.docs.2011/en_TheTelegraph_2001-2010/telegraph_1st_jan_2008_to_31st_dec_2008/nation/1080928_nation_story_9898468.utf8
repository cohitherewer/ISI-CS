          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 27: The chief executive of a Texas-based software firm was dragged out of his car and beaten unconscious by four men as industry hub Noida woke up to another vicious attack in less than a week.        
	It was, however, not immediately clear if employees were behind last nights attack on Kashir Dwivedi, CEO of Expedience e-solutions India Ltd, like Tuesdays fatal assault on Lalit Chowdhury.        
	The CEO of Graziano Transmission India, a subsidiary of the Italian auto parts major, was bludgeoned to death in his Noida office by union members demanding reinstatement of some workers sacked for under-performance.        
	Dwivedi said he was on his way to a Sai Baba temple when a Tavera with four men inside raced past his Honda City and pulled up in front of his car.        
	The men tried to force open my window. As the doors and windows have auto lock, one of them got an iron rod from their car and smashed open the window. After hurling abuses, he dragged me out on the road, Dwivedi said.        
	The four then tried to lift me and push me inside their car. I felt like a sack of potatoes, the 37-year-old recalled.        
	But Dwivedi rolled on the road to break free of their grip and screamed for help. A crowd had gathered by then, so the men retreated. But before leaving, one of them hit me on the head with the iron rod. I lost consciousness.        
	After regaining sense, the CEO called his wife Madhu, who rushed to the spot and took him to hospital with the help of residents.        
	Doctors at the Kailash hospital said he was kept under observation till morning and discharged in the afternoon.        
	Dwivedi told reporters he was too scared to go to work. This city is scary, his wife added.        
	Noida police chief R.K. Chaturvedi said the CEO was assaulted after a collision between his car and that of his attackers. A case of assault has been registered. We are trying to nab the youths.        
	Industry captains reacted with shock. What could be more unfortunate than this? This reflects poorly on the law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh, said Sajjan Jindal, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.        
	Aditya Ghildyal, president of the Greater Noida Industries Association, said the fresh incident could completely spoil Noidas reputation as an industrial hub.         
	The attack came two days after chief minister Mayavati called a meeting of top police and administrative officers and district authorities of Gautam Budh Nagar, which includes Noida. She told the officers they must ensure law and order in the district, sources said.

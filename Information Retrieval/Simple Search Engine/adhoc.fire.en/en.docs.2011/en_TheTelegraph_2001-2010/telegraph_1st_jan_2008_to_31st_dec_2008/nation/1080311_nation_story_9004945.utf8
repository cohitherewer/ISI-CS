          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 10: An IPS officer once hailed as a hostage-crisis hero is among 13 police officials suspended for allegedly framing a prominent Mumbai builder.         
	The suspensions were ordered following a probe report that indicted the 13 for arresting builder Rajesh Chaturvedi on trumped-up charges of plotting to murder a rival.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police Bipin Bihari, now director (vigilance and security) of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDC), is among the 13.        
	Before his transfer to the MSEDC, Bihari was the additional commissioner supervising the investigation in the attempt-to-murder case lodged against Chaturvedi.         
	Chaturvedi, who built Shreepati Arcade, one of the tallest residential buildings in Mumbai, was arrested last year on charges of hatching a conspiracy to eliminate rival Laxmikant Shah over a dispute arising out of a Slum Rehabilitation Authority project at Kalachowkie in central Mumbai.        
	Accused of hiring underworld henchmen for killing Shah, Chaturvedi was arrested by Juhu police. Four innocent persons, branded gangsters, were also picked up.        
	Released on bail, Chaturvedi demanded an impartial probe. The case was handed over to the Pune-based crime intelligence department, which submitted its report to the government last week.        
	As deputy commissioner of police in western Mumbai in May 2003, Bihari was praised for his calm handling of a sensational case. An armed CISF constable, Raj Namdeo, had shot dead his superior at Mumbai airport and held hostage six colleagues for seven hours on the airport premises.         
	Bihari had handled the negotiations with Namdeo and convinced him to release the hostages. Namdeo, who killed commandant A. Karanjekar for refusing him leave, jumped bail and is untraceable.

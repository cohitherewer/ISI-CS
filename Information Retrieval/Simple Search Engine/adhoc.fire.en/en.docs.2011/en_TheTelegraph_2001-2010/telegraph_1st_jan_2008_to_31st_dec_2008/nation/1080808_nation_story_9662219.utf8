          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The home ministry is holding a meeting with chief secretaries and police chiefs of states tomorrow as it gropes for answers after the serial blasts.         
	Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta will chair the meeting.         
	Links have been found between the Ahmedabad and Bangalore explosions and those in Jaipur and Uttar Pradesh earlier, but investigators are clueless about who is behind them. Over 130 people have been killed in Jaipur, Bangalore and Ahmedabad.         
	Prima facie, these appear to be the handiwork of certain terrorist groups with support from some local elements, a home ministry release said.         
	The meeting tomorrow has been called to discuss the need to respond to such incidents and develop a strategy. Ideas on preventive measures will be exchanged, such as awareness building, community co-operation, strengthening of intelligence, urban and metro policing, and the process of investigation and prosecution.

                                                                                                            Two traders shot dead in daylight
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Jan. 28: Two men were shot dead by unidentified assailants at Anisabad today.         
	The incident took place around 3.45pm when Ravinshankar Pande (28) and Abhay Kumar (26) went to purchase application forms for tenders at a office of the agriculture department.         
	The men, who were present in the office, opened fire at the two from close range. The duo died on the spot.         
	Ravishankar was a resident of Naubatpur, 15km from Patna. There is little information about his acquaintance, Abhay. Anisabad police station officer-in-charge Shivaji Prasad said: Prima facie it seems to be a case of business rivalry. We will question all applicants to see if the assailants were related to any of them.         
	City superintendent of police Anwar Hussain said the police are investigating the matter. This is the second case of daylight murder at the capital in less than a month.        
	Last month, a Barh resident and cousin of Mokama JD(U) legislator Anant Singh was shot inside a government office along the Boring Canal Road.

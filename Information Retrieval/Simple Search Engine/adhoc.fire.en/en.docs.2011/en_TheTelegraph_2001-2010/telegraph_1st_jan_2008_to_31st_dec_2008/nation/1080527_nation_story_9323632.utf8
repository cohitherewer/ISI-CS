          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Jubuli Sunderray (above) Nalini Panda. Telegraph Pictures        
	Bhubaneswar, May 26: Gangster Raja Acharyas mother, Nalini Panda, now in her late fifties, was arrested early this morning and was taken to Shahidnagar police station.        
	Recordist and album co-ordinator Jubuli Sunderray, too, was arrested and taken to Bargarh police station today, where he was interrogated for hours before being forwarded to the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court here.         
	On May 24, Sunderray and Raja Acharyas sister-in-law had filed complaints against each other for intimidating their respective families.        
	Sunderray had lodged his complaint at the Shahidnagar police station alleging that Nalini Panda had threatened him, Leslie Tripathy, Bidusmita Mantri and her brother, Arun Mantri, to withdraw a case lodged by them against her son or face consequences.        
	Meanwhile, Rajas sister-in-law, Shalini, too, had lodged a complaint at Bargarh police station accusing Sunderray of intimidation. Sunderray barged into our residence in the morning when I was alone and asked for my mother-in-law. When I said she was not at home, he threatened me and slapped me, the woman had said then.        
	While Sunderray had claimed that Nalini Panda had threatened him in presence of one of his personal security officers, Rabi Narayan Barik, Shalini had alleged that one of Sunderrays guards had accompanied him when he had threatened her. The allegation had raised criticism from all quarters, following which the guard was suspended. Sunderray had been provided with two guards following threats from the gangster.        
	Deputy commissioner of police Himanshu Lal said: The verification into both sets of allegations are being done and we cannot comment till the investigations are over.        
	The local court had released Nalini Panda on bail when reports came in last.         
	The gangsters mother was arrested under Sections 448 and 506/34 of the IPC, while Bargarh police arrested Sunderray under Section 448, 506 and 354 of the IPC.         
	Few hours after the arrests, unidentified men hurled two firecrackers at the Bhubaneswar Clubs tennis court. Club officials immediately contacted DCP Lal, who rushed to the sport. He later confirmed that the explosions were due to ordinary crackers.        
	Senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik was reportedly present in the club at the time of the incident. Sources maintained that the mischief-makers sent an indirect message to Patnaik, who, when contacted, denied to comment on the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP minister faces iftaar wrath
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP minister faces iftaar wrath
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Students of a madarsa break their fast at an iftaar in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, Sept. 18: Sangh affiliates have held mock funerals and donkey feasts in the name of the Madhya Pradesh minister for minority welfare because he attended an iftaar last week.        
	Minister Akhand Pratap Singh Yadavs party, the BJP, too is furious with him and may deny him a ticket in the November Assembly polls, a senior party official told The Telegraph.        
	We will blacken Yadavs face, throw mud at him and tear his clothes, said Madhur Mishra of the Dharm Jagaran Samiti, a Sangh parivar outfit.        
	The Bajrang Dal has banned Yadav from entering Chhattarpur, his hometown in Bundelkhand where he attended the iftaar. After the minister refused to apologise, a mock tehrvin (13th-day ritual after death) was held for him, with a feast thrown for 13 donkeys.        
	The organisers  the Bajrang Dal, Dharm Jagaran Samiti, Bharat Mata Seva Samiti, Shriram Seva Samiti and other saffron outfits  said feeding the donkeys symbolised the ministers foolish act.        
	Yadav has argued that as minister for minority welfare, he is expected to attend such occasions of goodwill.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself used to host iftaars; L.K. Advani and other senior BJP leaders frequently attend iftaars, said the ministers son, Abhay Pratap.        
	BJP sources said the real reason for the parivars anger was the ministers habit of flaunting his secularism. Yadav had been in the Congress and served as a minister of state in the Digvijay Singh government before he joined the BJP.        
	It is his overt (display of) secular credentials that we resent, a senior BJP minister said, adding that Yadav should have taken clearance from the Bajrang Dal and other outfits before attending the iftaar.        
	A BJP leader who has a decisive say in candidate selection said Yadav might not be fielded in the state elections. Instead of dropping him from the ministry just before elections, the better course is to deny him a ticket, he said.        
	Yadav, who also holds the portfolios of food and civil supplies and consumer protection, has accused Chhattarpurs Bajrang Dal leaders of conspiring against him.        
	As food and consumer protection minister, I have launched a crusade against black marketeers and those who hoard foodstuff; so some vested interests are out to finish me politically, said Yadav, known as a die-hard Uma Bharti supporter.        
	The ministers supporters say many of the ration shops in Bundelkhand are run by BJP activists or supporters.        
	Dharm Jagaran Samiti leader Mishra, however, said his organisation had advised Yadav against attending the iftaar, held on a plot that is the subject of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims.        
	He said Yadavs move had emboldened the Muslims to stake their claim on the land more strongly.        
	Yadavs son disagreed. How does his presence at the iftaar affect any litigation or dispute? Abhay Pratap said.

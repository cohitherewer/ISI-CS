	Bhubaneswar, March 18: A solution to the controversy over entry of non-Hindus into Puris Jagannath Temple might be worked out soon by scholars and academicians, who have congregated in the capital to take part in Jagannath Chetana Maha Adhibesan.         
	Experts from across the country would be in Bhubaneswar for six days to discuss not only this issue, but other relevant topics such as animal sacrifice in devapeethas and extension of hospitalities to pilgrims         
	The event started today with ritualistic processions  Durga Medha Yatra and Kalash Yatra  complete with Naga dance and a sword dance.        
	The delegates would also focus on the issue of ritual uniformity in (Jagannath) temples across India, besides development initiatives for temple sevayats.        
	The programme will comprise a seven-day-long Brihad Vishnu Mahayajna, exhibition of 32 veshas (dresses) and yantras (religious equipment) of the lord, a discourse on the Jagannath culture, a camp for students and fans of this culture and religious performances         
	Our aim is to rise above sadhuism and other-worldliness. We want to sensitise people about the beauty of this cult. We understand the problem areas and are here to find out solutions for the government, said Rabi Rath Sharma, an organiser of the event.         
	The congregation is expected to attract around 2 lakh pilgrims. We are expecting participants from Delhi, Allahabad and Hyderabad universities, said Sharma.         
	At the end of the session we will submit our suggestions to the government, he said.         
	The public would be encouraged to participate in interactive sessions and for the lovers of Jagannath cult the display of the lords veshas and equipment would be a bonus. An exclusive exhibition on Indias Jagannath temples by University Grants Commission has been planned.

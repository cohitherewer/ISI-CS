          SUBRAT DAS      
	Bhubaneswar, May 4: Puris Jagannath temple has hired around 20 guides to help visitors and protect them from harassment.         
	Four of them will exclusively look after disabled devotees, temple chief administrator Suresh Chandra Mohapatra said.        
	The guides, who are called yatri sahayaks, have been recruited on contract on a monthly pay of Rs 2,500, Mohapatra added.        
	They were first brought in five to six months ago on an experimental basis. When the move appeared to be working, they were hired.         
	The recruitment comes amid allegations that some priests were fleecing and harassing devotees, lakhs of whom visit every year.         
	The guides will not only help visitors get a glimpse of the presiding deity  not easy in the crowded temple  but will also counsel priests to treat them better.        
	The system is being touted as the first in any Orissa temple. Mohapatra said it is part of a reform process on in the 12th century temple (picture on right).         
	Officials have been worried by the rising instances of tourists flouting rules.        
	Two devotees from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu  N. Kumar and Prathiban  were yesterday caught carrying cooked food on the temple premises and fined Rs 125. The temple has one of Indias biggest kitchens, where a Mahabhoj made up of 56 offerings is cooked every day.        
	Last week, a Hyderabad-based devotee was fined for bringing a video camera into the temple.         
	A Muslim tourist from Chennai who was spotted in the temple revealed he did not know that only Hindus were allowed inside.        
	So the guides have been also asked to familiarise visitors with temple rules.         
	The administration has also introduced anubhab yatra or familiarisation trips for priests around the country to deal with devotees better.         
	Last year, around 200 priests in three batches had visited all major temples of south and north India. This year, we plan to send equal number of priests on a familiarisation trip, the chief administrator said.

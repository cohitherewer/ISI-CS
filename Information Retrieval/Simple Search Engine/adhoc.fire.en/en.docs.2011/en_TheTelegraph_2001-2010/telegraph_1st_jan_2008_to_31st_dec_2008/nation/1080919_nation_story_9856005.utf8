	Kathmandu, Sept. 18: Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal today described his five-day official visit to India as historic and said it would take relations between the neighbours to new heights.        
	Addressing a news conference on his arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport here, Dahal, popularly known as Prachanda, said he was overwhelmed by the Indian leaderships positive response to his concerns.        
	I raised several issues of bilateral interest in a sincere manner. I was amazed at the positive response from the Prime Minister of India and the Indian bureaucracy, he said, adding that Delhi had assured him of continued support to the ongoing peace process in Nepal.         
	My visit was more fruitful than expected. We have arrived at a new understanding on the issues pending for some time now.        
	The 54-year-old former Maoist rebel said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had agreed to review, adjust and update not only the controversial 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship, but all other pacts as well.         
	Prachanda said he had not met Indian Maoists during his trip as he was a guest of the government and had no reasons to insult Delhis hospitality. I went with an agenda and am satisfied that it has been fulfilled, he said.        
	He denied that his trip to Beijing had figured in his talks with the Indian leadership. But for the media nobody raised the issue of my China visit, he said.        
	The visit to Beijing to attend the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games  his first foreign trip as Prime Minister  had raised eyebrows in India. Delhi is usually the first port of call for any new head of the Nepal government.

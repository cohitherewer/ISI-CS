     CHARU SUDAN KASTURI
             Jinnah with Dina
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Mohammed Ali Jinnahs daughter Dina Wadia has challenged the Indian government to produce documents to prove it is the rightful custodian of Mumbais Jinnah House.
    
	Dina and her son, industrialist Nusli Wadia, have approached the Central Information Commission seeking official papers on the ownership of the Malabar Hills mansion, claimed by the Indian and Pakistani governments as well as Dina.
    
	The foreign ministry had refused to produce the information under the Right to Information Act, claiming it could damage Indias relations with Pakistan.
    
	Officials had cited Article 8(1)(a) of the act, which allows the government to withhold information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect... the relation with a foreign state or lead to incitement of an offence.
    
	But the commission has asked the ministry to produce all the documents relating to Jinnah House before it at 12.30pm on January 15.
    
	Sources said the commission wanted to decide if the disclosures sought could indeed harm Indo-Pak ties and, therefore, were a valid reason to deny Dinas plea.
    
	Dina, who has challenged Delhis claim to Jinnah House in Bombay High Court, believes that any documents the government is made to provide are likely to help her case. The next hearing in the high court is in February.
    
	Under the RTI act, a matters pendency in court cannot be a reason to deny a petitioners request for information about it.
    
	Jinnah had built the sea-facing bungalow, opposite the Maharashtra chief ministers residence, in 1936. Designed by architect Claude Batley, it remained the Muslim League leaders home till Partition. The house was the venue of several meetings between Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi in the pre-Independence days.
    
	After Jinnah became Governor-General of Pakistan in 1947, he requested Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru not to sell the property, according to Indias first high commissioner to Pakistan.
    
	In keeping with Jinnahs wishes, Nehru handed the bungalow on rent to the British consulate, which occupied it till 1984. After that, it was given to the Indian Council of Cultural Research.
    
	Pakistan, during this period, frequently asked India to hand over possession of the bungalow for a Pakistani consulate to open there. 
    
	But the foreign ministry has refused to budge. The Centre says the mansion comes under the category of evacuee property  belongings left behind by those who went over to Pakistan during Partition  and that the foreign ministry is the lone authority to decide on the future of such property.

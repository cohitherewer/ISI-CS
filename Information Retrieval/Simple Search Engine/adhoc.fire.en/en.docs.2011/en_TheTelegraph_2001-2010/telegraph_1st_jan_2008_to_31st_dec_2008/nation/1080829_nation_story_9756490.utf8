          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today described the Bihar floods as a national calamity and announced immediate aid of Rs 1,000 crore and 1.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrain after an aerial survey of areas devastated by the Kosi.        
	Officials said the deluge was the worst in 50 years but it was the first time in recent memory that a Prime Minister had declared floods in the state a national calamity.        
	Army troops and over 650 motorboats were evacuating thousands trapped in the swirling waters which, chief minister Nitish Kumar said, had already killed 55 people.        
	Flood experts, however, said the toll in 11 days of flooding since the river broke a dam in Nepal, where it originates, was much higher. I saw 40 bodies floating in a village in Araria district alone, said Dinesh Kumar Mishra, who has written several books on Bihars river of sorrow.        
	Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Union ministers Shivraj Patil, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan surveyed the worst-hit districts of Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura.        
	Kumar thanked Singh for the satisfactory relief package and for declaring the situation a national calamity. Officials said the tag ensures special efforts by the Centre to help an affected state.        
	An official at the National Institute of Disaster Management, however, said there was no formal or a legal definition of a national calamity. Central assistance becomes available even without such a declaration. The response, the official added, is determined by the gravity of the situation.         
	As the hungry river swallowed swathes of land, reports of flood riots poured in. Official sources said one person was killed in a clash over relief materials in Madhepura.

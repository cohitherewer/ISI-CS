The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chauhan follows Delhi diktat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chauhan follows Delhi diktat
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Dec. 20: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today expanded his council of ministers, dropping a few tainted ministers while retaining others.         
	Fourteen cabinet-rank ministers and eight ministers of state with independent charge were administered the oath of office by governor Balram Jakhar, following hectic deliberations and state leaders frequent trips to Delhi.         
	The BJP leadership explained the gaping holes in the council of ministers as dangling carrots for party MLAs to give cent per cent in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP occupies 24 of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state.         
	Sources close to Chauhan admitted that todays exercise lacked his stamp of authority. Many senior state ministers like Kailash Vijayvargiya, Babulal Gaur, Anoop Mishra, Jayant Malliya, Gopal Bhargava, Tukajirao Pawar and Raghavji reportedly paid visits to prominent BJP leaders in Delhi and got their names cleared.         
	BJP insiders said that in keeping with his image as the obedient Pappu, Chauhan accepted almost all the major recommendations of top national BJP leaders and Sangh functionaries.        
	He dropped some of his former colleagues, including Narottam Mishra, Kamal Patel, Vijay Shah, H.S. Babbu, Ramdayal Ahirwar and Moti Kashyap. Former state health minister Ajay Vishnoi, who had to go earlier because of an income-tax raid on his brother, also could not stage a comeback. In spite of facing allegations of financial irregularities, all of them managed to win the recent Assembly election comfortably.         
	Party leaders said besides the pressure from Delhi, Chauhan could not act drastically against all those facing corruption charges as it would have robbed him of almost the entire state party leadership. Former chief minister Gaur, Vijayvargiya, Bhargava and Malliya are some of the ministers who have cases pending before the state Lokayukta.         
	A case is also pending against the chief minister himself in the Lokayukta over purchase of four Tata dumper trucks.

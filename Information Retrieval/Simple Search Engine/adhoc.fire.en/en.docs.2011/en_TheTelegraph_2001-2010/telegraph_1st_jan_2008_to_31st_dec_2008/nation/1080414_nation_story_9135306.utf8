                              Arjun in Delhi. (PTI)                            
	New Delhi, April 13 (PTI): The Centre has said it would implement the 27 per cent OBC education quotas despite reservations from allies and would not get into a confrontation with the Supreme Court.        
	Human resource development minister Arjun Singh, however, tried to placate allies upset over the exclusion of the creamy layer, saying the UPA too favoured reservation for them.         
	The Supreme Court verdict is implementable and it will be implemented, Arjun said, adding the process would be set rolling in the coming academic session.        
	But he steered clear of the demands of several allies, including the DMK, for a fair and just review of the parameters that would define the creamy layer. It has been carefully done. The overall structure of the judgment is very positive.         
	The court had on Thursday upheld reservation benefits to the OBCs in central higher education institutions but excluded the creamy layer.         
	Asked if the government would file a review petition and seek reference to a larger bench, Arjun said: There is no such thing at present.         
	The UPA co-ordination committee is likely to meet soon after Parliament is reconvened on Tuesday, he added. The basic issue has been resolved. There are differences on the creamy layer issue. We will try to sort out differences through talks.         
	Arjun, asked by the Prime Minister to speak to the allies after the verdict, said the governments strategy was to implement whatever was implementable and decide on the rest after discussions with the allies. He said the Centre would examine the suggestions of the allies without confronting the court.         
	The concept of the creamy layer should be applied carefully to avoid a situation that would deny the benefit to genuine people, he said.         
	Taking a dig at a section in the Congress that has been claiming the verdict was confusing and unimplementable, he said it was their last-ditch attempt to block the quota.         
	It (verdict) is only not clear to them. These people had earlier demanded do not implement it. Now, they say it is non-implementable.        
	Arjun said there was no immediate plan to bring a bill to provide reservation in private and unaided educational institutions.         
	Hailing the verdict as an achievement of his party, Singh said: All this could not have happened except the support and guidance of the Congress president and the Prime Minister.

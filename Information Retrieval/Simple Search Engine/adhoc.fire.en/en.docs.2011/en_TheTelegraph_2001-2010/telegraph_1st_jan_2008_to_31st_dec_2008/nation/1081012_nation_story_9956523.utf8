          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: Pakistans national security adviser Mahmud Ali Durrani arrived here today on a five-day visit for talks on terrorism and other security-related issues.         
	He will hold talks with his Indian counterpart M.K. Narayanan on Monday. Narayanan will also host a lunch in Durranis honour.         
	Durrani will also meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and BJP president Rajnath Singh.         
	Durrani is a former Pakistani ambassador to the US and one of the few officials appointed by Pervez Musharrafs regime to have been retained by the new government led by the Pakistan Peoples Party.        
	Durrani and Narayanan will discuss how the two countries can tackle terrorism together. They will look at ways to strengthen the joint anti-terror mechanism, sources said.         
	They said the visit was significant because it comes days after Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari assured Manmohan Singh that Pakistan would not allow its territory to be used for terrorist activities against India.         
	We hope the meeting will have a positive outcome, as terrorism has become a bane of the region. We also hope its a freewheeling interaction, a source said.         
	Both sides will also discuss the situation in Afghanistan. The meeting would give India an opportunity to raise its concerns regarding Islamabads reconciliation efforts with the Taliban, the sources said.

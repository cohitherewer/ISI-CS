The act was committed sometime between 9pm and 10pm at the village around 90km from here. The body was completely charred by the time police reached the spot around 11pm.        
	The police said he was tightly chained to the tree to make him immobile before setting fire around it. Investigation is on, the officer in charge of Bontala police station, Anupama Mohapatra, told reporters.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that the blazing tree had caught the attention of the villagers around 10pm. No screams or yelling were heard, eyewitness said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 29: The first Norwester of the season hit the city today with wind speed of 72km an hour and intermittent drizzle in the evening.        
	The meteorological office in Alipore recorded a rainfall of 0.4mm. Several trees were uprooted and train services were disrupted because of power cuts. Air traffic was also disturbed.        
	The Air-India Delhi-Calcutta flight that was scheduled to land at 7.05pm hovered in the sky for nearly an hour before landing. Emiratess Calcutta-Dubai flight, too, took around 40 minutes to land. A Jet Airways Chennai-Calcutta flight had to be diverted to Bhubaneswar, said an airport official.         
	A rail official said the running of local trains in the Sealdah division was affected for 20 minutes as power in the overhead lines tripped several times, stalling the trains in different places.               
	At Debipur station, under the Howrah division, the girders of a shed over a railway platform touched an overhead wire after getting twisted. Trains in the Bandel-Burdwan section were stalled for an hour because of this.         
	In the city a tree was up rooted at Lansdowne Place.

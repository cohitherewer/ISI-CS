          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 5: Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu today accused Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy of misuse of office and gratification for raising funds for his sons newspaper venture.        
	He alleged that the Sakshi newspaper of Y.S. Jaganmohan was allegedly funded by industrialists who were given SEZ land by the government. Companies such as ICL, Lanco and Aurobindo Pharma were given licences for SEZs in Jadcherla and Hyderabad for investing in the newspaper, Naidu claimed.        
	Reddy denied the charges and said there was nothing illegal about the business transactions of his son. The Telugu Desam tried to find fault even with the power generation enterprise of my son in the past and failed to prove anything. I think the TDP president is desperate to malign me and grab the gaddi, he said.        
	Jaganmohan said all details of investors were available with the registrar of companies and nothing was hidden.

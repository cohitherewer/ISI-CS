	Patna, June 2: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today broke his silence for the first time on the alleged scuffle between his ministerial colleague Narendra Singh and BJP MLA Falguni Yadav.         
	We will iron out the differences at the NDA meeting tomorrow, Nitish said, adding: All senior BJP leaders, including deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, will be present at the meeting tomorrow.         
	Nitish Kumar described the scuffle between Singh and Yadav as normal. Its not as big an issue as it has been made out to be, he said.         
	I have spoken to the minister (Narendra) in question and road construction minister Prem Kumar, who was present at the time of the incident. We expect to discuss and come to a conclusion, he said.

	Mumbai, Nov. 13 (PTI): A South Korean ship trying to slip away despite a court bar was forced to return after a high-sea drama involving police, a bailiff and the coast guard.        
	The captain of MV Han Splendor tried to speed away last night, hours after a Bombay High Court notice had been served on him on board. But the coast guard intercepted the vessel and hauled it back, port officials said.        
	The notice was served after an Indian steel firm moved the court not to allow the ship to leave until its consignment had been unloaded at the contracted price. The notice said the ship cant leave without the coast guard and the courts permission, a police official said. Three officials, two from the police and a bailiff, had served the notice on board the Korean vessel, anchored near Alibag, 80km away.        
	As it tried to flee, the coast guard made radio contact with the Korean vessel and forced it to return, the officials said. The ship will now have to stay put till the final court order.

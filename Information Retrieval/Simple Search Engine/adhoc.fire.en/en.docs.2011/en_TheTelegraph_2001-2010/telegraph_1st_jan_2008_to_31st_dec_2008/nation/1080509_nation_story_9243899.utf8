The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Traders cry over ceiling, licence raj
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Traders cry over ceiling, licence raj
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 8: Traders are strongly opposing the re-introduction of what they call the licence raj in the state for essential commodities and fixing a ceiling for stock.         
	The twin measures proposed to deal with the price hike would boomerang in Orissa as the state largely depends on import of essential goods from outside, the traders warned.         
	Orissa stands on a different footing compared to other states, as it is primarily a consuming state. The proposed measures would only hamper free flow of commodities from outside and lead to scarcity.        
	Eventually, people will have to bear the brunt, B.K. Mohanty, the general secretary of the Federation of All Orissa Traders Association, told The Telegraph today.         
	In an apparent bid to caution the government on the purported perils of licensing system and fixation of limit on stock, the organisation submitted a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday.         
	The licensing raj being put forth by the UPA government at the Centre in the name of checking price rise was abolished by the NDA government to put an end to the corrupt practice perpetrated by the officials. Reintroduction of the system would only revive it, a trader said.         
	The system should not be reintroduced in the larger interest of the people as they depend on stocks imported from other producing states urged the Orissa in its memorandum, copies of which were made available to the media today.         
	The trading community in the state was being unnecessarily blamed for the prevailing price rise and restrictions were being imposed on them, the traders rued and attributed the current spiralling in prices to artificial scarcity created due to forward trading by multi-national corporations.         
	The MNCs are procuring food grains from open market by paying higher prices than the supporting price declared by the government and are hoarding them for forward trading, Mohanty said.         
	Instead of blaming the trading community the government should take steps to enhance production in the state to match the needs of the growing population, he summed up.

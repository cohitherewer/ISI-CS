          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat                                  
	New Delhi, June 27: Prakash Karat has blamed the political deadlock on Manmohan Singhs renewed bid to go to the IAEA and hoped the Congress would realise that pursuing a pro-US line would only benefit communal forces.        
	Claiming the schedule set by the US was impelling the Prime Minister to go ahead regardless of the consequences, he urged the Centre to take an honest and credible stand that there was no political consensus on the nuclear deal.        
	Karats attack on Singh and his assertion that the Left would not let the government go to the IAEA came in the latest issue of CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.        
	In the article Left will not compromise, the CPM general secretary said: As the time for the ninth meeting of the UPA-Left Committee on the nuclear deal approached, the country was plunged into a political crisis once again on the future of the nuclear deal.        
	What is the cause for this ongoing crisis? The answer lies squarely in the prime ministers renewed bid to go to the IAEA for seeking the approval of the Board of Governors on the text of the Safeguards Agreement. This is an essential step for taking the Indo-US nuclear deal forward and for operationalising the 123 Agreement.        
	He maintained that the urgency to approach the IAEA runs contrary to the November 2007 understanding between the Congress and the Left that the government would go to the IAEA for talks but not proceed to get the Board of Governors approval.        
	The Left had explicitly stated that without its concurrence there should be no step forward on the IAEA front. This was acknowledged by the Congress leadership.        
	Claiming the urgency was at the insistence of the Bush administration, he said: It is this schedule set out by the United States which is impelling the prime minister to go ahead regardless of the consequences.        
	Karat said the governments failure to curb price rise and its obsession with the vision of becoming a strategic partner to the US and fulfilling the commitment to President Bush had created a situation that could be exploited by communal forces.        
	... This is a situation which can be exploited by the BJP and other communal forces. One can only hope that the Congress leadership will realise the serious consequences of pursuing a pro-US line which can only benefit the rightwing communal forces in the country.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 30: The Ashok Chavan government concluded the winter session of the Maharashtra Assembly today with a Rs 6,208-crore loan waiver for farmers not covered by the Rs 71,000-crore waiver announced by the UPA government.         
	The fresh loan waiver and concession scheme is expected to benefit 40.15 lakh farmers, months ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.         
	The Rs 71,000-crore central scheme was offered to marginal farmers owning less than five acres, with a provision of a one-time settlement for those who owned more than the cut-off. It benefited 38 lakh farmers in Maharashtra who had defaulted on loan repayments between 1997 and July 2007, but led to protests from farmers with larger land holdings and those who had faithfully repaid their loans.         
	The scheme Chavan announced today waives all loans of up to Rs 20,000 irrespective of the land holding or irrigation facilities. For loans above that amount, too, farmers are offered a waiver of Rs 20,000 if they pay up the rest. If a farmer who owes Rs 75,000 pays up Rs 55,000, he would get a Rs 20,000 waiver.

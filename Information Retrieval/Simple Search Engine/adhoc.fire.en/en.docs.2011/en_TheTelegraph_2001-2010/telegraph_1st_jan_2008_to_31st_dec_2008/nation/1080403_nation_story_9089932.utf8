The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPMs debate on dichotomy continues 
                                                                                                               CPMs debate on dichotomy continues 
          BISWAJIT ROY                               
	Coimbatore, April 2: The CPMs internal debate on special economic zones (SEZs) has refused to die down despite Prakash Karats attempt to evolve a flexible policy framework for the three Left-ruled states.        
	As the CPM congress continued discussion today on the guidelines for the Bengal, Kerala and Tripura governments, delegates from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu resented the partys soft position on SEZs. Ours is not a federal party. The party should have a central line applicable to all states. No SEZ is acceptable at the cost of farmers. If we accept SEZs in Bengal, it will be difficult to face the charge of dichotomy in Andhra and other states where we are fighting for land for tillers as well as to save farmland from SEZ promoters, a source quoted a CPM leader from Andhra as saying at the meeting.         
	Other delegates from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also asked for one party, one policy that would balance the priorities of the Left governments in the three states and party units elsewhere where mass movements have been planned.         
	In so many words, they are actually asking the party to demand a total ban on SEZs and not mere amendments to the central SEZ act to make room for such zones in Bengal, a delegate from Bengal said. Although the debate on the partys political organisation report was not clinched till late tonight, the discussion on the draft political resolution that included the demand on the amendments to the SEZ act also faced resistance with eight delegates of Maharashtra moving an amendment seeking a total ban. The dissenters, whose numerical strength is not much, were voted out.         
	However, the clash between the agenda of development and discontent seems to be having a repercussion within the CPM itself.        
	In Andhra, the party is waging a militant land movement that led to killings of supporters in police firing in Khammam. The party has reaped considerable growth in the state in terms of recruits-- from 46,742 in 2004 to 68,405 in 2007. In Orissa it has joined the anti-Posco movement and participated in anti-SEZ movements in Navi Mumbai, Raigarh and elsewhere in Maharashtra and Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.         
	With the partys efforts to make a dent in Hindi heartland, Rajasthan and Haryana have emerged along with Andhra and Tamil Nadu as two major growth areas.        
	The communique issued by the party today stressed on plans to take up local issues and conduct a sustained struggle to address the serious concerns of the delegates over the uneven development of the party and slow development in the weaker states. Karat may be trying hard to strike a balance between governance and protest by insisting that the implementation of alternative policies of the Left governments should help the party to grow in other states, but the convergence is yet to be achieved. The debate on policy framework today also witnessed another dilemma.        
	Karat and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee underlined the historically different backgrounds of Bengal, Kerala and Tripura to prescribe focus on industrialisation for Bengal and agriculture and state investment in infrastructure and social sector in Kerala. But some Kerala leaders wanted changes in the formulation and asked for a common policy for development. Otherwise, it would confuse party workers and supporters and we will be accused of doublespeak in Bengal and Kerala, a leader was quoted as telling the meeting.        
	The pro-changers in Kerala want the Left government there to shun populist politics and take up a drive for industrialisation suitable for the state.

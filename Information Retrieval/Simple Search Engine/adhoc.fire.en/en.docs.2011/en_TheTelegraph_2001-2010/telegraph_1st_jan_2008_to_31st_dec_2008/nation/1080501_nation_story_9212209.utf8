          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 30: The Prime Ministers Office had not issued any order to help the company owned by T.R. Baalus family but made some routine references without any recommendation, the government told Parliament today.        
	Hours after petroleum and natural gas minister Murli Deora made a statement in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister broke his silence on the controversy outside the House. He said his office had not done anything unusual.         
	The PMO has not issued any order or any instruction to help the company. Certain references were received from the PMO in a routine manner, without any recommendation, on the basis of a representation made by Shri Selvakumar Baalu (the ministers son), the director of the company, Deora said.        
	The Prime Ministers clarification came on the sidelines of a programme this evening. There is nothing unusual. The minister has explained everything in Parliament, he said.        
	Price-rise attack        
	The Prime Minister today downplayed the Lefts attack on his government for not checking price rise. In politics, such exchanges occur, he said.        
	On whether he expected progress in UPA-Left negotiations over the US nuclear deal when the joint panel meets on May 6, Singh said: One is always hopeful.

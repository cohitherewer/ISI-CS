	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Raj Thackerays aides Shishir Shinde and Bala Nandgaonkar and Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam were among 131 people arrested today in a crackdown on those responsible for Sundays attacks against north Indians.         
	Although no major incident of violence occurred during the day, the offices of Nirupam, Bhojpuri singer-actor Manoj Tiwary and a Bandra showroom owned by Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi were pelted with stones.        
	On Sunday, Tiwary had claimed he received threat calls for performing at north Indian programmes. Joint commissioner (law and order) K.L. Prasad said Tiwary had been given protection.         
	Nirupam was held along with 23 supporters after he arrived at Shivaji Park leading a march to Rajs house in the area.         
	A fresh FIR was lodged against Raj for the attacks by a local NCP leader for promoting enmity between different groups. The matter, which was admitted by Andheri metropolitan magistrate M.N. Bondre, will be heard on April 28.

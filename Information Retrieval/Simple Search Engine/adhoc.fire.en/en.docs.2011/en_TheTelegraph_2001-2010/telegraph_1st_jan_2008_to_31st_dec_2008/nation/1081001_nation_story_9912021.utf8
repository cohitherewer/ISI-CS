  - Flood-ravaged states cut down on celebrations          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          For the 10th successive year, Bharat Roy puts seven pitchers on his chest to start Dussehra Puja in Patna on Tuesday. Pix: Deepak Kumar                                        
	Patna, Sept. 30: Unlike the past couple of years, the three-day Dussehra Mahotsav would not be sponsored by the state government because of the devastating flood that wiped out thousands of north Bihar villages since August 18.        
	The culture department had lined up programmes of ghazal maestros Ghulam Ali and Jagjit Singh among several others of Hindustani classical and folk versions. Talks with the performers were finalised earlier last month. But given the shock and misery that the Kosi river had unleashed following the breach on August 18, the state is not in a celebration mood, said culture secretary Vivek Singh, adding: The state will not sponsor the Dussehra Mahotsav this year.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar revived the tradition of Dussehra Mahotsav by sponsoring it in 2006 after he came to power. Nitish, with his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, sat through the nights enjoying the performance of top vocalists, musicians and classical dancers with lakhs of people at the Gandhi Maidan that year.        
	But Nitish, mourned with huge loss of life and property during last years flood, had kept away from the celebrations. Sources close to him said that the chief minister was busy with relief and rehabilitation operations of the marooned people in five north Bihar districts.        
	The three-day Dussehra Mahotsava was about to begin at the Gandhi Maidan from Saptami  October 6.         
	But there is no chance of the Mahotsava taking place, sources in the culture and tourism department said. Unlike the pervious years, the government did not organise any cultural programme on the World Tourism Day on September 27, too.        
	However, pandals have started coming up in in Patna and other Bihar cities and towns on private initiatives. The Puja at the Dakbungalow roundabout will display the misery of the marooned people, said a Puja organiser.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bandh lull with school warning

	Darjeeling, June 22: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today announced a two-day bandh breather for the hills starting 6pm, but said schools and tea gardens would be shut down for a while when it resumes at 6am on Wednesday.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung said he had decided to lift the bandh to ease the hardship of our people and enable students to go home for summer vacations on requests from central ministers and MPs.        
	I cannot disclose the names of the central ministers and MPs who called me this morning. Taking into consideration their requests and to ease the hardship of our people we have decided to provide a relaxation from 6pm this evening to 6am on Wednesday morning.        
	But he warned that from Wednesday the bandh would be enforced more strictly and educational institutes, tea gardens and cinchona plantations asked to observe the strike for a few days.        
	So far, these three have been outside the bandhs purview.        
	The Morcha has also decided to send a four-member team, comprising Roshan Giri, Pradeep Pradhan, Harka Bahadur Chhetri and Phubi Rai, to Delhi tomorrow to brief central leaders.        
	Gurung said another team would leave for Calcutta on Tuesday to request chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to write to the Centre to set up a tripartite meeting as soon as possible.        
	As a positive gesture to the chief ministers recent request, we will also send another team comprising Amar Lama, Anmole Prasad and other leaders to Calcutta day after tomorrow.        
	The Calcutta team will then leave for Delhi to join the earlier delegation.        
	The Morcha also indicated that it would be faxing a letter to Bhattacharjee in reply to his June 17 invitation for talks without any pre-conditions.        
	The contents of the letter are not known but sources said the party was likely to officially communicate that it was game only for a tripartite meeting convened by the Centre.        
	Observers said Gurungs citing central ministers to relax the bandh suggested that the Morcha had built up a strong lobby at the Centre.        
	This is, however, not the first time that the Morcha is lifting the bandh: there was a five-day breather from June 12-16.

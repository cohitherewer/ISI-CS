	Jaipur, Oct. 18: An 11-year-old girl was set on fire by an aged acquaintance she addressed as nana (grandfather) for repulsing his attempt to rape her, police said today.         
	The girl, a student of Class VI at Rainbow School, has been admitted to SMS Hospital in Jaipur with 90 per cent burns. Her condition is said to be critical, hospital sources said.        
	Pankaj Kumar Singh, Rajasthan inspector-general of police (crime), said Ajju alias Salim, 55, a distant relative of the girl, tried to rape her when she, accompanied by her younger brother, visited his shop in Jaipurs Lal Kothi area around 4.30pm on Thursday. The children often visited their nanas shop, family members have told the police.        
	Ajju was arrested late last night.        
	Singh rebutted reports that Ajju set her on fire because she was wearing lipstick and dressed scantily. It is highly unlikely that anyone would do such a thing just because someone is wearing a lipstick, the inspector-general said.        
	The girls father Salim, a day labourer, filed a report today alleging rape, Singh said. She underwent a medical examination during the day.        
	According to the girls statement, Ajju allegedly took her to a room behind the shop and tried to first molest and then rape her. When she fought back and tried to escape, he poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze, Singh said.         
	The IG said the girl recorded this statement before the police as well as the magistrate.         
	Engulfed in flames, the girl managed to unbolt the door and ran out of the room crying for help. Neighbours rushed to her rescue and tried to douse the flames by pouring water and wrapping a blanket around her. They took her to SMS Hospital.                                 
	Some unconfirmed reports said Ajju is supposed to have confessed to the police that he set her on fire in a fit of rage because she was wearing lipstick. The girl, Ajju is learnt to have said, had replied that nobody can stop her from doing so and she was wearing the lipstick because she would be going to a wedding that day. He then poured kerosene on her and set her on fire, the reports, quoting some police sources, said.        
	The police said they were unaware of any such statement.

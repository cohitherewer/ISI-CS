                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Spirit shaken, safety first     -  Offices fight fear, but its not business as usual
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          People watch the Taj operations from Gateway of India on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Armed gunmen have finally broken Mumbais reputation for resilience and the citys pride in its indestructible spirit to face man-made and natural disasters.        
	I was supposed to go to the Mumbai airport to catch an international flight at 10am. I chose to play safe and stay home at my Napean Sea Road home because there had been a blast nearby, Kingfisher Airlines and UB group chairman Vijay Mallya told a news channel early this morning after Mumbai woke to the horror of another terrorist attack.         
	Like Mallya, Mumbaikars stayed home as undiluted fear gripped its office-going population though some companies struggled to keep up the pretence of business as usual.         
	Attendance is thin at about 15 per cent even though our office is open, said an Essar group spokesperson housed in its corporate glass tower opposite the famous Mahalaxmi racecourse.         
	A similar scenario was being played out at Kumar Mangalam Birlas headquarters in Worli, mid-town Mumbai, though it was business as usual for the Birla scion.         
	The worst hit was the central business district that has been in the eye of the storm for more than 36 hours. Mumbais Nariman Point, where the Trident  one of the hotels under siege  is located wore an uncharacteristic deserted look as offices of some of the countrys largest corporate houses like Reliance Industries Ltd, national carrier Indian and Kotak Bank were shut.         
	We got an SMS at 7.15am asking us to stay away from office, said an employee of a private sector bank.         
	Bombay House, the Tata groups nerve centre in Colaba, however, remained open as chairman Ratan Tata and senior group executive used the heritage building as a control room to monitor the horrific developments at Indian Hotels flagship, the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Apollo Bunder.         
	Tata Consultancy Services, which is close to one of the terror sites  the Chhatrapati Shivaji terminus  decided to stay open though attendance was thin.         
	Several other multinational and domestic offices close to the the terror sites, however, decided to play safe. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd decided to shut its office in Backbay Reclamation as a precautionary measure, said a company spokesperson.         
	This might have had something to do with the fact that its top management, including Unilever CEO Peter Cescau and Hindustan Unilever chief Nitin Paranjape, had a narrow escape last night from the Taj Mahal Palace where the companys managing committee met.         
	Im in the midst of talking to my people and will not be able to comment at this point, said a calm Paranjape late this evening.         
	Consultancy Ernst amp; Young asked its employees to work from home so did some advertising agencies and corporate houses in far-flung surburbs like Andheri (East), which is turning out to be a hub for entertainment and communication businesses.         
	This was a rare day in the history of the citys financial capital where the Bombay Stock Exchange ticker stood still  and fear stalked the city.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Rival tech savvy, CM gadget geek              
	The man who called his rival a tech-savvy leader out of sync with farmers is gadget-friendly himself, but for a purpose.    
	Unlike Chandrababu Naidu, Y.S.R. Reddy doesnt go to town telling people how he has turned Andhra into a Silicon Valley but uses cutting-edge technology with a vengeance to dole out grants from a fund that is above scrutiny.     
	A high-definition iPhone that his aide carries is used to clear grants, when Reddy is touring, from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund amid accusations that most beneficiaries are Congress sympathisers or referred by party leaders.    
	Even if he is in a remote part of the state or stretching his legs in his backyard in Kadapas Idupulapaya, Reddy never misses an opportunity to clear pending applications using the gadget. On an average, 300 applications arrive daily. Initially, officials tried using a Blackberry device but they preferred the iPhone, a hand-held computer that makes browsing the Net easy.     
	he passion for technology also shows in how he flies:  a swank Bell Canada chopper. Naidu might get a complex.        
	Blow it out? No, foam it out             
	If all goes according to plan, Mumbais firefighters will soon foam out a blaze rather than blow it out.    
	The fire brigade is set to acquire mist foam technology, which reduces the use of water and manpower. Assistant fire officer P.D. Karkopikar said recently the mist foam proposal had been cleared by the departments standing committee.     
	Big fires can be controlled with a small amount of mist foam and many western countries are using it.    
	Also on the way is a chemical bullet to tame chemical-fed fires. A single bullet can douse a big blaze. Each bullet costs Rs 17,000 and we will opt for it once the cost comes down, said Karkopikar. The panel also cleared new outfits which, along with the foam kit, will cost Rs 18 crore. (UNI)    
	Swarm scare in hospitals              
	Some of the capitals areas where dengue could be cured have been found to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes.    
	Inspection teams of the civic body, the MCD, stumbled on such cesspools in a couple of police stations, too.    
	Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Escorts Hospital, SDN Hospital and the CGHS dispensary in Sriniwas Puri were among the health centres and hospitals where the levels of mosquito breeding were reported to be high. The drive, which has been launched in the 12 zones of the MCD, also covers government offices and institutions.     
	Among police stations, those in Hauz Khas, Prasad Nagar, Lodhi Road and Sriniwas Puri faced the mosquito menace, the MCD said. Before these, several areas spread across Model Town, Shadipur, Gulab Vihar, Rohini and Saini Enclave had been identified as high-risk.     
	The inspection teams, which include officials of the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme, had reported high indices of breeding in all these problem spots. The swarms are being partly blamed on early rains. (PTI)        
	Bill bite              
	Water-bill woes have lashed the Delhi government.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit was struggling to fend off charges in the Assembly last week that residents arent getting the bills for months. Some who did get the statements said they were full of mistakes.    
	JP leaders said the private firm given the contract last October to issue the bills hadnt updated records and sent the details to residents in time, forcing them to pay fines for delayed payments. (PTI)

	Patna, Dec. 12: Six revellers of a wedding party, who had gone to relieve themselves on the rail tracks in heavy fog, were run over by two trains coming from opposite directions in Bihar.        
	The 3133 Up Sealdah-Varanasi Express and 210 Down Jainagar-Howrah passenger came hurtling down parallel tracks, crushing the six, an Eastern Railway official said.         
	They were run over when they tried to dodge one train by moving to the next track, he said.         
	The victims were aged between 13 and 20 years. The accident took place around 10am in Munger district, about 300km from Patna.

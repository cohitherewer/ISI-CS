	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 18: BJD leader and chief whip Kishore Kumar Mohanty is set to be the new Orissa Speaker.        
	The Jharsuguda MLA was the only candidate to file nomination today for the post that vacant since former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty quit after facing harassment charges. An election is supposed to be held in the Assembly tomorrow, but so far no Opposition legislator has filed any nomination. Opposition leader J.B. Patnaik has revealed that the Congress legislators would not participate in the election, as the BJD had not consulted them on the issue. BJDs Bikram Keshari Arukha would replace Mohanty.

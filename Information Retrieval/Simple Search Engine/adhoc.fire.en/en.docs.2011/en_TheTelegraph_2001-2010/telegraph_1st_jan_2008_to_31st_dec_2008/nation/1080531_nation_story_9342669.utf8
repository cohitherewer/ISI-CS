          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 30: Riding high on the Gujarat and Karnataka victories, the BJP is dreaming big  it hopes to retain Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh that go to polls next.        
	This (keeping the three) is going to be our main task, said a senior leader. He added that the party national executive meeting on June 1 and 2 would focus on ways to beat anti-incumbency in these states.        
	Senior leaders will try to send home the message that winning big in these states, where polls are due later this year, will make the road to Delhi easier.        
	None of these governments has a record of extraordinary performance and all of them have their own share of problems, but the central leadership believes there is enough time to redeem the scorecards.        
	L.K. Advani, the partys prime ministerial candidate, has, after the stunning Gujarat triumph, been insisting that good governance can ward off anti-incumbency.        
	Senior leaders feel if Gujarat gave other BJP-ruled states the reason to believe they can keep power, Karnataka brought a sense of pride. The significance of being in the saddle in Bangalore isnt limited to breaking the southern barrier but also becoming a party bigger than the Congress. We have seven states on our own and five in coalition. We want to spread the message that we are the emerging party, an office-bearer said.        
	The national executive will see the BJP leaders launch a campaign against the Centres betrayal of the common man. The focus will be on inflation  which surged above the 8 per cent mark today  the impending hike in fuel prices and the agrarian distress.         
	A separate resolution on the common mans burden is planned, as is the announcement of an agitation against the increase in the prices of essential commodities.        
	Besides the usual political resolution, there will be one on foreign affairs and Indias declining clout in its neighbourhood, where the Congress-led Centre will be slammed for being a mute spectator to the Maoist takeover in Nepal. The Maoists have emerged as the biggest party in Nepal after the elections.        
	Terrorism, which the BJP has always used to corner the government, will now be presented as a bigger threat. However, the plan for a separate resolution on terrorism was dropped after the venue was shifted to Delhi from blast-scarred Jaipur.

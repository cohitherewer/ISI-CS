The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia notice
                                                                                                               Sonia notice
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Election Commission today issued a notice to Sonia Gandhi on a disqualification petition against a Belgian state honour she accepted in 2006.        
	The Congress chief, conferred the Order of Leopold, has been asked to reply within three weeks. The notice was issued under Article 102(1)(d) that says an MP can be disqualified for any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state.         
	A Kochi advocate claimed that accepting the honour amounted to owing allegiance to another nation.         
	The foreign ministry has been asked to furnish a list of all those who have received the award.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AWOL in America, in hunt for new life
                                                                                                               AWOL in America, in hunt for new life
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 28: Two soldiers of the Indian Army have gone AWOL  absent without leave  from a contingent that was visiting the US for a joint exercise with the US Marines, official sources confirmed today.         
	The soldiers may have deserted, army officers said, but that term will be used if they continue to be missing for 30 days since their contingent finished with the joint drill on March 20.         
	In the army headquarters, the suspicion is that the two soldiers are looking for a new life in the US. Such incidents have happened in the past, though none has involved the Indian Army.         
	Rifleman Sanjay Mahato, who has been with the army for seven years, and Rifleman Santosh Thapa, with four years of experience, were part of the 119-strong company based in Camp Pendleton on the US west coast for Exercise Shatrujeet from March 10 to March 20.         
	The army headquarters has ordered a court of inquiry. The Indian embassy has reported that its efforts to trace the soldiers have been futile so far.         
	The event threatens to cast a shadow on future military exchanges because of the strict immigration laws in the US. However, this will not immediately lead to a reduction in the frequency of exchanges.         
	On the morning of March 21, the contingent of the 1/1 Gorkha Rifles that was handpicked for the drill was summoned for an attendance parade just before departure. During the headcount, the two soldiers were found missing.         
	Their passports and official documents were in the custody of the company commander.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amar   in clear, Bardhan gets rap
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Amar (top), Bardhan                                       
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The parliamentary probe into the trust vote bribery scandal has cleared Ahmed Patel and Amar Singh but found a target in CPI member A.B. Bardhan.        
	The Lok Sabha committees report implied Bardhan unwittingly triggered the scandal by saying MPs were being bought for Rs 25 crore. It also came down on Sudheendra Kulkarni, aide to L.K. Advani, saying he facilitated the giving of bribes by masterminding the purported expose.        
	BJP members Ashok Argal, Mahavir Bhagora and Faggan Singh Kulaste had flashed wads of cash in the Lok Sabha on July 22, alleging Amar and Patel had offered them Rs 3 crore each to abstain from voting against the trust motion. Sanjeev Saxena, alleged aide to Amar, was said to have offered the bribes on Amars behalf.        
	The committee found no case against Congress MP Patel and no clinching evidence against Samajwadi Party MP Amar, and said no action should be taken against them. It, however, recommended a probe by an appropriate investigating agency into the roles of Kulkarni, Saxena and Suhail Hindustani, an alleged volunteer in the sting operation.        
	V.K. Malhotra of the BJP and Mohammad Salim of the CPM gave notes of dissent, distancing themselves from the seven-member panels clean chit to Amar and Patel.        
	The report said it was Bardhans remark that made a TV channel start its investigative journalistic enterprise. It added that the CPI leader had admitted before the panel his remark had no factual basis, and that what he had had in mind was an incident in 1993 where Rs 50 lakh each had been paid to a number of MPs  an allusion to the JMM bribery scandal.        
	Bardhan told the panel he had mentioned Rs 25 crore since the stakes were much higher this time, the report said.        
	Malhotras dissenting note said: If investigation agai-nst Sanjeev Saxena, as is recommended in the report, establishes that he came with the money on behalf of Amar Singh, it would contradict the exoneration of Amar Singh.        
	Salim said it was improper to limit the scope of further probe by excluding some important names. He wanted the panel to ask the Speaker to refer Amar and Patel to the Rajya Sabha chairman. But the panel said none of the BJP trio had come face to face with Patel and video clips of a car entering and leaving Amars residence proved nothing.

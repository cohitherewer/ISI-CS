                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hit-and-miss for Rahul amp; rookies

	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Rahul Gandhi, his babalog brigade of political scions and his youth teams of candidates have generally had a forgettable strike rate in the state elections.        
	The Youth Congress chiefs of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh lost while those of Delhi and Mizoram scraped through. Many other candidates recommended by Rahul too bit the dust.        
	The Amethi MP is the general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress and had leveraged his clout to secure as many as 30 tickets for the organisation instead of the token one or two in the past. He also got a few tickets for the National Students Union of India, which too is under his charge.        
	Sources close to Rahul played down the setbacks, claiming that in Rajasthan, for instance, of the eight or nine names he had suggested, four or five had won. Others gave more inflated figures.        
	Those involved in ticket distribution, however, said that of Rahuls five candidates, only Gopal Meena won, bagging Jaipur (rural). Neeraj Dangi, state Youth Congress chief, lost to his BJP rival by over 3,000 votes.        
	Chhattisgarh Youth Congress chief Yogesh Tiwari lost to the BJPs Brijmohan Aggarwal by nearly 25,000 votes. Even so, a source close to Rahul saw hope. He said the Congress had lost by 65,000 votes the last time, so Tiwari had at least managed to cover a 40,000-vote deficit.        
	These were tough seats. Whatever the margin of defeat, we think the success rate has been good overall. More important, we are happy with the representation our leaders gave the youths, said Youth Congress national president Ashok Tanwar.        
	Dausa MP Sachin Pilot, a member of the babalog brigade, had a poor time too. The Congress lost in four of Dausas Assembly seats, winning just one, Sikrai. It lost Dausa town to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).        
	The Congress had expected to be the biggest beneficiary of the Gujjar-Meena clashes in Dausa and its neighbourhood, but instead the gains were shared by a new Gujjar party, the Loktantrik Samajwadi Party formed by a BJP rebel, and the BSP.        
	This despite Sachin being a Gujjar and the sole legatee of the goodwill and base his father, Rajesh Pilot, had in the area.        
	Sachin has been looking for a new Lok Sabha constituency after Dausa became a Scheduled Caste seat in the delimitation.         
	Congress sources said that with the Gujjars concentrated to the southeast of Rajasthan, he had little choice but to look at Jaipur rural or Ajmer, both BJP strongholds.        
	Sandeep Dikshit, son of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, was the only one among the babalogs to do well.        
	Of the 11 Assembly seats in his east Delhi parliamentary constituency, the Congress bagged nine, debunking the theory that the party was losing support among Bihar-UP migrants following the violence against north Indians in Mumbai.        
	Although nobody in the Congress is ready to even whisper a word against the young leaders, one baba was the exception.        
	Amit Jogi, son of Ajit Jogi, is not part of any power group, nor does he hold a formal post. But sources say he wielded as much veto power in ticket distribution as his father, a former chief minister, and had even ticked off Priya Ranjan Das Munshi at screening-committee meetings for interfering too much.        
	Das Munshi headed the Chhattisgarh committee and wanted to keep Amit at bay.

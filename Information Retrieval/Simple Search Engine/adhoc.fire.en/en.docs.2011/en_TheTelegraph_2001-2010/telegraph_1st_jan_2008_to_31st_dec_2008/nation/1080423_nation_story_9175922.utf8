	April 22: The Biranchi Das murder case took a curious turn today when Chagala, an associate of prime accused Raja Acharya, confessed to his role in the killing but gave a clean chit to his boss.        
	He named senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik, actresses Leslie Tripathy and Bidusmita, and album producer and co-ordinator Jubuli Sundaray as the plotters. Bidusmita, Sundaray and Patnaik have denied the charge.        
	Das, the former coach of child marathon runner Budhia, was shot dead on April 13.        
	Sundaray fired at Das with a Mouser. I was standing beside him, Chagala told a TV channel. He was arrested from Bhopal today.         
	According to Chagala, the plan was chalked out at Bhubaneswar Club four days before the murder. They offered me a bungalow, prime land and money if I did a job, which I was not aware of. When I came to know the target was Das, Rajas friend, I declined. But Sundaray said. I would have to accompany him, he said.        
	Sundaray took him to the Judo Association Hall, where Das stayed. Before we left, Patnaik wished us luck, Chagala said, adding Das had swindled Rs 9 crore meant for Budhia but didnt give the four their share as promised.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 19: The Left parties, Bahujan Samaj Party and the United National Progressive Alliance will hold talks over lunch tomorrow.        
	Telugu Desam Party leader N. Chandrababu Naidu, who will play host, said after talks with the CPMs Prakash Karat today that the parties would discuss all possibilities, including a BSP-led third front government with Left support.        
	Asked if he was willing to accept Mayavati as Prime Minister as an interim measure, Naidu said: Why should we be against it? We are not averse to it. But we have to discuss all these issues.        
	Naidu also met CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and Mayavati. We are working on a joint strategy to oppose the nuclear deal, he said.        
	The Left and the UNPA would discuss the political scenario in detail, he said. We will have more such meetings among like-minded parties.        
	Asked about Mayavatis role in the coming few days, Naidu said she would play a major role.         
	Naidu was accompanied by his five Lok Sabha MPs and two Rajya Sabha MPs during the 90-minute meeting with Mayavati.        
	The two-day meeting of the CPM central committee began today and discussed, among other issues, the decision to vote with the BJP during the July 22 floor test. The Speaker issue also came up, but it is unlikely that the party will take action against Somnath Chatterjee before the trust vote.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh with relatives of the victims at a morgue on Tuesday. (Eastern Projections)                                  
	Imphal, March 18: Militants masquerading as contractors herded groups of migrant workers in Imphal into trucks and drove them to the suburbs to face firing squads.         
	Five of the captives died in the coordinated shooting spree, thought to be the handiwork of the same outfit that killed seven outsiders in Imphal West last night and wrote Go back to your home states on the back of their shirts.        
	The Okram Ibobi Singh government said it had a fair idea of which outfit was behind the Ulfa-type hate campaign  over 100 Hindi speakers have been killed in Assam since last year  and asked security forces to ensure that no more migrant workers were targeted.        
	We will confirm the identity of the group soon. It will be tit for tat. Befitting punishment will be given to them, the chief minister said.         
	Police said the labourers were rounded up from different locations in Imphal East and driven to Kumbi Ching, Keibi Kumuda and Kangla Sangomsang, where they were lined up and shot. The incidents occurred between 10 and 11am.         
	One of the survivors, 35-year-old Siva Patel, said he was in a group of 13 that faced a firing squad along the Imphal-Saikul road. A person met us around 10am and told us that our services were required for the construction of a house. He took us to Keibi Kumuda, where armed men made us sit by the roadside. When four to five of them started firing at us, I ran.         
	One person died in the firing and two, including Siva, were injured. One bullet grazed Sivas head. Residents of a nearby locality took us to hospital, he said.        
	Three persons were shot in Kumbi Ching and one in Kangla Sangomsang. Yesterdays incident occurred at Heiyen Hangoon in Imphal West district. The police confirmed that four of the victims in the Imphal West attack were Hindi speakers. One of them worked in a bakery and the rest were door-to-door salesmen.        
	Ibobi Singh convened an emergency cabinet meeting after the killings and sent a report to the Union home ministry. The chief minister instructed deputy commissioners, police chiefs and commandants of the Manipur Rifles and India Reserve Battalions to beef up security for settlers.         
	Most labourers and salesmen did not venture out in the valley districts today.         
	The jittery administration clamped Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the evening, restricting motor traffic in the Imphal East and West districts from 6pm till 5am every day till further orders. An official said this was meant to prevent militants from using vehicles to kidnap prospective victims.

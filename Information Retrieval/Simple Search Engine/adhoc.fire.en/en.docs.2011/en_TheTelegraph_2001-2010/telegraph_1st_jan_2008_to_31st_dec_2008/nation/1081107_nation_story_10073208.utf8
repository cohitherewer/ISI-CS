          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Nov. 6: Bihars BJP-JD(U) coalition government is now divided over the issue of asking its Lok Sabha members to resign in protest against the attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra.        
	The BJP does not believe in resignation politics and will not ask its members to quit the membership of Lok Sabha, said Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi to reporters today.         
	The BJP leaders statement, who stood united with other Bihar leaders on the issue, came on a day when JD(U) announced that its five Lok Sabha Bihar MPs will resign to protest attacks on North Indians in Maharashtra. Tendering resignations will not solve the problem, Modi said.        
	He added that it is for Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan to quit the cabinet, as they are now members of the UPA government that has been soft on Raj Thackarey and his Maharashtra Navinirman Sena.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 29: Akshay Behera alias Chagala today underwent the narco-analysis (lie detection) test at the forensic laboratory here.        
	Chagala has been brought here on an extended remand for three days for the lie detection test and further interrogation.        
	Despite providing several leads to police, the need for the narco test was felt as gangster Raja Acharyas aides statements fluctuated several times.         
	Police commissioner B.K. Behera refused to divulge any specific details about the test and repeated his earlier claim of following specific leads. IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik, who was named by Chagala as the conspirator in the murder, was interrogated by the investigation team yesterday.         
	Leslie Tripathy, Bidusmita and Jubuli Sundaray would be quizzed later.

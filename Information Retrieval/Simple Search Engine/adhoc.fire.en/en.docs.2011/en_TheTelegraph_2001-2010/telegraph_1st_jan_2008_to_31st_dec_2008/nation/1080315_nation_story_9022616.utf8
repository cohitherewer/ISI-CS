                                                                                                               Child cyclist found charred to death
          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, March 14: A 10-year-old who had gone out cycling was found burnt alive outside the capital last evening, and his family suspects that guests at a wedding might have killed the boy after an argument.        
	Sanjeev, the youngest of three children of a farmer, was identified by his legs hours after he left his home at Bakhtawarpur village, northwest of Delhi.         
	The rest of the childs body was charred beyond recognition.        
	His uncle, Jai Singh, said today: Sanjeev, we think, hit a car (belonging to the wedding party) with his cycle and then demanded money for it to be repaired. The men got so angry that they hit him and then burnt him. Police have taken the video of the wedding so they can identify the culprits.        
	The police, however, said they were probing whether the boy might have been killed by someone who held a grudge against his father, Vijender Singh.         
	Vijender and his wife, Neelam, also have two daughters aged 12 and 14.        
	Sanjeev had gone out of the house on his cycle, Jai Singh said. The boy with a lisp would go cycling every evening or be out playing cricket in a nearby ground. When he didnt come back till 7.30 in the evening, we got worried and started looking for him.         
	The search party went to the wedding and made an announcement, hoping to find him. The family had been invited to the wedding.        
	On their way back, my son, who was out looking for Sanjeev, saw a fire in one of the wheat fields. He went to inspect and found a body lying there. It was dark and he could only identify that it was a body after they got a torch, Jai Singh said.         
	The body has been sent for post-mortem to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital.         
	Police have detained five persons, including two cab drivers, for interrogation, a senior police official said.        
	The boy was riding his bicycle when a white-coloured Qualis hit him. He demanded money to get his cycle repaired. Then some men got out and started abusing and hitting him. They took him away, said Vijay, a local resident who claimed to have witnessed the accident.        
	But police are also probing other angles. There is a possibility that the boy was sodomised, a source said.         
	He might have been killed over property, too, as his father is a reasonably well-off farmer.         
	Residents of neighbouring Sungarpur village, where the wedding was held, do not think this was a case of road rage. There are suddenly many eyewitnesses to the fight with Sanjeev. If these people were there, why didnt they stop it? asked Prahlad Singh, who attended the wedding.         
	The site where Sanjeevs body was found is far away from the road, he pointed out, suggesting that someone who knew the area well had killed the child.         
	It is a really shocking incident. I have known Sanjeevs grandfather. But there is no question of someone from the baraat killing him. How would they know where to burn him? Prahlad Singh asked.

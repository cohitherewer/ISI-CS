          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 24: Anita Devi (26), the estranged wife of caddie-turned-international golfer Ashok Kumar, has alleged that she has received life threats after filing a dowry case against her husband in a Samastipur court in north Bihar.         
	Anita, who is a mother of a three-and-a-half-year old, said Ashok has threatened to eliminate her.         
	He said that he had enough money to get rid of me. I have been living in constant fear for a while now, she stated in petition filed today in the Samastipur senior divisional officers court today.         
	Ashok Kumar was born in a modest family of carpenters at Mokhiyarpur Salkhanti village in north Bihars Samastipur district, some 120km from here.         
	His talent catapulted him on a rags-to-riches journey in the golf arena. Ashok had no formal schooling, but he was Indias numero uno national amateur golfer from 1999 to 2001.         
	I would like to request the administration to ensure my safety, Anita said while talking to The Telegraph over phone. I am under tremendous stress and my childs safety is being threatened too.         
	The husband-wife row came into the open for the first time in November 2007 when Anita lodged a dowry case against Ashok in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Dalsinghsarai, in Samastipur.         
	Ashok also appeared in the same court in April after a court summon.

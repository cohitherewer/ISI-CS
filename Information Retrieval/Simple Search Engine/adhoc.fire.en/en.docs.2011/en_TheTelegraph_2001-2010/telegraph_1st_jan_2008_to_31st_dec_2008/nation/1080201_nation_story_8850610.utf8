	Washington, Jan. 31: The Indian embassy here may continue to have a Bengali face at the top even after the tenure of ambassador Ronen Sen ends on March 31.
    
	Satyabrata Pal, grandson of Justice Radhabinod Pal, the lone dissenting judge at the Japanese World War II crimes tribunal, has emerged as the front-runner to replace Sen as the next ambassador to the US. 
    
	Pal is now high commissioner in Islamabad. 
    
	A final decision, expected in the next few weeks, will be made only after a suitable replacement is found for the difficult job in Islamabad.
    
	An Arabic-speaking diplomat who learned the language in Baghdad, Sato, as he is known to friends, is well known in South Block for drafting skills in English.
    
	His family was in the news in August last year, when then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met members of the family in Calcutta as a tribute to Justice Pal.
    
	Abes grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who later became Japans Prime Minister, was one of those acquitted in the war crimes trial, which Justice Pal described as unfair justice by the victors.

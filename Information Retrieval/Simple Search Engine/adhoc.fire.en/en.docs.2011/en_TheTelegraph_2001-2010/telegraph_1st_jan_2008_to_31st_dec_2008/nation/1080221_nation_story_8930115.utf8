	Wallet saviour is filmmakers hero    
	Filmmaker Anand Patwardhan now has a plot he can spin into a celluloid saga  with himself as the protagonist.    
	The well-known documentary director of films like War and Peace could consider putting at the centre of his story Gyasuddin Khan, a boutique salesman who found and returned his wallet stuffed with cards, cash and a diary.    
	Khan found the wallet on Dadar station, not far from the sari emporium where he works as an assistant. I saw the wallet lying on the platform. Then, as someone kicked it, an I-card popped out, said Khan, who last month returned the cell phone left behind in a nearby shop.     
	As Khan picked up the wallet, a boy came up to him and claimed it was his. But the I-Card, with a picture of Patwardhan, made it obvious he was lying. Khan took the wallet to his manger, who called up the filmmaker. Patwardhan couldnt thank him more. Honest people like Khan reinforce my faith in humanity, said Patwardhan, whose films often revolve around basic human values.        
	Nirulas Buddy on a roll    
	Buddy, the mascot of fast food chain Nirulas, is on a roll, meeting children from slums and villages across Delhi, playing games with them, before treating them to a meal at the groups nearest outlet. The spread is topped off with Nirulas signature preparation - hot chocolate fudge.     
	Painted red, the Buddy Bus looks a lot like the iconic London carriers. Launched last week, the bus has already done a lap around Connaught Place, with 35 children screaming in joy.     
	The bus has been donated by Nicholas Bloy, director of Navis Capital Partners, the Malaysian company that holds a 75 per cent stake in Nirulas. In the first trip, the Buddy Bus carried children at Khushi, an orphanage we have been associated with for some years now, said Nirulas senior executive Pulkit Srivastava.    
	Tuskers die, fear lingers    
	Elephants, dead or alive, are worth a thousand coins.    
	The age-old Tamil adage played out in real life when three pachyderms  one of them pregnant  run over by a train near Coimbatore had their tusks sawn off before villagers shaken by the tragedy buried them in pits.    
	Villagers along the tracks still cant forget the sight of the dead new-born, lying soaked in blood after having spilled out of the womb of its mother that lay still next to it.    
	Sensing a bad omen in the deaths  a baby elephant is often likened to Ganesh  locals paid a moving tribute to the animals. Pregnant women, fearing they may incur the wrath of Ganesh in the wake of the tragedy, offered special prayers and lit deepams (ghee-filled vessels) to ensure there were no problems in deliveries.     
	Accidents of the kind that occurred near Coimbatore arent rare in that stretch of the Western Ghats. The reason is that the fast-shrinking forest cover often drives elephants closer to human settlements and rail tracks.        
	Toll plea    
	A public interest plea has been filed for exemption from paying daily tolls on the new Delhi-Gurgaon expressway.    
	Commuters argue that paying the charge every day imposes a financial burden they cannot bear. Vivek Bharat Ram, who filed plea, said the government should exempt daily commuters or build alternative roads for them.    
	The Rs 1,000-crore 27-km highway was opened late last month, reducing time for thousands who travel to the satellite town as well as to the airport.

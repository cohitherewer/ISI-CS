          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Wasim-Ur-Rahman. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                  
	Lucknow, May 25: A struggling villager who spent his formative years in Deobands Dar-ul Uloom has made it to the Indian Administrative Service, the second student from the Islamic seminary to clear one of the countrys toughest tests.        
	Wasim-Ur-Rahman, who wrote his papers in Urdu, says he wouldnt have made it had he not learnt the subject as a student at the 140-year-old Uttar Pradesh institution.        
	Four years ago, Shahid Ansari, who had graduated from an institution in Nadwa, Lucknow, under the Dar-ul Uloom, had also got through IAS, striking a blow for the system of education run by the seminary.        
	For Wasim, called Dr Rahman by fellow officers in Delhi because of his degree in unani medicine, the wait has been long.        
	I was almost giving up, he said from Delhi. After two earlier attempts I would have called it a day. But then it happened when I appeared for the 2007 civil service exam.        
	The 30-year-old may not have even sat for the tests had it not been for a teacher in Aligarh Muslim University, where he studied unani to keep his fathers medicine shop running.        
	I found out that I would be eligible to sit for the tests, he said. So I took up the challenge.        
	Dar-ul Uloom deputy rector Maulana Abur Khalid Madrasi said there was a message in Wasims success. We dont run archaic courses. We have modernised a lot and students can go for professional courses and civil service and management courses, too, if they want.        
	But the journey hasnt been easy for Wasim, who comes from Latia, a backward village in the heartlands Gorakhpur division.         
	Born in a family of five brothers and sisters, Wasim lost his father when he was 20.        
	His elder brothers  Ateek-Ur Rahman and Azeem-Ur-Rahman  gave up studies to work as farm labourers to support the family while managing their fathers unani dispensary.        
	Wasim studied in a village madarsa up to Class V before a maulvi advised him to go to Gonda district for higher madarsa studies as he found him a bright student.        
	In Gonda, he completed Fazilat  which is equivalent to high school  before enrolling at the Deoband seminary.        
	Dar-ul Uloom was the turning point of my career, Wasim said. It is there that I learnt the higher courses of madarsa education for three years called Fazil Kasmi. The course helps one to become a Maulana.        
	He then went on to get a bachelors degree in unani from AMU, where the teacher told him to sit for IAS.        
	When the results came out, Wasim saw his name on the list. His rank was 404.        
	Wasim says he had opted for Persian literature and public administration as his two subjects. He had taken a course on public administration from an IAS training centre in Delhi but it was the first time that a student who had studied Persian in Dar-ul Uloom had got through IAS.        
	Naim-ur-Rahman Siddiqui, a teacher at the seminarys Nadwa school, said students often enrolled at mainstream institutions to prepare for competitive exams. But the credit for their grooming should go to the religious schools.        
	Wasim, who has not learnt much of English, said though he had made it to IAS, he was still a unani doctor.        
	I will never forget the poor while working as an administrative officer as I belonged to them, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jet puts loyalty bonus on hold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Jet puts loyalty bonus on hold
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Naresh Goyal: Words to action                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 7: True to Naresh Goyals warning, pay cuts have started big time at Jet Airways and the message is clear: take it or leave it.        
	Over 1,500 pilots and engineers have had their retention bonus deferred in October, said a source in the airline. A retention bonus is paid to an employee for staying put with a company and not hopping jobs.        
	It was introduced at the height of the aviation boom two years ago when pilots and trained engineers were in great demand and supply was short. New airlines were being floated regularly which were offering huge pay packets making talent retention a huge problem, said a senior Jet Airways human resource official.        
	Now the scene has changed. We are curtailing routes and grounding aircraft. Pilots are sitting on the benches. Airlines are dictating terms: it is a take-it-or-leave-it policy.         
	With most airlines pruning the number of flights, there will be more commanders and fewer planes to fly. None of the 1,000 engineers who has had to give up the monthly retention bonus has quit or been able to find a job with another airline.        
	But they are smarting.        
	I draw a monthly retention bonus of Rs 25,000. It did not come this month. Neither for me nor for any of my colleagues. It is not the same for everyone though, as it depends on the scale, etc. We are trying to figure out how to respond, said a maintenance engineer.        
	The Jet HR official, however, said the retention bonus had not been cut permanently, only its payment had been deferred.         
	Other higher management staff, starting from the level of general manager, have had to go without their Diwali bonus this year. But all non-managerial staff have received their Diwali bonus which amounts to nearly Rs 10,000 across the board, said the Jet source.        
	The non-managerial staff  cabin crew, baggage handlers and those in non-operational jobs  however, have not had to give up their retention bonus either.        
	The whole idea is to avoid passing on too much burden to those with lower salaries. In these hard times, this is the best we can do to avoid retrenchments, he added.        
	Jet has decided to terminate contracts of about 35 expatriate pilots, who are paid at least 40 per cent more than their Indian counterparts. A foreign commander usually earns about Rs 5 lakh a month.         
	This apart, with expat pilots there is the added expense of travelling and boarding. Right now it does not make sense. More expatriate pilots  there are about 200 of them  will be asked to go, the official said.        
	Low-cost carrier Spicejet, which posted a Rs 198-crore loss for the second quarter of the year that ended September 2008, took a decision last week to phase out expatriate pilots totally.         
	We have decided to remove all expatriate pilots from our rolls by the end of 2009, said a Spicejet source.        
	Other airlines are expected to follow suit, said industry insiders.

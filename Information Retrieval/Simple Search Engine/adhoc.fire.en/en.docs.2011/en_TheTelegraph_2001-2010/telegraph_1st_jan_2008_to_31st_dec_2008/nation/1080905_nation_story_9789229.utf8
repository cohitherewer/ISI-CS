	Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 4: After a desi Disneyland, a CPM-mentored co-operative society has planned a five-star hotel in Kerala.        
	The hotel project, in Kozhikode district, has been mooted by the District Co-operative Travel and Tourism Development Society. Of its 15 directors, at least 12, including Kozhikode mayor M. Bhaskaran, are local CPM heavyweights.        
	Coming up in three years, the hotel will have 300 rooms. A hospitality training institute and a tourism information centre are also part of the project. The society has reportedly identified a prime half-acre plot in the city vacated by a sick industrial unit.         
	A glossy leaflet issued by the society says: A luxury hotel in Kozhikode with star facilities and mesmerising ambience, catering to requirements of international tourists and our own high-flying business travellers, is on our plan. This will be distinctly different in spreading Keralas rich tradition of hospitality and providing all modern amenities.

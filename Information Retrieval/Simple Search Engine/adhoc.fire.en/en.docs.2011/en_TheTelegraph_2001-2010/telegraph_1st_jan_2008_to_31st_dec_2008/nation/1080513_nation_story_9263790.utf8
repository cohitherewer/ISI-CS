          JAYANTH JACOB                          Potatoes being harvested. The government has banned futures trading in potatoes as well as gram, soy, oil and rubber                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: A Centre-appointed committee of experts has failed to make up its mind if futures trading is responsible for the current price rise, but most of its members appear to think it is not.        
	The Abhijit Sen committee was formed to help the Centre decide whether to ban futures trading in essential commodities  as the Left says it should. Although its report was inconclusive, the government went ahead and banned futures trading in gram, soy oil, potato and rubber.        
	However, the supplementary notes show that panel chairman Sen, a Planning Commission member, was alone sympathetic to the Lefts viewpoint. The rest  Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Joshi, Prakash Apte of IIM Bangalore and Sidharth Sinha of IIM Ahmedabad  took the opposite view.        
	Like stock markets, futures trading allows a buyer and a seller to fix deals at a particular rate at a certain time in the future. If the price goes down at the time of delivery, the seller gains because he has to be paid the pre-determined, higher rate; if the commodity becomes costlier, its the buyer who gains because he needs to pay only the promised lower price.        
	It is argued that futures trading may interfere with government procurement of foodgrains and the functioning of the public distribution system (PDS). It is time we initiate steps for (the) government to gradually distance itself from the direct contact between suppliers and consumers in agricultural commodities, Apte said.        
	(The) availability of adequate essential commodities to low-income groups can be handled in other ways such as food coupons. Universal subsidisation does not enhance overall economic welfare.        
	The Left took the hardest hit from Joshi.        
	The Government of India had managed to keep the domestic wheat prices within reasonable limits by insulating the domestic market from the global one, through imports, ban on exports, police raids as also restriction on the entry of private trade in the procurement market of wheat, he said in his note.        
	But suddenly the atmosphere was vitiated by the slogans and the jargons that were so common in the socialistic decades of 1950s and 1960s. Some political parties, particularly the Left allies of the UPA, launched a vitriolic attack on the futures markets and demanded (a) ban.        
	Sen, however, said the supposed benefits of futures trading  providing better prices to farmers and reducing price volatility  had not accrued in India.        
	He suggested the government come out with a clear statement (on) its intent to maintain and expand the current system of public procurement and PDS to ensure remunerative prices to farmers and affordable prices to consumers.        
	Sen said the best option was to identify commodities where futures trading could drive up prices and insulate them from the practice. He recommended that the suspension of futures trading in the four sensitive commodities  wheat, rice, arhar and tur  should continue and the case for suspending such trade in sugar and edible oils should be taken up.        
	To buttress his point, Sen cited an example from the US: a meeting of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on April 22.        
	While the official position (at the CFTC meeting) was to play down speculation and stress fundamentals, such as low physical stocks and increased demand from China and India, all farmers and trade associations blamed the problem mainly on speculative surge Sens note said.

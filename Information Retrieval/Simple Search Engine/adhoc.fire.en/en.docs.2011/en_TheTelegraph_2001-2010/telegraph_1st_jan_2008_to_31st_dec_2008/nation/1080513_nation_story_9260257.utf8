	Cuttack, May 12: The 50-day non-violent struggle for rehabilitation before eviction by Cuttack slum-dwellers has gathered fresh momentum with Annapurna Maharana, a freedom fighter and Gandhian leader, throwing in her support.         
	An indefinite relay hunger strike was launched on March 24, along with a sit-in dharna, by hundreds of slum-dwellers in front of the office of the revenue divisional commissioner (RDC) to protest against what they called eviction without rehabilitation.         
	Reacting to the deadlock, Maharana has dashed a letter to the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, to break the impasse at the earliest by taking a compassionate approach.         
	While the RDCs office expressed its inability to redress demands of agitating residents, the district administration on the other hand has also shied away from commenting  pleading that the matter is still sub judice.        
	The octogenarian Sarvodaya leader said: The rehabilitation demand is not unjust. It cannot be brushed aside without any effort to find an amicable solution.         
	The agitation spearheaded by All Orissa Jhopadpati Confederation demanded rehabilitation for nearly 3,000 families who have been living along the 2km stretch of Taladanda canal from Jobra.         
	They have been staying along the embankment for decades. Now, they have been served notices to leave the place by the administration and Cuttack Municipal Corporation without any alternative, alleged the confederation president Brundaban Das Azad.         
	Azad, who was forcibly hospitalised a month ago, started his second spell of hunger strike 10 days ago. So did Ramchandra Patnaik and Sudarshan Nayak, two other activists.         
	Our agitation will continue till our grievance is addressed by the commissioners office, an activist said today.         
	Officials maintained that the eviction along Taladanda was launched to facilitate restoration of the 130-year-old canal that originates from Mahanadi at Jobra, meanders through the city and stretches up to Paradip.         
	We are not opposed to the restoration, but people should be evicted only after receiving an alternative, said Azad.         
	The authorities had launched the eviction operation on February 25. Little headway, however, could be made due to stiff opposition from the slum-dwellers under the banner of CPM-backed Cuttack Basti Unnayana Mahasangh. On February 27, Orissa High Court issued a stay order, based on a petition filed by the mahasangh, on the eviction and had advised the government to take up rehabilitation instead.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The UPA government is determined to introduce the insurance reform bill either in the ongoing Parliament session or the next as a statement of pro-reform intent.        
	With elections expected to be held on schedule in April-May 2009, Parliament will meet briefly in February to seek a vote-on-account.        
	Government sources said talks were on with the BJP to secure its support on the bill, which it had opposed on the ground that the government lacked the legitimacy to act on important legislation.        
	After the flak the BJP got from its urban constituency for speaking out against the nuclear deal and the economic reform initiatives merely to score a brownie point, we feel the leaders may not be that obdurate, a parliamentary affairs ministry source said, adding the government was not planning to approach the Left.         
	The bill seeking to raise the quantum of foreign direct investment in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent was cleared by the Union cabinet last October.        
	Sources said while the bill would not become law, at least in the UPAs tenure, it was important for the coalition to reassure the international community that the Congress would not abandon its reforms agenda despite the doubts raised after the economic meltdown.        
	Insurance reform is one of the promises the Congress made to itself and we are set on fulfilling it at least partially before the governments tenure ends, a source said.

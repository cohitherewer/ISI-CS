                                                                                                               9 per cent growth plan for state
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: The first day of Orissa Assemblys budget session was far from peaceful, as the state Opposition requested Governor M.C. Bhandare to not read out his 40-page government speech full of false promises.         
	Despite the hue and cry, Bhandare presented a seemingly strong budget that aimed at a 9 per cent annual average economic growth during the 11th Five-Year Plan, with more than 4 per cent annual growth in agriculture and allied sectors.        
	Delivering his customary address to the Assembly today, Governor M.C. Bhandare conceded that the state would aim at a faster and a broad-based, inclusive growth of 9 percent and a higher rate of poverty reduction during the plan period, in accordance to the 11th plan approach paper and developmental imperatives,         
	In order to achieve the objectives, the plan outlay for the state has been substantially increased from Rs 19,000 crore (of the 10th plan) to Rs 32,225 crore for the 11th plan.        
	Bhandare also stated that Orissa has witnessed a higher average economic growth rate of 7.2 per cent during the 10th plan, against a target of 6.2 per cent in the ninth plan. The growth was also higher than the annual average rate of a 2.3 per cent during 8th plan and 5.2 per cent during the 9th plan.        
	Listing out a number of fiscal correction measures, including expenditure rationalisation and revenue generation, to improve Orissas fiscal situation during the past few years, the governor said consequently the state has achieved a revenue surplus of Rs 481.19 crore during 2005-06.        
	The improved scenario has also been sustained during the subsequent years.         
	The states tax and non-tax revenue collection have also gone up substantially from 2000-2001 to 2006-07, he added.        
	However, management of debt burden has been a recurring problem for Orissa government, he admitted, adding that the government was committed to reduce the debt burden, as a result of which net addition to the burden was showing a declining trend. Till now, the net loan has been decreased from a whopping Rs 3822.77 crore during 2003-04 to Rs 793.06 crore in 2006-07, he said.         
	Stressing on the need to curtail unproductive expenditure and increase capital spending for infrastructure improvement, Bhandare said the curtailment would create more fiscal space for developmental and welfare activities.        
	Focusing on development of agriculture and irrigation sector, he said the state was also contemplating announcing new agriculture policy soon, for an all-round development in the farm sector.        
	The government had also declared 2008 as the year of irrigation and had launched an ambitious programme to the tune of Rs 5 lakh for every village that enjoyed less than 35 per cent irrigation facility.        
	Finally, Bhandare also reiterated the governments focus on rapid industrialisation through value-addition of mineral resources, available in the state abundantly.

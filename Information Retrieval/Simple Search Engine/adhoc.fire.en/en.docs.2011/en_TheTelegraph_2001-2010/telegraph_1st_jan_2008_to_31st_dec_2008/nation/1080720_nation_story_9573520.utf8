	Calcutta, July 19: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tonight flew back to the city midway through the two-day CPM central committee meeting in Delhi, apparently to take a last shot at persuading Somnath Chatterjee to step down.        
	The Lok Sabha Speaker, who has kept his party guessing on his course of action ahead of the trust vote, is in Calcutta because of a tragedy in his family. He is scheduled to leave for Delhi tomorrow morning but could change his plans if the situation so demands.        
	Bengal chief minister Bhattacharjees aides said he had returned because of fever but CPM central committee sources claimed developments related to Somnathda had prompted him to cut short his visit.        
	According to committee members, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat did not touch on the Speaker controversy today while discussing the withdrawal of support to the UPA over the nuclear deal.        
	Somnathdas issue was not discussed today as the leadership is expecting to work out some compromise formula. The developments regarding him would take place in Calcutta and, if necessary, Jyotibabu will be involved in the process again, a member said.        
	Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who has invited flak by openly siding with Chatterjee on the trust vote, called on him at Raj Bhavan. Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim also met him.        
	Yes, I met him but what he will do is a matter between him and the party, Halim said.        
	CPM sources said the leadership was almost reconciled to Chatterjee presiding over the floor test but expected him to cast his vote in case of a tie.        
	There is no hard and fast rule that the Speaker cant resign and join the floor for voting even if he has admitted the trust motion as the presiding officer of the House, said Rupchand Pal, the partys chief whip in the Lok Sabha.        
	In no way are we going to allow this government to continue if it fails to prove its majority. We will ask them to seek a fresh mandate, said the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, Basudeb Acharya.        
	The sources said a section of CPM MPs had suggested a compromise formula that would allow Chatterjee to chair the debate but step down at the time of voting. But Chatterjee was averse to being seen as voting with the BJP, they said.        
	Chatterjee did not look up Jyoti Basu today. The ailing patriarch had advised him last Sunday to bow to the partys wishes in the interests of unity and discipline.

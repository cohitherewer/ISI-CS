          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The board of governors of IIM Ahmedabad has formally rejected key administrative reforms recommended by a central government panel alleging encroachment on the B-schools autonomy.         
	The board met today and formulated the institutes response of opposition to the human resource development ministry, members said.         
	Each of Indias seven IIMs is independent of the others. But as the most coveted B-school in the country, IIM Ahmedabad is usually followed by the other IIMs in their response to the government on key policy matters.         
	The board today decided to convey to the HRD ministry its staunch and unanimous opposition to a recommendation by the panel for a pan-IIM body similar to the IIT council.         
	The review panel was headed by Maruti chief R.C. Bhargava and included Rediff.com CEO Ajit Balakrishnan and higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal.         
	The IIT council consists of directors and representatives from all IITs and is the highest decision- making body for the institutes on policy issues. But unlike the IITs, which share an administrative and academic structure, the IIMs each have their own, independent identity. A common platform, in the form of a pan-IIM board, is simply not acceptable, an IIM Ahmedabad board member said.         
	The IIM Ahmedabad board, headed by Vijaypat Singhania, has also rejected a proposal from the Bhargava committee to trim individual IIM boards to roughly halve their current strength.         
	The review panel, in its report, argued that the current strength of over 20 members on the IIM boards makes them unwieldy and hard to manage.         
	But if the board has no problems managing a number of members in excess of 20, why does the Bhargava panel have a problem? We sense mischief, because the only control freaks in the IIM mix are government babus, another member said.         
	Several members also criticised a recommendation asking the IIMs to almost triple their student intake. The IIMs are not MBA factories, one member said at the meet.         
	The members have, however, in principle agreed to study some of the other proposals made by the committee in greater detail, sources said.         
	The Bhargava committee had recommended expanding scholarship schemes to help finance courses for all needy students. It specifically asked the IIMs to build a corpus  to be called a scholarship fund  for the purpose.         
	The board today decided it was willing to examine this proposal, sources said.

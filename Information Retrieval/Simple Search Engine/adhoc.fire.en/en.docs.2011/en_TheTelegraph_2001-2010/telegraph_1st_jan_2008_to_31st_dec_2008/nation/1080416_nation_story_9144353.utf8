  Patrick on UK prize longlist          AMIT ROY                                                 
	London, April 15: V.S. Naipaul has not been kind to the people he met in India, especially the well-known ones who offered him hospitality, put him up and generally helped him gather information for his books, it is revealed in Patrick Frenchs warts and all biography of the 75-year-old Nobel Prize winner.         
	In The World Is What It Is, French says about the man who almost invariably bit the hands that fed him morsels of the Mother Country: He milked his hosts for information, often causing a scene when he set off an argument, and was happy to dismiss many of his helpers afterwards as fools and idlers.         
	Should the veteran journalist Prem Shankar Jha, for example, choose to write a review of the book, it will certainly make entertaining reading.         
	I thought Jha was a windbag, is Naipauls view. A windbag. He always had a view about everything, and there was little selectivity in what he said. Everything was a crisis. But if you write a column, thats what happens to you.         
	It can now be disclosed that Frenchs biography is in the running for a major award  it will be announced tomorrow that The World Is What It Is is one of 20 books on the longlist for the 2008 BBC4 Samuel Johnson prize.         
	The Telegraph was today able to break the news to French (thats good news, I hadnt heard,), who had not been informed that he is one of the candidates for the worlds richest non-fiction prize, worth 30,000.        
	The chairman of the judges, former newspaper editor Rosie Boycott, said the books on the longlist, reduced from 131, encompass everything that is exciting, innovative and brilliant about non-fiction in Britain today. The sheer scope and range of the books is extraordinary... all life is here.        
	Others on the longlist include Julie Kavanaghs Rudolf Nureyev: The Life; John Richardsons A Life of Picasso: Triumphant Years, 1917-1932; The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalins Russia by Orlando Figes; and Marcus du Sautoys Finding Moonshine: A Mathematicians Journey through Symmetry.         
	Despite this strong field, French must be considered one of the favourites to win since his Naipaul biography has attracted exceptionally good reviews in Britain.         
	For example, John Carey said in the Sunday Times that Frenchs book is a magnificent achievement, while in the Observer, Hilary Spurling called it one of the most gripping biographies Ive ever read.         
	Allan Massie said in the Literary Review: Patrick French has brought off something very difficult, so difficult indeed that I would have thought it impossible. He has written a biography of a living person that is every bit as honest, perceptive, compelling and plain good as if his subject was dead.        
	And in The Spectator magazine, Sebastien Smee remarked: French wallows a little too indulgently in his sources. At times the narrative reads like a collage of quotations. And yet this remains a brilliant biography: exemplary in its thoroughness, sympathetic but tough in tone.         
	French has certainly created a buzz ahead of his trip to India. He will be in Calcutta from May 7-9, after tours of Delhi (April 25-May 1), Mumbai (May 2-3), Bangalore (May 5) and Chennai (May 6).         
	French may well be asked, among other issues, about Naipauls opinion of fellow authors, including Nirad C. Chaudhuri.         
	The biography says that when Chaudhuri died in 1999, Vidia was asked to write his obituary by the Royal Society of Literature, and produced a slanderous and malign text, daring its commissioners to reject it (the chairman of the society, Michael Holroyd, had to write a diplomatic letter to V.S. Naipaul declining to publish).         
	Nirad Chaudhuri was an old fool, was one of Naipauls more charitable comments.         
	Naipaul had once backed Chaudhuri for the Duff Cooper Prize on the strength of the latters Autobiography of an Unknown Indian. Later, Naipaul regretted he had done so: I had no idea then that the prize was going to lead to the man setting himself up as a clown in Oxford for his last 30 years.         
	Before coming to England to collect his award many years previously, Chaudhuri had written to Naipaul giving instructions on the kind of people he did not want to meet: Most especially I am thinking of that little half-caste rat Dom Moraes who, if he comes near me, will get a whipping as sure as anything.         
	Back on home base in Britain, Naipaul was not always welcoming to those who had gone out of their way to assist him in India.         
	He met Bharat Bhushan in London but was reluctant to part with his home telephone number even though the journalist had once acted as his guide in Ajmer when the latter was a pupil at Mayo College: I will give you my telephone number only on the condition that you do not pass it on to any researcher, literary critic, journalist or other such pests.         
	Enraged, Bharat threw down a pen and stalked off: On second thoughts Mr Naipaul, forget about it. I dont think you have anything to say to me and I certainly dont have anything to say to you.         
	Another journalist, Vinod Mehta, despite offering much help to Naipaul, found the same: After 20 years, this did not extend to him giving me his telephone number.         
	A young reporter, Nikhil Lakshman, took Naipaul to Thane near Mumbai when he was gathering material for India: A Million Mutinies Now.         
	Naipaul thanked Lakshman by telling him he was too fat. Naipaul did not think walking was going to reduce the latters weight: Thats not going to do anything. Youve got to enrol in a gymnasium. Is there was a gymnasium near your office?         
	What shocked Lakshman even more was Naipauls reaction to the breaking news that a Hindi film actress, Neena Gupta, was having a baby by the West Indian cricketer Vivian Richards. Mr Naipaul said, How could she have a child by that nigger? I was appalled. For a lot of us, Viv Richards is God.         
	Naipaul, readers will learn, did not want for good food in India. In Calcutta, he and (his mistress) Margaret (Gooding) had dinner with Malavika Sanghvi and her husband Vir, both upcoming journalists, who served Dom Perignon and black-market Russian caviar.

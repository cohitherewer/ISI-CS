	Cuttack, June 4: Rashtriya Yuva Sangathan, a Gandhian national youth organisation that has been opposing the Posco project in Orissa, is currently holding a five-day camp at Satyabhamapur scheduled to end tomorrow.        
	The all-girls camp has 125 members from Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Orissa who were initiated into Gandhian thought.         
	The present camp is on issues related to man-woman, inter-relational issues, womens rights and ecological challenges, the youth organisation spokesperson said.         
	The national convenor of the organisation, Biswajit Ray, told newspersons that the camp was to enable the girls update their commitment and plan a future course of action.         
	The camp was as much about self-discipline and positive lifestyle, as it was about ideological discussions.         
	Every day began with a prayer in the morning, followed by yoga and then discourses on different ideologies, group discussions, and lectures, with question-answer sessions, group activities, sports and cultural activities topped the rest of the day.         
	Gandhians like Amarnath Bhai, Bhavani Ben, Vandana Bhartiya, Prerna Desai, and Kumar Prashant were present to guide the camp.         
	After returning from Satyabhamapur, they will be transformed into disciplined and dedicated human beings, said Annapurna Maharana, an eminent Sarvodaya leader of Orissa.         
	The 80-year-old grand dame of Gandhian thoughts inaugurated the camp at Kasturba Centre in Satyabhamapur, 28km from here, on June 1.         
	The pan-India youth panel has been actively working among farmers of Vidharba in Maharashtra regarding their rights, pursuing the same issue with tribals in Madhya Pradesh and among Manipurs youth.         
	Over the past few years, the group activists have been engaged in organising the youth in Jagatsinghpur area of Orissa and preparing to oppose the Posco project.

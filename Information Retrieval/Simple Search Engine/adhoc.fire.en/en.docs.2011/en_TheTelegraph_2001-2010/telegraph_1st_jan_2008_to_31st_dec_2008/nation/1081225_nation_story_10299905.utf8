The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak in no hurry on Kasab plea
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pak in no hurry on Kasab plea
  - Islamabad waits for concrete proof        NASIR JAFFRY                           Kasab at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on the first day of the Mumbai attack on November 26                                        
	Islamabad, Dec. 24: Pakistan will not respond in haste to a request made by arrested terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab for legal assistance but wait for concrete evidence that establishes his actual identity, officials said today.        
	We will extend any legal assistance to Kasab only after the Indian government provides us concrete evidence establishing his identity as a Pakistani national as merely verbal claims will not do, said a senior foreign ministry official who did not want to be named.        
	It will take time and there will be no hasty decision. Let us now examine which way the wind blows, he said.         
	Indian officials claim that all terrorists involved in the Mumbai attacks had links with the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba while Kasab, the lone gunman captured alive, was also a Pakistani national from Faridkot town in Okara district.         
	Kasabs remand was today extended to January 6 by a Mumbai magistrate who held court in the lock-up for security reasons. The gunman went unrepresented.        
	Mumbais joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria said: We are awaiting a response from Pakistan authorities on Kasabs plea for legal aid. Vakalatnamas filed by local lawyers will be taken into consideration later.        
	The Pakistan foreign ministry official said that as concrete evidence, India must furnish some hard proof  like a national identity card or a voters ID  which establishes his Pakistani citizenship.        
	India says Kasab has told investigators he is a Pakistani national and that the information had been cross-checked, but New Delhi has not revealed how.         
	How do we know that Kasab is a Pakistani? the official asked, echoing a question that has resonated through the political and military establishment in Pakistan.         
	Indian officials say that one way of ascertaining that is by matching the DNA samples of the captured terrorist with that of Ameer Kasab, a resident of Faridkot town in Pakistan, who recently claimed while talking to Pakistani newspaper Dawn that he was Kasabs father.         
	It is because of all such questions that we have offered a joint probe. We can work out the specifics and details later. Our foreign minister is ready to visit India if New Delhi is ready to share evidence of the perpetrators links with Pakistan, the official said.        
	But he pointed out that even the man claiming to be Kasabs father could not produce either a copy of his sons national identity card or his birth certificate. Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said yesterday that Kasabs name did not figure in the centralised computerised database of Pakistani citizens.        
	This situation has raised serious doubts (about the authenticity of Indias claim), the foreign ministry official said. He asserted that the issue had been debated threadbare at recent high-level meetings and everyone, right from President Asif Ali Zardari to officials in the foreign office and those waiting for evidence from India, had failed to find any clue.        
	In such a situation, how can Islamabad entertain Kasabs request for legal assistance when it is not clear whether he is actually a Pakistani or not, the official said.        
	Sharif demand        
	Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said India should provide evidence for Islamabad to take action or else it should avoid creating tensions through fake allegations.        
	Pakistan, as a state and as a government, is not at all involved in the incident (Mumbai attacks). If India provides evidence to Pakistan, the country will look into them and take action, PTI quoted Sharif, the leader of the Opposition PML-N, as saying.        
	Last week, Sharif had raised his voice against the tactics adopted by Islamabad to deny Kasabs nationality. He had criticised the governments move to cordon off Faridkot and its adjoining areas.

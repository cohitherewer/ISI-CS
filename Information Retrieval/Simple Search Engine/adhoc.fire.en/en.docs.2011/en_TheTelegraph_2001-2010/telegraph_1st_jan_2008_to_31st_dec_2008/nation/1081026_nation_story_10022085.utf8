          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Poor record-keeping and slow payments have hobbled the rural job scheme, preventing the UPAs showcase anti-poverty programme from having the targeted impact, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India has said.        
	The CAG report on the scheme, tabled in Parliament yesterday, cites delayed wage payments as well as failure of states to pay unemployment allowance or spend sanctioned central funds.        
	The scheme, implemented under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), guarantees 100 days employment a year to every rural household. The UPA is expected to highlight it in poll campaigns.        
	The CAG says the states had, till March 2007, utilised only Rs 8,823 crore (73 per cent) of the Rs 12,074 crore sanctioned by the Centre, which supplies most of the money for the scheme.        
	States such as Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya have spent around 90 per cent of their allotted funds but Maharashtra, Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh are at the bottom of the list having spent just above 50 per cent. Bengal has used 62.62 per cent of its allotted funds.        
	The CAG report lays the heaviest stress on record maintenance at the gram panchayat level, saying this is necessary to make the scheme transparent and effective.        
	Quoting the Union rural development ministrys figures, the CAG says 3.81 crore households have registered themselves under the scheme, and of them 2.12 crore have applied for jobs.        
	However, only 2.10 crore households received jobs during 2006-07, it says, adding: The ministry figures cannot be said to be very reliable as the record maintenance is very poor.        
	Since applications for work were not documented or dated, there is a high probability of the records being incomplete and of duplication, according to the CAG report.        
	It alleges that there are many instances of delayed wage payment, for which the NREGA-mandated compensation was not paid.         
	However, no one was fined for violation of the (rural job) act.        
	The CAG wants the Union rural development ministry to accept overall responsibility and co-ordinate and monitor the scheme, ensuring economic, efficient and effective funds utilisation.        
	The CAGs recommendations include:        
	Amendment to the act to ensure that the unemployment allowance is paid out of the central funds        
	A time-bound programme to attach photographs to job cards        
	An effective grievance redress mechanism in every state        
	Additional categories of work taken up under the scheme, which now focuses on public works such as road-building and programmes in watershed areas        
	Payment through postal accounts and bank accounts to check corruption        
	Vigilance against funds being diverted or misused.

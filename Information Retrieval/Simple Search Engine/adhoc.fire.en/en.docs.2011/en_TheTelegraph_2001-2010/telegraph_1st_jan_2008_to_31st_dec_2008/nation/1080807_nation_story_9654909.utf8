          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 6: Orissa High Court has asked a rape accused to either languish in jail without bail or marry the victim in Jaripada village in Tangi area of Cuttack district.        
	The single judge bench of Justice L.K. Mishra yesterday asked Maheswar Nayak  lodged in jail on charges of raping a girl of the same village  to either tie the knot with her or face rejection of his bail plea.        
	Masheswar had sexually abused the girl in the pretext of marrying her and later deserted her after she became pregnant, following which she lodged a complaint against him.         
	Police had registered a case of rape and arrested Maheswar. The lower court had refused to grant him bail. Subsequently, he filed a bail petition in the high court.        
	When the bail plea was taken up for hearing yesterday, additional government advocate Sidheswar Behera informed the court that the victim was in the ninth month of pregnancy.         
	The would-be baby would remain deprived of a fathers name.        
	Behera sought judicial intervention for ensuring fathers name for the baby after birth. Taking note of it, Justice Mishra suggested that the accused should marry the victim.         
	The court granted him interim bail for two months to facilitate the marriage.         
	Permanent bail would be allowed only if the accused tied the knot with the victim within this two-month period and allow his name to be the babys father, the bench specified.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           We wont bow to Taliban: Pranab
          OUR BUREAU                          Hussein and wife Chand Sulthana in Mangalore. (PTI)                                  
	April 23: India today said it would continue helping war-ravaged Afghanistan rebuild itself and not bow to pressure from any militant group even as Mangalore native Sarang Mohammad Naeem remained untraced two days after his abduction by suspected Taliban rebels.        
	We cannot succumb to pressure from the Taliban or any extremist group. Our approach is of zero tolerance, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters in Delhi.        
	He said threats and minor attacks were taking place on a daily basis, which was exactly what the Taliban wanted. They do not want any development activity in Afghanistan.        
	Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi, however, said his organisation was not involved in the abduction of Naeem and a Nepalese national as they travelled by car in Herat.        
	We cannot take responsibility for the kidnapping of the two foreigners, he told AFP late tonight. We have asked all our allies but they reject this.        
	In Suralapady village, 20km from Mangalore city, the kidnapped 38-year-olds family said only one call had come so far from the foreign ministry.        
	The call came late on Tuesday night. We were told my son had been kidnapped and all efforts were being made to get him released, Naeems father Mohammed Hussein said.        
	The caller spoke to Naeems brother Gaffoor.        
	Hussein said his son, a father of three, was not working on any project the Indian government was involved with.        
	He was an employee of a Dubai company, which was on contract with a private American firm undertaking work for the US government. We also appeal to whoever has kidnapped my son to release him safely.        
	In Kabul and in Herat, embassy and consulate officials were in touch with local authorities. A hunt is on to track down the kidnappers and we are exploring all options for Naeems release, sources said.

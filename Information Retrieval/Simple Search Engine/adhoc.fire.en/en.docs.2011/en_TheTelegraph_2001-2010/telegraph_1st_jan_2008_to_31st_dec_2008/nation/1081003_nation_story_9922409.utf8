	Metro offers tips to win flab fight    
	The Metro isnt only a travel option but a fitness instructor, too.    
	Authorities who run the capitals most sought-after mode of getting around have launched not a new service  but a campaign asking people to stay fighting fit.    
	And Metro stations could well be the places where some of the cholesterol-melting drills could begin in right earnest.    
	Climbing stairs (at the elevator-equipped stations) has been the best-kept secret to preserve good health. It has been proved one of the best ways to keep weight off, said an official of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.    
	What followed next was a virtual tour de force on the virtues of leading a life of climbing stairs and shunning elevators. A flight of stairs for just 20 minutes can burn 130 calories, more than those burnt during aerobic dancing.    
	Akshay Kumar has been brought into the picture, too, with Metro officials raving about his climb each night up an 80-storey Australian tower during Singh Is Kinngs shooting. The actor is proud of his Delhi roots. (UNI)        
	Showcase hub on new high    
	Hyderabads showpiece has another trophy to flaunt.    
	The aviation hub recently entered into an agreement with Malaysia Airlines to set up a maintenance, repair and overhaul facility that will cater to a variety of planes.    
	The pact between the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd and the airline promises to open up new opportunities for both to capitalise on the fast-growing aviation market in the sub-continent, an airport release said.    
	Prospects for such cooperation appear bright given the fact that around 300 aircraft are flying in India alone. Aviation industry experts say the number makes India one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world.    
	More than 200 aircraft will be added over the next two years, the Hyderabad airport authorities said. (PTI)    
	Penalty jolt to DVD drivers    
	Delhiites with a penchant for movies while driving have a touch choice: get their DVDs off the front panel or pay Rs 300.    
	Traffic police in the capital have launched a special drive recently against cars with DVDs on their panel. They are being prosecuted under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.    
	The fine in the first offence is Rs 100 but it goes up to Rs 300 in subsequent violations, a senior police officer said.    
	The crackdown hasnt stopped at video. Bluelines are being checked to find out if they were playing loud and, as some allege, bawdy songs that embarrass women, the officer said.    
	It has been noticed that buses have installed tape recorders or radios (most of them tuned to FM stations). This practice has to stop as it distracts the attention of the drivers causing accidents or developing tendency to speed up, the officer said.    
	The police had prosecuted 578 bus drivers up to July 15 for playing music. The numbers of DVD devils booked arent known. (PTI)        
	Baby shock    
	The authorities at Madurais government hospital were treated to a rare sight, and a shock recently: a two-headed baby and its death almost minutes after it was born.    
	The baby was born to a 33-year-old woman at the Rajaji Hospital, as the healthcare facility is called in the temple town.     
	The lady, from nearby Valayamkullam, already has two children, aged five and four, hospital sources said. Doctors believe the foetus wasnt conceived properly. A pal of gloom descended on the ward after the babys death. (PTI)

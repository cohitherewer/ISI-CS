          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RJD MLAs enter the House premises. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, March 6: Lalu Prasad loves his cattle. So do the MLAs of Lalus RJD.         
	Proof? They today travelled to Bihar Assembly on a bullock-cart driven by former minister Rajesh Singh. Goal: to highlight the plight of farmers in the state.        
	The sight of Singh and RJD MLAs Bimla Bharti, Akhtar-ul-Imam and Babloo Dev standing on the cart with sugarcane sticks in their hands drew everyones attention, as they entered the Assembly premises around 11am.        
	Earlier, the MLAs defied security personnels request and entered the House premises through the main gate. Other RJD members, including former minister Gajendra Singh, joined the rest of the group on the cart as it headed towards the House portico.         
	The MLAs raised slogans demanding payment of arrears to farmers and opening of closed sugar factories.        
	Ironically, most of Bihars corporation sugar mills were closed during the 15 years of RJD regime. The Nitish Kumar government has initiated processes to set up new factories and get the closed ones reopened.         
	One of the animals managed to soil the House premises and the Assembly Marshal and watch and ward staff immediately ordered a sweeper to clean the place. Security personnel made the MLAs leave their sugarcane sticks behind before entering the House.         
	The ruling BJP-JD U) members raised objections over RJD colleagues obnoxious behaviour during the zero hour.        
	BJP member Bhola Singh requested the Speaker Uday Narain Choudhary for a ruling on the matter. Today, they (RJD) came in a bullock cart. Tomorrow they may come riding donkeys to highlight the problem of washermen, said Singh, calling upon the Speaker to submit a ruling to avoid a repeat of such a scene.        
	The Speaker said he would look into the matter.         
	This not the first time that politician have taken the cattle way  former Prime Minister and BJP patriarch A.B. Vajpayee, too, had travelled to the Parliament on a bullock cart to protest the rise in prices of petroleum products during the Indira Gandhi rule.        
	Site sleaze        
	MLAs belonging to the Opposition RJD, BSP and the Left today walked out of the Assembly to protest against the rejection of their notice on an adjournment motion over the sleazy content in the state government website.         
	Noisy scenes were witnessed when the Speaker, after reading out a notice submitted by RJD MLA Shyam Rajak, rejected it. In the notice Rajak had charged that the video diary section of the official website (www.prdbihar.org) had obscene video clippings which is a matter of shame for all of us.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Supporters wait outside 10 Janpath to greet Sonia Gandhi. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 23: After the thumbs-up in the House, time for a Manmohan stamp.        
	Congress insiders said they expected, for the first time in over four years, the touch of an assertive Prime Minister when he expands his council early next month, a few days before Parliaments monsoon session begins on August 11.        
	They said Manmohan Singh, who had the complete backing of party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, was likely to get a chance to accelerate the pace of banking, insurance and pension reforms and drop ageing and inefficient ministers.        
	Singh is said to be keen on changing the portfolios of ministers like Kapil Sibal as reward for their competence.        
	Sources said JMM leader Shibu Soren is set to return to the cabinet, along with a minister of state from his party, as prize for bailing out the UPA.         
	Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, who called on Sonia and Manmohan, is said to have pitched for the induction of his daughter Kanimozhi.        
	NCP chief Sharad Pawar and RJD boss Lalu Prasad are also keen on minor changes in the allotted quota for allies within the council of ministers.        
	But the point of interest, in Congress circles, has more to do with the likely exit of some senior ministers who have earned the tag of misfit in Team Manmohan. There is a growing feeling within the party that after winning the trust vote, Manmohan should be given the chance to pick his team and drop some of the deadwood.        
	But sources in 10 Janpath said the task was tricky as the party had, over the years, evolved a culture where persons of importance were seldom divested of perks and offices. Rather, as reward for their loyalty and seniority, those dropped from the council of ministers are either given party posts or rehabilitated as governors.        
	In the present context, almost all gubernatorial vacancies were filled weeks before the trust vote.        
	Sources said Sonia might draft some ministers for party work so that Manmohan could inject fresh blood into the government and accommodate new allies.        
	Sources said Sonia might act upon the A.K. Antony Committees recommendations for revitalising the party. One suggestion was ministers who held additional charge of party work should be made to follow the one-man, one-post norm.        
	Saifuddin Soz, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Ajay Makan, Oscar Fernandes, Prithviraj Chavan, Shakil Ahmad, V. Narayanswamy, Jitin Prasada and Jairam Ramesh are some of those who hold dual charge.        
	Chances of the Samajwadi Party joining the government are dim, but some senior leaders feel the heartland outfits induction would provide greater stability.        
	Its inclusion, these leaders added, could also come in handy when the Congress bargains for seats in Uttar Pradesh.

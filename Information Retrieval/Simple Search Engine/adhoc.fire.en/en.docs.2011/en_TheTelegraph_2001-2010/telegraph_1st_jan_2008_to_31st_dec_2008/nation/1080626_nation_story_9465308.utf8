          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: The Supreme Court today pulled up the Mayavati government for taking the law into its hands in the Sahara Sahar case and asked it to rebuild a razed township fence.        
	We are not satisfied with the state governments explanation. If Sahara erected a structure in violation of court orders, the state should have come here, a vacation bench which had earlier this week ordered status quo in the demolition-scarred township observed today.         
	The court ordered the tin fence to be built exactly where the original stood and appointed an officer to monitor compliance till Allahabad High Court disposed of the matter.        
	Within hours of the snub, the state shunted out Lucknow Development Authority vice-chairman Ram Bahadur, under whose supervision the fence was razed, and urban development principal secretary Harminder Raj.        
	The states counsel, Shanti Bhushan, claimed Sahara had erected the tin wall after the status quo order. But the judges werent impressed. Even if the fence was erected after the order, the state should have come to us with a complaint, the bench said.         
	Sahara claimed that the wall had been built after Allahabad High Courts June 19 order restoring possession of the land. It is not physically possible to erect a 750-metre-long wall in a few hours, the Sahara lawyer said.        
	The state is terrorising Sahara with its illegal middle-of-the-night demolitions, Tulsi said. The state has scant respect for the law.        
	Senior counsel L. Nageswar Rao, who will monitor the walls restoration, will submit a report to the high courts Lucknow bench, which will decide if certain constructions in the township, built by Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited, violated town-planning laws.        
	The state had demolished the wall surrounding the 270-acre Sahara Sahar in a late-night swoop on June 17-18 for encroaching on public land, prompting the group to go to Allahabad High Court.

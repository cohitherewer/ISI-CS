	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Magician Jaitley waved his wand, but it was Sheila Dikshit who charmed the voters.        
	As election results trickled in, the buzz in the capitals BJP circles was where had Arun Jaitley  the man who had fashioned impressive victories for his party, most recently in Karnataka  gone wrong.        
	The party had convinced itself long ago that Delhi was as good as won. The Congress, too, seemed to have given up.        
	But things changed all of a sudden when Vijay Kumar Malhotra was chosen as the BJPs candidate for chief minister.        
	The Congress, Sheila Dikshit in particular, smelt an opportunity and summoned the will to battle it out for the third time.        
	Jaitley, too, played a part in this metamorphosis. The rainmaker  who had delivered Gujarat in 2007 and 2002, Bihar in 2005, and Madhya Pradesh in 2003  refused to join the race for chief minister as the post was nothing better than that of a glorified mayor.        
	The party leadership then chose the rusty Malhotra against a chief minister whose amiable political persona was the Congresss USP.        
	The comparison proved costly for the BJP. While Malhotra flaunted his achievements as chief executive of the Delhi Metropolitan Council decades ago, the recent developments visible all over Delhi spoke for Dikshit.        
	This was not the only mistake the BJP made in the run-up to the polls.        
	Jaitleys emphasis on terror also appears to have boomeranged. Some analysts said the aggressive propaganda on this front irked suave voters who were not prepared to see a national crisis through a partisan prism.        
	Others pointed to Jaitleys close association with Delhi. They said in the states where he delivered victories for his party, he could take a dispassionate view of the electoral scene, got surveys done to surgical precision and allotted tickets to potential winners.        
	In Delhi, however, many weak candidates were nominated for reasons other than merit.        
	Sources in the party said at least eight sitting MLAs were extremely unpopular but the leadership could not drop them because of pressures from different lobbies.        
	Senior leaders, they added, managed tickets for people close to them and Jaitley, who had accommodated his own private secretary  who lost  was not in a position to shake off these pressures on purely political grounds.        
	Jaitley, the sources said, also failed to recognise the importance of voters from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.        
	His highly urbanised campaign and over-reliance on the BSP to cut into Congress votes backfired, too.        
	Clearly, the master strategist  hailed as a magician and rainmaker by the media  needs to do some introspection.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Names of Kasabs parents on Pakistan voter list
                            
	London, Dec. 7 (PTI): A British newspaper has obtained the electoral roll for Faridkot village in Pakistans Punjab province with names of 478 voters, including Mohammed Amir, married to Noor Elahi.        
	Mohammed Ajmal Mohammed Amin Kasab, the lone terrorist arrested after the Mumbai attacks, had told interrogators he belonged to Faridkot and was the son of Mohammed Amir Amin. Pakistan has questioned this.        
	But a villager in Faridkot told The Observer: Weve all known from the first day that it was him, Ajmal Amir. His mother started crying when she saw his picture on the television.        
	The newspaper tracked down Kasabs home and found conclusive proof of his identity. At the address mentioned in the voters list, a man identifying himself as Sultan said he was the father-in-law of Mohammed Amir. The Observer published a photograph of the house and a food cart owned by Kasabs father.         
	Indian interrogators had said Kasabs father was a paani-puri chaat wala.         
	The newspaper has obtained the national identity card numbers of Amir and Noor  3530121767339 and 3530157035058. Faridkot falls under union council number five, tehsil Depalpur, district Okara, it said.        
	After many residents tried to mislead the newspapers correspondent, one villager said: Youre being given misinformation. Weve all known from the first day that it was him, Ajmal Amir.        
	Ajmal used to go to Lahore to work as a labourer, continued the villager who feared being named. Hes been away for maybe four years. When he came back once a year, he would say things like We are going to free Kashmir. He had last visited a couple of months ago, for Id.         
	Attempts to meet Kasabs father, however, were not successful. Villagers eventually said he and his wife had mysteriously been spirited away earlier in the week.        
	Kasab had little education, the residents said.         
	The villager said Faridkot was an active recruiting ground for the banned Lashkar-e-Toiba. They brainwash our youth about jihad, there are people who do it in this village. It is so wrong, he was quoted as saying.         
	Lashkar founder Mohammed Hafiz Saeed had visited nearby Depalpur, where there were hundreds of supporters, the newspaper said, adding that a Lashkar office in Depalpur had been hurriedly closed in the past few days. A newspaper of the militant group is distributed in Depalpur and Faridkot.        
	Depalpur lies to the south of Punjab, an economically backward area. Some residents said Faridkot and another poor village nearby, Tara Singh, were recruitment grounds for the Lashkar.        
	On the side of a building just outside Faridkot, graffiti reads: Go for jihad. For jihad. Markaz Dawat ul-Irshad. Markaz is linked to the Lashkar.

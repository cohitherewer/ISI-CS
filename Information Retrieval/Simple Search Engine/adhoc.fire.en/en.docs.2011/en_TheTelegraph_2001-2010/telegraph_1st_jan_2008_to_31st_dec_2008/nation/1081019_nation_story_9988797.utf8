          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Manmohan Singh today assured the Congresss Muslim representatives that he would do whatever was best advised to find a solution to the controversy triggered by the Jamianagar encounter.        
	Singh told the delegation that as their leader and colleague, he realised they were answerable to people on the questions and doubts regarding the shootout that followed the Delhi blasts.         
	Sources quoted Singh as saying he would make his own judgement. I dont go by anyones views. I will take a decision. If need be, I will call you again, he reportedly told Salman Khurshid, K. Rahman Khan, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and the others who called on him.        
	Unlike a section of the ruling UPA, which has dismissed the demand for a probe into the incident as unnecessary, the Prime Minister acknowledged that the minority leaders concerns were legitimate, the sources said.        
	The delegation stressed that Singh should do what was fair and will fully satisfy public disquiet. They did not bring up the demand for a judicial probe, but instead suggested an inquest to come up with a detailed sequence of the September 19 shootout.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fuss over US manhole tip 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Fuss over US manhole tip

	Mumbai, June 12: When it comes to its manholes, Mumbai puts its foot down.        
	Not in the manholes, of course, but on anyone who points the finger of scorn at them  even if its mighty America.        
	The US consulate has apologised after warning American tourists to beware Mumbais open but unmarked manholes, often an invisible trap under waterlogged monsoon streets. Or so civic officials claimed today.        
	They have apologised to the municipal commissioner for the advisory. We have received the letter today, additional municipal commissioner R.A. Rajeev said.        
	US consul-general Michael Owens letter, however, doesnt read too much like an apology. He has clarified that the advisory was not intended to ask Americans to avoid Mumbai.        
	I most certainly have not advised Americans to avoid Mumbai. In fact, several high-level delegations will be visiting Mumbai over the next two months, Owen writes. (The) notice was issued to assist US citizens (who are) entirely new to India and have never experienced the monsoon in Mumbai previously.        
	The advisory, issued on Monday, said: To ease flooding in Mumbai, Bombay Municipal Corporation workers will open manhole covers on roads, and there may be no markers. In reduced visibility conditions, you could drive into one of these open manholes.        
	Furious civic authorities, however, felt it was the consulate that needed to watch its steps and avoid diplomatic pitfalls.        
	Not a single accident has been reported due to these manholes that you claim have been left open. All of them are properly marked and manned even when they are left open, additional municipal commissioner Rajeev wrote to the consulate.        
	The advisory, issued just when municipal staff were gearing up to fight the onslaught of the monsoon, has hurt the sentiments of the workers who put their heart and soul into looking after these manholes even during the rains, Rajeev wrote.        
	I would request you to remove this part from your advisory as it is far from the truth and presents a wrong picture of the city to the world.        
	Its unclear if the M-word would be deleted, but Owen said: In my discussion with the press, I stated very clearly, but it regrettably was not reported, that the BMC is doing a very admirable job under difficult circumstances in dealing with the special challenges posed by the monsoon.        
	Heavy rains can cause flooding anywhere in the world as we have seen recently in the US. I continue to believe that you and the BMC are doing a good job.        
	Mayor Shubha Raul, too, wrote to the consulate today. I have sought an explanation for insulting Mumbai, she said.        
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, however, dismissed the advisory and urged US tourists to visit Mumbai and enjoy its monsoon.        
	Americans need not worry. To protect the citizens is the duty of the state government. We are geared to tackle any eventuality, Deshmukh said.        
	The consulate had earlier warned US citizens to be careful about the political violence in Mumbai in February this year, when the Maharashtra Navnirman Senas anti-north Indian campaign had taken a violent turn.

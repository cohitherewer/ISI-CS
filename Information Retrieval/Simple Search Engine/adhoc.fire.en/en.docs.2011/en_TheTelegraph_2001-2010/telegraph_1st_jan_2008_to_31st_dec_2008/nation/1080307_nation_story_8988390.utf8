The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Birth bonanza enhances zoo honour
                                                                                                               Birth bonanza enhances zoo honour
  - Mortality rate dips in nandan kanan, several born          OUR CORRESPONDENT                
	Bhubaneswar, March 6: If recent figures are any indication, Nandan Kanan Zoological Park could be the best place for endangered species.         
	The zoo, of late, has been teeming with newborn animals much to the delight of visitors and officials.         
	The authorities state that they have not seen so many births in a single year before. Twenty young ones, including two tiger cubs and Indian pangolins, were born last month.         
	Till the first week of March there has been 144 births, including 72 mammals, 58 birds and 12 reptiles, in the zoo. One of the two new pangolins was born on Wednesday. The birth of so many animals certifies Nandan Kanan as a progressive zoo. Reproductive health is a good indicator of the overall health of a species in captivity. Nandan Kanan has been promoting itself as an institution that can conserve species and it has been doing so, said the zoo director, Ajit Pattnaik.         
	The zoo enjoys the rare distinction of being successful in rearing species like Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata)  a highly threatened group.         
	For long our zoo has been emphasising on animal welfare, health, ethics and excellence in animal husbandry with emphasis on enclosures, Pattnaik said.         
	The authorities are also lauding the dip in mortality rate.         
	Till the first week of March 2008, there have been 57 deaths, lowest in the history of the zoo and one of the lowest in any Indian zoo.         
	To achieve this, health was given priority, Pattnaik said.         
	To provide the best care we employ three veterinary surgeons. Besides, we have a well-equipped hospital with adequate infrastructure to monitor animals all the time, he added.         
	The efforts were not easy, or cheap. A captive slaughterhouse, first-of-its-kind in the country, was started to provide fresh meat to the carnivores. Doctors conducted ante and post-mortem scan of the animals slaughtered daily by authorities.         
	In addition, the zoo started a fodder farm to provide quality feed to herbivores. The farm is cent per cent self-sufficient.         
	At Nandan Kanan, health monitoring is carried out on a daily basis. Periodic vaccination and de-worming protocols are followed meticulously. Care is taken to protect the animals from extreme weather. Special arrangements are taken in winter and summer, Pattnaik said.         
	Besides, a five-member technical committee constituted by the government regularly monitors and reviews health.         
	We maintain a liaison with Orissa Veterinary College and avail the services of their health committee in case of emergencies. The services of Centre of Wildlife Health, also functioning from Orissa Veterinary College, are also availed, said Pattnaik.

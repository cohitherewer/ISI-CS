The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena for Hindu suicide squads
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sena for Hindu suicide squads
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Thackeray                                  
	Mumbai, June 18: Shiv Sena boss Bal Thackeray today suggested suicide squads could be formed to protect Hindus and combat the rising threat of Islamic terrorism.        
	Commenting on the arrests of some activists who allegedly planted bombs in theatres staging a play perceived as denigrating Hindu religious icons, he said a better option would be to form Hindu suicide squads.        
	This entire episode is hilarious and reeks of stupidity. Islamic terrorism is on the rise in India and Hindu terrorism should also be equally strong to fight it. Hindus can survive if, like Islamic terrorists, Hindu suicide squads are created to protect the Hindus and the nation, he wrote in an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna.        
	On Monday, four activists of the Sanatan Sanstha and Hindu Jana Jagruti Samiti Hindu right-wing organisations campaigning against denigration of Hindu religious icons  were picked up by the anti-terror squad for allegedly planting explosive devices at theatres in Vashi and Thane and a cinema hall in Panvel.        
	The theatres had been staging a Marathi play, Amhi Pachpute, which is a spoof on the Mahabharat. The cinema was screening Jodhaa Akbar, which the activists claimed distorted facts and glorified the Mughal emperor.        
	The editorial, which sparked a political controversy this morning and had ally BJP scrambling to distance itself from the Sena, has, however, not condemned the acts of the activists.        
	It was heartening to know that it was the supporters of Hindutva who had exploded the bomb in the theatre. But it was sad to know that it was planted to hurt the Hindus and I am ashamed about it, it said.        
	Whether Jodha was Akbars wife or did Jodha exist at all? Hindus are red with anger over these questions, but will it stop the murderous attacks by Islam on Hindu society?        
	Instead of exploding low-intensity bombs in Marathi plays and turning themselves into a laughing stock, if Sanatan activists had created a Hindu bomb to counter the Islamic bomb they would have featured in the list of revolutionaries.        
	Thackeray also accused the Congress and the UPA of playing foul over the Ram Janmabhoomi issue and termed the Sachar Committee report an Islamic bomb.        
	In Delhi, BJP general secretary Venkaiah Naidu said only democratic methods should be used to counter terrorism. People should not take the law into their hands. It is the duty of the government to counter terror.        
	Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil said the state government would study the editorial and not hesitate to take action if objectionable content were found.

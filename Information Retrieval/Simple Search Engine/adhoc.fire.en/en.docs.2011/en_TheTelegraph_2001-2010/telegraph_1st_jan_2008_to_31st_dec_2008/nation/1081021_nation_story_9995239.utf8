          SHEENA K.                                            
	Raipur, Oct. 20: Twelve CRPF jawans were killed in an encounter with Maoists in Bijapur district this afternoon.        
	Two rebels were also killed in the encounter while six jawans were injured. Three of them are reported to be critical and had to be later airlifted to Raipur for better medical attention.        
	About 30 jawans from the 170th battalion of the CRPFs Modakpal base camp this morning left for a routine search operation. Ahead of the Assembly elections, patrolling in forested areas had been intensified in Bijapur district, which will go to the polls on November 14.        
	When the team reached near Kongupelli  about 22km from the Bijapur district headquarters and 400km south of Raipur  the Maoists opened indiscriminate fire on the jawans around 12.30pm.        
	Sources said the ambush was meticulously planned by the rebels, as they took position from all sides and sprayed bullets before the jawans could open fire.         
	Besides heavy firing, the Naxalites also lobbed grenades on the security personnel, deputy inspector-general of police (intelligence) Pawan Deo said. Most of the jawans died of bullet injuries, he added. Twelve jawans died on the spot.         
	As the message was flashed on the wireless sets by the jawans who escaped the attack, reinforcement was immediately rushed to the spot. The sources said with more reinforcement reaching the spot, the Maoists fled to adjoining forests.         
	The security personnel recovered bodies of two Maoists who succumbed to the bullets, senior police officers said. Two weapons were also found from the site.         
	Pawan Deo said that the rebels also took away eight weapons from the jawans. The senior police officers are verifying which kind of weapons were looted by the rebels.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Congress, BJP in wheat war 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Nov. 19: The Congress today promised wheat to the poorest of poor at Rs 1 a kg if it came to power in Madhya Pradesh in a manifesto peppered with sops. The BJP had offered the cereal at Rs 2 a kg days back.        
	Interest-free farm loans and a new department to implement the Sachar Committee recommendations are the other key features of the Congress manifesto released today for the November 27 polls.        
	The Congresss manifesto committee chairman and foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, unveiled the document here with state party chief Suresh Pachauri.        
	The leaders declined to spell out how the state would bear the financial burden of the wheat promise but Pranab pointed out that the Congress government in Andhra Pradesh was fulfilling its pledge to supply rice at Rs 1 a kg to the poor. Salt will be given free to poor families.        
	The sops came days after the ruling BJP tried to court voters with farm loans at 3 per cent, besides cheap wheat that would be sold to the poor through ration shops.

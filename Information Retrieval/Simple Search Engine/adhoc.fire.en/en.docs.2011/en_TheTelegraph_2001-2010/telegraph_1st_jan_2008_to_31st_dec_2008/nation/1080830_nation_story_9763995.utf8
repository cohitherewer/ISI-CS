          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          A pro-Amarnath protester in Jammu on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 29: The Jammu and Kashmir government today suspended nine Hindu and Muslim employees accused of inciting riots in Jammus Muslim-majority Kishtwar district on the sidelines of the Amarnath land agitation.        
	The action came as police continued their crackdown on separatist leaders, arresting Shabir Shah from a hideout after a massive hunt that included raids on mainstream politicians homes.        
	However, discussions with the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti to resolve the land controversy were put off for the second time in three days because the head of the government talks panel, S.S. Bloeria, failed to recover from illness.        
	The nine suspended employees are from the health, agriculture and forest departments, an official said, adding: There are Class III and Class IV employees from both communities.        
	The Samiti, which is leading the pro-Amarnath agitation, had blamed Muslim government employees and workers of the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for last fortnights Kishtwar riots.        
	The police forwarded a list of 15 employees found instigating the mobs. Nine of them work in our district and the others are posted in central government departments, said Kishtwar deputy commissioner Sudershan Sharma.         
	An official said talks with the Samiti were likely tomorrow, with Bloeria expected to reach Jammu from Srinagar. The head of the four-member panel set up by governor N.N. Vohra had suffered a fall at his home, Samiti spokesperson Narendra Singh said.        
	As the Valley groaned under six straight days of curfew, the authorities prevented Friday prayers at Srinagars Jamia Masjid fearing protests. Many other mosques on the main roads too were not allowed to hold prayers, PTI reported quoting sources.        
	Prayers, however, were allowed at many other mosques. In Bandipore, north Kashmir, thousands marched after the prayers, shouting slogans.        
	Shabir Shah was arrested from a hideout in Rawalpora in the afternoon. His whereabouts were traced with the help of a landline. The area was cordoned off and several houses were searched, which led to his arrest, a police source said.

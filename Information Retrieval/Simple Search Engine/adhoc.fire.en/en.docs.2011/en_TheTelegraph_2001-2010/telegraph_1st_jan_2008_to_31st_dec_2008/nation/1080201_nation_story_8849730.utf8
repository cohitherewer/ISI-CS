	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The BJP has geared up for next years general elections, working out all aspects of poll management and naming commanders for each battle zone. 
    
	Under the plans firmed up at the partys national council meeting, shadow Prime Minister L.K. Advani will lead from the front, kicking off with 13 public rallies over the next two months.
    
	Party president Rajnath Singh will be in charge of planning and execution.
    
	Arun Jaitley will oversee strategy sessions while Sushma Swaraj will coordinate with allies and state leaders to work out alliances and seat adjustments.
    
	The national council meeting offered pointers to the pecking order in Advanis scheme of things. But other than Rajnath, Sushma and Jaitley, only Narendra Modi appeared to have established himself among the top rung.
    
	Modi, who gave a rousing speech at the just-concluded conclave, earned praise from Advani. If a son achieves name and fame, it is cause for celebration in the family. It is nothing to worry about, the former party chief said. 
    
	While Rajnath appeared in control right through the three-day meet, Sushma showed her ability to connect with party workers. Jaitley, asked to present the political resolution, was more than impressive at the job.
    
	The speeches of Murli Manohar Joshi and Jaswant Singh appeared lacklustre, perhaps a signal that the generation change had well and truly taken place in the BJP.
    
	RSS representatives, too, were kept on the margins.
    
	Rajnath, accustomed by now to playing second fiddle to Advani, rarely missed an opportunity to assert himself as the second-in-command.
    
	He was reverential towards Advani, but chose to warn senior colleagues against indiscreet behaviour and over-enthusiasm.
     
	Leaders must work with a big heart, the party chief said in an allusion to the problems among second-rung leaders. On several occasions, difference of opinion may surface. To resolve this, we require self-restraint. The organisation may witness divergent directions but this should be overcome through coordination, he said. 
    
	This was seen as a veiled warning to leaders and party workers who went public with their grudges and resentment.
    
	Today is the era of communication. In this age of media, it is important to appropriately use the various channels of communication, he said.
    
	However, our attention should be focused on the grassroots. Only then will our influence on politics be truly visible. And this influence will finally help us reach our destination.
    
	Advani, too, appeared willing to take everyone along. The party veteran, for instance, agreed to form a larger election management committee after his initial small group caused heartburn.

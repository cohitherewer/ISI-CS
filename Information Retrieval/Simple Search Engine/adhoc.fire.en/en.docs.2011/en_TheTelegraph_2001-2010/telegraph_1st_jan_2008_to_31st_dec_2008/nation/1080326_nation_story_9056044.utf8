          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 25: Members of the BJD-BJP coalition today stalled Assembly proceedings protesting against an alleged UPA move to delete 10 lakh economically weak families from the BPL list.         
	Interestingly, the ruling party members, who seldom stage dharna inside the House, rushed to the well for sloganeering against the UPA government.         
	The Opposition members retaliated by shouting slogans against the NDA government and chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The prevailing pandemonium forced Speaker Maheswar Mohanty to adjourn the House twice for 40 minutes.         
	Raising the issue during the zero hour, senior BJD member and former government chief whip Pradeep Maharathy drew the Houses attention to the rejection of the states BPL list by the Centre.         
	Maharathy added that the move came despite Naveen Patnaiks recent meeting with Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, where the former requested the latter to not to strike out 10 lakh families from the list. However, the Centre turned down the request, lamented the BJD member. He went on to add that the Centre had also threatened to stop benefits under the Indira Awas Yojana from April 1 if the government does not prepare a revised BPL list.         
	Government chief whip Kishore Mohanty and deputy chief whip Mohan Charan Majhi tried to persuade them to come back to their seats, but provoked by the remarks of Maharathy few Congress legislators trooped into the Well and raised slogans against the NDA government.         
	Senior Congress member Nalinikanta Mohanty pointed out that the move to revise the BPL list was initiated during the NDA regime in 2002.         
	Tempers ran high as the treasury members started shouting retaliating to Mohantys action.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dawa empties bank accounts
                            
	New York, Dec. 14 (PTI): The Jamaat-ud-Dawa has been able to transfer money out of most of its public bank accounts, negating the impact of the crackdown by Pakistan, the Wall Street Journal said today.         
	The dismantling of the charity, blacklisted by the UN as a terrorist group after the Mumbai attacks, is being seriously hampered by Pakistans difficulties in tracking and seizing millions of dollars the group is believed to have stashed in accounts in Pakistan and abroad, the paper said.        
	The public lead-up to the UN action, which came on Thursday on Indias request, gave the group ample time to transfer money out of most of its public bank accounts, an unidentified Pakistani finance ministry official was quoted by the Journal as saying.        
	The official estimated that the Dawa, a front for the Lashkar-e-Toiba that has been blamed for the Mumbai attacks, has moved hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions, in recent days.        
	If we dont take away money, it can re-open any time, the official told the paper. The money in Pakistan is hidden now. We wont find it.         
	Dawa officials have been unavailable for comment since Thursdays clampdown.         
	As of Friday afternoon, the Journal said, one Dawa account remained open for supporters to deposit donations at least for the moment. People could still deposit money in the account at a Lahore branch of Bank Alfalah Ltd, a small lender part-owned by investors in Abu Dhabi, said the banks operations officer, who would give his name only as Ali.         
	The bank official said neither the Dawa nor the government had asked him to shut the account, which was in the name of Markaz Jamaat-ud-Dawa. Markaz means headquarters of in Urdu.         
	Pakistans central bank ordered all of Dawas assets frozen and accounts closed on Thursday, and Pakistani officials said they believed banks were complying with the order, but wouldnt comment on the Alfalah account.         
	Rehman Malik, Pakistans interior minister, said investigations into the Dawas assets and funding were under way. But he added: The government is not tracking everyones accounts, frankly speaking.

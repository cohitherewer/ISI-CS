     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Feb. 3: Sharp differences have cropped up again in the BJP, the ally of the ruling NDA in Bihar, over Nitish Kumar delaying the expansion of his ministry even after over two years of becoming the chief minister.
    
	Nine more ministers are to be added in the 27-member Nitish Kumar-led council of ministers. As per the proportion of the JD(U) and the BJP MLAs in the state legislature, four from the JD(U) and five from the BJP are supposed to join the ministry.
    
	However, a section of the BJP MLAs expressed their resentment at their close door legislature party meeting over the chief minister delaying the ministry expansion for no obvious reasons. 
    
	The MLAs believed to be the aspirants of the ministerial berth also directed their anger on the deputy chief minister, Sushil Kumar Modi, for his failure to put pressure on Nitish Kumar to expand his ministry and ensure that the deserving MLAs got their rightful positions. 
    
	Modi, who belongs to the BJP, was present in the meeting.
    
	Insiders in the BJP revealed that senior party MLA Bhola Singh, who has been harbouring the ambition to join Kumar-led ministry ever since the formation of the government, went to the extent of telling there is corruption all around. The local government officers at the block and district levels were exploiting the people. The government has no control over its officials.
    
	Four other MLAs at the meeting, according to sources, also approved what Bhola Singh said. 
    
	Singh told The Telegraph: Whatever I said I said it on our party forum. It is not wise for me to tell everything to the media that I said in our internal meeting. 
    
	He, however, added: The chief minister must expand his ministry. A full strength ministry will ensure better work and better development in the state.
    
	The party spokesman, Vinod Narayan Jha, denied that there were complaints against the chief minister and deputy chief minister over the delay on the expansion of the ministry. He, however, admitted that the MLAs wanted the government to carry out the development work in a more co-ordinated manner to yield better results. Contacted, Nitish Kumar said, There is vacancy in the ministry. The expansion is on the cards. 
    
	But he refused to reveal the timing when he would take up the exercise to expand his cabinet.
    
	Nitish, according to the grapevine, does not want to expand the ministry in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections due early next year to avoid a rebellion in the NDA rank as he has far more claimants against nine positions he can offer. A section of BJP led by Bhola Singh had raised a virtual banner of revolt on the issue in July last year, too.

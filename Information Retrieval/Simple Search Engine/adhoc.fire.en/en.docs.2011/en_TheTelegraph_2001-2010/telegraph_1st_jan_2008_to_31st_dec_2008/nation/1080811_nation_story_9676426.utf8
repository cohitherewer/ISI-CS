          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Mayavati: Development deal                                  
	Lucknow, Aug. 10: If the BJP has its Ram, the Bahujan Samaj Party has found its Krishna.        
	In her new-found avatar of protector of the upper castes, Mayavati has turned her gaze towards Vrindavan and Mathura, the birthplace of Krishna, by offering a development package of Rs 250 crore.        
	The largesse is part of her effort to wean away upper caste voters from the BJP, which has harped on Ram Janmabhoomi and Ram Setu, and send out the message that she has the vision for development that a prime ministerial candidate must have.         
	The Left and other constituents of the third front have zeroed in on Mayavati as a potential prime ministerial candidate.        
	The foundation for the first part of the development projects was laid on Wednesday.        
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, who has been wooing upper castes to broaden her support base, took a dig at the BJP by saying that Vrindavan and Mathura were ignored by other parties that had ruled the state.         
	No other government in the past had bothered about the plight of the pilgrims and the people of Mathura and Vrindavan, Mayavati said.        
	The architect of these projects is S.C. Mishra, the Brahmin face of her party.        
	Mayavati voiced her sympathy for Hindu pilgrims and foreign tourists who come to Krishnas birthplace, saying the twin cities had not been developed despite their historical, religious and cultural importance. The pilgrims, she said, suffer all types of problems in reaching temples and other religious places.         
	Political analysts are not surprised by this effort to reach out beyond her core votebank among the Dalits.         
	Mayavati, who strode beyond her exclusive politics in 2007 and won a sweeping electoral victory, now appears to be trying to consolidate her position.         
	The attempt to bring in Krishna is also aimed at parts of eastern India and some pockets of the south where Ram is not the presiding deity. Besides, even in the heartland states, she wants to make a dent in Yadav votes. The Yadavs look upon Krishna as their own God.        
	The BSP government is committed to the development of urban areas and after the completion of the first phase of projects in Mathura and Vrindavan, pilgrims would find better basic facilities, the chief minister said.         
	The projects launched for Krishna Janmabhoomi includes construction of a railway overbridge on a metre gauge line (Rs 230 crore), a Ganga pollution control project (Rs 22.71 crore), a bridge on the Yamuna river at KC Ghat (Rs 20 crore), renovation of roads in Vrindavan (Rs 94.55 crore), setting up a power sub-station and a 25km 132 KVA transmission line from Maat (Rs 38.82 crore).         
	She said all projects would be completed on time and mostly within a year. The government has set up a committee headed by the Mathura district magistrate to monitor all development projects in the region and ensure timely completion.

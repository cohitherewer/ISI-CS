          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Saharsa, Sept. 19: They have lost all, but havent given up the fight for survival.        
	Exactly a month after the Kosi river changed its course and fates of millions of villagers, people have made a beeline at Saharsa railway station to move to another part of the country to rebuild homes and lives.        
	Bijoy Yadav of Sourabazaar still has no idea about his family members  wife, two siblings, mother and three brothers. I have no idea where they are; living or not, said a sobbing Bijoy after a futile search for his family at relief camps at the station.        
	I will die here because their memories haunt me. My ancestral cultivated land was completely destroyed by the floods. I will have to find a job elsewhere for survival, Bijoy said before boarding a Delhi-bound train.        
	Ramesh Jha of Pratapganj came to a relatives house in a Supaul village to take shelter only to find the hamlet being washed away.         
	I have started pulling rickshaw just to save my family from dying of hunger. I have hired the rickshaw at Rs 100 for eight hours and can earn Rs 200 daily, said the graduate youth, who once enjoyed a comfortable life.        
	We dont have money to eat, how can we purchase a ticket to Delhi? said Durganath Jha of Supaul hoping the railways would offer them free ticket to Delhi. Like Saharsa, railway stations at Madhepura, Mansi, Khagaria, Katihar and Naugachhia became over-crowded with the flood evacuees.         
	While trains to Delhi prove to be insufficient to burden the rush of flood victims, clashes often break out between villagers and conductors of buses which somehow operate in some areas. We have to carry the villagers on free trips, said Arjun Paswan, the conductor of a Patna-Siliguri bus operating on the NH-31.         
	We are trying to arrange for government buses, said Kosi divisional commissioner Hem Chandra Sirohi.

	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The law commission wants the executive to have equal say in the appointment of judges, a suggestion that comes just at the right time for the government.        
	The Centre and the judiciary are currently at odds over the elevation of three high court chief justices to the Supreme Court.        
	The government did have an equal say in judges appointments till 1993, when the Supreme Court whittled its role down.        
	The law panel, headed by former apex court judge A.R. Lakshmanan and made up by legal experts, today handed its report to the law minister advising restoration of the pre-1993 system. It said it had taken the matter up on its own.        
	Till 1993, the judiciary  especially the Chief Justice of India  had to consult the executive while appointing apex court and high court judges. But that year, the apex court diluted that norm down to concurrence, which meant the government had to agree with the chief justices recommendations.        
	The chief justice, in turn, was bound to consult a collegium of the senior-most judges of the court concerned, which had to arrive at a consensus over the names. Legal experts said that in practice, the chief justices opinion almost always prevailed.        
	One criticism of the post-1993 system has been that it lacks a mechanism to verify the antecedents of the judges  for instance, the genuineness of their educational qualifications. All that is done is a background security check by the Centre.        
	The law panel has backed this argument, a key weapon in the governments arsenal against the collegium system.        
	Judges constituting the collegium are not conversant with the names and antecedents of the candidates and, more often than not, appointments suffer from lack of adequate information, a government press release has quoted the panel as saying.        
	If the panels suggestion is to be implemented, the apex court has to reconsider its 1993 judgments, or the government has to bypass the courts and get a law passed in Parliament.        
	The Centre recently returned to the chief justice, for reconsideration, the names of three judges but the collegium has sent the names back, leaving the government with no option but to agree.

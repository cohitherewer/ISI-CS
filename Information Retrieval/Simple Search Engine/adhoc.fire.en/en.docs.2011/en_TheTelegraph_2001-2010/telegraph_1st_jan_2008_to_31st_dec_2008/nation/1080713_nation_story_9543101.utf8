                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cong readies booklet bomb

	New Delhi, July 12: The gloves are off  now its time to go ballistic.        
	A day after Rahul Gandhi lauded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his bold stand, the Congress has gone into overdrive to propagate the virtues of the nuclear deal and answer the charges of the BJP and the Left more aggressively than before.        
	Sonia Gandhi and her general secretaries have decided to rework the contents of a booklet the party had compiled last year to make it sharper. The new version will be translated into several languages and distributed across the country.        
	The first booklet is basically a response to the clarifications sought by the Left. We had sounded defensive because the government was then dependent on the Left and the party had not firmed up a political line. The gloves are off since, a source said.        
	The Congress president has asked us to inform the people the deal is good for the country, chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.        
	Sources said they would link the deal with Indias energy needs and emphasise how it would bring bijli (electricity) to every village. The deal would also figure prominently as a poll issue.        
	The demand from the ground, however, is the message should be more muscular.        
	Energy security and such concepts are too esoteric for my voters, a Delhi MP said. They equate the deal with the bomb. Hindus and Muslims alike say it will help us flatten Pakistan and China. We obviously cannot use the same idiom but, if our message should have a strong nationalist overtone to make it voter-friendly, this is the best way to blunt the BJPs offensive.        
	A joke Rahul cracked on the Left at yesterdays working committee meeting summed up the partys mood.        
	Alluding to a recent booklet on the deal the Left had released, the Amethi MP played on the word Left and reportedly said: Its called Lefts stand on the nuclear deal, it should be called left standing on the deal.        
	Some leaders said the campaign should take the comrades head on.         
	The UPA came into being on the issue of communalism. If the Left votes with the communal forces (in Parliament), it will be making common cause with them, a general secretary said. We can state with pride that we are the only party that never aligned with the BJP.        
	Others, however, said the Congress should leave the door ajar for a reconciliation with the Left keeping the 2009 elections in mind.        
	The party has beefed up its media apparatus by appointing 11 new spokespersons, including Digvijay Singh, Prithviraj Chavan, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Renuka Chowdhury and Salman Khurshid.        
	An effort is on to ensure that six jailed MPs  Mohammed Shahabuddin, Suraj Bhan, Pappu Yadav (all from Bihar), and Atiq Ahmed, Afzal Ansari and Umakant Yadav (from Uttar Pradesh)  were in the capital on the day of the vote. Except for Umakant, the rest are from the UPA.

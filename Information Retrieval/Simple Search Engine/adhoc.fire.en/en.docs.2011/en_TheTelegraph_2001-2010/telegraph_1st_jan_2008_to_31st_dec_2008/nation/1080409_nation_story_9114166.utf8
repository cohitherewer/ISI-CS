          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 8: The Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow, plans to set up a research facility dedicated to the study of climate change and its impact on business and industry, the first such centre in any Indian B-school.         
	Called the Centre for Business of Climate Change, the facility is likely to start functioning within three months, IIM Lucknow officials said. The Tata Group, Osram India and international NGO Greenpeace are likely to support the IIM in running the climate study centre, the officials said.         
	Risks from climate change are likely to affect Indian businesses in a manner most industries are currently unprepared for. Part of the problem is the absence of sufficient research on the subject here. Thats where we want to fill in, Sushi Kumar, chairperson of the agri-business section at the IIM, said. Kumar will head the new centre, officials said.         
	Apart from research, the centre will hold short-term executive programmes to help corporate officials deal with challenges posed by climate change, Kumar said.         
	Initially, we do not plan to offer full courses for students at the centre. But eventually, the plan is to develop the centre for academic purposes, over and above its use as a research facility, Kumar said.         
	In addition to the executive programmes, the centre will also offer consultancy services to corporate groups to assist them in reducing carbon emission, officials said.         
	Businesses are believed to be the worst culprits for the crisis of climate change. There is increasing pressure from society on businesses to become environment-friendly, IIM Lucknow director Devi Singh said.

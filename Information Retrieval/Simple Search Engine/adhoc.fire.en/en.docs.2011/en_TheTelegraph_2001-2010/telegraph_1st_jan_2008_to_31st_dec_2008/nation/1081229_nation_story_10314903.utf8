  - Congress sees sense in aligning with National Conference, game for Omar or Farooq as CM        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Congress supporters celebrate outside a counting centre in Jammu. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Congress appears most likely to go with the National Conference after a meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party chief Sonia Gandhi held this evening to assess the election verdict.        
	Ahmed Patel, Sonias political secretary, and Prithviraj Chavan, the general secretary in charge of Jammu and Kashmir, were present.        
	The way the numbers have panned out, we are left with little elbow space. If a party (National Conference) has the required numbers to lead a government, it would be foolhardy and unwise to embark on another course and try and manufacture a coalition with another entity with whom we may have worked in the past (Peoples Democratic Party), a Congress leader said.         
	What Jammu amp; Kashmir needs at this moment, when we are tackling far bigger challenges, is a stable government, a natural government and not an artificially manufactured one.        
	Earlier in the day, Sonia termed the verdict a lesson for Pakistan. The people of the Valley, the people of Jammu, the people of Jammu amp; Kashmir have expressed their faith in the democratic system. It is a lesson to be learnt by our neighbours.         
	She said she had been firm from the beginning that it did not matter who won but elections must be held on time.        
	The large turnout is a vote for democracy, a vote for national integration. Therefore, we are all happy, the Prime Minister said.         
	Congress sources said they were aware that the PDP, with which the party formed a coalition in 2003, was an unknown entity out of government. Our fears are compounded by the perception that the PDP addressed the soft separatist constituency and got its votes. We will have to deal deftly with them, a source said.        
	Sources said the Congress did not want to alienate the PDP because if there is an accident with the National Conference, we do not wish to plunge Jammu and Kashmir into political uncertainty.         
	Its important for a government to last its term, a source said.        
	The Congress has tentatively worked out some ground rules:         
	The larger party will lead the coalition but the Congress will ask for a deputy chief minister        
	It is ready to accept as chief minister either of the Abdullahs: Farooq or Omar. Omar is said to be a good friend of Rahul Gandhi        
	It has not decided whether it should ask to share the six-year term with the National Conference. In the last government, the PDP and the Congress had taken turns at the chief ministers post.        
	One view is that the party should let the National Conference rule for the full term, so that in the next election, the Abdullahs take the rap for any omissions or commissions. The Congress also wants an exit route in case things sour with the National Conference.        
	Before announcing its decision on an alliance, the Congress is expected to go through the ritual of a consultation Sonia will have with former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and Union minister and state unit chief Saifuddin Soz.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | I heard my child call Ammi
                                                                                                            I heard my child call Ammi
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: For over five hours, little Rukaiya fought death.        
	Then her scorched six-year-old body that had 90 per cent burns gave up.        
	Wails of grieving parents rose above the din as they waited for news of their children at suburban Mumbais Cooper Hospital, where the kids, all between six and nine, were taken after the LPG-fitted van carrying them home caught fire.        
	As the vehicle burst into flames, none of the 11, all students of Millat High School in suburban Oshiwara, had any chance of scrambling out.        
	Three of the 11 kids in the Maruti Omni died on the spot. Two died in hospital.        
	I dont know how I will get on with life. I cant imagine Ill never see her smiling face again, sobbed Rukaiyas mother as she collapsed on the ground littered with burnt pieces of cloth that had fallen off the tiny bodies.        
	Some parents burst into tears as they recognised familiar socks or napkins. I wouldnt have recognised him if I wasnt his mother. His face is burnt, his eyes are bandaged, and I saw him through a glass covering, cried Atiya Rehman.        
	Her son Mudassar is struggling with 40 per cent burns.        
	I could hear him call out Ammi, but I couldnt touch my baby and reassure him. I hope his eyes are fine.        
	The Rehmans, who live far away in Borivli as do most of the families of the dead and injured children, said they used the services of a private travel agency and not the school bus as it saved them time.        
	Whether the car had proper permits or not is something that needs to be investigated. Its not unusual for parents to use private vans to ferry their children, but what they need to understand is that this can be dangerous, as most of these vehicles ply without proper permission, said additional police commissioner (west) Archana Tyagi.        
	Millat officials present at the hospital said the school had 15 buses that picked up and dropped children from different parts of Mumbai.        
	Outside the casualty ward, parents stood frozen in grief. My child has nothing left below the waist. What will I do without him? mumbled Shakeels mother Sakeena Parveen, her eyes moist behind the veil that covered her face.        
	Shakeel is out of danger but would need skin-grafting operations to lead a normal life again.        
	Four dead children  three girls and a boy  have been identified by their parents. One is yet to be identified.        
	Parents and relatives joined their hands in prayer when they heard that seven-year-old Zubair Sheikh had spoken to his father Faryaz. He told me he was thrown to the floor of the vehicle and all he could see were his friends lying around him, said Faryaz.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Saharsa, Sept. 22: On the intervening night of August 18 and 19, Md Nayeem could hardly think that the rising water would wash away his thatched-roof house at Chattapur in Madhepura district.        
	To his horror, Nayeem, 57, only watched helplessly how the hut was washed away by the Kosi river, which had found a new course only hours earlier. Never during his 30-year stay in the block  which incidentally no longer exists after August 18  did the marginal farmer face such disaster after moving from Araria district. Worst was the case when one year crops in my field were damaged by floodwater, but last months destruction was beyond my imagination, said the frail man at a relief camp here.        
	Miraculous was his escape too. He was carried away by the high current that fateful night before he could cling on to a branch of an uprooted tree.         
	I somehow managed to climb on the strong branch which was laying upward the next morning and waiting there for next two days. I did not take the risk to swim across because of the swift current. Finally, I was rescued by a passing army boat. But I lost my sense soon after they pulled me on the boat, he said.        
	Some five to seven people managed to take shelter on the roof of a middle school in the Chattapur village. But apprehending the worst current of floodwater, some of us managed to collect some banana plants, tied it with our dhoti and left the school building. Makeshift banana boat saved our lives but two villagers, Hanif and another unknown, were washed away after they slipped from the boat, Bibhakar, a flood victim, said.        
	Lalit Mishra and Gopal Mishra of Debhaya village in Chattapur block along with 10 others, including three women, had to swim across the current with help of an uprooted tree. We tied ourselves with saris of the women with the tree and were in waist-deep water for more than 60 hours. Finally, the army jawans rescued us and sent here, Lalit said.

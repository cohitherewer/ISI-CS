          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Unprotected transformers at Aparnanagar and Chauliaga. Mahanadi Vihar, Jobra, Pilgrim Roa, Naya Bazaar, Bisnabar, Khannagar, Gandarpur, Gamandia, Sikharpur, Bidanasi, Bakhrabad, Kamalpur and Alisha Bazaar are some of the areas where transformers are either left exposed to public or the barbed wire is found missing.

	Cuttack, June 15: Power distribution transformers across Cuttack lack required safety shields despite a high court order making it mandatory some four years ago.         
	The lack of safety measures is causing fresh concerns among public, especially with the onset of monsoon.        
	There are 133 distribution sub-stations across the city, with (approximately) 900km of wires drawn to provide electricity to people and 1,000 transformers under the power distribution system.         
	But most transformers lack even a barbed wire fencing around them.        
	Though there have been sporadic public resentment regarding the lack of safety, Crescent Electrical Supply Company (Cesco) has done little to address the grievances.        
	Orissa High Court last took up the issue when a PIL on it was filed in 2004.         
	City NGO Maitree Sansad had sought judicial intervention for immediate barbed fencing around transformers to prevent cattle and human casualty.         
	The petition blamed Cescos Cuttack division for turning a deaf ear to repeated public representations for proper fencing.        
	Acting on it, the high court in October 2004 had ordered Cesco to ensure barbed wire fencings around all transformers in the silver city within a month of the order.         
	Cesco authorities had since been embroiled in a contempt case. But the situation has changed little since then.        
	Safety becomes all the more important during the rains, as chances of death by electrocution increases in this season, said Ajay Mohanty, the vice-president of the Maitree Sansad.        
	The general manager of Cescos Cuttack division was not available for comments. A subordinate, however, pleaded funds constraint as reason for the bare transformers.        
	Proper barbed wire fencing around transformers entails an expenditure of more than Rs 26 lakh.         
	Required measures are being taken in a phase-wise manner as and when portions of power bill arrears, outstanding against government offices, are being realised, the official said, on condition of anonymity.         
	Cesco authorities had sought the intervention of the high court in the matter of outstanding arrears through an affidavit.         
	What is making our situation even worse is the recurrent theft of barbed wires around the transformers even when the fencing is provided. The oil from the transformers, too, is not spared and is often stolen, rued a Cesco official.

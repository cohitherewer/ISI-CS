          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, April 25: About 300 heavily-armed Maoists attacked the Essar facility in Dantewada district in small hours today and set 53 trucks on fire, besides damaging heavy machines.         
	The rebels raided the iron ore plant of Essar near Kirandul in Dantewada district, about 350km from here, past midnight after cordoning off the area, said Bastar inspector-general of police R.K. Vij. The rebels took Essar employees hostage at gunpoint and took away their phones and disconnected all communication. Later, they took out diesel from the trucks parked on the premises and set them on fire.         
	According to police sources, rebels set as many as 53 trucks on fire besides damaging three heavy machines.         
	The police received information about the incident in the morning today. A posse of senior officers, including Dantewada superintendent of police Rahul Sharma, rushed to the spot with additional forces.         
	Maoist pamphlets found at the site stated that the attack was designed to protest the transportation of iron ore from the state and depleting local natural resources instead of adding value to it.         
	The rebels have never raised the issue of using minerals within the state earlier.         
	This is the first major attack on the Essar plant that started its operation in the area about four years ago.         
	The company has a major expansion plan in the area and has sealed a pact with the state government to set up a 3.2MTPA steel plant near Dantewada.

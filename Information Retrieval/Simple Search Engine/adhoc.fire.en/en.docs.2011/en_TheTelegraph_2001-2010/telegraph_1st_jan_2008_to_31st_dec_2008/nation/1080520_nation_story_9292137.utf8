          FARHANA KALAM                              
	Gaya, May 19: Gaya superintendent of police Paresh Saxenas move to deny a prisoner the chance to get an MRI test done outside the district and questioning the diagnosis of a Magadh Medical College doctor has led to raised eyebrows among the medical fraternity.        
	Now, the district chapter of the Indian Medical Association is under pressure to confront the superintendent of police, who is also a former medical student with a postgraduate degree in anaesthesia.         
	The medical tussle began when a well connected prisoner of Gaya Central jail complained of back pain and the prison doctor referred him to Magadh Medical College, where doctors diagnosed him suffering from prolapse disc (slipped disc)  a painful condition. The medical college doctor suggested an MRI to confirm the diagnosis.        
	Saxena was subsequently requested to provide police escort to take the prisoner to Patna for the MRI, as the facility is not available in Gaya.        
	But, the Gaya SP, applying his medical background, disagreed with the need to get an MRI done and returned the patient-cum-prisoners medical file with a direction to treat him at the local hospital with help of medicine and physiotherapy instead.        
	According to sources, Saxena suspected a nexus between the doctor and the jail inmate and that the MRI alibi was being used to facilitate an outing for the prisoner.         
	What irked Gaya doctors more was that Saxena pointed out spelling mistakes in the report and encircled mistakes embarrassing the doctor concerned. The issue inevitably was discussed at an IMA meeting recently.         
	Now, IMA secretary D.K. Sahai and members have decided to meet the Magadh range deputy inspector-general of police, Perween Bashist, (Saxenas immediate chief) to register their protest.        
	Faced with the tirade, Saxena does not look ready to give up just yet.         
	Talking to the media the SP stressed that the medical body could not prevent him from using his medical knowledge in discharge of his functions as the Gaya police superintendent.         
	Asked about the effect of physiotherapy on patients with prolapse disc, Saxena replied, such patients need complete bed rest and not a bumpy ride to Patna in a police jeep.        
	The issue has taken an academic and legal turn with the IMA members stressing that Saxena is a police personnel and not a medical professional and that only a medical board, and not Saxena, is in the position to provide medical opinions.        
	Moreover, they add, Saxena did not examine the patient and thus could not have formed a correct opinion. Its also being said that in case of acute prolapse disc cases, physiotherapy may leave a permanently crippling effect.        
	The IMA discussion also took the line that Saxena, being a non-practising doctor, was not favourably placed vis--vis a specialist. In any case, Saxena specialised in anaesthesia and not in orthopaedics, IMA members stress.

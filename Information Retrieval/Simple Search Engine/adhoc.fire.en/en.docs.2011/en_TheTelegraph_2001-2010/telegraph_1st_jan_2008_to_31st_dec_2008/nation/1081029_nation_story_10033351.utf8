	Taste of food fury for jail officials              
	Protests from Kashmir to Kanyakumari are common but Bangalores central prison had a taste of one recently.     
	Inmates unhappy with the food went on a dharna, refusing to eat for two days and forcing a review of the jail menu.    
	Fortunately for them, the protest paid off. Instead of just one dish  rava upma  for breakfast and the monotonous rice, sambar and buttermilk for lunch and dinner, the jail authorities decided to provide them with a different breakfast daily and include vegetable dishes in other meals.    
	The protest was a culmination of several complaints that the food served to them by the Akshay Patra Foundation, a local voluntary organisation, was unpalatable.    
	The foundation has been serving cooked meals to prisoners as part of an experiment to do away with jail kitchens. Under the old system, officials and senior prisoners decided the menu and rations, often leading to corrupt practices.     
	With a wider choice, jail officials now hope to be able to touch the prisoners hearts through their stomachs.        Cash for crumbling roads            
	Money seems to be pouring on Delhi roads giving way to rain.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi recently announced it had set aside Rs 45 crore to repair and resurface stretches of roads that bore the brunt of the monsoon.    
	According to Vijender Gupta, the chairman of the civic bodys standing committee, engineers must certify the drainage system good enough before the repair cash is released.    
	Faulty drainage and choked water channels were blamed for the waterlogging seen over the past two months. Outer Ring Road in Rohini, and Devli Road and Sarai Phoose road in Civil Lines are among the traffic arteries that will be improved with the fresh lot of funds.     
	Link roads, those branching off main thoroughfares, will also be given attention and money, Gupta said.      
	Left high amp; dry on billboards              
	A billboard battle has kept Chennai riveted in recent weeks.    
	At the heart of the row are claims by the Tamil Nadu Outdoor Advertising Association saying many authorised hoardings put up by member-companies had been yanked off under a drive against unauthorised billboards.    
	Association secretary A.G. Nayakam said 1,600 such ads were dismantled under the guise of removing the Supreme Court-ordered 4,000 unauthorised hoardings in April.    
	The government neither issued a prior notice nor allowed us to remove the hoardings on our own.     
	He claimed hoarding materials, including thousands of vinyl sheets and iron structures, worth Rs 18 crore had not been returned by the officials of the demolition squad.    
	The association had paid the lease rent and advertisement tax, which was valid till June 30 this year, after which renewal requests had been made to the authorities.    
	Nayakam argued that the apex court hadnt banned ads, only obstructive hoardings, and sought a renewal of licences given that a lakh people lived off the business.   
	 (UNI)    Honour call            
	Away from the gaze of the Teachers Day events in upscale schools, those in MCD-run institutions were feted for their contributions to shaping the countrys future.    
	The roll of honour included 100 teachers in the civic bodys schools. Mayor Aarti Mehra presided over the ceremony. Those awarded had been chosen from a shortlist of 18,000.    
	They were given a cash prize of Rs 5,000, a certificate and a memento. The list of the awardees included 71 women. (PTI)

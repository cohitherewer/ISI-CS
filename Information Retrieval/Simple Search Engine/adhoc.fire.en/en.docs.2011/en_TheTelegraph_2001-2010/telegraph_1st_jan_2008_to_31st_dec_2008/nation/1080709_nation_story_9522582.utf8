	New Delhi, July 8: The Supreme Court today asked the HRD ministry, the University Grants Commission and Jawaharlal Nehru University to explain quotas for OBC lecturers and SC/ST associate professors and professors.        
	They have to respond within two weeks, explaining why a stay should not be clamped on two UGC guidelines and the JNUs resolution to implement them for the time being.         
	The directive came on a petition by the Citizens for Equality, which said taking reservations to the levels of associate professor and professors would compromise excellence in education.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, March 29: A wealthy businessman shot his paralysed 18-year-old daughter dead this morning before turning the gun on himself.        
	Police said Karamjit Singh, 50, may have been reduced to despair about Poonams condition after elder daughter Alpana, who looked after her, eloped this month.         
	Karamjit died on the spot and Poonam on the way to hospital.         
	We heard two pistol shots less than half a minute apart, and then heard cries of help from Poonams mother who had rushed outside, a neighbour at Sector 23 said. We found both father and daughter bleeding profusely. The floor was blood-splattered.        
	Poonam had become paralysed two-and-a-half years ago and Alpana, 23, cared for her till she ran away to marry a boy from another caste. Neighbours said her act may have left Karamjit, owner of one of Chandigrahs most popular meat-product outlets, Kasauli Broilers, deeply frustrated.        
	Karamjit was a fine person who had no enmity with anyone. He made a lot of friends while jogging in the morning, but never said he was unhappy with his daughters, a neighbour said.         
	We will question the family soon, a police officer said. Karamjits wife was too shocked to speak coherently today.        
	Karamjits business was doing well and there seems to have been no motive other than a feeling of helplessness that he could do nothing for Poonam  a feeling strengthened by his elder daughters elopement, the officer said.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The Congress is planning to make a fresh beginning in Gujarat with a brainstorming session near the temples of Somnath or Dwarka.        
	A brainchild of AICC co-ordinator for Gujarat Rajiv Shukla, the conclave is likely to be held later this month or in early-June. Apart from party leaders from Gujarat, all AICC functionaries and Congress Working Committee members, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, will be invited.        
	During a recent visit to Ahmedabad, Shukla had reportedly urged the Gujarat Congress to go on the offensive. The state unit has been keeping a low profile since its crushing defeat in the November 2007 Assembly polls when it won 51 out of 182 seats.         
	Shukla is said to be of the view that a proximity to temples would help the party discover its roots and, perhaps, make a dent in chief minister Narendra Modis stronghold at a later stage.        
	BJP leader Sushma Swaraj scoffed at the brainwave. Merely holding a session near temples does not mean that their stand will change, she said.         
	Gujarat Congress sources said the idea has found favour with local Muslim leaders. They have extended their support and told us that they were against Modi but not against the majority community. In fact, they are prepared to walk the extra mile to drive away Modi during the 2009 general elections, a party leader said.         
	The Congress has held similar meets in the past. In 1974, Indira Gandhi had convened the Narora conclave in Uttar Pradesh against the backdrop of a near-rebellion by a ginger group.         
	Soon after taking over the Congress reins in 1998, Sonia followed in her mother-in-laws footsteps at the Satpura hill resort, Pachmarhi, in Madhya Pradesh in September that year.         
	The Pachmarhi meet succeeded in ironing out ideological and organisational inconsistencies and evolved guidelines for the Congresss political advancement in the short, medium and long terms. The party also signalled its willingness to get into electoral alliances with like-minded parties to keep communal forces at bay.        
	The Pachmarhi declaration and Sonias valedictory speech voiced the official view  that coalition politics was a necessity. Coalitions will be considered whenever necessary and on the basis of agreed programmes that will not weaken the party or compromise its ideology, the declaration had said.        
	Party leaders in Gujarat are now keeping their ears open for the message that will emerge from the holy sites.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 28: Rajesh Talwars family today filed a contempt petition against Noida police after a sleepless night looking for the high-profile dentist, arrested on the suspicion of murdering his teenage daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj.        
	A Noida court had yesterday sent Talwar to three days police remand but had allowed a lawyer to be present at an appropriate distance during interrogation after the defence voiced fears that he could be tortured in custody.        
	But till early on Wednesday, Talwars lawyers waited outside Noidas Sector 20 police station where the dentist was to be brought from Dasana jail where he had been lodged since his arrest on May 23.        
	Dr Talwar was taken out from Dasana jail at 5pm but we have no idea where he was taken from there. This is a blatant case of contempt of court, lawyer M.P. Singh said, adding that no police officer involved in the case was taking their calls.        
	The family moved the court of chief judicial magistrate A.K. Singh around noon today, alleging that his lawyers were not informed about his whereabouts and that Talwar had been taken to an undisclosed location in violation of the courts order.        
	The court will take up the petition on May 30.        
	Uttar Pradesh police today replaced investigating officer Anil Samania with Jagvir Malik, making it the third time that an IO in the case had been changed. Data Ram Nanoria and Gajendra Singh were the first two investigating officers.

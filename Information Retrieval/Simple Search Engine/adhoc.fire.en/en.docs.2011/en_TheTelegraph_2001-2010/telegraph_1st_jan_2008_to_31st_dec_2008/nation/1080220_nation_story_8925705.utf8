The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	BPOs are old hat, all eyes on LPOs    
	After BPOs, the new buzzword is LPOs  legal process outsourcing.    
	Career Launcher, which offers coaching on MBA entrance exams, is now launching an LPO programme. Such companies, as distinct from BPOs, are not call centres  a misconception that the institute believes many hold, and one that they hope to dispel through the programme.     
	The intention is to bring to light the fact that working with an LPO requires the best legal talent, an official said.     
	Students need to be educated on where the LPO industry is headed, the kind of talent it seeks and how it could be more lucrative than a career in courts or in law firms, the official said.    
	In recognition of the growing demand for LPOs, the National Knowledge Commission has asked the government to liberalise courses in top law universities. The commission has found that India has more lawyers than needed  in contrast to the West, where they arent enough. This situation, the commission feels, can be used to turn India into a potential global legal hub.        
	Naidu, the fitness freak    
	Chandrababu Naidu played a lifestyle guru to many at a celebrity-studded launch programme.    
	The Telugu Desam chief held forth on the virtues of meditation, yoga and exercise to meet the challenges of modern life.     
	The occasion was the opening of a fitness boutique by wellness queen Dinaz last week. Naidu reminded the audience how he made time for meditation and exercise despite his busy schedule, suggesting the others could follow his example.    
	The secret of my success in speaking for hours and presenting issues with clarity is the ability to concentrate and keep a healthy attitude, he said.     
	Pullela Gopichand and V.V.S. Lakshman, known for their physical prowess, were also there to share thoughts on fitness. But after Naidus comprehensive briefing, they had precious little to add.    
	Fight against college hoax    
	Move over sleek mobiles and slim iPods, Mumbai colleges are hooked to a new fad  caller IDs and closed-circuit TVs.    
	Hi-tech security devices became a rage after a spate of recent hoax calls and bomb scares.     
	We will be installing caller identification devices soon, said Frazer Mascarenhas, the principal of St Xaviers College, which fought a bomb hoax last week.    
	Other colleges were quick to follow. V.J. Sirwaiya, principal of Chowpattys Wilson College, said it was important to have good security measures. We plan to get caller ID phones. We already have four CCTV cameras.    
	Some are already in battle mode. Narsee Monjee College and the adjoining Mithibai College in suburban Vile Parle installed caller ID phones after two hoax calls.    
	Bhargav Patel of the Shri Vile Parle Kelvani Mandal Trust, which runs Narsee Monjee, Mithibhai and a host of other professional institutes in the city, said moving CCTV cameras were being put in place.         
	Tech schools    
	Those aspiring for an engineering course in the capital have a reason to smile.    
	The Delhi government last week said it would upgrade polytechnics to the level of engineering colleges. The move aims to expand the avenues of technical education and effectively raise the number of seats.    
	Delhi has many technical education institutions. They will soon be put through a national and international-level certification, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said. The makeover plan will make Delhi a model for other states.    
	Delhi: This Wednesday, Hungarys Custos Consort presents European Baroque and Renaissance music at the India International Centre at 6.30pm. Sndor Szszvrosi is on the cello, Piroska Vitrius on the baroque violin, Gbor Tokodi on the flute and Judit Andrejszki is the vocalist.

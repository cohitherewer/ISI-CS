The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar deaf to PM warning
                                                                                                               Pawar deaf to PM warning
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, April 2: Manmohan Singh had been warning Sharad Pawar for the past three years of a food crunch staring the country in the face as well as the threat of hoarding and price spikes, according to a source close to the Prime Minister.        
	The food and agriculture minister did little, the source said, except to score points over certain Congress ministers who tried to corner him whenever food prices cropped up in cabinet meetings.        
	Congress sources rued that the Prime Minister could do nothing about an ally he depended on for his government in Delhi and his partys in Mumbai. Pawar is from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).        
	As Pawar was quoted as saying that the dietary switchover from rice to rotis in the south was responsible for excessive wheat consumption and for his ministrys supply-demand projections going awry, Congress sources speculated over the fate of their party in the next elections if such explanations were trotted out.        
	It dawned on the Congress that because it was at the core of the UPA coalition, Sonia Gandhi and Singh would face the music for the price mess on the food front rather than Pawar.         
	He just has his turf in Maharashtra to mind. He has his caste equations in place, so he is not that poorly off. We have the entire country to answer to, a general secretary said.         
	His fear was the negatives of the issue may play themselves out in the first battleground Karnataka, which goes to polls in May.        
	Sources revisited the winter of 1998 when the BJP-led government grappled with the same problem. Only it was worse.         
	Inflation went up to 8.5 per cent as against 6.68 per cent now, the wholesale price index for food products was up at 18.2 per cent as against a 1.7 per cent increase in November 1997, onions sold for seven times more than the price a year ago, while wheat and rice prices shot up by 12.3 per cent and 7.2 per cent.        
	The BJP had elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi and lost all of them. The then Rajasthan chief minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, and then Union agriculture minister Sompal Singh Shastri exacerbated matters by saying if people couldnt buy onions, they should eat apples and tomatoes.         
	By the time, the Lok Sabha elections came in September 1999, the government had managed to push down inflation to 4 per cent or so by banning onion exports, releasing it through state-owned outlets and getting traders  the BJPs core constituency  to help out.        
	But the Kargil war was the biggest bonus for the BJP. The partys campaign sought to project it as the only upholder of patriotism and the Opposition as unpatriotic for asking questions about the way the government handled the war. The Congress was on the run as the BJP rode back to power, inflation a distant memory.        
	Our problem is we cannot create a campaign on communal or jingoistic lines because it goes against our grain, a Congress functionary said.         
	For instance, the effort of the votaries of the Indo-US nuclear deal to turn the treaty into a test of nationalism ran aground. The Left and the Samajwadi Party played up the USs role and the suggestion that it may compromise Indias sovereignty rattled Congress traditionalists nurtured on the non-aligned ideology.        
	As of now, the Congresss only counter to the BJP and the Lefts price rise chorus is the unprecedented amount the UPA has spent on the social sector and the aam aadmi schemes. But it still has to weave the claim into a campaign.

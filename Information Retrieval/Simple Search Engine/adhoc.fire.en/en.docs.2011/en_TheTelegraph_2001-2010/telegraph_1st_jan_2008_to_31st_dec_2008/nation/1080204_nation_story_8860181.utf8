	New Delhi, Feb. 3: India and Pakistan are for the first time to sign an agreement between defence studies think tanks of the two countries tomorrow, signposting a new confidence building measure that was first proposed by New Delhi over three years back.
    
	The directors-general of Indias Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, N.S. Sisodia, and Islamabads Institute of Strategic Studies, Shireen Mazari, are expected to meet here for the bilateral institutional co-operation agreement. The proposal for such an arrangement was among 72 suggestions for links that the ministry for external affairs had given to Pakistan. 
    
	This agreement is one of the first. The ministry of external affairs and the ministry of defence are working on more such measures, a senior defence ministry official said. The IDSA is the think tank of the ministry of defence and is chaired by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee. 
    
	Last year, for the first time, a Pakistan Air Force official was hosted by the Indian Air Force at a seminar on flight safety. 
    
	Faculties from the two institutes will discuss the exchanges that can flow out of the agreement. The IDSA is likely to propose collaborative research on co-operative security in South Asia, making the peace process irreversible and an analysis of military expenditures in India and Pakistan.
    
	The proposal for the agreement was first made by India in September 2004. The two institutes will host each others scholars and jointly conduct seminars after the MoU. A ceasefire on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and the Actual Ground Position Line in Siachen has been holding true for nearly five years now.
    
	World War II search
    
	Indian and US soldiers will begin joint expeditions to trace the aircraft that went missing over Indias Northeast during the World War II.
    
	About 430 American soldiers are estimated to have gone missing in action in Indias Northeast during the war. The India-US defence policy group, the highest body that charts the course of India-US military relations, took this decision at a meeting in Washington.

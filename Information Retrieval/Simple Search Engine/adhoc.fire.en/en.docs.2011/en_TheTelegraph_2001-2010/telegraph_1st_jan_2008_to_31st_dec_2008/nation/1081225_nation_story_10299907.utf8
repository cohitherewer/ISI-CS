          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          The Gateway of India                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 24: New Year revelry in the city that never sleeps will end within half an hour after 2009 dawns.        
	Police in the terror-ravaged metropolis said celebrations on the famed waterfronts would have to be over by 12.30am.        
	Senior officials said the 35,000-strong Mumbai constabulary would be deployed in full force at public hangouts and there would be restrictions on movement of people after the cut-off hour.        
	It means the thousands who start gathering from evening every year on December 31 at the Gateway of India, Marine Drive and Bandra bandstand to welcome the new year with crackers and tipsy camaraderie will have to thin out fast.        
	A ring of securitymen will guard the Gateway of India arch and its surroundings opposite the Taj hotel  whose Tower wing reopened on Sunday along with the Trident. Armed personnel on watchtowers and in bunkers will monitor and control revellers.        
	We cannot tell citizens not to celebrate. Despite restrictions, we expect some revellers to assemble there, and we will make the necessary arrangements to create confidence among the public, said joint commissioner (law and order) K.L. Prasad.        
	Policemen in civvies will patrol popular haunts to keep watch on potential mischief-makers.         
	Restrictions will also be imposed on the jetty at the Gateway. The police have already banned cruises and boat parties off the Gateway coast, hitting hard the brisk business done by ferry-owners.         
	As many as 98 boats are registered under the Boat Owners Association, which operates ferry services to the Elephanta Caves, Rewas and Mandwa on the Alibaug coast. October to December is the peak season. We charge around Rs 10,000-Rs 25,000 per night depending on the size of the vessel. The ban has brought down business by nearly 90 per cent, an office-bearer of the association said.        
	Christmas will also be low key with Mumbais substantial Christian community deciding to skip ostentatious celebrations  not just because of last months terror attack but also because of the continuing violence against the community in Kandhamal, Orissa, and the economic downturn.         
	The terror attacks and the economic meltdown are the two reasons why I am not celebrating Christmas this year. I was glued to the TV on 26/11 and watched humanity being attacked. Though I will go to church, I will not do all that I do every year, said Shery John, who heads the marketing team of the Malayalam Manorama group and lives in Santa Cruz.        
	Parishes as well as Christian organisations across the city plan to hold special prayers for the terror victims and express solidarity with the people of Kandhamal.        
	Members of St Ignatius Church in central Mumbai have collected donations for the policemen killed in the terror attack. So far we have collected Rs 35,000, said Father Joe DSouza.

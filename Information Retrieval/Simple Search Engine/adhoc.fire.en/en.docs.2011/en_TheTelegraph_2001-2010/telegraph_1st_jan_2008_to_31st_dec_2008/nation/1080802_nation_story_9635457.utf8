          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	Colombo, Aug. 1: India would like to improve on the proposal the US moved before the Nuclear Suppliers Group today, senior officials said as a delighted Manmohan Singh welcomed the IAEA boards approval to the safeguards agreement in Vienna.        
	Officials accompanying the Prime Minister to Colombo implied the US draft contained some conditions, but asserted that India wanted it modified to get a clean and unconditional waiver from the NSG.        
	We want a clean exemption. If any NSG country has an issue with the US on any terms, we can discuss that with that particular country, an official said, making it clear Delhi was in no mood to accept any conditions.        
	I can only say that we will give it our best effort. We are expecting a clean and unconditional exemption. I would not like to get into what constitutes a clean waiver, foreign secretary S.S. Menon said.        
	The reaction from the NSG, which has called a meeting on August 21-22 to consider the proposal, has so far been positive, the officials added.        
	They said the first week of August was likely to see some developments on the US proposal. National security adviser M.K. Narayanan is expected to talk to two key NSG countries, Russia and France, soon.        
	India will wait for the 123 Agreement with the US to come through before approaching any other NSG country for nuclear trade, an official said. Technically, we can (approach other countries). But we want the agreement with the country that has helped us.        
	The Prime Minister thanked the US as he said: This is an important day for India and for our nuclear initiative for the resumption of Indias co-operation with our friends abroad.        
	He said he was grateful to the members of the IAEA board of governors, our partners and friends abroad, and in particular to the USA, for making this important step in IAEA possible.        
	Singhs statement had a special word for IAEA chief Mohammad ElBaradei, who it said had played a significant role.

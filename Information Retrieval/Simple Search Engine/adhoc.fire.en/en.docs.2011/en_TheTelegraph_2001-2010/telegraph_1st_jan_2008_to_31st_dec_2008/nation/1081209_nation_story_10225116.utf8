          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Santiniketan, Dec. 8: The CBI team looking for Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medallion has stumbled on two suitcases of the poet in a store room the agency had earlier found empty.        
	The suitcases, believed to have been used by Tagore during a trip to Rome, were in the storeroom of the Udayan building in the Uttarayan complex.        
	Both suitcases were marked Grand Hotel, Rome. One is made of leather, the other wood.         
	Two torn pillows, a dilapidated weaving machine and a piece of cloth were also found in the room.        
	The Uttarayan complex is under the administrative control of the director of Rabindra Bhavan, from where the medallion was stolen.         
	CBI investigating officer Partha Sarathi Bose today said the last time the sleuths had checked the room, it was empty. There was nothing in the room during our earlier investigation. Not only us, but the CID or the local police also did not find anything there, said Bose.        
	CBI sources said the keys to the room were handed over to the Rabindra Bhavan authorities.        
	The special officer of Rabindra Bhavan, Nilanjan Bandyopadhyay, said it was not known how the suitcases and the other things came to be in that room.         
	He was also unable to say where the suitcases were earlier.         
	The director of Rabindra Bhavan, Swapan Majumdar, refused to comment.        
	We are carrying our probe. We also interrogated seven Rabindra Bhavan staff today, said CBI investigator Bose.        
	The CBI that had closed the case last year had approached the Bolpur court in September this year with the plea to reopen the case.

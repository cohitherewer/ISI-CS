             Singh: Confident
                 
	New Delhi, March 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is putting the finishing touches to a Parliament speech that is expected to form the basis of the Congresss next election manifesto.
    
	Although not known to be a fiery orator, Singh, sources said, was brimming with confidence ahead of the speech on Wednesday.
    
	For one, the sources said, Singh knew that his party was on board the nuclear deal. Plus, it was euphoric about the 2008 budget, ready to take a hardline stand against the Left and was not as shaky about early elections as it was last August when he dared the Left to withdraw support.
    
	Singhs reply to the motion of thanks on the Presidents address to both Houses is expected to catalogue the high points of his tenure, not as bullet points on sheaves of paper but as talking points for the Congress.
    
	A source said that while the Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for farmers was expected to be the centrepiece of Singhs speech, he would dwell at length on one of his prime concerns: lack of political consensus on issues like economic reforms and foreign policy.
    
	His line, the sources said, would be: in an age in which coalition politics couldnt be wished away, the need for continuity on fundamental policies was all the more important. And while he wouldnt name parties, Singh clearly has the Left and the BJP in mind.
    
	He is also expected to speak on Pakistan for the first time since the neighbour went to polls.
    
	The reason Singh is investing his time and energy on this speech  he has been working on it since Sunday  is because it may be his last reply to a motion of thanks before the next elections.
    
	Congress sources sounded certain that this would be the UPA governments last budget during the term of the current House. Even if the coalition lasted its full term until March-April 2008, it will have to take a vote-on-account because the Election Commission is expected to set the ball rolling in February.
    
	The Congress seems to have mentally prepared itself for early elections. Though Singh was inclined towards early polls last year, neither the allies nor the Congresss own MPs wanted one. Sonia Gandhi, too, was not prepared to snap ties with the Left.
    
	But a debate has started on why the Congress should continue tolerating the Left.
    
	Top Congress leaders have reminded their friends in the Left that if they want a long-term relationship, they should support them in the coming elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi, instead of playing footsie with the third front.

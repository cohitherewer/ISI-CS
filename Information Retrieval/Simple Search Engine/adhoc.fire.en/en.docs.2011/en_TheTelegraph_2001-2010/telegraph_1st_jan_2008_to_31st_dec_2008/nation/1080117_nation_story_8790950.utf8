     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Protests by hundreds of Bhubaneswar lawyers continued for the second day today after police failed to arrest the people involved in the alleged rape attempt made on a young lawyer late Monday night.
    
	For the second day today, city lawyers continued their demand for immediate action, while many set tyres on fire and blocked roads to make their demands heard.
    
	On Monday night, a 25-year-old lawyer from Balipatna, who was handling a rape case, was manhandled by unidentified people on her way home. The woman bit one of her attackers and managed to set herself free and fled from the spot. She fainted in front of her house.
    
	Yesterday, lawyers went on a rampage damaging vehicles and torching traffic towers at Kalpana Square. They ended Mondays stir with a demand note to the additional commissioner of police, Y.B. Khurania, seeking the arrest of the guilty and the suspension of Balipatna officer in charge Alok Kumar Jena before 10am, Wednesday. Otherwise, they threatened, agitation would intensify. Despite our demands, police have failed to arrest the accused, said Bapi Maharana, a lawyer. 
    
	Today vehicular movement on the national highway from Kalpana Square to Rabi Talkies Square was badly affected leading to total chaos. The deputy commissioner of police, assistant commissioner of police, five inspector in charges of different police stations and five platoons of OSAP forces could not contain the chaos.
    
	Meanwhile, the police have constituted four teams to get an early result in the case. A pair of shoes belonging to a man and a shoe belonging to a woman, a towel, a dupatta and a ladies-purse has been recovered from the spot.
    
	The victims medical tests have also been completed and Mahila police have registered a case under Sections 376, 354 and 506 of IPC. 
    
	Fourteen people have been detained so far for the case and interrogation is on, assured Khurania.

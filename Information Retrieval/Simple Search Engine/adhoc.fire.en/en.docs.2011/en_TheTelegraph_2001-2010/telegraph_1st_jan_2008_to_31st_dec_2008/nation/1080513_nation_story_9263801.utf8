The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panchvi punch from Big B
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Panchvi punch from Big B
                                Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh                    
	Mumbai, May 12: If you know the answer to this one, write to Amitabh Bachchan: why has Shah Rukh Khans Panchvi Pass turned into panchvi fail?        
	However, even a fifth-grader would know that the question, posted on the actors blog site, is actually an answer  to a rival who seems to chase Bachchan everywhere, competing with him by acting in a remade Don and anchoring Kaun Banega Crorepati III.        
	Bachchan writes on his blog hed like to know the reasons for the falling TRP ratings of game shows like Panchvi Pass, and would welcome the views of fellow bloggers.        
	SRK has himself acknowledged that his latest TV quiz show isnt doing well. Asked if he was the reason his IPL team, the Kolkata Knight Riders, was so popular, the star had replied if that were true, why would Panchvi Pass be doing so badly?        
	Bachchan has the same question. Why is there a depleted performance despite the presence of the biggest name in the business?        
	The man who made TV game shows the rage in India with KBC I and II goes on to say: KBC 1 ran non-stop for almost two years and then, with an adequate break, the 2 and the 3. I am unable to understand its (Panchvis) falling interest, as the graphs show, despite the fact that they were presented by bigger and more popular stars, namely Shah Rukh.        
	Bachchan explains that his motive in raising the question is a little selfish.        
	I am meeting several TV channel executives, keen for me to do something on TV again. Not knowing the prevalent hits and misses or the reason for their success andfailure, I am at a loss as to which one to consider.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lawyers protest fee hike
                                                                                                               Lawyers protest fee hike
                            
	Patna, Feb. 27 (PTI): Lawyers of Patna High Court would go on a two-day strike from tomorrow to protest against the steep hike in court as per the Bihar governments directive.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the three lawyers associations presided over by Yogesh Chandra Verma.         
	All high court lawyers will abstain from work on February 28 and 29 to demand rescinding of the government order effecting a steep hike in court fees, as it would make the justice system expensive and out of the reach of the common man, Verma said. The hike is arbitrary, he added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bad company                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: Orissa police on Wednesday detained and interrogated an American national for seven hours after he was found travelling with a person believed to be a Naxalite leader.         
	The suspected rebel, Pratima Das, was arrested by Jajpur police after being identified as a hardcore leader and an in-charge of Naxalite activities in parts of Cuttack and Jagatsinghpur.         
	David Pew, the US citizen, who claimed that he was unaware of Pratimas identity, clarified that he was a research scholar.        
	I came to Orissa to investigate social conditions and anti-displacement issues in the state. I went to meet people in Posco and Kalinganagar. I talked to farmers there and also attended tribunals. She helped me to identify the people, he said.        
	Meanwhile, 28-year-old Pratima refuted allegations that she was a Naxalite leader.         
	She has claimed that she is a lawyer. But she accepted the fact that she was a Naxalite sympathiser and had attended gatherings and sabhas held by the rebels and has even spoken and sang in some of them, said a police source.        
	David was accompanied by Pratima when he travelled to Posco, Kalinganagar and other Naxalite-hit areas.         
	Jajpur superintendent of police D.S. Kuttey interrogated the duo.         
	Interrogation is on and we are trying to find out how David came across Pratima in the first place and how did he get to meet a hardcore Naxalite like her? he said.

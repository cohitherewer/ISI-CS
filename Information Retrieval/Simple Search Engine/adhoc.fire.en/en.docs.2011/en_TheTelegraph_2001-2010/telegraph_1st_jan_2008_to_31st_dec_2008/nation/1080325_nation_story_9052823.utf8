  - Govt firm on private   international university        OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Orissa Assembly                                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 24: The controversy over the proposed international Vedanta University to be set up along Puri-Konark marine drive by Anil Agarwal Foundation today rocked the Assembly.        
	Opposition MLAs lambasted the state government for sacrificing Orissas interest to favour a private firm. Angry Opposition members also stormed the well, demanding that the MoU, signed between Vedanta Foundation (later renamed Anil Agarwal Foundation) and the government on July 19, 2006, be scrapped.         
	Finally, a combined Opposition staged a walkout led by the Leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, as the government refused to scrap the deal at the end of a marathon four-hour-long debate.        
	Two senior cabinet ministers  higher education minister Samir Dey and revenue minister Manmohan Samal  were grilled by the Opposition during the debate.         
	Those against the motion pointed out at the frequent changes in the nomenclature of the promoter, Vedanta Resources Plc.         
	Narasingha Mishra and other Opposition leaders accused the state of signing the deal with one party (Vedanta Foundation) and acquiring land for another (Anil Agarwal Foundation).         
	Mishra, a former law minister, accused the government of acquiring land for a private limited company, in violation of provisions of the Orissa Land Acquisition Act.         
	Referring to a provision in the MoU that grants the university immunity from the state law, the Opposition members said the Assembly cannot be a party to anti-state and one-sided deal. The Opposition members also sought a CBI probe into the deal.         
	Ruling BJD-BJP legislators, on the other hand, hit out at the Opposition alleging that it was the previous Congress government, headed by J.B. Patnaik, which invited Vedanta Resources Plc to set up an alumina project in Orissa. Defending the deal, higher education minister Samir Dey said the proposed project would be a world-class university.         
	The foundation has agree to pay adequate compensation (Rs 1 lakh per acre) and provide rehabilitation benefits to the land-losers, including a job to a degree-holder from each family, said Dey.         
	Revenue minister Manmohan Samal, whose department is responsible for the land acquisition, said there was no flaw in the acquisition as the foundation was later converted into Anil Agarwal Foundation and registered as a public limited company. .

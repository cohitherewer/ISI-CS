	Cuttack, Nov. 16: The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Birthplace Museum exhibits have for the first time moved out of the galleries with a display of rare photographs on the life of the legendary freedom fighter in this years Baliyatra on the banks of the Mahanadi.         
	Museum director Chandrabhanu Patel said: At least 60 meticulously preserved photographs are on display at a special pavilion on the Baliyatra ground.         
	Such publicity would continue during Baliyatra ending November 20. We will make all efforts for the publicity of the Netaji Birthplace Museum at Oriya Bazaar as well.         
	With three years passing after the museum got a facelift, it had not seen increase in the footfall. The museum was equipped with a state-of-the-art lighting and innovative display system along with an interpretation centre to attract more visitors, but of no avail.         
	The photographs on display at Baliyatra are snippets of Netajis early, student and political life, which include his INA days also.         
	The special pavilion is also screening museum-produced documentary films on the life of the leader. The museum officials are expecting a huge turnout this Baliyatra.         
	Lakhs of people will watch the documentary promotions, Patel said.         
	Future publicity plans for displaying exhibits in special pavilions outside the museum at events such as the Puri beach festival, Konark dance festival and major fairs across the state are already under active consideration, he added.         
	At the Baliyatra pavilion, the museum authorities have also put laminated photographs, booklets, literature, picture postcards, books and souvenirs on sale. About 3 lakh people would throng the banks of Mahanadi during the Baliyatra, the second largest gathering in Orissa after the Rathyatra.

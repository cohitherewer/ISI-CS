	Red carpet for green models    
	Delhi has rolled out the red carpet for the green cars.    
	The government recently said it would offer incentives to carmakers rolling out hybrid vehicles like Revai, launched recently by chief minister Sheila Dikshit.    
	Let them (carmakers) come, we will definitely see and consider giving incentives, Dikshit said after the launch. The Revai has been given a series of tax and other rebates.    
	Dikshit said she would be happy to encourage such environment-friendly vehicles but left it to the firms to first design such cars and seek sops from the government.    
	Dikshit described the Revai launch as a green letter day for the government and hailed it as the car of the future. I would appeal to those car owners in Delhi with several vehicles at home to have at least one Revai.    
	Honda Siel has also unveiled the hybrid version of its Civic sedan but, at Rs 21.5 lakh, it costs almost double the petrol version. Others, like the Mahindras and Toyota, have also been working on fuel-efficient models.        
	More roads amp; rooms ahead    
	A ring road and a housing scheme for the weaker sections promise to change the face of Bangalore in the near future.    
	The Bangalore Development Authority will soon float global tenders to lay the first phase (65km) of a 115km peripheral road to free up clogged streets downtown.    
	Around 1,800 acres have been acquired for the new link, from Tumkur Road to Hosur Road. The first phase will cost around Rs 3,000 crore, including land. The project will be executed on a build-own-transfer basis.    
	The authority also plans 92,000 flats, of 3.25sqm each, for the economically weak and the middle-class at a price of Rs 3 lakh. Around 326 acres has been acquired for the purpose. The developer will be free to sell half the dwellings at its own prices.    
	AIDS threat to cop ranks    
	Mumbai police have a new enemy to battle within HIV/AIDS.    
	The number of personnel testing positive for the disease has increased 4.4 per cent since January this year. According to the statistics furnished by the Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre of the police hospital, the number was only 5.6 per cent for all of 2007. This year, 23 of the 521 personnel tested were positive.    
	Commissioner Hassan Gafoor didnt hide his concern. I havent received the statistics yet but steps need to be taken to ensure the percentage is brought down, he said.    
	He said counselling and awareness sessions would be held for the force to help prevent the incurable disease. What has surprised the top brass is that the number has increased this year after a sharp decline last year.    
	The figure has been falling ever since 2004, when 12.3 per cent of the personnel had tested positive. Maharashtra Districts AIDS Control Society has offered help. If we are approached, we will definitely conduct sessions for the police, project director S.S. Kudalkar said.        
	Cement slur    
	A councillor appears to be having a field day with cement that should have been used for a childrens park.    
	Mayor Aarti Mehra recently recommended a probe by the central vigilance commission into allegations that the councillor had been using the cement, bought for an MCD park, to build his own house.     
	The municipal councillor, Prithvi Pal Singh, from Paschim Vihar in the citys west, denied the charge but the cement bags and the godown that supplied these were sealed.    
	MUMBAI: This Friday, you can watch Begum Jaan, a play based on a legendary classical singer and her narration of Indias changing face from the pre-Independence era to the present day.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 14: The BJP leadership today called for a professional and nationalist approach in dealing with terrorism and raised some issues for national debate before formulating the strategy.         
	The party felt the country should analyse the problems of illegal infiltration, inadequate legislative support, poor intelligence and diplomacy against rogue states.         
	Party president Rajnath Singh offered all possible help to the government in the fight against terror, before his party launched an attack.        
	Terror will be won not by words but by national resolve, political courage and decisive action, the BJP said.        
	This action must be motivated by security concerns and not by vote-bank politics, a statement issued by general secretary Arun Jaitley added.        
	Jaitley said the blasts in Jaipur were a reminder that India is a soft state that can be attacked by terrorists at will.         
	Many recent terrorist attacks have been masterminded by Huji, a Bangladesh-based outfit that is an outsourced organisation of al Qaida and supported by the ISI. Logistical support to these cross-border terrorist groups is provided by local sleeper cells, he said, pointing a finger at illegal infiltration from Bangladesh.         
	We need a strong legal regime to deal with terror. Several states have legislated Pota-type laws to deal with organised crime and terrorism after the repeal of Pota. Maharashtra was the first state to have such a law. Rajasthan and Gujarat have also legislated such laws. However, the central government has not accorded presidential assent to the laws from both these states.        
	Jaitley also stressed the need for diplomacy to coerce and eventually isolate rogue states that allow their territories to be used for building infrastructure for terror.         
	Terrorist groups operating out of Pakistan obviously have India on their radar, and Pakistan must be pressured into eliminating these groups, he said.         
	Jaitley also felt that by deliberately delaying the execution of Afzal Guru, the government was displaying both a weak-kneed policy and one that is linked to vote bank politics.         
	Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, who was in Jaipur, issued a statement saying the fight against terrorism is a national issue, and the role and responsibility of the central government in dealing with this menace is much more than that of any state government.        
	He said the UPA government has a dismal record in discharging this responsibility, and has failed to punish the guilty in numerous terrorist attacks around the country.

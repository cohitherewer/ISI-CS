The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | U-turn Uma jumps into poll fray
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     U-turn Uma jumps into poll fray
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Uma: Quiet shift                                  
	Bhopal, Nov. 7: After the slap, the somersault. Uma Bharti today filed her papers for the Assembly polls, reversing an earlier decision not to contest, at a time her physical attack on a colleague has led to hundreds quitting her party.        
	Uma quietly arrived in home district Tikamgarh, in northern Madhya Pradesh, this morning and performed elaborate rituals at her home. She then headed for the district electoral office to file her papers for the Tikamgarh constituency.        
	The Bhartiya Janshakti Party (BJS) chief had repeatedly said she wouldnt be a candidate. Even two days ago, she said: If I contest, I will not get the time to tour the state and canvass votes for other party candidates.        
	Today, Uma explained she had an intuition that she should contest so that the state did not fall into the hands of corrupt people.        
	Some BJP leaders fear that Umas candidature might impact the entire Bundelkhand region, particularly the 20-odd seats where the votes of Lodhis, her caste, are crucial.        
	The Congress is happy, reckoning Uma would cut into the BJPs vote share.        
	Umas chief opponent will be BJP minister Akhand Pratap Singh Yadav, who was once close to her and recently angered the Sangh parivar by attending an iftaar during Ramazan. The Congresss Yadvendra Singh too is in the fray.        
	Analysts see Umas move as a desperate attempt to project her party as a credible alternative to the BJP and the Congress. In the 48 hours since she slapped party colleague Anil Rai twice in public, more than 1,000 workers and leaders have left the BJS. Uma has apologised but Rai has rejected it and quit the party.        
	Umas associates said she was unhappy with Rai over a poor turnout at a rally in Chhindwara the day before. She had blamed Rai and warned him not to show his face to her, a source said.        
	But Rai reached the circuit house where she was staying and this act of defiance apparently triggered her assault.        
	The stakes are high for Uma in this election since she is seeking to re-establish her leadership in her home state.        
	She had led the BJP to victory in December 2003 but had to quit as chief minister following a warrant from a Karnataka court in August 2004 for inciting violence.        
	After her exit, she got enmeshed in intra-party wrangling and was suspended from the BJP in December 2005. She then floated her own party to teach the BJP a lesson.

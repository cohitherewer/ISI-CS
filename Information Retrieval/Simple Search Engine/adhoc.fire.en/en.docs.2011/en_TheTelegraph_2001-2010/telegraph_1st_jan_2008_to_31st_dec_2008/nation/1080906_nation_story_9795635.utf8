  - Age no excuse, says court        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nanda after the sentence on Friday. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: A court today sentenced Sanjeev Nanda to five years imprisonment, saying he should have known the consequences of drink-driving since he had got his licence in the US.        
	Additional sessions judge Vinod Kumar, however, added that the nine months Nanda, 28, had spent in jail during trial would be snipped from the sentence.         
	The question is whether a man on the road is safe and whether drunken drivers would keep on committing such offences. This accountability to society can only be suitably answered if a substantial jail term is provided to him, the order said.         
	Nanda, the grandson of former navy chief S.M. Nanda, was on Tuesday convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for mowing down six persons while driving his BMW in 1999.         
	The judge rejected Nandas plea to let him off on probation as he was only 19 at the time of the incident and his family had compensated the victims.         
	A person who got a driving licence from the US can be considered to be having a higher degree of knowledge of the consequences of drunken driving. Therefore, on account of his young age, no benefit can be given, he said.        
	Nanda was already exposed to a western culture where drunken driving is taboo and if someone indulges in it, the consequences are very harsh.         
	That Nanda had tried to win over witnesses also merited the high quantum of punishment, the judge said.        
	The court also sentenced businessman Rajeev Gupta, the father of Nandas friend Siddharth, to one years rigorous imprisonment for destroying evidence. He was also slapped a fine of Rs 10,000.         
	Two of Guptas employees, Bhola Nath and Shyam Singh, were sentenced to six months in jail and fined Rs 100 each for washing off bloodstains and removing pieces of flesh from Nandas BMW.        
	All three were immediately granted bail as their sentences did not exceed three years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chapra (Nadia), Nov. 20: A BSF jawan who allegedly shot dead a Class X girl yesterday has been arrested.        
	M. Silva Kumar, who Khukuli Khatun had in her dying statement accused of trying to molest her, was handed over to a team led by Nadia police chief H.K. Kusumakar at the Hatkhola border post where the incident occurred. The girl also said he was drunk.        
	The police chief spoke to Khukulis parents and other family members before taking the jawan into custody. We will produce him in court tomorrow, he said.         
	The BSF, however, said the 17-year-old had been hit by mistake. The force claimed the accidental shooting occurred when jawans were trying to foil a smuggling attempt. Our jawans caught two villagers smuggling fertilisers (to Bangladesh) but others snatched the culprits. One jawan, Ami Singh, was beaten up. Then, M. Silva Kumar, fired a shot but it hit the girl by mistake, said S.S. Chahar, BSF DIG in Krishnagar.         
	At the time of the shooting, Khukulis father, farmer Yunus Mondal, had gone to Hatishala, 15km away, to fix his daughters marriage with a young grocer there. He told the boys family the wedding would be held after my sisters Madhyamik next year, said Kakali, Khukulis elder sister.        
	Rupali Khatun, Khukulis younger sister who is in Class IX at the same school from where her sibling was returning when she was shot, said she and her mother Bilkis Bibi saw yesterdays incident.        
	We saw Khukuli having a heated exchange with a BSF jawan about 100 metres from our home. The jawan started beating up my sister. When we rushed to the post, my sister told me he had misbehaved with her. The jawan then beat us up. When my sister tried to intervene, he shot her. He ordered us to leave and said he would shoot us if we didnt, said Rupali, 15. Another jawan took Kumar away, she said.        
	Khukuli was buried in the village graveyard tonight.

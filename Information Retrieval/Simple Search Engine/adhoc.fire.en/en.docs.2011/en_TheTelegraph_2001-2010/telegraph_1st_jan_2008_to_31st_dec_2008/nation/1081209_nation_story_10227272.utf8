          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Mayavati                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Bahujan Samaj Partys loud pre-poll claims that no state government will be formed without behenji may have been belied, but the BSP has made an impact likely to echo in the general election in a few months.        
	In all four states where the BSP fielded candidates, it has registered a healthy increase in vote share, gaining both at the expense of the Congress and the BJP. Sarvajan hitay sarvajan sukhay (welfare for all, happiness for all)  the slogan that symbolises the BSPs new strategy of adding upper and intermediary castes to its Dalit-Muslim base  may be yielding results for Mayavati beyond Uttar Pradesh.         
	In Madhya Pradesh, the party has done particularly well in the northern belt that runs along the Uttar Pradesh border. The BSP has had a presence in that state since Kanshi Ram began organising government employees in 1984.        
	In 1993, the BSP had won 11 seats in Madhya Pradesh but fell to eight seats in 1998 and further down to a mere two seats in 2003. This time, perhaps powered by the huge victory in Uttar Pradesh and Mayavatis own expanding national profile, there has been an exponential increase in the vote share  more than 10 per cent.        
	And translated into seats, that means seven each in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and two each in Chhattisgarh and Delhi. We had just two seats in Rajasthan, now we have leaped ahead. We have improved in terms of seats and vote share alike, said BSP secretary Ashok Parmar.         
	In Delhi, significantly, the BSPs vote share has shot up from a little over 5 per cent to 14 per cent  again perhaps a result of quiet constituency building through worker networks that are near-invisible. But the party had given intimations of an improved performance in the capital, winning 17 seats in the municipal elections last year.         
	The BSP has stood second in at least four constituencies where the BJP has lost  this runs against conventional wisdom that the BSP is expanding at the expense of the Congress alone.         
	Having thrown her towel in the prime ministerial ring, Mayavati has been working hard these past months on expanding her partys base.         
	This is the success of our worker-base and the way they are directed, said Shahid Siddiqui, who left the Samajwadi Party to join the BSP during the July trust vote. It is not merely enough to say now that the BSP is benefiting from the erosion in the Congress vote or the BJP vote, all the vote that has come to us is the BSP vote, it is a new constituency we are carving out.         
	It is clear Mayavati believes that if she can retain her home base in Uttar Pradesh and pick up a substantial number of seats in neighbouring states  the BSP is counting on creating a presence in states like Maharashtra, too  she will be in a position to have enough bargaining power in the new Lok Sabha.

	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has taken charge of the information and broadcasting ministry as Priya Ranjan Das Munshi continues to be on life support.        
	A Rashtrapati Bhavan communiqu said Das Munshi would remain a minister without portfolio until he is able to resume work.        
	Official sources said Singh was not expected to be pro-active regarding the I amp;B ministry because Anand Sharma, a deputy minister for external affairs, will continue to handle the department.        
	Sharma, however, cannot take policy decisions, the sources added.

	New Delhi, Aug. 27: A Class XI student of DPS RK Puram died today after falling off a bathroom window on the fifth floor of the girls hostel.         
	The schools principal, Shyama Chona, quoted the hostel warden as saying that Pushpanjali Raj, 16, had cut out a hole in the window net and jumped out. But the girls local guardian, Durgesh Pandey, said he suspected foul play.        
	The hostel warden told me that she had met Pushpanjali at 2.30pm when she marked her attendance. She said Pushpanjali had locked the bathroom from inside, cut the net on the window and jumped out. Police are investigating the case. But I must say that when I spoke to her friends, they said she didnt seem depressed, Chona said.        
	A friend of Pushpanjali, however, said she had been tense about the competition she faced in school.        
	Pandey, a friend of Pushpanjalis father, said she was a short girl and it would be difficult for her to cut the net and jump out. It cannot be suicide. She was a happy girl. I suspect foul play, he said.        
	The girls body was discovered around 4pm by some of her hostel mates. The hostel is on the school premises and Pushpanjali used to stay in room number 504.         
	Pushpanjali was rushed to Holy Angels Hospital in south Delhi, where she was declared dead on arrival.         
	Doctors said she had suffered grievous head injuries. Her body has been shifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for post-mortem.        
	Pushpanjalis father, Shiv Narayan Raj, is the managing director of a co-operative society in Jharkhand. The family is from Hazaribagh.         
	Pandey said Pushpanjalis brother, Purushottam, who had visited her only two days ago, would arrive from Hyderabad late tonight while her parents were expected tomorrow.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 10: A deathly silence has replaced the tick-tack of looms in Andhra Pradesh with over 30 weavers in Telengana killing themselves in the past one month, unable to come out of a debt trap similar to the one which has claimed thousands of farmers.        
	Once a beehive of export activity, Siricilla, 140km from Hyderabad, now resembles a ghost town inhabited by starving weavers and their families.         
	Since September, at least 31 weavers have been driven to death faced with the rising cost of yarn, an unsold stock of one crore metres of cloth worth Rs 15 crore and pending wages.         
	Sickness and malnutrition have added to the misery of the weavers living in daily fear of the midnight knocks of moneylenders and bank managers.        
	More than 300 weavers have ended their lives since the Congress government took over four years ago. In the same period, around 5,400 farmers have committed suicide in the state.        
	The government, however, does not admit that the weaver deaths have been caused by debts. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has blamed hooch for the recent suicides, even as two more weavers killed themselves yesterday.        
	It is unfortunate that leaders of the ruling party are unwilling to acknowledge the distress of weavers, said P. Ravi, the district president of Chenetha Karmika Sangham, an association of weavers.        
	The weaving industry in Siricilla, which has around 30,000 hand looms and 10,000 power looms, is in the doldrums because of rise in the cost of raw material such as yarn and the absence of marketing avenues. Lack of timely and subsidised credit has also landed many in a debt trap.        
	Ravi said the price of yarn has gone up by 110 per cent in the last two years.        
	We normally get yarn on credit from master weavers who charge us another 30 per cent, he said.        
	Two types of cloth, known as polyester grey and cotton casement (used to make petticoats and sent to Bengal), are produced in Siricilla. The demand for these cloths has nosedived because of cheaper imports from Bangladesh. This has resulted in a huge unsold stock of cloth.         
	On an average, a weaver earns just Rs 240 for weaving 10 yards of polyester cloth or three saris, which entails three days of work for himself and his family who also work on the loom with him.        
	A parliamentary standing committee on labour led by CPI deputy general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy has urged the state government to purchase the accumulated stock and declare Siricilla a Textile Economic Zone.        
	The suicides began on September 7 with G. Lakshman, 50, of the weavers colony in Siricilla, who hanged himself from a tree near a temple of Sai Baba. Soon after, Pallati Raju, 32, a former loom worker, set himself on fire at his house in Garshakurthi following harassment by money-lenders who wanted him to pay up his debt of Rs 35,000.         
	Early on Wednesday, 65-year-old Rapelli Mallaiah, a handloom weaver, hanged himself from the ceiling. With a debt of close to Rs 1 lakh, he had no means of paying even the interest. Where can I go now? None of my four daughters can take care of me because they are all hard-pressed themselves, wailed his widow Satyavva.

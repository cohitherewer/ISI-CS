	Patna, Sept. 11: Chief minister Nitish Kumar sought an appointment with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek special fund for carrying out reconstruction of large tracts of land and habitation ravaged by the changed course of the Kosi river.        
	The chief minister is likely to get the appointment with the Prime Minister any day after Friday, sources at Nitishs office said, adding: We are working out on the exact amount needed to rebuild north Bihars damaged areas.        
	Even as Nitish said that he was working out on the demand of the package to be placed before Singh, corporate houses have been making generous contributions towards the relief and rehabilitation of the millions of the marooned people.        
	LG Electronics India Limited today donated Rs 1.5 crore in the chief ministers relief fund.         
	Yesterday, Neeta Ambani, wife of Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh Ambani, donated Rs 11 crore to the chief ministers relief fund. Tatas have already sent a team of 100 to carry out relief work in flood-hit areas.        
	The sources said that the government had estimated a loss of property worth Rs 6,000 crore in the wake of the breach in the Kosi.        
	Yesterday, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi failed to make it to a relief camp because of law and order problem that took place after angry relief seekers had launched a retaliatory attack on a Bihar minister, beating the latter and his supporters on the Patarghat-Forbesganj-Sursar highway.        
	Rahul visited five relief camps before the NSG jawans awaiting him at Sursar, one of the biggest relief camps in Araria district, told him not to follow Sursar route because of disturbance after the minister had been thrashed.

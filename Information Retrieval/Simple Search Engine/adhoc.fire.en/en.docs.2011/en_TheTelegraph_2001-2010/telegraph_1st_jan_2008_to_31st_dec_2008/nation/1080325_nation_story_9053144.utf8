	New Delhi, March 24: A Delhi trial court today handed life terms to suspended IPS officer R.K. Sharma and three others in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case.        
	Rejecting the prosecutions demand to send them to the gallows, additional sessions judge Rajendra Kumar said the crime was no doubt abominable and heinous, but it was not of that ilk which could shock the conscience of the society.         
	The 13-page order came six days after the four were convicted for the 1999 murder.        
	The judge has to record the reasons for either accepting or rejecting the prosecutions demand for death sentence. According to the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the maximum punishment is only awarded in the rarest of rare cases involving cruelty or depravity that shocks society.        
	While turning down the prosecution plea, the trial court also took into account Sharmas excellent service record as a police officer and the fact that he had no criminal history.         
	Sharma, hemmed in by police officers, seemed a bit apprehensive as he arrived in the court packed with lawyers and journalists this afternoon. But he looked relieved when the judge announced the sentence.         
	His lawyer later told reporters that he would appeal the conviction and sentence in the high court.         
	All convicts have to be present in court to hear their sentences unless they have been exempt by the court.         
	Sharma was also fined Rs 20,000, while the other convicts will have to pay Rs 10,000 each.         
	The court had last Tuesday convicted Sharma, Shri Bhagwan, Satya Prakash and Pradeep Sharma for hatching a criminal conspiracy to murder Bhatnagar. Pradeep was convicted for actually killing the journalist. Two others have been acquitted.

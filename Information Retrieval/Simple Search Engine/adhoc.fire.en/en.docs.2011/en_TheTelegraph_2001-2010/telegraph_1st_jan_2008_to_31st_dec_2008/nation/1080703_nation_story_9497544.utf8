          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, July 2: The first militant attack in the Amarnath land row left 20 people injured in Jammu, and curfew had to be imposed in some areas following communal tension.        
	On the second day of protests in Jammu against revocation of land transfer to the Amarnath shrine board, suspected militants lobbed a grenade at a Hindu procession in Bhaderwah town, the seat of chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.        
	Bhaderwah was rocked by clashes between the two communities early today after Hindus held a protest against the cabinet decision to revoke the land allotment. The protest caused tension in the town, which has an almost equal population of Hindus and Muslims. The clashes continued for some time, before the grenade was fired.        
	Around 20 people were injured, seven of them critically. Some policemen are also among the injured, said SP Bhaderwah, T.R. Katoch.         
	The injured include local BJP leader D.S. Kotwal, who had contested against Azad in the Assembly bypoll. Curfew was clamped in Bhaderwah.        
	During the nine-day protests in Kashmir, which have left five dead, militants had steered clear of violence.        
	Following todays attack, some other parts of Jammu were also tense and the situation is likely to worsen as the BJP has called a nationwide strike tomorrow. The army had to be called out in the Samba area.         
	We were requested by the civil administration to help them maintain peace in Samba. Troops have conducted a flag march in the area and the situation is now under control, defence spokesperson Lt Colonel S.D. Goswami said.         
	Curfew was also imposed in the Nagrota and Khatua areas of Jammu. At some places, people burnt tyres, threw stones at policemen and blocked the Jammu-Srinagar highway. At Vijaypur, protesters stopped trains. Shops, businesses, banks and government offices were closed.

	Lucknow, April 26: A Samajwadi Party legislators son, driving his mothers red-beacon car drunk, ran over five pavement dwellers last night after ramming into two motorcyclists and a roadside shop.        
	A medical examination later confirmed Kasif Abbas, son of Gazipur MLA Shadab Fatima, was under the influence of alcohol. The 20-year-old, who has been sent to jail custody for a week, does not have a driving licence.        
	Uttar Pradesh DGP Vikram Singh told PTI beer bottles had been recovered from the Tata Safari registered in Fatimas name.        
	The car first rammed into two motorcyclists around 12.30, then ploughed into nine persons sleeping on the pavement after hitting a shop near Lucknows Pariwartan Chowk area.        
	Three died on the spot. The others were taken to Balrampur Hospital, where two died today. The condition of the others is critical. After the first collision, the driver seemed to have lost control of the vehicle and hit my paan shop, said Chand Babu, who is in Balrampur Hospital.        
	Inspector-general (Lucknow zone) A.K. Jain said cases under several sections of the penal code had been registered against Kasif, a BBA student in the Indian Institute of Planning and Management in Delhi.

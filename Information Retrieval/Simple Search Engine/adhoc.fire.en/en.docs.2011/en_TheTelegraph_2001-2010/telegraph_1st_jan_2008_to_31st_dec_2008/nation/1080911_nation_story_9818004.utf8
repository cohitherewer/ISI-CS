          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Education minister Arjun Singhs ill health is stalling efforts to introduce the promised Right to Education Bill in Parliament.         
	The bill seeks to make free schooling a fundamental right for children between 6 and 14 years.         
	A group of ministers (GoM), set up a month ago to iron out last-minute differences between the human resource development ministry Singh heads and the Planning Commission on the proposed law, has not met even once because of the ministers health, The Telegraph has learnt. Singh chairs the GoM.        
	HRD ministry officials are now trying to mould the Planning Commissions opinion through back-channel talks so that the process is expedited when the GoM does meet, a source said.         
	The GoMs recommendations need to be debated by the cabinet before the bill  with any changes the group recommends  is presented before Parliament.         
	The coming Parliament session, scheduled to start on October 17, may be the UPAs last opportunity before the general elections to get the House to pass the education bill promised in the common minimum programme.         
	The HRD ministry has gently requested its own minister to hold a GoM meeting as soon as possible, sources said.         
	But Singh, among the biggest votaries of the proposed law, is not being able to attend any meeting, a source close to him said.         
	The poor health of the GoM chairman is the sole reason why no meeting of the group has been fixed so far. He is still under heavy medication, a senior school education official said.         
	Singh was hospitalised in July with liver and kidney infection triggered by a decline in immunity because of diabetes. He cancelled his presence from programmes to launch six new Indian Institutes of Technology and also skipped government programmes held on Teachers Day  September 5.         
	The GoM has science minister Kapil Sibal, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia as its other members.         
	They can meet even in Singhs absence, but the chairman needs to sanction such a meeting. However, no decision can be finalised by a truncated GoM.         
	The Planning Commission has objected to the ministrys request for Rs 12,000 crore  besides funds for other school schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan  for the implementation of the proposed act, the sources said.         
	The bill seeks to make it mandatory for private unaided schools to reserve 20 per cent of their seats for economically weaker sections. The law ministry had expressed concerns that this clause could attract litigation from private schools.         
	But HRD ministry sources said the bill was modified to put in place grievance redress mechanisms that schools could use if they had objections.

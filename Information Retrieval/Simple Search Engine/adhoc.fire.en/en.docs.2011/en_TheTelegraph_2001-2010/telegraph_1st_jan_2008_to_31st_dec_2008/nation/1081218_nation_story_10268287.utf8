	Dec. 17: The CPM today expressed reservation against some clauses in the new anti-terror bill that proposes to empower a federal agency to take over a probe as long as the crime falls under eight select laws.        
	The party said though the National Investigation Agency Bill allows the Centre to call the shots in any dispute over jurisdiction, states must be consulted on certain offences under two of the laws, specifically the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.        
	We demand that if some incident takes place the state government concerned should be associated by the NIA in the investigation. The association of state agencies with the NIA would ensure a fair probe, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said in Chandigarh.        
	As India was a large country, states had different backgrounds to terror, he said. In the Northeast, the Ulfa is active. In other states, there are other groups about which state agencies would have much better information due to their day-to-day functioning.        
	In New Delhi, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said such association would, for instance, be desirable when the terror act came under IPC Sections 121-130 (waging war against the state) and Sections 489A-489E (currency and bank note counterfeits).        
	We want that state governments must be associated with when the agency is investigating cases related to these offences, he said.        
	So we suggest that in case of two of the laws scheduled be made in the NIA bill the consent of the state government be taken. On the other six the agency can proceed with its business as envisaged in the bill.        
	Yechury, however, clarified that the CPM was not against the bill but was merely suggesting revisions.         
	The CPM also suggested revisions to the second bill  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2008  tabled yesterday, with Karat saying some clauses were not right and need to be changed.        
	We will oppose the proposal to increase the period for denial of bail from 90 to 180 days as the present period should be sufficient to complete investigations.        
	Karat said the party would also oppose the proposal to empower police to detain anyone for refusing to part with information they believed would help investigations.

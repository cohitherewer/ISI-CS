	Vatican City, Oct. 26 (AP): Pope Benedict XVI today decried the killing of Christians in India and Iraq and appealed for political and religious leaders to defend them.        
	The appeal to religious leaders and to all men and women of good will came during an interaction with pilgrims in St Peters Square. I am thinking above all of Iraq and India, Benedict said.        
	Some 13,000 Christians in Iraq fled their homes after attacks, while churches have been damaged and hundreds of Christian homes burnt in India.

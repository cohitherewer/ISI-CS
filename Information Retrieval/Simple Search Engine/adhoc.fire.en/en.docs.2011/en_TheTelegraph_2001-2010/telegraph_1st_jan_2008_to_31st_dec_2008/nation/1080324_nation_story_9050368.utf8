          SANJAY K. JHA                                    
	New Delhi, March 23: The BJP has decided to seek an alliance with Om Prakash Chautala, ignoring stiff resistance from its Haryana unit.        
	If the tie-up happens, the United National Progressive Alliance will further lose relevance, since Chautala would be its second important member to chart an independent course after the ADMKs Jayalalithaa.        
	The BJP had initially not counted the Indian National Lok Dal leader among prospective partners because when Chautala was in the National Democratic Alliance, he had worked systematically to decimate the BJPs Haryana unit. But several factors, especially caste equations, have led the party into a rethink, BJP sources said.        
	The BJP was initially planning to tie up with former chief minister Bhajan Lal, who has floated his own party after quitting the Congress.        
	Bhajan and his son Kuldip Bishnoi, who too has left the Congress, have support across Haryana. The BJP thought an understanding with their nascent outfit would win it greater political space in the state compared with an alliance with any of the established parties.        
	But Bhajan has embarked on an anti-Jat agenda since both his rivals, Chautala and current chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress, are from the community.        
	Bhajan played a key role in the Congress victory in the last Assembly elections and many observers had thought there was a strong case for a non-Jat chief minister. But the Congress chose Hooda in a decision that non-Jats widely viewed as a betrayal.        
	Bhajan is now determined to exploit that sentiment. The BJP, too, is mainly a non-Jat party in Haryana and so Bhajans politics would not have been a problem for it.        
	But the BJP had come to power on Jat support in neighbouring Rajasthan, which goes to the polls later this year. BJP leaders from Rajasthan are alive to the implications of being identified with Bhajans anti-Jat project and have conveyed their feelings to the central leadership.        
	So, the party has suddenly changed tack and decided to explore if Chautala is open to a re-alignment. Although the state BJP is still violently opposed to Chautala  the two sitting MLAs have threatened to quit  the central leadership has decided to put national politics before regional interests.        
	Chautala, too, is in need of support since Bhajans entry has turned Haryana politics into an unpredictable triangular contest.        
	The BSP, too, has entered the fray in a big way and threatens to cut into the anti-incumbency vote. The BJP realises that the presence of so many parties would leave it nowhere if it contests the elections, whether to the Assembly or the Lok Sabha, alone.        
	Haryana has only 10 Lok Sabha seats but every one of them will be precious to the BJP as it looks to make L.K. Advani the next Prime Minister.        
	The Congress holds nine seats, and anti-incumbency can dramatically change the situation if the Opposition plays its cards well. The BJP therefore stands to gain by wooing Chautala, at least in the short term.

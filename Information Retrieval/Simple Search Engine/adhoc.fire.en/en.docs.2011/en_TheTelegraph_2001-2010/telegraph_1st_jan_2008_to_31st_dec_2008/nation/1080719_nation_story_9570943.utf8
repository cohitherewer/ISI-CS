          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          NO time for school or PLAY                                   
	New Delhi, July 18: Indias apex child rights panel has asked states and export promotion councils to do a social audit of industries plagued by child labour in a novel bid to check the offence.        
	It has recommended that Indian exporters use self-regulatory mechanisms employed by leading international garment and carpet exporters to contain child labour in production of goods.        
	This is the first time India has officially acknowledged that it may need to learn from the West in its campaign to eliminate child labour, government officials said.        
	GAP and Primark, leading apparel chains from the UK, have over the past year suspended Indian sub-contractors after they were found employing children primarily for embroidery and stitching.        
	But the labour and commerce ministries responded to criticism of Indian efforts to curb child labour by suggesting that the West was targeting Delhi because of its attraction as an outsourcing shore.        
	In a letter to all export promotion councils  each export based industry has a separate council  the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) said: They (international companies) have shown that through such self-regulatory mechanisms child labour can be avoided.        
	The NCPCR, in the June 25 letter, has also asked the councils to include, in all contracts with manufacturers, a clause explicitly stating that children are not to be employed.        
	Further, we request you to carry out processes of social audit in all stages of production of goods that you export. This would be from supply to export stage, the letter says.        
	A copy of the letter has been sent to the commerce ministry. In a separate letter, the NCPCR has asked states to set up district-level task forces that will undertake regular social audits of key industries where child labour has been rampant.        
	The June 24 letter clarifies that the audit must cover domestic labour.        
	A review of the social audit through the task force must be carried out by the collector and the (state) labour department must take action to book cases against concerned employers, and take the case to its logical conclusion, the letter says.         
	The commission has also issued guidelines on how the auditing must be done. The task force should consist of state government officials, NGOs, reputed public personalities, a trade union member and representatives of the Nehru Yuva Kendra, the NCPCR has said.        
	We will review the scenario after a month. We want to identify which states are eager to improve. The functioning of the task forces will also be reviewed, NCPCR chairperson Shantha Sinha said.        
	The task force must visit production units on a daily basis, at different times of the day, over a continuous period of a week. This must be followed by another visit as a follow-up after a weeks break, the NCPCR has recommended.

          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: As developed nations reel under a financial crisis, India has handed them a defeat at the United Nations whose perennial north-south divide was threatening to invade the tourism sector.        
	New Delhi has scuttled a UN move to rank global tourist destinations that it felt would be tilted heavily towards the rich nations, favouring, so to speak, Toronto over the Taj.        
	Under Indian pressure, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) has agreed not to endorse a western tourism promotion bodys rating of countries according to their attraction for tourists, officials here said.        
	Delhi has often played a key role in UN battles between the First and Third Worlds, over issues ranging from West Asia politics to global trade pacts.        
	The UNWTO had signed a pact with the Canada-based Centre of Excellence for Destinations (CED) to promote tourism and had since been under pressure to accept the private bodys grading of destinations as the ultimate thing.        
	India felt that the centre, packed with members from developed nations, would come up with a biased rating that would be put up on the UNWTO website and influence travel agencies and their clients.        
	New Delhi also said a private body could not be accepted as sole judge of a places tourist attraction, the officials said.        
	Besides, India argued, such standardised grading would undermine the diversity of culture and flora-fauna that is the lifeblood of global tourism.        
	Indias stand received strong support in a working group set up by the UNWTO to examine the by-laws and procedures of the CED. The members of the working group included Costa Rica, Brazil, Iran and Ghana apart from India, Spain and France.        
	The decision not to endorse the CED grading came last week at the 84th session of the executive council of the UNWTO in Madrid, Spain. Indian tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni was chairperson of the executive council.        
	Had the original plan been accepted, all countries would have had to go through the CED to receive funds and technical assistance from the UNWTO, which they can now do directly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Congress eyes merit, BJP first-time voters     -  Sonia unity push for poll
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                      
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress will junk its quota system, Sonia Gandhi has said, referring to the practice of handing out tickets for patronage.        
	Merit and capability will be the only criteria while choosing candidates. This is the time when we have to implement a hard decision and rid ourselves of old practices, she told Saturdays meeting of the Congress Working Committee, the partys highest policy-making body.         
	The Congress chiefs declaration was meant to take effect in the impending elections and could clip the wings of factional leaders who have long used ticket distribution to create independent power centres in the party.        
	The meeting, convened to take stock of the partys poll preparedness, also came up with other dos and donts. One was to stop infighting.         
	If we start counting, we will know exactly how many times we have lost elections because of infighting and putting each other down. Most of us are responsible for this, Sonia said.         
	Suresh Pachauri, the Congresss Madhya Pradesh chief, was the only other leader who referred to this flaw at the meeting. Unity should come from within our hearts.        
	Another point, made by defence minister A.K. Antony, was to make elections party-oriented and not candidate-driven. Antony, the author of the eponymous report on organisational reforms in the party, said candidates must be declared at least two months ahead of the elections because delimitation had altered constituencies.         
	The party should take over the constituencies first and then the candidates. All the committees, from top to bottom, should involve themselves. Sonia reinforced the point. The partys victory is our victory. Every individual has a stake in such a victory. Another need, she said, was for an aggressive campaign.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, the head of the Congresss manifesto committee for the Lok Sabha polls, spoke of putting into action Rahul Gandhis wish to make the Congress manifesto, a manifesto of the nation.         
	Another first would be to have a slim and trim manifesto, in bullet points.

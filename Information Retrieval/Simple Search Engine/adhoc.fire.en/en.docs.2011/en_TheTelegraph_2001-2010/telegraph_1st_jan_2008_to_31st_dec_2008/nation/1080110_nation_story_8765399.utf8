     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Nationalist Congress Party president and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today held the US indirectly responsible for Benazir Bhuttos death. 
    
	The root cause of the violence in Pakistan lies in Washington, Pawar told a gathering of party workers from the minority community.
    
	The diatribe lasted more than 10 minutes and covered Iraq as well. What was the fault of our brethren in Iraq who were doing well? But some power, which has taken upon itself a contract for policing the world, sent the army to Iraq. Now their eyes are on Iran, he said.
    
	The content of the speech was in line with the target audience but the tone was unusually aggressive.
    
	The Union minister, however, has not opposed the nuclear deal with the US. His party did advise caution but that was mainly because of fears that the Left would withdraw support to the UPA.
    
	Condemning Benazirs killing, he said the responsibility could fall on the US, pointing out that he had not named any country but only a city.

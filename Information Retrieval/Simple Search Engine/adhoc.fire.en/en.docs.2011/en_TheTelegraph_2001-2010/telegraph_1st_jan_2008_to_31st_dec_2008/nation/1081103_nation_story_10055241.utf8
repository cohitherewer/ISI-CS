                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lalu lobs quit dare   at Nitish 
  - Minister challenges CM to resign in one-upmanship game on Mumbai attacks        NALIN VERMA                          Nitish: Quit retort                                              
	Patna, Nov. 2: Lalu Prasad has virtually challenged Nitish Kumar to sacrifice his chief ministership to protest the Maharashtra attacks on Biharis, trying to beat the Janata Dal (United) leader at his own game.        
	The JD-U recently said its four Lok Sabha MPs would resign on November 7 if the Prime Minister failed to act against Raj Thackeray. The announcement put Lalu Prasad under pressure days after the emotive issue had brought him, Nitish and Ram Vilas Paswan together for the first time in nearly two decades.        
	The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief today replied by raising the stakes, saying all his ministers, MPs and state legislators were ready to quit and daring Nitish and Paswan to follow the example.        
	Doing that would cost Nitish the government in Bihar with more than two years left of his term.        
	My partys 24 Lok Sabha MPs, four Rajya Sabha MPs, 54 MLAs and seven MLCs (members of legislative council), including myself and other ministers, are offering to resign on November 15 on the issue of Bal Thackeray and his family members assaulting people from other states in Maharashtra, Lalu Prasad said.        
	He asked National Democratic Alliance leaders from Bihar and Paswans Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) to follow suit. Nitishs party is an Opposition NDA member while Paswans, like Lalu Prasads, is in the ruling coalition.        
	Nitish played it safe, saying: Lalu Prasad, other Bihar parties and I are united on the issue of assault on Bihar people in Maharashtra. Our Rajya Sabha MPs will talk to Laluji on the subject. We will have a meeting with Laluji.        
	He added: However, who will run the government if the MLAs and state ministers resign? There will be Presidents rule and further anarchy.        
	The JD-Us threat to get its Lok Sabha members to quit was aimed at winning voter sympathy during the parliamentary polls at little cost. The Lok Sabha MPs have almost completed their tenures.        
	Lalu Prasad appeared aggrieved as he said: Ram Vilas Paswan and I had responded to Nitish Kumars call to join the Bihar leaders delegation which asked Manmohan Singh to rein in the divisive forces in Maharashtra. Our unity sent out a strong message. But without consulting us, the JD-U announced its MPs would quit.        
	Asked what he would do if other Bihar parties ignored his call, he said: Let us see how they respond.        
	Lalu Prasad thanked Nitish for skipping yesterdays NDA meeting after learning that the Shiv Senas Uddhav Thackeray would attend it. But he added: JD-U president Sharad Yadav attended it, so how can you separate Nitishs JD-U from these seditious forces?        
	Activists of Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena attacked north Indian railway job seekers in Mumbai last month and are accused of beating a Bihari youth to death. The Shiv Sena of Rajs uncle Bal Thackeray has since raised its anti-migrant rhetoric to guard its turf.

	New Delhi, June 10: The government today ordered TV channels to stop beaming an advertisement of Lux Cosy undergarments, saying its depiction of semi-clad male and female models and a dog made it indecent, vulgar and suggestive.

	The ministry has prohibited the transmission or retransmission of the advertisement with immediate effect. and has asked channels to be careful in selection of content.

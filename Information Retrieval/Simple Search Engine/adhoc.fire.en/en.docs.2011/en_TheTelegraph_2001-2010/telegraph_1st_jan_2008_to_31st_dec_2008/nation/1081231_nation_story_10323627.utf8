The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priests for export? Sorry, India cant help
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Priests for export? Sorry, India cant help
  - Young Catholics in Kerala turn away from pulpit, supply to US amp; Europe hit        LAURIE GOODSTEIN                                                  
	Aluva (Kerala), Dec. 30: In the sticky night air, next to a grove of mahogany trees, nearly 50 young men in shirts saunter back and forth along a basketball court, reciting the rosary.         
	They are seminarians studying to become Roman Catholic priests. Together, they send a great murmuring into the hilly village, mingling with the Muslim call to prayer and the chanting of Vedas from a temple on a nearby ridge.        
	Young men willing to join the priesthood are plentiful in India, unlike in the US and Europe. Within a few miles of this seminary, called Don Bosco College, are two much larger seminaries, each with more than 400 students.         
	As a result, bishops trek here from the US, Europe, Latin America and Australia looking for spare priests to fill their empty pulpits.         
	Hundreds have been allowed to go, siphoning support from Indias widespread network of Catholic churches, schools, orphanages, missionary projects and social service programmes.         
	At least 800 Indian priests are working in the US alone. India, Vietnam and the Philippines are among the leading exporters of priests, according to data compiled by researchers at the Catholic University of America in Washington.         
	But these days, the Indian prelates have reason to reconsider their generosity. With India modernising, more young men are choosing financial gain over spiritual sacrifice.         
	There is a great danger just now because the spirit of materialism is on the increase, said Bishop Mar James Pazhayattil, the founding bishop of the Diocese of Irinjalakuda, as he sat barefoot at his desk, surrounded by mementos of a lifetime of church service. Faith and the life of sacrifice are becoming less.        
	Some of the forces contributing to a lack of priests in Europe and the US have begun to take shape here.         
	Parents are having fewer children, with even observant Catholics freely admitting they use birth control. The Indian economy, which has boomed for years, offers more career options.         
	Many priests once came from large agricultural families. But now land is scarce, the soil tapped out. Families are moving to cities, far from the tight-knit parishes that for generations kept Catholics connected to their faith. And educated young Catholics are increasingly attracted to fields like engineering and technology.         
	In past generations, having a son become a priest increased the familys stature, said Rev. Jose Kuriedath, a sociologist in Aluva who has written a book about vocations in India. Kuriedath recounted an adage in Malayalam: It is equal in dignity to have either an elephant or a priest in the family.         
	But this is changing.         
	At St Pauls Minor Seminary in the Diocese of Irinjalakuda, sleepy teenage boys clamber from their dormitory every morning down to the chapel, past a statue of Mary and portraits of Pope Benedict XVI and Gandhi.         
	Among them is Chacko Kuttuparambil, a stocky 17-year-old who wears basketball shoes and slim, stylish glasses. His prosperous family was not particularly supportive of his joining the priesthood, he said.        
	His father, an apartment building manager, wanted him to be a computer engineer. His brother, a business executive, also tried to dissuade him. Chacko is the younger of two sons, and traditionally it is the responsibility of the youngest son to care for the parents in their old age.         
	But Chacko felt called to the priesthood because, he said, as a child he was miraculously cured of a viral infection that paralysed the right side of his body for two years.         
	He gave me life, Chacko said, so I am to give my life to Him.        
	On a hot day before the monsoon arrived, Chacko and his fellow students boarded a bus for a field trip intended to expose them to ministry work. Along the way, the teenagers clapped and belted out Christian hymns and pop tunes. They craned to look out at billboards of motorcycles, cellphones and models with bare midriffs advertising sari shops.        
	The students arrived at a home for mentally ill adults run by an order of nuns in pink saris. Some students initially recoiled at the patients odd tics. But as they had been taught, they separated into small groups to talk with the patients, many of whom brightened under the boys attention.         
	Most of the students were selected for the seminary after attending a life guidance camp that each year draws hundreds of local teenagers for a three-day session at St Pauls.         
	Those who seem promising are invited back for a vocation retreat, and the best of those are invited to join the seminary.         
	In a first-year class, the students studied a pamphlet called Growing up Gracefully. The schools rector, Rev. Sebastian Panjikaran, demonstrated proper priestly etiquette. Father Panjikaran acted out the wrong way for a priest to walk through town, charging down the aisle between the students desks, his eyes fixed on the ground.         
	A priest should not walk so fast, he said, turning to face the students. He should walk how?        
	Slowly, the students said.         
	He should walk slowly, Father Panjikaran repeated, strolling casually up the aisle and making eye contact with the students. And he should ...?        
	Help, the students say in unison.         
	If you walk slowly, Panjikaran explained, the people will see you are friendly and accessible and will ask you for help. He concluded, You can have that sense of usefulness if you do good for others.        
	Catholics represent a tiny proportion of the population in India  about 2 per cent. But they have played an outsized role in weaving the countrys social safety net, establishing schools, hospitals, old-age homes and other organisations that serve many non-Catholics.         
	The church here is ancient, with three separate rites, each with its own liturgies and bishops. Here in Kerala, Catholics of the Syro-Malabar rite trace their roots to Apostle Thomas, who according to lore arrived by boat in 52 AD, made disciples among the ruling Brahmin class and planted seven churches.         
	After evening Mass one Sunday at Sacred Heart Keezhmad, the parish just up the hill from Don Bosco College, the young altar boys and some friends were helping the priest close the sacristy.         
	Of eight young men, including the president of the local Catholic youth organisation, only one said he was interested in becoming a priest. Six said they aspired to be engineers, and one said he wanted to be a doctor.        
	Like many seminaries run by religious orders, Don Bosco College traditionally did not accept students who were the only child in their families. But that policy has changed, said Rev. Sebastian Kalambaden, the seminarys administrator. The seminary also has two students who were brought up Hindu and converted to Catholicism. Until recently, most seminaries avoided taking converts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 6: The presence of a dead calf in a temple compound sparked communal tension and clashes in an Anantnag village home to some Kashmiri Pandits.        
	Tempers frayed when the four Pandit families of Chatrugul village discovered the calf in a spring within the premises of Mata Ragniya temple, a 900-year-old shrine.        
	Suspecting foul play by some in the majority community, the Pandits marched out of their homes in protest, leading to an altercation with some onlookers. Police said they briefly clashed with each other but some locals intervened and stopped things from getting out of hand.        
	Anantnag police chief Nitesh Kumar ruled out any conspiracy. The calf had gone to drink water from the spring but slipped and died later. Its owner is mourning.        
	Kumar said some people tried to exploit the situation and give the incident a communal colour. But nobody heeded their call and their designs were frustrated.

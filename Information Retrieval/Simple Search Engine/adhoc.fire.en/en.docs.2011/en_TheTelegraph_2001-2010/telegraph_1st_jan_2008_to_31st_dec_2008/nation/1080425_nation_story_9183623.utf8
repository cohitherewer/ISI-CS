          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, April 24: Orissa High Court today ordered ban on the use of recycled polythene bags in the state.        
	Orissa government had imposed a ban on the sale, import or store of non-biodegradable polythene carry bag (less than 20-micron thick with effect from January 26, 2004), but had not followed it up with a ban on recycled polythene in the state.        
	Orissa has turned into a dumping ground for recycled polythene bags following restrictions on it in 13 states across the country, said the court, while coming up with the immediate ban.         
	The court also directed the state government to ensure that recycled polythene bags were not distributed in the market and submit a status report on the implementation of the ban on May 15.         
	A two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Indrajeet Mohanty imposed the ban today.

          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 22: CPM leaders appear convinced Mamata Banerjee will not be satisfied even if the government offers to improve the Singur compensation package, suspecting that her real game plan is something else.         
	Her plan is quite clear. She does not want the project to happen. She could have accepted the package and claimed it as a victory for her agitation. But her stubbornness on the return of 300 acres reeks of a different design, CPM secretariat member Madan Ghosh said.        
	A central committee member suggested the Trinamul chief was looking at the Lok Sabha polls due next year.         
	In the panchayat polls (in May), the discontent over land acquisition had helped her snatch three zilla parishads from us. She now wants to project herself as the saviour of farmers with an eye on the Lok Sabha polls, he said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declined comment but CPM state secretary Biman Bose slammed Mamata in Purulia for demanding the governments dismissal under Article 356.         
	Let her shout as much as she wants. It will only expose her politics to the people, said party veteran Benoy Konar.         
	Mamata is insisting on the return of maximum land from within the Nano project area and has threatened to resume her dharna.

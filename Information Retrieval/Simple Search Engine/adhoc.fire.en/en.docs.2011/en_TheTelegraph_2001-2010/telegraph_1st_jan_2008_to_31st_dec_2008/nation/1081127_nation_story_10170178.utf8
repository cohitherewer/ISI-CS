          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chandrayaan takes off in Sriharikota on November 14. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Temperatures inside Chandrayaan-1 have climbed up to 50 Celsius because of anticipated changes in illumination from the Sun, but spacecraft control engineers in Bangalore said there was nothing to worry about yet.         
	Most scientific instruments aboard the spacecraft which is orbiting the moon at an altitude of 100km have been switched off as part of routine procedure during the temperature surge, senior Indian Space Research Organisation officials said.         
	This is hot summer season for Chandrayaan-1, said T.K. Alex, the director of the Isro Satellite Centre, Bangalore. It is expected to last about a month. We knew that the temperatures would rise when the orientation of the Sun changed, he said.         
	Temperatures vary from point to point within the spacecraft but appear to be in the range of 40 Celsius to 50 Celsius, instead of the normal operating temperature of 25 Celsius to 30 Celsius.         
	He said the spacecraft was equipped with thermal insulation and reflectors that were expected to radiate heat back into space. Its very hot outside  without insulation the temperatures would have been 100 Celsius, Alex said.         
	Isro officials tracking health signals from the spacecraft picked up at the Deep Space Network station near Bangalore said all readings were within normal values. Its a bit hotter than we expected, but everything looks fine, one engineer said.         
	In ground roast-and-freeze tests before launch, all onboard electronics and instruments remained intact and functional when the fully-assembled Chandrayaan-1 was heated to 120 Celsius and cooled to minus 150 Celsius for 21 days.         
	The average day temperature on the moon is about 100 Celsius and the average night temperature is about minus 150 Celsius. Scientists have calculated that the day temperature 100km above the lunar surface would be about 100 Celsius.         
	Space scientists said the scientific observation instruments on the spacecraft were currently in the commissioning phase and were turned on only for short periods for routine tests.         
	Its only during observation phase that well need them switched on for longer periods, said J.N. Goswami, the director of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, that had made two of the nine instruments aboard.

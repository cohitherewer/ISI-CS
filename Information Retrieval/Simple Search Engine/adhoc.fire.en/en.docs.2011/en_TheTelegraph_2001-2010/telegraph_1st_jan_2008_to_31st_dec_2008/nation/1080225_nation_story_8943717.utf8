          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: Nine days after the Maoist mayhem at Nayagarh, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked the rebels to give up arms and come to the discussion table.         
	Im always prepared to have a dialogue with the Maoists. But they should first give up violence and follow the laws of the land, Naveen told reporters here today.        
	The chief minister has taken this stand after taking over as the chief minister eight years ago.        
	A few years ago, Naveen had a meeting with a delegation of pro-Naxalite groups and said in clear terms that the rebels would have to shun violence before the government started a dialogue with them. He had fulfilled certain demands of the pro-Naxalite groups, including withdrawing minor forest cases and restoring tribal land ownership after evicting the non-tribal encroachers.        
	Earlier this morning, a fact-finding team of civil rights activists, academicians, lawyers, and students urged the state and the Centre to start a dialogue with the Maoists and other Naxalite outfits.         
	Professor Manoranjan Mohanty, who represented the Peoples Union for Democratic Rights, said: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has been saying the same thing. But he should hold talks with the Maoists without any pre-condition.        
	The fact-finding team addressed a news conference here after visiting Nayagarh and Ganjam districts. They demanded that the harassment of innocents in the name of picking up Maoists should be stopped. They also sought withdrawal of unnecessary security forces.        
	The fact-finding team comprised representatives from the Peoples Union for Democratic Rights, Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee, Centre for Protection of Civil Liberties and All-India Students Federation.

	Melbourne, Sept. 3 (PTI): Indian students seeking admission in Australia may have to push harder to get a visa as India has been moved up on the immigration risk scale.         
	The status of India and eight other countries has been changed to combat increased levels of immigration risk, a spokesperson for Australias immigration and citizenship department said.

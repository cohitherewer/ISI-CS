          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: After a terror techie, a missing medical student has been thrown up as a key link in the Ahmedabad blasts.        
	Police today claimed that Fahan Khan, from Mumbais Juhu but studying medicine in Indore, was a crucial player in last months blasts along with cyber expert Taufiq Bilal.        
	A top crime branch official claimed Fahan, 21, had stolen four cars from the Navi Mumbai area, two of which were used in the Ahmedabad blasts and two were found packed with explosives in Surat.        
	Fahan was entrusted with the job of procuring stolen vehicles. He arrived in Mumbai about a fortnight before the blasts with two car thieves from Madhya Pradesh and stole four cars from the Navi Mumbai area, he said.        
	When we visited his house on Sunday on a tip-off from Gujarat police, we found it locked. We are on the lookout for information about his family.        
	An officer of the Maharashtra ATS, probing the blasts, claimed Taufiq could be as crucial a player as alleged mastermind Abu Basheer who was arrested last week.        
	We are certain that Taufiq Bilal, whose real name is Abdul Subhan Qureshi, played a key role in the Malegaon blasts, too. He is a multitasker, equally adept at organising terror meetings, arranging logistics, making bombs and hacking mails, said ATS additional commissioner Parambir Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhis dilemma: to vote or to go to wedding
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhis dilemma: to vote or to go to wedding
  - 20000 marriages coincide with November 29 election day, headache for staff assigned democracy duty         ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The astrologers must have been smirking all the time they were huddled with Delhis politicians, picking the perfect date for filing of nomination papers.        
	They hid from the candidates a little detail that could affect their fortunes  that the day of the Assembly polls was a most auspicious date too. For weddings.        
	Some 20,000 marriages are lined up in Delhi on November 29, which means several lakhs of people will be too busy through the day to vote.        
	I dont care much about the elections anyway. I voted in last years municipal polls but Ill give this one a miss, said Pritha Sinha, 20, one of the capitals eight lakh first-time voters.        
	I have an appointment at the parlour in the morning and then have to be at several weddings, including my cousins. I cant give up on so much fun just to cast a vote that is not going to change my life in any way.        
	If Pritha will not vote, many of her elders simply cannot  they will be anxiously making the wedding arrangements, overseeing the ceremonies and welcoming guests.        
	Sources at the Delhi electoral affairs department reckon that not more than 35 per cent would vote.        
	Assembly poll turnouts in Delhi have been falling steadily for the past 15 years, from 65 per cent in 1993 to 49 per cent in 1998 to 47 per cent in 2003. Only 43 per cent voted in last years municipal elections.        
	But Rakesh Gupta of Pitampura, whose sister is marrying on November 29, has a bigger problem than Prithas. Even if he skips the booths, his party is sure to be spoiled.        
	My wife is on election duty; she is a teacher with a Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) school, Gupta said.        
	We tried to get her out by talking to the principal, but nothing has material- ised yet. They are telling us she wont have a problem since the marriage is at night, but anyone should know that its the preparation that matters. We had fixed the date months in advance, I dont know how we are going to cope.        
	Requests for exemption are pouring in from among the 12,000-odd teachers on election duty. I have received 15 requests, said Bijender Singh, former president of the Government School Teachers Association and MLA from Nangloi Jat.        
	He explained the problem: Election duty takes up two days. The teachers have to reach their polling stations a day before the vote. And even if polling finishes by 5pm on November 29, the process of winding up will take so much time that they cannot reach their destinations before November 30. So their plans are ruined anyway.        
	A woman teacher at a government school in Shahdara, who did not wish to be named, said she had even toyed with the idea of postponing her sons wedding.        
	The marriage was fixed six months ago, but now I have been put on election duty. I dont want to miss this important day in my sons life but I dont know what to do, she said.        
	The banquet hall has been booked, the band and the decorators have been hired; its not possible to cancel everything.        
	The politicians have begun worrying. I have seen people skip voting for the flimsiest of reasons, so shrugged Mangat Ram Singhal, Delhi elections affairs minister.        
	I can understand its difficult to be on poll duty or take time out to vote when a friend or relative is getting married and you are busy with the preparations, he added. But voting is a duty for every citizen and they should exercise their rights.        
	What has set up the rush for weddings on November 29 is that there were no marriage dates from October 16 to November 16. The most auspicious dates are November 23, 24 and 29.        
	I was to travel to Rajasthan on November 27 for my cousins marriage, said Rachna Srivastava, a teacher at an MCD school near Janakpuri. I shall have to cancel my trip if my request for exemption is not considered.        
	She added: I have already bought jewellery and clothes for the wedding. But Ill never finish on time to be able to make a last-minute dash to the evening functions.

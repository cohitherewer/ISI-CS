          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 24: A soil conservation officer was stripped and beaten up allegedly by two policemen at Athagarh prompting the government to seek a report into the incident.        
	The incident that occurred on Tuesday night led to the suspension of the inspector in charge of Athagarh town police station.         
	Sources said a preliminary probe had revealed that Akhaya Kumar Mohanty, the section officer at the soil conservation office, was taken to the police station on Tuesday night by inspector in charge (IC) Pradipto Kumar Jena and assistant superintendent of police Niranjan Sabar.         
	He was later stripped and beaten up, in presence of his brother, Arun Kumar Mohanty, an advocate.        
	Sources said that the two officers went to the soil conservation office in search of a watchman against whom they had received a complaint. They stumbled upon the section officer at the office.         
	The man had apparently refused to accompany the two officers to the watchmans quarters and had only pointed it out to the officers  an action that allegedly offended the men in uniform.        
	We have sought a report from the concerned authorities. Appropriate action will be taken against those guilty if the allegation is found to be true, said home secretary A.P. Padhi while talking to reporters at Bhubaneswar today.         
	Tension filled the sub-divisional headquarters town, some 40km from here, late in the night as mob protests began over and the crowds staged a gherao in front of the police station.         
	Director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj has reportedly also issued orders for the suspension of the IC on the basis of a preliminary report submitted by Harmohan Das, the additional superintendent of police, Cuttack, who rushed to Athagarh after the mob refused to budge. The situation was brought under control only after the officer assured prompt action.

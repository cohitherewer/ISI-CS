          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Parliament is set to debate the Mumbai attacks tomorrow after floor leaders of political parties agreed on the agenda today.         
	Although the BJP has demanded a debate on terrorism and internal security in almost all Parliament sessions in the past four years, this time the government appears keener to discuss the issue.         
	The recent Assembly poll results have emboldened the government to stress that terror is not a partisan issue and the challenge should be met together. It wants to use the opportunity to project a tough line on terror with promises to strengthen laws and set up an administrative mechanism.        
	The BJP is, however, determined to corner the government for treating terror casually for over four years because of vote-bank politics. It feels the efforts to seek a consensus on fighting terror have come too late and under duress.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram will first make a statement on the Mumbai attacks and a debate will follow. Terror will remain on the agenda with the House slated to discuss a bill on a federal agency that the government promised in the wake of the Mumbai mayhem.        
	The tone was set in both Houses on the first day of the session with an unambiguous demand for strong action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks.         
	Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari condemned the Mumbai strikes and other terror attacks. Ansari said: The scourge of terrorism must be countered at all levels....        
	Chatterjee said: The House calls for strict action and all-out effort to prevent recurrence of such cowardly and inhuman attacks.        
	Both Houses were adjourned for the day after MPs paid condolences to former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, the Mumbai victims and members and former members who passed away recently.         
	Chatterjee hailed Singh as a true friend of the poor and deprived and a statesman who stood for secularism and a casteless society.

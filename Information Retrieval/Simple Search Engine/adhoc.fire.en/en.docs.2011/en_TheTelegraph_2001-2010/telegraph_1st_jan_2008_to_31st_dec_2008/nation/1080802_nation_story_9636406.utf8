	New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Supreme Courts decision on a tussle between Bihar and Jharkhand over the ownership of a power plant is likely to be delivered in September.        
	Tenughat thermal power station in Lalpania in Jharkhand has become the bone of contention between the two states. Both the states are staking a claim over the unit which was a Bihar-government entity till the new state of Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar under the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000. After the state boundaries were redrawn, the power unit fell in the territory of Jharkhand which has now claimed ownership over it.        
	A bench headed by Justice Altamas Kabir, while issuing notice today, directed both the states to maintain status quo with regard to the power plant till September. It has also posted the matter for final disposal in the second week of September.        
	Tenughat thermal power station was the only industrial undertaking owned by Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Ltd (TVNL), a wholly-owned enterprise of Bihar before the creation of Jharkhand.        
	Jharkhand counsel K.K. Venugopal and Mahesh Agarwal said that after apportionment of the assets and liabilities of undivided Bihar between the two successor states, the power plant is now vested in Jharkhand and not in Bihar. Counsel S.K. Kapoor and Ved Prakash, appearing for TVNL, sought a direction to Jharkhand to share the plants power in view of shortage in Bihar, which is ready to pay a price for it till the disposal of the matter.        
	Jharkhand has challenged in the apex court a judgment of Patna High Court in which it said the registered office and the principal seat of business of TVNL had been in Patna and, therefore, the TVNL shares would vest in Bihar.

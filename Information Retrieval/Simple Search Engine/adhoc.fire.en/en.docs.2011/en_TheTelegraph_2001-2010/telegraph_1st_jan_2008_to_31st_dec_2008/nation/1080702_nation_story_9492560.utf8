The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Religion chant back on Advanis lips
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Religion chant back on Advanis lips
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani                                  
	July 1: Pouncing on the politically potent Amarnath row, L.K. Advani today shed his new-found inhibitions on Hindutva to declare that India needs a government that promotes religiosity.         
	The government should promote religiosity, of the right kind, he told reporters at Bhopal airport this morning before returning to Delhi.        
	Advanis stand goes against the Indian Constitution, which says promotion of any religion is not the duty of the state.         
	The statement also signals another shift in strategy for the BJP leader, who had earlier tilted away from Hindutva to focus on development and good governance.        
	No government should compromise with religious fundamentalism, communalism and sectarian pressures, said the leader whose Ram rath yatra had divided the country and ended in the demolition of the Babri Masjid.        
	The context was the revocation of the order transferring forest land in Kashmir to the Amarnath shrine board to build facilities for pilgrims, which Advani blamed on the directive of the Congress leadership.        
	After protests across the state against the land transfer and ally PDPs pullout, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad announced the revocation and said the government, and not the shrine board, would build the facilities.         
	The state hasnt done this on its own. I charge, it is the central government which decided this course. This is surrender before fundamentalism. This is perverted secularism, Advani today said.        
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate also made it clear he was not merely expressing outrage at the incidents in Kashmir but unveiling a well thought-out agenda.        
	When our government comes to power, we will create a separate department of religious tourism in the ministry of tourism. We will explore all possibilities of expanding facilities for religious tourism all over the country. He described this as an idea of great significance.         
	This might be a subtle attempt to indicate that if the BJP comes to power, matters like the Amarnath yatra will not be left in the exclusive domain of the state.         
	The BJPs core committee and office-bearers met later in the day in Delhi and also decided to take up the Amarnath controversy in a big way.        
	Party chief Rajnath Singh said the Congress had surrendered before fundamentalist forces and announced a nationwide hartal on July 3. He also said the party would hold demonstrations at district headquarters between July 4 and 11.         
	The Sangh parivar, however, does not appear satisfied with the BJPs response. It has announced a Bharat bandh on July 3, threatened to lay siege to Haj Houses all over India and called for a boycott of all Kashmiri goods. It will take out a cycle rally tomorrow.         
	The BJP, too, adopted a resolution, saying: Today, democracy, secularism and civility are under serious threat in Jammu and Kashmir. It is a result of the Congress policies since Independence that the Hindu minority has been thrown out of the Valley.

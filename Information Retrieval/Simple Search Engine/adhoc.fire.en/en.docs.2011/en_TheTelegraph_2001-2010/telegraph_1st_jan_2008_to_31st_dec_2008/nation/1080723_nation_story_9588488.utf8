	New Delhi, July 22: When Manmohan Singh presented his first budget 17 years ago, few in the Congress had thought the quiet, apolitical minister capable of transforming into a confident leader of the country.        
	Today, there was unanimity that politician Manmohan had arrived  and to stay.        
	Party leaders are now cautiously optimistic that the Manmohan-Sonia-Rahul troika would continue to work together for a few more years till the young Gandhi was ready to take up charge in a more direct and independent manner.        
	Old-timers feel that in the partys 123-year-old history, Manmohans emergence has been unique.        
	The Congress has had leaders of stature in the past who enjoyed excellent rapport with the Family. But the likes of Rafi Ahmad Kidwai, Babu Jagjivan Ram, Y.B. Chavan, M. Chenna Reddy and H.N. Bahugana mostly worked under a Nehru-Gandhi Prime Minister.        
	In 2004, when Sonia proposed Manmohans name for the top job, most Congress leaders believed the Prime Minister would have a limited role while the party president held all the strings.        
	This somewhat illusory perception continued for a long time till Manmohan showed his firmness of purpose over the nuclear deal, issuing the Left a public dare to withdraw support.        
	Since that August 2007 statement, the party began to see a different and more assertive Manmohan. He worked closely with Sonia to identify the Samajwadi Party as a credible alternative to the Left. Politician Manmohan also kept in close touch with several smaller parties.        
	The plan had the support of Sonia and Rahul, and some influential party leaders too were kept in the loop.        
	Party officials believe Manmohan, Sonia and Rahul can leash the whims of mercurial allies such as the Samajwadi Party and the JMM with a mixture of accommodation, reason and firmness. They are confident of the government surviving the remaining part of the term.        
	Some, however, argue that having won the trust vote, the Congress should consider calling early polls. The logic is that the feel-good effect of the win, the Prime Ministers thrust on the energy sector (associated with the development plank) and the divisions in the Opposition ranks should be exploited.        
	This lobby cites another advantage  an early poll would deny Mayavati the time to expand and consolidate the realigned third front.        
	However, the new allies who saved the day at the trust vote could be a stumbling block to that plan, as could the need to work out a new strategy for Uttar Pradesh.        
	Sources said that having parted ways with the Left, the Congress needed to keep the Samajwadis and the JMM in good humour and honour some of the commitments made to them in the past fortnight.        
	For instance, JMM leader Shibu Soren is keen to head the coal ministry for at least six months. And though the details of the understanding with the Samajwadis are under wraps, the two parties need time to plan their Uttar Pradesh strategy, which will have a crucial bearing on the next general election.

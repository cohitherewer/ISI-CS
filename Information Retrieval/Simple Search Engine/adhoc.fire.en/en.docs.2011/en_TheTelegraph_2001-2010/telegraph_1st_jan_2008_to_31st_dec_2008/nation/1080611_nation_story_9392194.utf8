	Cuttack, June 10: An inmate serving life sentence at Choudwar jail died after another convict allegedly stabbed him inside the prison.         
	Krushna Chandra Behera (43) was declared dead around 9.05am today while he was under emergency treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital here. He suffered lung ruptures, prison officers said.        
	Krushna hailed from Nurukesabarini village at Badamba in Cuttack and was convicted in a case of dowry death in 2003.         
	He was one of the 225 convicts in the jail, located 11km from here.         
	Prison superintendent Dharanidhar Das said the convict was found bleeding profusely from his stomach near one of the jail latrines in ward No. 19 around 8.15pm.         
	He was shifted to SCB Hospital after preliminary medical attention.         
	The wounds were inflicted by Pratap Khatei, another lifer inmate. Khatei had stabbed Behera with a broken steel utensil (karchuli) used to serve food. We have lodged an FIR at the Choudwar police station, Das told The Telegraph today.         
	There are unconfirmed reports about a tiff between the two over some trivial issue minutes prior to the stabbing, he added.

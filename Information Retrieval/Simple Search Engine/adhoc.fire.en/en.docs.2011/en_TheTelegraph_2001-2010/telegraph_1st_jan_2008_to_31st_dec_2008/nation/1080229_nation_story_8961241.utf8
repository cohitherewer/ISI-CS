  - BJP Orissa boss steps in to stop infighting            SUBRAT DAS                                       
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 28: Simmering differences in state BJPs senior ranks is finally out in the open with the Balasore MP sharpening his knife against a cabinet minister.         
	MP Aira Kharavela Swain recently levelled charges of corruption against BJP leader and revenue and disaster management minister Manmohan Samal at a Balasore news conference.         
	Swain alleged that while the state allotted a sum of Rs 5 crore for Orissa flood-relief  the revenue department, headed by a Congress member, released Rs 2.5 crore from the Calamity Relief Fund to the Balasore municipality. Swain further alleged that the municipality chairman, Anup Kumar Das, gave Rs 25 lakh to the revenue minister for his favours towards the civic body.         
	BJP insiders believe Swain was miffed by Samals collusion with a politician from a rival party and for ensuring his defeat in the coming Lok Sabha poll.         
	Das has denied all allegations.        
	He has hit out at Swain, stating: If I had given Rs 25 lakh to Samal for the flood fund, then I must have paid Rs 40 lakh to Swain for the Rs 4-crore released from the MPs LAD fund, which was used for Balasore development projects.         
	Samal has also dismissed Swains allegations as false and baseless. He has clarified that he had no role to play in the fund disbursement and district collectors, following approval from a committee headed by the chief secretary, released them.         
	A section of cadre owning allegiance to Samal held a street rally in Balasore yesterday to protest against Swains accusations and burnt his effigy. Interestingly, Congress activists also burnt effigies, venting their ire against the local MPs anti-Balasore stand.         
	The BJP leaders, in a tight spot due to infighting during the election year, is trying to douse the fire  and fast.         
	I am in touch with Swain and Samal. Swain clarified that he had not made allegations against Samal directly and had quoted the chairman of Balasore municipality. Samal has also denied all allegations, said BJP unit president Suresh Pujari.         
	I have also apprised the central leadership of the entire episode, said Pujari.

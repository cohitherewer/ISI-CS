          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Manmohan Singh today formed a group of ministers to discuss women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhurys proposal to serve packaged food at anganwadi childcare centres, a suggestion his office had opposed.         
	The GoM will consult state governments before finalising its recommendations, the Union cabinet decided today.        
	A senior official in the child development ministry called the decision a positive step towards the government accepting the proposal, which critics warn could spawn corruption.         
	India has around 6.5 lakh anganwadis  government-sponsored care centres that reach out to around 80 million children under six. Under the Integrated Child Development Scheme  the worlds largest childcare scheme  anganwadi centres provide supplementary nutrition to tackle malnutrition.         
	At most anganwadis, children are fed meals freshly cooked by the local community. But Chowdhury has proposed introducing pre-cooked, fortified food, arguing the scheme was mandated not to fill stomachs but to battle lack of key nutrients.         
	But the Planning Commission and the Prime Ministers Office oppose it on the ground that it could increase corruption. Several health experts and academics are also against the plan, which, they say, could compromise childrens nutrition further.

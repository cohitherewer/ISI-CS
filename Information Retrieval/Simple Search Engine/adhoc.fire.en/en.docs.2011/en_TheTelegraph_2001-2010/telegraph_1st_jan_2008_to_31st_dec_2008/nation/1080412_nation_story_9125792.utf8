  - General category cadre   tags state move unfair        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Cuttack, April 11: The state government has stirred a hornets nest by reserving promotion chances for SC and ST officers in the Orissa civil service  a move that some believe comes at the cost of the depriving general category officials.        
	The civil servants belonging to the general category are peeved, as the state government had shuffled and recast the Orissa Administrative Service (OAS) cadre in a provisional gradation list of OAS Class-I (junior) officers by extending the benefit of accelerated promotion and seniority to the SC and ST officers.         
	Consequently, general category officials have been pushed down in seniority by more than 100 spots from SC and ST officers, who were otherwise below them in terms of actual seniority.         
	The provisional gradation list is a classic example of bestowing reservation at each successive stage of promotion and enabling OAS officers in the SC amp; ST category to jump over the general category officials at every stage of promotion, alleged an OAS officer of the 1987 batch.         
	While his seniority was at a difference of 38 above an SC officer of his batch, the gradation list has placed him at a difference of 42 below the SC officer now.        
	The revenue and disaster management department had released a provisional gradation list of 559 OAS Class-I (junior) officers on March 3, 2008, and had invited objections from the civil servants concerned by March 31, 2008.         
	While approving it, commissioner-cum-secretary has clarified: The SC and ST officers are arranged with present gradation list according to their original position at the time of promotion, without any change.         
	The approval order further clarified that original position of general category officers after their promotion to OAS-I (junior) was being restored and no catch up principle is being followed.         
	Aggrieved general-class servants in the OAS-I cadre on the other hand alleged that the provisional list had not complied with the directions and observations of the Supreme Court. The authorities has misconstrued the direction of the Supreme Court and gone ahead to implement reservation, said an OAS officer of the 1987 batch.         
	While his seniority was at difference of 28 above a ST officer of his batch, the provisional gradation list now has placed him at a difference of 39 below the ST officer.

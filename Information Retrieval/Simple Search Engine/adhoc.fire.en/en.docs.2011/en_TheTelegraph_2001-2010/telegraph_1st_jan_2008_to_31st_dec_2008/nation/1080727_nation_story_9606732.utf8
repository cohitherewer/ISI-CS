          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 26: As Ahmedabad bleeds, Calcutta shivers.         
	Gujarati families in the Bengal capital have been making frantic calls since evening to find out if their relatives in Ahmedabad are safe after the blasts, triggered in quick succession, killed over a dozen people.        
	With mobile phone networks jammed, people had to wait agonising hours before they could speak to their kin in the blast-hit Gujarat city.        
	I watched the breaking news on television and called my uncle but couldnt get through initially. I managed to get through finally on his landline, but with much difficulty, said Jasmine Vora, who works in a private firm in Calcutta. We were relieved to know they are safe.        
	Voras uncle Vipin Shah, aunt Indu and their children stay in Ahmedabad. A niece, Hetashwi Vankani, also studies there.        
	The serial explosions not only cut short Divyesh Shahs plans to take his mother to Vadodara but have also left his family sick with worry about relatives back in Ahmedabad.        
	I returned from Ahmedabad barely three days back and todays news sent shudders down my spine. I have received several calls and some of the callers are desperate to connect with their families there, Shah, who owns an automobile shop on Lenin Sarani, said.        
	City-based businessman Raju Desai spent tense moments before he finally got through to his aunt and cousins in Ahmedabad. At first, we didnt know what to do, he said.        
	Desais widowed aunt Lilam Shah stays with her daughters in Ahmedabad. I called them up to find out if they are safe at home, he said.        
	Till late in the evening, Rishabh Sanghvi hadnt got through to his family in the blast-scorched Gujarat city. I have a family in Ahmedabad and I have been trying to get their information since the time television channels started beaming the news, the businessman said.

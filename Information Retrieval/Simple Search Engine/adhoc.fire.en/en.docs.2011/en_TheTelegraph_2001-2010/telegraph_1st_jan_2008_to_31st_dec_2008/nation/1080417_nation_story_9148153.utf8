          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, April 16: Karnataka High Court today asked the Centre and the state to re-negotiate the agreement signed with the consortium building and operating the new Bangalore airport.         
	It asked the government to consider two issues of public interest: the user fee and the demand to keep the old airport open for short-haul flights.        
	Bangalore International Airport Limited (Bial) is set to levy a user development fee of Rs 955 for outgoing international passengers and Rs 675 for domestic passengers.         
	Also, according to the pact with BIAL, once the new airport opens on May 11, no other airport can operate in a 150km radius. The airport at Devanahalli, 40km from the city centre, is a traffic nightmare with only one access through the already congested Bangalore-Hyderabad highway.

                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Meter rogues in fuel-fraud fury     
	Commuters can often do little against manipulated meters. But auto drivers, who are behind the deception, dont take it lying down when the trick is played on them.    
	Bangalores three-wheeler army, notorious for fudging meters, united against a gas outlet they suspected was short-changing them. The protest ended after police intervention.    
	The auto drivers discovered that a particular station dispensing LPG was short-changing them. Then, showing some meticulous planning and organisational muscle, the drivers filled gas at a regular outlet and at another one where the meters were fudged. When both were measured, they found that the weight of one of the auto tanks filled at the defective outlet was around 350gm less  an obvious case of LPG dispenser meter tampering.     
	Incensed auto drivers then gathered and marched to the nearby police station to complaint.     
	The police, applying the same testing methods, concluded the pump owner was cheating. The protest left many wondering if the auto drivers would get a taste of their own medicine when they short-changed passengers.        
	Desam in save-hills cry    
	Telugu Desam lawmakers have a new cause to campaign for  prevent Andhras hills from being pawned off.    
	The partys members joined forces to urge the government, on a drive to sell such hillocks and other tracts to tourism companies, against going ahead with the plans.    
	The group argued that the sale of such government land in various places, including Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, violated a Supreme Court directive that said hills should not be touched for environmental reasons.    
	Desam leader Dadi Veerabhadra Rao and his colleague A. Revanth Reddy alleged that the Congress government was stooping to unthinkable levels only to ramp up revenues. At least spare hillocks and hilly tracts. The Y.S.R. Reddy regime should leave them alone, he said.    
	Birth pangs for Metro    
	Mumbais planned Metro is too slow to take off, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh fretted last week before officials.    
	Work on the project needs to start quickly and until it does, the answer to the citys commuting woes might remain on paper, he told the agencies overseeing the project. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, steering the plan, needs to speed up construction, he said.    
	Ratnakar Gaikwad, the authoritys commissioner, presented the plan for the third phase of the project. He suggested the government complete the plan, instead of leaving it to public-private partnership. Gaikwad said work on the first phase would begin within a year.    
	The Metro will snake across the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar route. It will connect Colaba-Mahim-Charkop in phase two and add a crucial link between Mahim-Bandra Kurla-Mankhurd on the eastern suburbs. The project promises a swift, silent, air-conditioned mode of transport for half a million Mumbaikars.        
	Power for exams    
	Students appearing for board exams neednt burn the midnight oil  they have been promised round-the-clock power.    
	The Delhi government last week asked the private companies supplying electricity to ensure there are no blackouts as along as the exams continue for much of this month.    
	We have asked them to ensure regular power supply so that children and their studies do not suffer, power minister A.K. Walia said. Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely asked parents to ensure children use power judiciously

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The brother and sister of Krishna, Rajesh Talwars compounder, outside the CBI court in Ghaziabad on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 14: The CBI today sealed Rajesh Talwars house and that of family friend and colleague Praful Durrani to search for evidence based on information the arrested dentists compounder Krishna has revealed to sleuths probing the Noida twin murders.        
	Sources said the agency had also got an anonymous tip-off regarding the location of the murder weapon.        
	Early this morning, investigators, accompanied by a forensic team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, reached the Talwar house where the dentists 15-year-old daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj were found murdered last month.        
	The team cordoned off the area while another sealed the house of the Durranis, partners of the Talwars in their dental clinic.        
	Sources said the sleuths searched for the murder weapon and other evidence, including bloodstained clothes and missing mobile phones and also checked the rooftop water tanks and pipes.        
	Armed with metal detectors, they scanned the terrace and even looked into the flowerpots.        
	The CBI continued to question Pradeep Tayal of Flex Industries, a friend of the Talwars, Prafuls wife Anita and Rajkumar, the domestic help of the Durranis.        
	Rajesh Talwar was reportedly close to Anita, and Tayal had arranged for the car in which the Talwars took Aarushis body to Hardwar for the murdered teenagers last rites.        
	Rajkumar, like Hemraj a Nepalese, was close to both Hemraj and Krishna.        
	The sources said the CBI would soon put both Tayal and Durrani through a lie-detector test.        
	Krishna, arrested yesterday after being brought back from Bangalore on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence, allegedly mentioned during his narco-analysis that three persons were involved in the murders.        
	The sources insisted that Rajesh was still not off the hook and the agency, under pressure to crack the case earlier botched up by Noida police, was certain it would find evidence to nail the dentist.        
	The agency today sought Krishnas custody for 14 days to question him further.

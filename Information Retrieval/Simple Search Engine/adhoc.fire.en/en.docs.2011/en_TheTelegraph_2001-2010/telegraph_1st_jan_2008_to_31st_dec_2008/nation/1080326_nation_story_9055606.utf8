	Cuttack, March 25: The Orissa government today pressed doctors in peripheral service on duty at the referral hospitals in the three government medical colleges in the state as the indefinite strike of junior doctors entered the sixth day.        
	Healthcare services in the three government medical college hospitals at Burla, Berhampur and Cuttack had been badly affected owing to cease work by junior doctors over the past one week demanding hike in their stipend.        
	Subsequently, the administration of the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital in Cuttack had sought assistance of chief district medical Officers of Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada.         
	We now have doctors from peripheral service to assist senior doctors in ensuring adequate healthcare service to the patients, said Dr Trilochan Sahu, the hospital superintendent.        
	Official sources said the government had temporarily posted 30 peripheral doctors (five each from Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Khurda and Puri and 10 from Cuttack) at the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital.         
	Similar measures were also taken at the VSS Medical College Hospital in Burla and MKCG Medical College Hospital in Berhampur.        
	While the state government was busy making arrangements to end the crisis in the hospitals owing to the strike, the Junior Doctors Associations (JDA) of the three medical college hospitals launched a dharna in Cuttack apparently to mount pressure on the government. JDA claimed that all the 500-odd junior doctors in the state were staging dharna at the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital. Our demands are reasonable. But the state is yet to take serious note of it. So, the strike will continue and will be intensified further, said Paresh Behera, the JDA spokesperson.         
	The JDA, which has been spearheading the strike, has demanded a monthly stipend of Rs 13,000 for the junior doctors in their first year, equivalent to the basic salary of assistant surgeons appointed by the Orissa government.         
	The junior doctors expect that to be followed by an increment after the first year and two increments in the second year. The JDA has also demanded work allowance of Rs 10,000.

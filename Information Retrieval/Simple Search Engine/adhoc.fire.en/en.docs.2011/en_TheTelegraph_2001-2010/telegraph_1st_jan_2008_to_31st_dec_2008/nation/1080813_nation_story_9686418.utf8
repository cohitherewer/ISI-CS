	Aug. 12: Communal clashes broke out in Jammus Kishtwar town today, killing two persons and adding to the list of casualties in the day-long violence in the Valley.        
	Fourteen persons, including a photo journalist, were killed in firing by security forces in the Kashmir valley as tens of thousands defied a curfew to protest the death of Hurriyat leader Shiekh Abdul Aziz.        
	The army took control of Kishtwar and staged a flag march to restore law and order. Three companies of the CRPF have been sent to the town.        
	The clashes began when a procession was stoned. When the mobs did not disperse, police fired warning shots in the air and on the agitators during which a grenade exploded, official sources said.        
	One person was killed when a hand grenade exploded in his hand while another died in police firing, the sources said. In the arson that followed, 40 buildings  32 shops, six houses, one hotel and a petrol pump  were gutted. Thirteen vehicles were also damaged.        
	In Kashmir, a huge rally led by Hurriyat leaders Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani was taken out in Srinagars old city, which culminated at the idgah where Sheikh Aziz was buried.        
	The curfew, the first such clampdown in 13 years, was extended this morning from Srinagar to all major towns across Kashmir.        
	But thousands marched to the residences of the Mirwaiz and Geelani and forcibly freed them from house arrest. The protesters then marched towards Srinagars old city, where the procession swelled in numbers. Several deserted CRPF and police bunkers were torched.         
	The protests began with a call by fruit-growers associations to cross the Line of Control in an apparent attempt to sell apples in Muzaffarabad, the headquarters of Pakistan-held Kashmir, but are now escalating into a larger movement demanding either independence from India or a merger with Pakistan.        
	On the outskirts of Srinagar, the forces opened fire on a procession after a security officer of a political leader accidentally pulled the trigger, injuring a sub-divisional police officer. It caused panic after which the security forces opened fire in which three persons died, an officer said.         
	Another big procession was fired upon at Bagh-e-Mahtab on the outskirts of Srinagar. Photo journalist Javed, who was working with a local news channel, died here.        
	Jammu and Kashmir police chief Kuldeep Khoda said the security forces observed maximum restraint to maintain law and order.        
	In Delhi, sources said the army had taken over the Jammu-Srinagar and Pathankot-Jammu stretches of the national highway to convince fruit- growers that they could transport their produce. But the killing of four protesters in Bandipora today is fuelling further resentment.        
	The four protesters were killed near Bandipora around 9.45 this morning after they broke through a police barricade and attempted to attack a post at Paribal Tekri manned by the Rashtriya Rifles, said an army headquarters source.

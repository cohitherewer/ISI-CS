	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to shuffle his council of ministers before Parliaments winter session begins on December 10.         
	Congress sources said Singh was keen to induct a finance minister as he did not want an impression to go around that he was trying to bite more than he could chew.        
	The Congress is not keen on either of the two persons he wanted for the job: Montek Singh Ahluwalia and C. Rangarajan. However, some feel that either would be perfect to tackle the challenges thrown up by the economic meltdown.         
	With about five months to go for the Lok Sabha polls, Singh does not want to risk a government-party disconnect. He is not too happy with junior finance ministers Pawan Bansal and S.S. Palanimanickam.         
	Sources said some had proposed the name of Jairam Ramesh but Singh was not too receptive. Prithviraj Chavan, a deputy minister in the PMO, may be divested of one portfolio and given finance because of his rapport with Singh.        
	He may also appoint full-fledged coal and I amp;B ministers.

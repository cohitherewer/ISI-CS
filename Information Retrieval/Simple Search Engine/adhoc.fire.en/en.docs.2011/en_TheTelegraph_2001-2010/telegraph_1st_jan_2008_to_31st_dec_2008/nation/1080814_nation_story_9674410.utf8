          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Purnea, Aug 13: In a small courtroom in Purnea, a sleepy district in northeastern Bihar, a bizarre legal battle is on involving the IPC and a dog.        
	The accused, a canine called Chhotu, is facing charges of misbehaviour much to the dismay of its present owner  a frail, middle-aged widow. The pet and his mistress have been involved in a five-year bitter battle to decide if the dog is indeed a hero, as his mistress insists, or a nuisance as the court sees it.         
	Chhotu belonged to late Janki Devi of Tatmatoli locality in the town. After her death, the dog became the pet of his erstwhile mistresss daughter, Rajkumari Devi, and grandchild. According to Rajkumari Devi, who has been staying in her fathers home since the death of her mother, no-good neighbours of hers have tried all tricks  poison, official complaints and attacks  to get Chhotu out of the way and then force the family to vacate their home. All these for theree cottahs of land worth lakhs in the middle of the town.        
	When my mother was alive, they tried to force her to vacate her home. Chhotu foiled their attempts each time, recalls Rajkumari Devi.         
	The devoted mistress names her neighbours Jagadish and Sambhu, as the key plotters in the destroy-the-dog plan.         
	Unable to get better of the ferociously protective canine, the duo recently lodged a case in the court of the first-class executive magistrate. On August 5, the court summoned Rajkumari Devi and her dog to the court and fixed August 20 as the next date of hearing.         
	The dog and its mistress had also appeared before the court on July 24 after Jagadish and Sambhu lodged a case against Rajkumari for spreading terror with her mad dog. Executive magistrate Shabbir Hussain, however, observed no madness in its behaviour. Talking to the local media, Husain has cleared Chhotus name calling him an an obedient pet.        
	Former sub-divisional officer of Purnea Sadar Jitendar Prasad on 2003 had awarded Chhotu death sentence after Jagadish and Sambhu filed a case against it.        
	Rajkumaris late mother, Janki Devi, then managed to save the life of her pet roping in the media and activists, who mounted pressure on the administration to spare Chhotus life. Maneka Gandhi was also brought in and she made the same request before the administration.         
	The former Purnea district magistrate, Pankaj Kumar, asked Prasad to revoke his report in wake of raising protests. The present district magistrate, Shreedhar C, is not ready to comment on the issue yet since the matter is sub judice.

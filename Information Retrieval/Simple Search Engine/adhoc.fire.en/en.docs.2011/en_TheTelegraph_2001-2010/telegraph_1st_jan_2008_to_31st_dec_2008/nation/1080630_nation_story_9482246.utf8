          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kokrajhar, June 29: A bomb, probably strapped to a bicycle, blew up the pork stand at a crowded weekly market in western Assams Baksa district today, killing at least five people and injuring 70.        
	The blast at Kumarikhata is suspected to have been triggered by Ulfa whose 709 battalion is active in the area. It comes at a time a faction in Ulfas 28 battalion, based in eastern Assam, has called on the groups entire military wing to observe a cease-fire to facilitate talks.        
	The Sunday mart on the India-Bhutan border was bustling with traders and buyers haggling over vegetables, pigs and poultry when, around 1.10pm, a deafening sound drowned the market buzz.        
	Most of those crowding around the pork stand were Bodos and Adivasis (Santhals).        
	I was buying vegetables when there was a loud bang. I saw people screaming and running helter-skelter. Smoke engulfed the pork market; there was chaos everywhere, said Samesar Boro.        
	The blast left the market splattered with blood and strewn with torn limbs, while pigs and poultry ran amok.        
	The dead include three women. Hailun Narzary, Mogli Boro and Pansari Murmu died on the spot as did Robin Soren, Baksa additional superintendent of police M. Mahanta said. Harao Basumatary, a police constable, died on the way to hospital.        
	Murmus husband Jeetha Soren said the couple and their 12-year-old son Rabiram were selling pork when the blast shook the market.        
	I dont remember anything after that. I have been told my wife is dead and my son is injured, he said at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.        
	We have treated 69 people. Many have received splinter injuries, a hospital employee said. Among the injured are two police constables.        
	Doctors said 37 of the patients had been admitted to the hospital and six of them were critical.

  - Mob torches houses in Adilabad, 2 days after immersion flare-up        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Hyderabad, Oct. 12: Six members of a family were charred today when a mob set fire to five houses in a village in Adilabad district that has been communally charged for the past two days.        
	Three of the victims in Vatoli village were children and one was a woman. A PTI report said five of the victims were from Hyderabad and had come home for Dussehra holidays.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government has ordered a CBI probe into the violence.        
	The names of the victims are yet to be known, but the incident comes two days after a communal clash in Bhainsa town, also in Adilabad and 275km from Hyderabad.         
	On Friday, tempers flared when some people in a Durga immersion procession in Bhainsa sprinkled colour on devotees coming out of a mosque after prayers. In the violence that followed, four persons died. A judicial probe has been ordered.        
	Angry crowds threw stones and fought with swords and axes on the streets for several hours. The mobs went on a stabbing spree and torched motorcycles and shops that were closed for Dussehra, said Andhra home minister K. Jana Reddy, who visited Vatoli and Bhainsa today.         
	Curfew was imposed in Bhainsa, which is near Vatoli, on Friday.        
	Three of the victims were identified as Mohammad Khayyum, 27, and Abdul Sami, 25, both locals, and Bharati Butaan, 30, from Uttar Pradesh. The fourth body was of a painter from Bihar. Police said all died of stab injuries.         
	The police fired 35 rounds to disperse the crowd and arrested four persons. Reddy, who described the violence as beastly and barbaric, said the Rapid Action Force had been deployed. About 400 policemen were out in Bhainsa, still under curfew, he added.        
	Adilabad superintendent of police Anil Kumar said a minor incident of sprinkling colour triggered the violence in which 61 shops were burnt down. We have 400 men guarding Bhainsa town and have organised hourly mobile patrolling in the sensitive villages nearby, said a police officer.        
	Muslim leaders have demanded better protection for minorities. The government has failed to protect the Muslims who live in small numbers in remote areas of the district, said Asaduddin Owaisi, the Hyderabad MP.        
	BJP MLA G. Kishan Reddy accused the police of indifference towards complaints of atrocities on Hindu women.

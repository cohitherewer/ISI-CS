	Nashik, Nov. 13 (PTI): Shrikant Prasad Purohits father-in-law today alleged that the lieutenant colonel, arrested for alleged involvement in the Malegaon blast, was being tortured in police custody.        
	In an application filed before the chief judicial magistrates court, Vilas Dalvi alleged that the army officers finger was broken during interrogation and he had injury marks all over his body.        
	Dalvis plea said Purohit, on whom polygraph, brain mapping and narco-analysis tests have been conducted, should be moved out of police custody.        
	Dalvi has also requested that a team of five doctors  two from the army, two independent doctors and one government doctor  examine his son-in-law. Purohit is among 10 persons arrested for their alleged involvement in the September 29 blast that killed six persons and injured about 80.        
	The application is likely to come up for hearing on November 15 since the judge is on leave.

	Kokkre Bellur (Karnataka), Jan. 16: Kokkre means pelican in Kannada, and this village believes it knows more about caring for birds than the Karnataka government.
    
	Life in Kokkre Bellur has for generations revolved round the migratory birds that spend six to nine months here every year. Now its 2,500 residents are opposing a move to turn the 750-acre village, 85km from Bangalore, officially into a community reserve.
    
	From the children to the aged, the villagers have been taking care of the spot-billed grey pelicans and painted storks that have made the village their nesting ground for centuries.
    
	Being declared a community reserve would mean a tourist invasion, says Hejjarle Balaga (friends of the pelicans), an NGO formed by the villagers.
    
	Bird lovers are welcome to stay but why build additional infrastructure for tourists? We had a bad experience when a watchtower was built. It was too close to the trees and many young ones fell down and some nests were abandoned, said Mahadev Swamy of the 96-member Hejjarle Balaga.
    
	The birds were not used to having tourists peer into their nests. We forced the forest department to dismantle the tower. We will not tolerate such intrusions.
    
	Village lore has it that the only year the birds did not come, back in 1964, a famine claimed many lives. 
    
	Their arrival is a good omen, said Linge Gowda, another Balaga member.
    
	The villagers also believe that the birds, which live for 25 years, can identify them. In 1924, when residents were shifted to a camp because of a plague outbreak, the birds built their nests around the camp, Gowda said.
    
	But its not just traditional beliefs that the government is up against. The Balaga has an arsenal of arguments against the village being turned into a community reserve (see box), which will mean compensation for not cutting trees, and money to plant saplings, regenerate dying water bodies and practise aquaculture.
    
	We need government help to build good roads and insulate the overhead electric wires, which kill at least 25-30 young birds every year. We have been pleading with power officials for six years but they havent responded, a villager said.
    
	Balaga members have set up a bird rehabilitation centre with their own money and are against outside meddling. We have planted banyan, peepal, acacia and other trees so that the birds come in large numbers. If the government steps in, our culture and lifestyle will be affected, Swamy said.
    
	We teach our children to co-exist with the birds. Its they who inform the Balaga when chicks fall off the nests or get electrocuted.
    
	A government official said: We have guaranteed the villagers land rights and promised funds for every kind of activity but they say the government cannot do a better job than them.
    
	Over 500 pelicans and 2,500 storks from across India come here every year. In another few weeks, the entire village will come alive to the chirrups of thousands of chicks and its fields will be carpeted with white bird droppings.
    
	The storks stay from January to July and the pelicans for a whole nine months, from October till July.
    
	Pelicans lay eggs at six years and storks at four. After arrival, they take a month to build nests, preferring higher trunks, and lay eggs that hatch after another week. For the next three weeks, male and female birds take turns to feed the chicks, which take at least three months to learn to fly.

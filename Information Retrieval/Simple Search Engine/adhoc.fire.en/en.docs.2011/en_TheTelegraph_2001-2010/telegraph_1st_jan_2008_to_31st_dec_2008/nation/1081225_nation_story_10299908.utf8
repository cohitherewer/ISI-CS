	Srinagar, Dec. 24: Jammu police today said Ghulam Farid, the Pakistan soldier they claimed to have arrested along with two Jaish militants, was with the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami before joining the army.        
	We had specific intelligence about them, but we did not know one was a Pakistani soldier before the arrest. During questioning, he confessed he was a Pakistani soldier and that he was deputed by the army to Jaish in 2005, police chief K. Rajendra said.        
	Farids comrades, also arrested from a Jammu hotel on Sunday, have corroborated his statement, he added.        
	Police have learnt that Farid had joined Harkat in 2000, a year before he joined the army.         
	In 2005, he joined the Jaish while he was in the army. It will require us some more time to find out how he was inducted into the militant group and whether there are any more such cases, Rajendra said.        
	Sources said the police were building a case to show how deep the army-militant nexus was in Pakistan.        
	The police maintained that Farid was a serving soldier, debunking Pakistani reports that he was a deserter. An officer said too much should not be read into the difference of one digit in the belt number given by the Pakistani authorities.        
	It is not a big issue but we will find out if there is any communication gap, an official said. Jammu and Kashmir police had cited Farids belt number as 4319184 and Pakistani authorities as 43191840.        
	The terror mission of the arrested trio had apparently begun in August when they visited Karachi to collect passport and visas. They flew to Bangladesh and stayed in Khulna for some months before sneaking into India.        
	Jammu police are sending a team to Calcutta to identify the local guide who accompanied the trio after they crossed the India-Bangladesh border at Habibpur in Malda on December 16.        
	We have involved central agencies in the investigations to find out how they entered our country in the first place and who their other accomplices are, one official said.

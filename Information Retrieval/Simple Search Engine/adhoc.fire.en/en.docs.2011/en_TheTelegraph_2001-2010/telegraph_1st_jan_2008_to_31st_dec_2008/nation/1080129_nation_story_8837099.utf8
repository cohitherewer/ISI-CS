          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Supreme Court will hear the Nandigram case on February 25.         
	A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan decided to hear the case next month because some parties were yet to submit responses to a notice.        
	The Bar Association of Calcutta High Court, which has filed its reply, contended that the Bengal governments opposition to a CBI probe into the March 14 firing in Nandigram was misconceived.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said his government may order a CBI inquiry to get to the truth of the matter, the association said.        
	It pointed out that Article 226 of the Constitution empowers the high court to issue a directive for a CBI probe.         
	Police had acted hand-in-hand with supporters of the CPM who were in police uniform, the association alleged.         
	A probe by Bengal police would, therefore, not be appropriate, it said.                    
	 The police had also delayed in filing chargesheets, thereby helping the accused get bail, the association said.

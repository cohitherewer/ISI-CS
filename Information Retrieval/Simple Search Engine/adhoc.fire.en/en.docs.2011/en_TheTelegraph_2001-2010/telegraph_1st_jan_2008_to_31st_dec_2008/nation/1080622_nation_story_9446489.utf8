          OUR BUREAU                          Mayavati announces her withdrawal of support to the government in Delhi. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                  
	June 21: Mayavati today withdrew support to the UPA government, accusing it of handing out step-motherly treatment to her party and government and attacking its economic policies.        
	But she also let slip that she was annoyed with the Congress for not bailing her out of the Taj corridor corruption case.        
	Choosing to strike when the Congress is crushed between the nuclear deal deadlock on one side and rising inflation on the other, Mayavati sent a four-page letter to President Pratibha Patil to inform her of the decision.         
	Inflation is an important reason but most importantly, we are withdrawing support because the Congress and UPA government at the Centre has consistently neglected and is meting out step-motherly treatment to our party and the BSP-led government in Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati told reporters, reading out from the letter.         
	She said the Centre did not grant the Rs 80,000-crore special area incentive package she had sought for the backward Purvanchal and Bundelkhand regions.         
	Asked about her stand in Parliament if the BJP were to bring a no-confidence motion, Mayavati said her party, with its 17 MPs, would act independently depending on the issue at hand. She did not comment on the nuclear deal.         
	The BSP chief also attacked the BJP, blaming it for getting her entangled in the Taj corridor case.         
	Mayavati said she had hoped she would get justice when the Congress-led coalition replaced the NDA at the Centre. But unfortunately, the Congress proved worse than the BJP. Instead of ensuring justice, the Congress has kept the matter hanging during the last four years, she said.        
	Projecting herself as a victim of persecution by the Congress, Mayavati tried to draw sympathy from Dalit voters, who might be uncomfortable over her tilt towards the upper castes.         
	The CBI had filed a chargesheet against her in the corruption case in June 2007. Although she got a reprieve when governor T.V. Rajeswar refused to grant sanction for her prosecution, the case still dangles over Mayavatis head.        
	She has also been worried about Rahul Gandhis attempts to woo Dalits and the Congresss warmer ties with her main rival, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party. She mocked Mulayam as a poor man out of power.         
	Mayavati is looking to increase her partys tally from 17 to 40 in the next general election and hopes this will allow her to bargain for the post of deputy Prime Minister.

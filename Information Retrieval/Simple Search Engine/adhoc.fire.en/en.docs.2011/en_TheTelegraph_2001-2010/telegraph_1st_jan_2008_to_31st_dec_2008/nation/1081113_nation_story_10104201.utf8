                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wanted: Gates-way to end coolie tag
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Bill Gates: On tech radar                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: India is thinking of tying up with Bill Gates and Microsoft to help turn the backroom boy of the software industry to a brain driving information technology worldwide.         
	The human resource development ministry is contemplating the move to foster cutting-edge research in computer sciences. It today held a meeting with Microsoft officials and computer science professors from the IITs and universities to discuss its plans and the role that company chairman Gates could play, sources said.         
	The proposal is at a nascent stage, officials clarified, and there is no formal blueprint yet. It is unclear, for instance, if and how much Gates or Microsoft would be willing to invest, they said.         
	But the idea of the government using help from a global software giant, and its most famous face, to try and make India an IT force is unprecedented, they added.         
	Individual institutes, including the IITs, have frequently combined with private firms to promote specific sectors of technical education. The ministrys attempt indicates the concern that India needs to take the next leap in the IT revolution, an official said.         
	We have long been described as software coolies because our IT industry largely creates software codes for foreign companies. Its time to upgrade, the official said.         
	If the tie-up takes place, it would be novel for Gates and Microsoft, too. Gates, the worlds third richest man, has dedicated funds for several health projects in India, including polio. But neither him nor his company has supported any Indian programme to promote research in the area they are best known for  IT and computer sciences.         
	The collaboration would focus on the number and quality of computer science PhDs in India. The idea is to try and use the vision of Mr Gates and the expertise of Microsoft and combine these with Indian intellect, an official said.

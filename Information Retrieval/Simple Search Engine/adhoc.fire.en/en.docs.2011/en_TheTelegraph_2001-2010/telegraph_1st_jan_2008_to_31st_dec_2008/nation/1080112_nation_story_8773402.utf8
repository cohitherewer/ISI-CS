	New Delhi, Jan. 11: The Centre wants to make molestation a non-bailable offence and is taking expert advice on how to plug the legal loopholes that allow sexual offenders to escape with little or no punishment.
    
	The government particularly wants to know how it can nail those who pass lewd remarks at women  and mostly get away with it.
    
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury will meet a panel of legal experts on Monday to discuss possible amendments to the IPC to crack down on sexual offence, officials said.
    
	They insisted that the move was not a knee-jerk reaction to the recent, widely reported spate of molestation cases across the country but was part of a larger plan to review the laws dealing with the safety of women.
    
	Physical forms of sexual harassment like molestation  as distinct from rape  are covered by Section 354 of the IPC. It refers to outraging the modesty of a woman by means of assault or criminal force. But it does not directly refer to lewd comments or to assault that is not sexual in nature. 
    
	Lewd remarks are covered by Section 509, but it requires the woman to prove that the accused had an intent to insult her modesty.
    
	Eve-teasing rarely leads to punishment unless a policeman or policewoman happens to witnesses it, an official said.
    
	Several offenders also get away because the victim is unable to prove that the assault was sexual in nature.
    
	The government wants to see if the IPC can be amended to include a special mention of lewd comments, and if the assault law can be tilted in favour of women.
    
	Offences under Section 354 now fall in the bailable category, the reason the men accused of molesting two NRI women in Mumbai on December 31 were granted bail soon after they were arrested. We believe the offence should be made non-bailable, an official said.
    
	The non-bailable nature of the offence is mentioned in an adjunct to the IPC that can be modified through an executive decision.
    
	The National Commission for Women had recently suggested changes to the IPC. It said the punishment for molestation must be made comparable to that for rape, a suggestion ministry officials do not favour. Increasing the punishment will prove futile if we cant catch (and convict) the guilty, an official said.
    
	Seven years is the minimum punishment handed out in most rape cases.
    
	Many women, including foreign tourists, were molested on New Years Eve from Mumbai and Kochi to Delhi and Calcutta. This was followed by an American saying she was groped at a temple in Rajasthans Pushkar and a UK journalist alleging rape in Udaipur.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left call to trash Posco pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan addresses a news conference in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday on the eve of the UPA-Left talk on Indo-US nuclear deal. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 24: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan took a tough stand on the Posco MoU while addressing reporters in the state capital today even as he took a diplomatic stance while facing nuke deal bouncers.        
	Bardhan demanded immediate cancellation of the Posco MoU the government has signed with the South Korean steel major three years ago for setting up the 12MT plant near Paradip.         
	In view of the continued protests, the government should cancel it, Bardhan told reporters today.         
	Bardhan visited the project-affected villages yesterday and addressed a meeting attended by leaders of all non BJD-BJP parties. On Sunday, he addressed an anti-Posco convention in Bhubaneswar, coinciding with the observance of the black week by anti-plant protestors on the occasion of completion of three years of the MoU.         
	The much-hyped project has remained virtually a non-starter with villagers carrying on an agitation opposing the project. Incidentally, the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, the organisation that has been spearheading the anti-plant protests for three years now, is headed by CPI leader Abhay Sahu and the project-affected villages have a large number of party supporters. Bardhan has clarified that his party is not opposed to industrialisation, but is against the projects that effect farmers. He said the villagers are opposing the proposed plant since it would destroy agrarian economy in the area that produces export-variety of betel leaf, prawn and cashew nuts.         
	Nuke deal stance        
	Softening its stand on withdrawing support from the UPA government over the nuclear deal, Bardhan said the Left do not wish to take steps that would strengthen communal and divisive forces.         
	Tomorrow will be a crucial day for the alliance, as a panel comprising UPA-Left members would be meeting over the nuclear deal, said the general secretary.        
	Bardhan added that the members had decided in the last panel meeting that the UPA government would share the text of India-specific safeguards to be placed before the board of governors of the IAEA in its next meeting scheduled in July. But we were not shown the text, not even a para-phrase, he said.         
	If the government comes out with the text tomorrow, the panel will examine the proposal and give its idea. If they dont, we will stick to our position, said the CPI stalwart.         
	When directly confronted with the question on whether the Left would withdraw their support if the UPA government does not show the text, he said: Lets wait till tomorrow to decide. We feel the priority is the question of inflation, not the nuclear deal.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 17: The instant justice spree continued in Bihar as around 12 villagers thrashed two men to death early this morning at Siwan.        
	Police said the incident took place around 4.30am today when the residents of Balia Karampura village, 22km from Siwan and 225km from here, intercepted the victims near the village fields suspecting them to be thieves and thrashed them to death. The victims identified as Mahant Nat and Butan Nat, both in their mid-thirties, belonged to the nautch community.        
	The theft of a pump set of one Saheb Choudhary on the night of April 15 prompted a patrolling system in and around the fields in Balia Karampura. The patrolling team caught the two snooping around the fields this morning.        
	Siwan deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Manoj Tiwari told The Telegraph: The suspects had visited the fields to perhaps shift the stolen pump that they had failed to take away on the night of April 15.        
	Villagers beat the suspects with wooden sticks and fists till one of them succumbed to injuries. Maharajganj sub-divisional police officer Neeraj said: The villagers beat Mahant Nat to death. Butan Nat suffered serious and died before he could reach Siwan Sadar hospital.         
	He added that the villagers had been suspicious of the members of the nautch community ever since they had settled around the village.

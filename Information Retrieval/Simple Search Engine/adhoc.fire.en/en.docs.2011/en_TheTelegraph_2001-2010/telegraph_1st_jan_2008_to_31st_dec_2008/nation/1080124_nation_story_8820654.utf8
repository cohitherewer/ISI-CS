	P.C. Pande will replace K.R. Kaushik, who was appointed the DGP ahead of the elections in the state in December last year.
         
	New Delhi (PTI): The Central Administrative Tribunal has rejected a Jat candidates claim to the job of a Delhi police constable because the community wasnt recognised as a backward class in the capital.

	We need eight weeks to assess the report and take a decision, he told a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishan. The court fixed the next hearing after eight weeks.

	Hyderabad (PTI): A woman allegedly kidnapped a three-day-old boy from a government hospital. The woman had introduced herself as Fatima to the sister of the mother, Amina.

	 Dubai (PTI): An Indian was found dead at a labour camp here on Saturday, police said. Chandran Pillay, 54, was found hanging from the ceiling of his room.

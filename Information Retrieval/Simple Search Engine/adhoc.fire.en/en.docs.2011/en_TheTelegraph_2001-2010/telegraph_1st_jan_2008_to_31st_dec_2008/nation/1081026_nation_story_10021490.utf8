                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Manhunt ends for Menon prize
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Two governments ran a manhunt for him for almost a year although the man was to be found some 3km from the foreign ministry headquarters here.        
	Finally, Hariram Sashtri, relative of late defence minister V.K. Krishna Menon and South Africas Most Wanted Indian, was tracked down last month.        
	Sashtri left for Pretoria on Thursday to receive, on behalf of his great uncle, the highest honour South Africa confers on foreign nationals.        
	The middle-aged businessman, who runs a petrochemical firm in Connaught Place, about 3km from South Block, will be handed the Grand Companion of .R. Tambo in Silver by President Kgalema Motlanthe on October 28.        
	Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru are the previous Indian recipients of the award, given to those who have actively promoted the interests and aspirations of South Africa through outstanding co- operation, solidarity and support.        
	The award was to be given on April 22 this year. But the South African government was keen on handing it to a relative of Menon, Nehrus controversial defence minister and a key figure in independent Indias history.        
	It turned down suggestions that a designated Indian foreign ministry official receive the prize on Menons behalf, sources said. So a hunt began last December for any living relative of Menon. It proved a difficult task.        
	Menon, a freedom fighter and the countrys first high commissioner to the UK, died a bachelor. He had a sister, V.K. Janaki, who too is dead.        
	Janaki had two daughters, V.A. Madhavi Sashtri and V.A. Janaki. Hariram is the son of Madhavi and has two sisters, one of them based in the US and the other in Dubai. V.A. Janaki didnt have any children.        
	Harirams father Akambara Sashtri was the nephew of C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer, diwan of the former princely state of Travancore.         
	Officials said Hariram, who is a bachelor too, approached the South African embassy in New Delhi in September after coming across a news report that there was no one to receive the award on Menons behalf. Frank Chikane, South Africas chancellor of national orders, wrote to Hariram on October 3 inviting him to receive the award.        
	Hariram could not be contacted for comments since he has already left for South Africa. The South African presidency website says Menon has been awarded for excellent contribution to the fight against colonialism and the apartheid system in South Africa. The award includes a walking stick, a neck badge and a lapel rosette.

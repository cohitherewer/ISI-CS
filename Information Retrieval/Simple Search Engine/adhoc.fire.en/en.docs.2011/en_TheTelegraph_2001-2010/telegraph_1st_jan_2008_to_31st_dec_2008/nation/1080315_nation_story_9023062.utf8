The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Goof-up over Sonia plaque
                                                                                                               Goof-up over Sonia plaque

	Hyderabad, March 14: The VIPs had lined up to welcome her, garlands in hand and broad grins on their faces. But someone had forgotten to put Sonia Gandhis name on a plaque when the Congress president arrived to inaugurate an irrigation project in Warangal district.        
	When the authorities realised the faux pas, they hastily took a computer printout with her name and pasted it next to the names of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, Veerappa Moily and other Congress leaders.        
	There was more embarrassment in store for the hosts. A rupture in a pipeline had flooded the area. Sonia, however, carried on with her half-hour tour of the Rs 6,000-crore Devadula lift irrigation project.        
	Over 5,000 policemen stood guard at the site, which is nestled in the heart of the Maoist hinterland.        
	In Hyderabad and the Telengana districts, however, the security blanket could not keep Telugu Desam Party and BJP protesters at bay as they staged dharnas and blocked roads.         
	While the BJP slammed Sonia for keeping mum on the Telengana statehood issue, Desam workers and MLAs protested against the Centres refusal to name the domestic terminal at the GMR airport after N.T. Rama Rao.        
	Sonia addressed a mammoth rally at Jaggampeta, 25km from Rajahmundry. But eight of her supporters could not make it as the overcrowded lorry carrying them turned turtle. Three of them died on the spot and five were injured.         
	Sonia accused the previous NDA government of sowing seeds of disillusionment among farmers, which had triggered a spate of suicides across the country.        
	Dynasty barb        
	As the Congress celebrated Sonia Gandhis 10 years as its president, L.K. Advani found an occasion to attack her.         
	How brazenly an entire party has been appropriated and made into a family fief, and how slavishly Congressmen have resigned themselves to this appropriation, is one of the sad developments in Indias political evolution, he said.        
	Advani was speaking at a media conclave, where the subject for discussion was: How the BJPs leadership differs from that of the Congress.         
	This is not the first time the BJP leader has attacked the Congress or the partys first family for dynastic rule. But as his partys candidate for Prime Minister, Advani packed in more bite.         
	There is a reservation policy for the top slot in the Congress party: it is reserved in perpetuity for members of the Nehru family, he said.

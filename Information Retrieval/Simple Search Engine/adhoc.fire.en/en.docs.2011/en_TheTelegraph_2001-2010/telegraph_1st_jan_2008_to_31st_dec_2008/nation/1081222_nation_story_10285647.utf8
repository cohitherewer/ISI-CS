                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hit on Imphal Raj Bhavan
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, Dec. 21: Militants lobbed two grenades at Raj Bhavan from a highway today and fled, continuing their hide-and-seek with the 500 security personnel guarding the Manipur capital.        
	Lobbed around 6pm, only one of the grenades exploded a cricket pitchs length away from Raj Bhavans main gates and 150 metres from the governors residence  hurting no one. Governor Gurbachan Jagat is away in Delhi.        
	Only a few tree branches fell, a Raj Bhavan source said. We found the two grenade pins on the highway, a police officer said.        
	The Lanheiba group of the Kangleipak Communist Party, which wants to liberate Manipur, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group had set off the October 21 blast in Ragailong village that killed 18 persons and wounded 40.        
	This is the first rebel strike on the CRPF-guarded Raj Bhavan, though chief minister Ibobi Singhs residence has faced two attacks this year. Neither the CRPF guards nor the police picket near the gates saw anything suspicious. The posh and normally busy Nitaipat locality in the heart of the city was almost deserted when the attack happened.        
	Businessman Ramu Singh, who lives on the third floor of a four-storey building behind Raj Bhavan, said he had heard a loud sound. It was so loud, I initially thought there was a blast in our building.        
	Imphal crawls with police, CRPF, India Reserve Battalion and Assam Rifles personnel.        
	The attack came a day after another rebel group, the Kangleipak Communist Party (Lalumba), held talks with the government. Another 19 outfits have struck cease-fire deals. A source said todays attack was probably an indication that the Lanheiba group too wanted talks.        
	An Assam Rifles officer said grenades were available at Rs 5,000 each in Imphals underground arms bazaar.

	Bhubaneswar, July 15: Sand artist Sudarshan Pattnaik will find his mention in the Limca Book of Records for the third time next year for being the first Indian to win the world champion title twice at the USF World Double Championship in Berlin.        
	On the second year of the championship, the artist created a 25ft high sculpture based on the theme of global warming depicting a polar bear sitting on a globe and praying with three faces representing Africa, Europe and Asia supporting the base.        
	My second win is a dream come true. I am glad that I could make my country proud twice, said the artist, adding that Bijay Ghosh, the editor of the Limca Book of Records, confirmed the news last evening.         
	After Sudarshan returned from the USF championship, Union tourism minister Ambika Soni approached Sudarshan to don the cap of the Orissa brand ambassador for its Incredible India campaign.         
	Talks have not been finalised yet, but we did have a discussion, said Sudarshan.         
	The ministry wishes that I promote the Incredible India campaign when I participate in international meets, he added. So far, his global warming theme has been taken to 37 countries.         
	I have requested the government to recognise sand form as a genuine art. I have also pleaded the government to mull a sand park near Puri, where many such sculptures may be displayed. The ministry officials have assured me of discussing the matter, he said. Sudarshan has participated in 37 international championships and has won in a number of them. After fulfilling his dreams of creating 100 sandy Taj Mahal, Sudarshan now wants to concentrate on the issue of global warming.         
	Global warming is a matter of concern for the entire world, including Orissa. I have approached the UN asking their help in this regard, he added. The artist is expected to carry the world champion title for a period of a year.        
	Earlier, Sudarshans exhibition on the theme of Jesus Christ on the Puri beach in 2007 and the one on Santa Claus in 2006 had received a mention in the Limca books.        
	Made of 600 tonnes of sand, the sculpture of Jesus Christ on the Puri beach in Christmas 2007 was 60ft long.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 17: The three Gujarat schools that lost 41 students yesterday in a bus accident opened after prayer meetings this morning but anger simmered among villagers over the rickety vehicles they are forced to take.        
	The Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation bus involved in the accident was not roadworthy, leader of Opposition Shaktisinh Gohil said.         
	According to the rules, buses that have covered 8 lakh km are considered no longer roadworthy and have to be scrapped, he said. This bus, Gohil added, had done 11.3 lakh km. The Vadodara depot to which the bus belonged does not have maintenance facilities.         
	Most rickety buses ply in rural areas where they suffer more wear and tear because of poor roads. Government buses are the only means of travel for most villagers.        
	The bus had plunged into the 60-foot-deep Narmada main canal as the driver lost control while trying to overtake a truck. It was ferrying the students, all from Classes VIII and IX, to Bodeli for the last paper of their annual exam. The exam will now be held tomorrow.        
	The driver, conductor and an elderly lady also died in the crash.        
	Over 700 people from Bodeli, 75km east of Vadodara, and the villages that lost their children  Bamroli, Samdhi, Suryaghoda and Patana  gathered for a condolence meeting today. Union minister of state for railways Naran Rathwa was present.        
	Education minister Raman Vohra, tribal development minister Mangu Patel and his deputy Jaswant Bhabhor individually met the bereaved families to offer condolences. Patel said they came across angry people in Bamroli village, which lost 15 girls.         
	Yesterday, many villagers had threatened not to accept compensation announced by the government. Their anger is understandable. We told them that we are with them, said Patel. But later they accepted the ex gratia amount of Rs 1.5 lakh.         
	Sensing the anger among the people, the corporation kept its buses off the roads on the Vadodara-Chhotaudepur route. Bodelilies en route.        
	The committee headed by H.K. Das, principal secretary (transport), which has been asked to investigate the accident and submit a report within a week, is yet to start work.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 22: Intellectuals from Orissa today demanded that the MoU inked between Vedanta Foundation and Orissa government be scrapped as it was a sham. 
    
	In July 2006, the Orissa government had signed an MoU with the company to set up a Rs 15,000-crore Vedanta University, that would be on a par with Stanford, Oxford or Harvard university. 
    
	The university plans to offer graduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes on a variety of disciplines including liberal arts, basic sciences, engineering, medicine, law, business and performing arts.
    
	The protest group comprising former Orissa advocate-general Jayant Das, former additional chief secretary P.K. Mishra and trade union leader Nalini Ranjan Pati said the Vedanta Foundation (the trustees for the university) has been registered as a company when it should have been registered as a society. 
    
	The foundation is run by four members from the Anil Agarwals family, including Agarwal himself and their personal liability do not extend beyond Rs 5,000. How can the government give 8000-odd acres to a company and people whose personal liabilities are so low? asked Das. 
    
	He added that it was surprising how the state government was going all out to help the company when the Supreme Court in its judgement last month had cast doubts about its credibility. 
    
	Das added, a body that wishes to build a university has not found time to submit a project report so far. This is strange. The MoU is set to expire in June 2008. So what are they waiting for? he asked.
    
	While the state is yet to pass an act for National Law University, why is it in a hurry for the Vedanta project? The members of the Assembly should think whether they are mere rubber stamps for the Naveen government, he said.
    
	Puri residents who are likely to be affected by the proposed university also demanded that the state stop land acquisition immediately.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 2: Perturbed by an increasing backlog of pending cases relating to atrocities on members of SC and ST communities, the government has urged the Centre to sanction more special courts for speedy trials.         
	The demand was made at a recent conference held in Agartala to review the implementation of Prevention of Atrocities on SC/ST Communities Act, which was attended by Union social justice and empowerment minister Meera Kumar.        
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra, who attended the conference, conceded that he had put forth the proposal for more courts there.         
	At present 3,370 cases related to atrocities on SC/ST communities are pending in the state, he said. The government has notified 52 courts as special ones to deal exclusively with SC/ST cases. But, these are not adequately equipped to dispose of the cases, Mishra admitted.         
	Another factor that had led to the backlog was the dearth of senior police officers in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP).         
	According to provisions in the Prevention of Atrocities on SC/ST Communities Act, a joint investigation into such cases has to be made by a police officer in the rank of a DSP and an executive magistrate. But there are only 197 DSPs in Orissa.         
	Mishra has also requested the Union social justice and empowerment minister to suitably amend the act to empower police inspectors to conduct the joint investigation.         
	Meera Kumar reportedly gave her consent to think on such lines.        
	Orissa has a preponderant (38.66 per cent) SC and ST population. While the tribal population accounts for 22.13 per cent of the total population, the percentage of SC communities is 16.53 per cent. Majority of the scheduled communities is economically weak and often illiterate, which leads to exploitation.

          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 11: The protracted farmers trouble in and around the sick Marhowrah sugar factory in Chapra took a turn today when railway minister Lalu Prasad threatened to expose what he called a high-level collusion stalling the mill re-opening process.         
	I will expose the people who have cheated farmers in my constituency, said Lalu Prasad, while talking to The Telegraph from New Delhi.        
	Everyone knows who had been to Marhowrah to lure innocent farmers and had asked them to grow sugarcane in December 2006, while promising to open the factory by 2007-08, the minister added.         
	The RJD boss was referring to his rival and high-profile BJP spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudi, who in collaboration with the UP-based JHV Distillery and Sugar Limited, had asked Marhowrah farmers to grow sugarcane over 65,000 acres.         
	But, the RJD chief suspects, they did not turn up to re-open the factory on the promised time because a financial deal between Rudi and the JVH chairman, Jawahar Jaiswal, had gone awry. Its difficult for me to tolerate the fact that farmers in my constituency got cheated. I will expose the deal and collusion, Lalu stressed.         
	Lalu Prasad had defeated Rajiv Pratap Rudi on the Chapra Lok Sabha seat in 2004.         
	The Nitish Kumar government, too, sensing the gravity of the issue, had issued a show cause yesterday to the JHV management for its failure to re-open the sick mill. The government had fixed April 20 as the last date for the latter to furnish a reply. Also, the government has ordered sugarcane commissioner Bhrigunath Upadhyaya to probe into the matter.         
	The NDA dispensation is also aware of the political damage the stir can cause and that it is a veritable weapon in Lalu Prasads hands.         
	Meanwhile, Marhowrah farmers continued to burn sugarcane and stage dharna and demonstrations, against Rudi and Jaiswal almost everyday. Our desperation heightens everyday with no signs of the BJP leader (Rudi) and Jaiswal coming up to explain what went wrong, said N.K. Singh, the president of the struggle forum.         
	The Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction had settled assets and liability of the closed mill at Marhowrah to JHV Limited in 2006.         
	Rudi and Jawahar Jaiswal and state ministers had then announced the factory take over to a farmers assemblage in December. It was then that they suggested that sugarcane be grown in fields around the mill and supply it to the factory when it becomes operational in 2007.

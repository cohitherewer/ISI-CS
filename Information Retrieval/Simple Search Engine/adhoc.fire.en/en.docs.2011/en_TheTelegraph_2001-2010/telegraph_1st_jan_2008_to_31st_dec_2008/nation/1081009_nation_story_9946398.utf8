	Mumbai, Oct. 8 (PTI): Bank customers will now be able to credit and debit money from mobile phones.         
	The RBI today approved mobile banking norms with immediate effect.         
	Core banking solutions-enabled banks will be allowed to offer mobile banking services to customers having debit or credit cards, the regulator said.        
	However, the banks will not be allowed to use mobile banking services for cross-border transfers. Initially, the banks will be allowed to offer up to Rs 5,000 per customer for funds transfer and Rs 10,000 per customer for transactions involving purchase of goods or services a day.        
	The banks can put in place a monthly transaction limit, depending on the credit profile of the customer.        
	The customers will have to register with banks to use the mobile service. Documents and physical presence of the customers will be mandatory for registration.         
	The banks should communicate complete details of the mobile service to the customers at the time of registration, the RBI said.         
	The banks will also have to insure themselves against the risk of unauthorised transfers.

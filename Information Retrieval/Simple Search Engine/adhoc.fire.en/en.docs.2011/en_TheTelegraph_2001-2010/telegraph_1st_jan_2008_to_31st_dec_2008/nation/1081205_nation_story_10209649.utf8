	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Americas top military official has urged India to collaborate with Pakistan in investigating the Mumbai attacks.         
	Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said during a series of meetings with defence minister A.K. Antony and top officials today the US was serious in pursuing Pakistan to co-operate in the investigations, a defence ministry official said.        
	Other than Antony, Mullen met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta, who is also chairman of the chiefs of the staff committee.        
	Later, the US embassy put out a statement saying Mullen had urged all parties in India and in Pakistan to collaborate against the increasingly sophisticated threat of militant extremism in South Asia.         
	In Islamabad yesterday, Mullen had told President Asif Ali Zardari and army chief Ashfaq Kayani their country must aggressively investigate all possible ties of groups based in Pakistan.

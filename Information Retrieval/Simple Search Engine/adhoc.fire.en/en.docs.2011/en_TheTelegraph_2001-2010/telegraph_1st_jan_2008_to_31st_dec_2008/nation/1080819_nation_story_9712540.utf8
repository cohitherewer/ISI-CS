          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, Aug. 18: The Indo-US nuclear deal may go into a coma in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) unless Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rolls up his kurta sleeves and launches a personal diplomatic blitzkrieg to neutralise opposition within the group to a clean exemption for New Delhi from NSG guidelines for nuclear commerce.        
	The UPA governments current strategy of relying on the Bush administration to deliver the goods for India appears unlikely to produce the results that New Delhi is seeking for a variety of reasons.        
	A majority of NSG members are resentful that the US is trying to pressure them into a second meeting of the group in the first week of September even before the outcome of their first meeting on August 21 is clear.        
	Most members want a second NSG meeting regarding India, if one were needed, between September 21 and 29, not in the first week of September as proposed by the Bush administration.        
	A meeting towards September-end will upset the Bush administrations time-table to send the nuclear deal package back to the US Congress as soon as it reconvenes here on September 8.        
	Sources in Vienna said the dominant view there was that it makes better sense to have a second NSG meeting planned around the regular session of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors on September 21 and the 52nd IAEA general conference, also to be held in Vienna from September 29 to October 4.        
	Most NSG members feel this will give doubters within the group over the India-specific exemption enough time to discuss the issue threadbare in their capitals.        
	The two IAEA meetings will also bring the heads of atomic energy agencies of major countries to Vienna in the last 10 days of September.         
	These agency heads are more competent to deal with the India-specific exemption than resident ambassadors in Vienna who would otherwise represent their countries at any special meeting of the NSG in early September.        
	Diplomats in Vienna said the stalemate that is building over a second NSG meeting can only be broken if the Prime Minister picks up the phone and personally talks to his counterparts in a majority of NSG states, especially the ones that have reservations about the US draft that will be considered by the group on August 21.        
	India has sent a number of envoys around the globe to lobby its case with NSG member states for a clean exemption. But these are mostly secretaries in South Block and, in some cases, retired secretaries who have been contracted to see the nuclear deal through.        
	Sources in Vienna said such an initiative falls far short of the political intervention that is required if New Delhi wants to see the exemption for India quickly approved by the NSG.        
	One source in New Delhi compared the current state of Indian lobbying in the NSG to the half-hearted South Block effort to get Shashi Tharoor elected in 2006 as UN secretary general.        
	Like now, New Delhis inability to launch an all-out diplomatic push at the Prime Ministers level sank Tharoors candidacy.        
	There is bewilderment in Vienna that the UPA government is not using the services of the last two Indian governors to the IAEA in the effort to lobby the NSG. More so since the incumbent governor, Saurabh Kumar, is content to merely play second fiddle to the US permanent representative to the IAEA, Gregory Schulte, in seeing the nuclear deal through at the IAEA and the NSG.        
	Although T.P. Sreenivasan, who was Kumars predecessor once removed, has retired, he maintains excellent contacts with the non-proliferation world, visits Vienna regularly as part of Track II diplomacy and his book was released in the Austrian capital recently by IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei.        
	Kumars immediate predecessor, Sheel Kant Sharma, now secretary general of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, has equally good contacts in Vienna that date back to his disarmament work in Geneva from 1983, his six years on deputation to the IAEA, his direct involvement in nuclear issues as joint secretary for disarmament in South Block and subsequent tenure as Indias IAEA governor until recently.

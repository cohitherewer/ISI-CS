	Imphal, March 17: Seven bodies, with their hands tied behind their backs and bullet wounds in their heads, were found lying on a road near a paddy field in Manipurs Imphal West district this evening.        
	A message written on the back of their shirts said: Go back to your home states.        
	Police, who reached the spot at 7.30pm, an hour after the incident, said the victims could be labourers as they wore tattered clothes and sandals.         
	Some non-Manipuri labourers from the district reached the site in Heiyen Hangoon around 8pm after coming to know about the killings, but could not identify the bodies. Residents told the police that unknown persons had brought the seven to the place.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet seal on new poll map
                                                                                                               Cabinet seal on new poll map

	New Delhi, Feb. 14: All elections, starting with those in Karnataka, will be held on the basis of redrawn constituencies, the Union cabinet has decided.        
	The only exceptions will be Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland, which are going to polls later this month and in early March.        
	The Delimitation Commission, headed by Justice Kuldip Singh, has drawn the new boundaries on the basis of the 2001 census. A result of the rejig will be an increase in the seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The number of seats in urban areas will also go up.        
	However, the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha (543) and Assemblies will stay unchanged because of the 42nd amendment to the Constitution in 1976. The law has frozen the numbers on the ground that states with lower population growth will lose out to those with more people.        
	The new map will not include Assam, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland because the delimitation exercise has been challenged in courts there. As of now, it will cover 24 states and Union territories.        
	A cabinet recommendation to issue a notification on the delimitation panels proposals has been sent to the President. An official said the notification could come soon after the election results in the three Northeast states. There will be no delay.        
	The cabinet also approved a proposal to supersede the 1976 Delimitation Order and amend the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1950, in line with the new changes, primarily those related to the SC/ST seats.         
	Congress sources said the litmus test for the countrys new political map would be in Karnataka, where SC seats have risen from 36 to 39 and those for STs from two to 13. Presidents rule in the state ends in May. In the normal course, elections in the state should be held this summer but the Congress is apparently determined to use the pretext of delimitation to prolong central rule.        
	Parliament can pass a law, with a simple majority, allowing the extension.        
	The rise in the number of urban seats will also create ripples in Maharashtra, where the calculations of city-centred parties like the Shiv Sena and Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena could be upset by the presence of north Indian migrants. A gainer could be Mayavatis BSP, helped by more SC/ST seats.        
	Mamata turf        
	Mamata Banerjee will be among the MPs who will have to grapple with the readjusted boundaries. She is staring at the prospect of an increase in the number of seats in the suburbs of Calcutta at the cost of those in the city, which remains the bastion of her Trinamul Congress.         
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee (from Bolpur) could also be affected. Others on the list are S. Jaipal Reddy, A.R. Antulay, Sachin Pilot, Jitin Prasada, Dharmendra and Raj Babbar.        
	Reddys Miriyalaguda seat in Andhra Pradesh will merge with the Nalagonda constituency. The seats of Pilot and Prasada will be reserved for SCs, forcing the young MPs to hunt for new pastures.

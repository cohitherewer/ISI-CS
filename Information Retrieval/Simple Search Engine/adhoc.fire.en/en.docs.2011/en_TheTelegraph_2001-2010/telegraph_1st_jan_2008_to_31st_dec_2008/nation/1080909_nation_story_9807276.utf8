          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, Sept. 8: Schools and colleges in Bamara have been closed for the past three days after more than 60 people, including 17 students, were injured because of dog bite.        
	Residents of Bamara, 120km from here, are facing difficult time with the street dogs spreading terror since the past five days. People are so much scared that they prefer to stay inside homes to save lives, sources said. Most of the people leave homes with sticks in hand.        
	According to the sources, the problem began on September 3 and continued till today. When it came to the notice of the administration, precautionary measures were taken but of little benefit with a fresh case of dog bite reported this morning. Feeling gravity of the situation, the district administration instructed closure of all schools and colleges for three days, said Sambalpur collector Pradipta Kumar Patnaik.        
	However, persons experienced with dog catching have been sent to Bamra from Kuchinda NAC and Sambalpur municipality.         
	They are catching dogs with abnormal behaviour, Patnaik said.         
	All the people, including 17 students, had been administered anti-rabies injections and they were quite well now, Sambalpur chief medical officer P.K. Nayak said.        
	Kuchinda sub-collector Bibhuti Bhusan Behera is monitoring the operation there. It is further learnt that one mad dog has been killed today, Bamara resident Pramod Kumar Naik said. It is difficult to identify only two-three dogs out of hundreds who bite human being. This is a real problem for us, the collector said.         
	Still with help of veterinary doctors we are trying to identify mad dogs, Behera said.

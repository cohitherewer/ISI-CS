	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 13: Normal life was paralysed in five southern districts, including Kandhamal, as the Left parties  CPI(ML), CPI(ML) New Democracy, CPI(ML) Liberation, SUCI and Samajwadi Jana Parishad  today observed a dawn-to-dusk bandh protesting against communal violence.        
	Vehicles stayed off the roads and shutters were downed at various places in Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Kandhamal and Ganjam districts, where the parties had called the bandh.         
	Security measures were tightened as bandh supporters blocked roads at several locations in the districts.         
	Schools and business establishments remained closed while transportation was affected.        
	The bandh passed off peacefully and there had been adequate arrangements to avoid any untoward incident, deputy inspector-general of police (southern range) R.P. Koche said.        
	At Phulbani, shops were closed and vehicles kept off the roads at other places, including Daringbadi, Bramhanigaon, Raikia, Tumudibandha areas.        
	The 12-hour bandh was called demanding compensation to the victims, arrest of the accused and release of the innocent.        
	The ripple of the bandh was felt at Rayagada, Gunupur, Padmapur, Muniguda, Gajapati, Kashinagar, Guma and Parlakhemundi where protesters blocked roads and burnt tyres. CPI(ML) state secretary Khitish Biswal claimed that the bandh was a total success.        
	The Swami Laxamananda Saraswati Shradhanjali Samiti has announced a mass rally here starting today.

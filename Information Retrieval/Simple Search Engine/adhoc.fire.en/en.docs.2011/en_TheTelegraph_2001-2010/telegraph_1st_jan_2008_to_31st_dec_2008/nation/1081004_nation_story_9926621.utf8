          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 3: The Tatas have drawn up an interim plan to manufacture the Nano from a couple of existing plants till such time as they select a site that will house the new mother plant for the small car.        
	The first few Nanos will be made at the plant at Pimpri, near Pune, where it already makes the Indica.        
	There are two other plants that can immediately churn out the Nano. The first is the one at Ranjangaon that was opened on April 2. This unit is part of a joint venture between Fiat Spa of Italy and Tata Motors.        
	Last November, the Tatas had signed a joint venture agreement with Fiat to establish a Rs 4,000-crore facility from which the two carmakers would roll out Fiat and Tata models. This plant will also make engines and power trains.        
	The second plant is at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand, where the Tatas now make the Ace  the sub one-tonne pick-up that has been very popular with transporters.        
	Observers say the company may start by making a few hundred cars at each plant and then ramp up production sometime next year when the new facility is ready.        
	The Tatas had always denied that there was an active Plan B just in case Mamata Banerjee torpedoed the Singur project. However, Ratan Tata made it clear today that they would stick to the deadline to launch the Nano on schedule.        
	The company has been very cagey about the launch date for the Nano but many believe that it will roll out this month.        
	The company is under some pressure to launch the worlds cheapest car before Suzuki Motor launches the A-Star  its fifth global car model, which was showcased in Paris yesterday.        
	Speculation about the alternative sites had mounted after Tata said the company would have no qualms about pulling the plug on the Singur project if the opposition to the project continued.        
	Till the company identifies the site for the mother plant, it is good strategy to use the existing sites since it will at least ensure the rollout of the Nano, one analyst said.         
	He added that Tata Motors should not be worried about the pricing for Nano since state governments are likely to offer tax breaks and other incentives.        
	Although the Pantnagar and the Maharashtra facilities were often touted as the likely destinations, Karnataka joined the race last month when its chief minister offered to house the project.        
	Incidentally, Tata Motors has a facility in Dharwad  in alliance with Marco Polo of Brazil  where it plans to make luxury buses. One of the selling points of the state is the strong auto component base there.        
	Latest reports suggest that Tata Motors may also be looking at Gujarat as a possible site for the mother plant. When Ratan Tata was in Ahmedabad last year to attend a programme to showcase the state, he had made headlines when he said: It is stupid if you are not in Gujarat.

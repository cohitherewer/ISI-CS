	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 2: BJP president Rajnath Singh today accused the Maharashtra government of indulging in partisan politics by blaming the Malegaon blast to Hindu terrorists.        
	BJP condemns terrorism. But in this case, blaming the Malegaon blast exclusively on Hindu terrorists is politically motivated, given the fact that Maharashtra is ruled by the Congress, said the BJP chief while addressing a news conference here today.        
	When the UPA all along has been insisting that terrorists have no religion, then why its silent on Maharashtra governments attempt to link the conspirators of Malegaon blast to Hindu terror? he asked.        
	Rajnath, who was in the city to address the partys Vijay Sankalpa Samavesh, said: Apparently, the Maharashtra government did not have any solid proof against the accused. If you have sufficient evidence, come out with it. But dont target the innocent for narrow political gains.        
	He added that there should not be mass-scale religious conversion and freedom of religion should not be misused. He demanded that the Orissa Freedom of Religion Act should be enforced strictly and if necessary, the central government should enact a national legislation to prevent conversion by force or allurement.         
	Condemning the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, Rajnath said the judicial probe should be conducted on time-bound manner. Rajnath, however, disagreed with chief minister Naveen Patnaik who branded VHP and Bajrang Dal fundamentalist outfits.

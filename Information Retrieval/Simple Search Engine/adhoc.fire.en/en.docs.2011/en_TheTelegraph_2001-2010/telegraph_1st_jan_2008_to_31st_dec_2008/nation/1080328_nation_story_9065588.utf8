The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll officer sent to jail 
                                                                                                               Poll officer sent to jail 
                            
	Mumbai, March 27: Maharashtra election commissioner Nand Lal was arrested this evening and sent to jail for two days after the Assembly approved a breach-of-privilege motion against him.        
	Lal, a former bureaucrat who assumed his current office in June 2004, accused chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh of vendetta. The chief minister had tried to influence the delimitation process in Latur (Deshmukhs seat), and I refused to yield to pressure.        
	Under the delimitation exercise, Latur is likely to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes.        
	The motion was moved by a Congress MLA in 2006, alleging Lal had bypassed a bill by ordering that local body polls be held under his supervision. Sources said though the Constitution empowered the poll panel to conduct local polls, the government had drafted a bill vesting the powers in itself. It is yet to be passed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi must for talks: Morcha

	Darjeeling, June 28: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said it was no longer interested in bipartite meetings with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and insisted that the Gorkhaland issue could only be solved by the Centre.        
	Binay Tamang, Morcha publicity secretary, told The Telegraph the party had attended yesterdays meeting in Calcutta mainly to honour the chief ministers initiative for a dialogue.        
	The state government doesnt want to look beyond autonomy, but we too are firm about Gorkhaland, Tamang said. The impasse can end only through a tripartite meeting. We are no longer interested in bipartite talks with Bhattacharjee.        
	Yesterday, the chief minister had said he was not against tripartite talks but insisted that more bipartite meetings were needed to work out a political solution before bringing Delhi into the picture. He had ruled out the Morchas demand for a Gorkhaland state.        
	In Calcutta, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said the state government should make a fresh assessment on the hills situation before deciding whether to implement the Sixth Schedule.        
	The Morcha has relaxed its indefinite bandh till July 5 but the agitation is going strong with students continuing to join a relay hunger strike since Thursday in support of statehood.        
	The Gorkha Janmukti Astai Karmachari Sangtan  a frontal organisation of the Morcha  too began a fast unto death in Darjeeling today. Seven of its members are sitting on hunger strike before the district magistrates office, demanding immediate regularisation of the 8,000 DGHC workers hired on six-month contracts that expire on June 30.        
	DGHC officials had earlier said the process of regularisation would start soon but would take at least a year.        
	We are worried because there is no official communication on this from the state government despite the DGHC having forwarded the proposal to Calcutta on June 20, Sangtan president M. Subba said.        
	Although DGHC officials have assured us verbally that the contract system would be done away with and a fresh agreement signed, we have not received anything in writing.        
	Sources said that DGHC officials were likely to meet the workers on Monday to discuss a solution.

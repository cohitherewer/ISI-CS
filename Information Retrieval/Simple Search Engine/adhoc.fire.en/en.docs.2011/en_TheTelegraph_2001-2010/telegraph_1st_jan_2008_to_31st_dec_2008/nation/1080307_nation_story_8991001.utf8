The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress fights back with pride
                                                                                                               Congress fights back with pride
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 6: The Congress today suggested the Left would hurt national pride if it brought down the government on the nuclear deal.        
	Spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily warned the CPM and its allies that if they withdrew support to the UPA, they would have to explain to the people why they had aborted their mandate.        
	Is it their (the Lefts) mandate to shoot down national pride? By pulling down this government, do they want to frustrate that which was achieved with diplomacy and hard work? That is not their mandate. The nuclear deal will have to happen, he said.        
	The comments followed a blunt message from the Left today: proceed with the deal at the governments peril.        
	God forbid, if the NDA comes to power and agrees to settle for a deal which will offer 50 per cent less than what our government has extracted. Does the Left want that? Do they want a communal party like the BJP to come back? What is their agenda? Moily asked.        
	He advised the Left to look at Indias power situation. Shortage of fuel was leading to power cuts, he said, and pointed out that the agreement would help address the problem. Does the Left want the industrial and rural sectors to starve for want of power?        
	Sources said the move to hit back with national pride came in response to the Lefts oft-repeated contention that the deal lacked legitimacy because it had not been sanctioned by a majority of Parliaments members.        
	Moily said trade agreements did not need to be ratified by Parliament. They are a question of national pride. Till today, no convention or the Constitution, for that matter, requires trade agreements to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.         
	Does the Left want a constitutional crisis which will affect Indias standing? No country will believe us. This is not a question of false prestige of the Congress, the Prime Minister or the UPA. It is national pride.        
	He ruled out a rethink. There will not be a mid-course review. To withdraw from a stand on a trade agreement has never happened in the country.        
	The Congress leader protested the use of the word deal and maintained that it was a trade agreement which would open up nuclear commerce with over 40 countries, an allusion to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.        
	But he refused to consider the Lefts latest push as a threat or an ultimatum. We call it concern. The Left has not been unreasonable. They did not obstruct the discussions with IAEA, he said. It is good that the Left has opened up minute details of the deal to the nation as everything was done with their knowledge and consultation.

	Watch loss tops cops case list    
	Police in the city might find a place in the record books when it comes to unresolved cases of rape, dacoity, theft and so on. But when a former top cop loses a watch, the same lethargic force goes on an overdrive.     
	Nearly four teams recently went looking for an Omega wristwatch that former director-general of police (DGP) Swaranjit Sen had lost. He had filed a case on April 24.    
	The flamboyant former cop had left the watch behind in a washroom in Kakatiya Sheraton Hotel. When he went back, it was gone.     
	Sen lodged a complaint at the Punjagutta police station, putting the officers on their toes.     
	The hotel also appointed a private detective to trace the watch, expected to cost over Rs 1 lakh.     
	Clueless even after a week, the police have decided to approach the state forensic lab for a polygraph test on the six hotel staff identified as suspects.     
	Sen, who retired in December 2006, is known for dealing with Maoists with a firm hand and wiping out their presence in the Nallamala forests.

	Dont know how many times Akhilesh Shukla has watched Sholay, but he did a Dharmendra in the capital recently.    
	If Sholays Veeru wanted to win Basantis hand, Shukla, an Uttar Pradesh resident, wanted to draw the governments attention to his neglected state.     
	Shukla scaled a 50-metre-high water tank in south Delhis Hazrat Nizmuddin and started shouting slogans against the Centre for targeting Uttar Pradesh chief minsiter Mayavati.    
	Policemen and the crowd that had gathered at the spot pleaded with Shukla to get down.    
	It took almost three-and-a-half hours of persuasion to make him relent. Once on the ground, the police immediately took him into custody.

	Never cheat on your wife, and if you do, dont leave any tell-tale evidence at home.    
	A 36-year-old man learnt this the hard way and is now ruing his mistake in prison.     
	The self-proclaimed doctor, who had been running a clinic at Virugambakkam for several years, had married a woman in 2007 without telling her he already had a wife.     
	The second wife found out when she stumbled on a photograph of the first while rummaging through the mans suitcase.    
	She also found documents revealing that he had not cleared the final-year MBBS exams.    
	Furious, the woman headed straight to the local police station and spilled the beans, about both his private and professional life. He was put behind bars soon after.

	NYU in town    
	New York Universitys Leonard Stern School of Business plans to open a study-abroad programme in Mumbai by January 2009.    
	The school will tie up with St Xaviers College and HR College of Commerce in south Mumbai.     
	After Shanghai, which has a full-fledged study-abroad site, Mumbai would be the second city to host such a facility in Asia.     
	The programme will have 40 Stern students travelling to Mumbai, an internal announcement by the university said.     
	More than 100 years old, the Stern School of Business was named after its alumnus Leonard Stern, who gifted the Greenwich Village-based school $30 million in 1988.

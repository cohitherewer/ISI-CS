          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           St Stephens College                                   
	New Delhi, March 22: St Stephens College has rescinded the controversial reservation for Dalit Christians introduced last year by the then acting principal, Reverend Valson Thampu, days after he resigned.         
	The college on Thursday declared all administrative policy decisions taken during Thampus tenure null and void, explaining the unprecedented move as a desire to start with a clean slate.         
	The college has never before taken the step of rescinding all administrative decisions under a former principal in its 127-year history.         
	St Stephens also announced that six administrators appointed by Thampu had resigned following the reverends decision to quit office on March 14.         
	The decision to introduce the quota in addition to the seats reserved for Christians in general, implemented during the 2007-08 admissions, had caused fissures in the college.        
	Thampu had justified the move to reserve 10 per cent seats for Dalit Christians as a progressive initiative aimed at challenging the exclusive nature of the traditionally elite college.         
	Thirty per cent seats are reserved for general category Christians, taking last years figure for Christian quotas up to 40 per cent.         
	Many senior faculty members had criticised Thampus policy, accusing him of diluting standards at St Stephens.         
	Under Anil Wilson, Thampus predecessor, students applying for reserved seats were not considered if their Plus II marks were lower than the general cut-off by over 15 per cent. So, if the cut-off for general students in a subject was 90 per cent, those applying under the Christian quota needed at least 75 per cent marks to be considered. Thampu changed this practice.         
	The Supreme Council  the highest decision-making body  said Thampus policies had been revoked to assure fresh candidates for the post of principal that the college wanted to move on.

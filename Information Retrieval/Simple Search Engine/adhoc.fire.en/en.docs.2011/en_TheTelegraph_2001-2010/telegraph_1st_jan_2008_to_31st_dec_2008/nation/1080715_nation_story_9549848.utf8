          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 14: India today hastened to warn against a reported US plan to back an Israeli strike on Iran, betraying eagerness to please a new-found friend in need.        
	The foreign ministry didnt name America but its reaction followed reports in a British newspaper yesterday that Washington had asked Tel Aviv to prepare for an attack on Irans main nuclear sites if talks over Tehrans nuclear programme broke down.        
	Usually, the government relies on sources other than newspaper reports to comment on issues affecting other countries.        
	The emphatic response to a news report has come at a time the Samajwadi Party, which counts a sizeable number of Muslims as its voters, has promised to bail the government out over the US nuclear deal that some say is unacceptable to the minority community. Iran had last week test-launched medium-range ballistic missiles that it claimed were capable of striking Israel.        
	The news report said US President George W. Bush had given Israel an amber light to start preparing for a possible offensive with long-range weapons. Amber means get on with your preparations, stand by for immediate attack and tell us when youre ready, a Pentagon official was quoted as saying.        
	Delhi said this amounted to unacceptable international behaviour that would have disastrous consequences.        
	India is gravely concerned at these statements threatening use of military force against Iran, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.  
	Delhi will on Friday brief the IAEA board of governors in Vienna on the India-specific safeguards agreement, sources said. The board is likely to hold a formal meeting on the agreement on August 1. Its approval is essential for the Indo-US nuclear deal to be implemented.

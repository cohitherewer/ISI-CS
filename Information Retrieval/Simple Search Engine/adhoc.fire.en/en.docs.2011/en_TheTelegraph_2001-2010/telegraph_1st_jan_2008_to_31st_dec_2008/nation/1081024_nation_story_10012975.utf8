	London, Oct. 23: The UK-India film co-production treaty, under which Indian producers qualify for tax concessions in Britain, became operational yesterday, with Barbara Follett, the new British movie minister, appearing on the set of London Dreams with one of its stars, Ajay Devgan.        
	A spokesperson for Follett said: Salman Khan was supposed to be there as well but failed to turn up.        
	Thats not unusual for Salman , who had also failed to turn up for the Zee Cine Awards in London in April this year after the show had been heavily promoted with posters bearing his picture.        
	Follett is getting to know the ways of Bollywood.        
	Asin did turn up, said the spokesperson, referring to the south Indian actress now working in Bollywood, but she was fashionably late.        
	The formal celebration of the treaty took place in Trafalgar Square.        
	Although London Dreams  Vipul Shahs new venture after Namastey London and Singh is Kinng  does not qualify for benefits because the treaty was not in force when filming began, the set was used for todays programme.        
	Under the treatys terms, any Indian filmmaker who wants to collaborate with a British producer will have access to a range of benefits, including tax breaks, sources of funding and practical support.        
	British sources said they expected 10 extra projects to go into production in the next two years, providing jobs, entertainment and cultural benefits to two of the worlds great cinema-going nations.        
	Putting a brave face on Salmans absence, Follett said: After the United States, the British and the Indian film industries are arguably the two greatest in the world. The range of benefits we are offering through the treaty aims to bring our industries closer together and I am confident that Indian filmmakers will want to take up the offer.        
	She promised: Any Indian filmmaker who wants to collaborate with a British producer will find it more financially worthwhile. We can also offer a mature production infrastructure and share expertise between the two countries film industries. I am delighted to see some of the biggest names in Bollywood filming in the heart of London and hope to see many similar co-productions being filmed around the UK in the coming years.        
	Films made under the treaty can benefit from possible funding from the UK Film Council; support to help them sell their films at international festivals; and increased access to EU markets and TV sales.        
	The treaty is expected to indirectly support a range of businesses. They include British-Indian suppliers who support filmmakers with everything from costumes to caterers, British-Indian owned cinemas that are likely to show the films and the UK tourist industry.        
	Former British culture secretary Tessa Jowell and Indias information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, signed the main body of the agreement in Delhi on December 5, 2005. Negotiations on the detailed annex to the agreement were completed and signed in June 2008.        
	Record numbers of Bollywood films have been released in the UK over the past few years. There were 2.6 million visits to Hindi films in the UK in 2005, and Indian films accounted for over 16 per cent of all releases, taking 12.4 million (Rs 99.7 crore) at the box office.

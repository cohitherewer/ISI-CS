     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Centre today said it would not impose special economic zones on any state and was willing to review notified zones.
    
	Sources said Union commerce minister Kamal Naths statement, after a meeting with Goa chief minister Digambar Kamat, was an attempt to buy time on the SEZ stand-off with the state.
    
	The Congress chief minister has said he wants all 15 tax-free industrial zones planned in Goa  including three that have been notified  to be scrapped.
    
	But commerce secretary Gopal Pillai had said yesterday there was no provision in the SEZ act to denotify such zones.
    
	Nath today told Kamat the Union government would not impose any SEZ on his state. The central government or the SEZ act does not thrust upon the state any SEZ. It is for the state government to evaluate the need, necessity and appropriateness. As and when the state government communicates their view, appropriate action will be taken, he said.
    
	Asked about the three projects that have already been notified, the minister said: There is absolute provision in the (SEZ) act for everything.
    
	Pillai tonight repeated what he said yesterday but denied any contradiction with Naths stand.
    
	Officials said a way out could be for the Goa government and the developers to come to an amicable settlement and approach the Centre asking for the projects to be scrapped.
    
	Kamat held meetings with Union ministers and Congress leaders to gather support for his governments December 31 decision to scrap all SEZs. Goa is the first state to have taken such a decision, which followed political opposition and charges of irregularities in allocation of land.
    
	Nath has asked the state government to send its proposals, which would be reviewed by the Centre. The SEZ act would guide all decisions, officials said.
    
	Cipla, Peninsula Pharma Research Centre and K. Raheja Corp have acquired land for the notified SEZs. Cipla has started work.
    
	Kamat said the government would go by the law on compensating developers.
    
	However, officials said, the decision could invite investment apathy and, in the future, another state could stand up and ask for its SEZs to be scrapped.

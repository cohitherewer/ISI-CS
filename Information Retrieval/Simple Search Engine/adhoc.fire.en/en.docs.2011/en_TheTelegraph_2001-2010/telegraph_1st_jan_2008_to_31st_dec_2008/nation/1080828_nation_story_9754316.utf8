	Mumbai, Aug. 27 (PTI): Bombay High Court has allowed a 19-year-old girl to get her passport made although she refused to give her fathers name in the application form, which is mandatory.        
	The student of a prestigious Mumbai college, who wants to go abroad for higher education, has no communication with her father after he deserted her and her mother.         
	Her mother remarried when the girl was a little more than 15.

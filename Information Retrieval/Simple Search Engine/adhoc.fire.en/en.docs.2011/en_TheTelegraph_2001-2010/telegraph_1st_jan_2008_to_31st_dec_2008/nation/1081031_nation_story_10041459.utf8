          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Grey gang: Obama...				                 ...and Karat		                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Opposing neo-liberal policies, whether of George W. Bush or his friend Manmohan Singh, can be injurious. At least to your hair.        
	Prakash Karat today said his hair had turned from grey to white arguing with finance minister P. Chidambaram against the Centres neo-liberal economic polices.        
	US Democrat candidate Barack Obama would sympathise: his jet black hair is now streaked with grey after months spent holding off Hillary Clinton, panning the Bush government and debating with John McCain.        
	The CPM general secretary hit out at the government while speaking at the inauguration of the Centre for Policy Analysis, a Left-leaning think tank.        
	He criticised the Prime Minister for his decision to continue pursuing banking and insurance reforms, blocked by the Left when it was a government ally.        
	Karat disagreed with Singhs statement that Indian banks were safe. The CPM chief accused the government of being keen on handing controlling stakes to foreign banks, opening up the insurance sector and putting government employees pension money on the stock market.        
	My hair has turned from grey to white arguing with Chidambaram, he joked.        
	Karat said the Left parties had handed the government 20 well-studied reports detailing why they opposed the government move on each of the policies. He cited the example of a note opposing increasing the FDI cap in insurance.        
	Obama has been looking at the silver lining: he has said his salt-and-pepper hair would at least make him look the part of a President. Karat too may console himself that Indian communist bosses have always been associated with white hair, since they usually keep their posts as long as they live.

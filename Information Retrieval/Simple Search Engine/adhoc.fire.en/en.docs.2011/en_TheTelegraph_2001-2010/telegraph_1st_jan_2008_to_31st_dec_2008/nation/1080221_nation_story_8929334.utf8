The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulford pushes, Arjun blocks
                                                                                                               Mulford pushes, Arjun blocks
  - US seeks review of finance institute shutdown          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           David Mulford                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The US has asked India to reconsider the expulsion of an American financial analysis institute that failed to meet standards, triggering allegations of interference in education policy.        
	Ambassador David Mulford has written to Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia urging him to allow the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute to continue in India.         
	The institute was asked to stop operations last year by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the apex technical education regulator, after a legal battle. Delhi High Court rejected its appeal to be allowed to stay on.        
	In his February 11 letter, Mulford has asked Ahluwalia to reconsider the decision to shut down the institute over a decade after it came to the country. Copies of the letter were sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and HRD minister Arjun Singh.         
	The letter  at a time when relations with the US are under intense scrutiny  has sparked concern within Indias education establishment, with some officials accusing Mulford of trying to put pressure.         
	India has certain basic requirements which all institutions are expected to meet. That is the countrys policy and the US knows it. There can be no other explanation for such a letter other than that (pressure), an HRD ministry official said.         
	The US embassy declined comment. But sources confirmed Mulford wrote the letter in his capacity as the top-ranking representative of the US government in India.         
	Arjun replied to Mulfords letter on February 18 but addressed it to the Prime Minister. The HRD minister made it clear that his ministry was unwilling to bend rules to allow the US institute to return.         
	All higher education institutes need approval from the AICTE before they can offer technical courses.        
	In March 2007, the Institute of Chartered Finance Accountants of India (ICFAI), an Indian competitor of the CFA institute, moved Gauhati High Court accusing the government of allowing its rival to teach without approval.         
	When the court asked the AICTE to look into the allegation, it accepted it had failed to act against the institute, in India since 1995.        
	Last May, the AICTE asked the CFA institute, which had around 7,000 students, to terminate operations immediately. The institute discontinued its courses but pleaded in Delhi High Court that chartered financial analysis did not require AICTEs approval. But in December, the high court dismissed the petition.         
	That the ambassador has written when even the court has given its decision suggests the US believes it can arm-twist us through backroom channels. That is unacceptable, the HRD official said.         
	Arjun, in his letter, has cited the court order to buttress his argument that the CFA institute cannot be allowed to continue.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 21: The Samajwadi Party today looked more confident than 24 hours ago, alleging fissures in the Bahujan Samaj Party and uncertainty in the Deve Gowda and Ajit Singh camps.        
	Samajwadi sources said they were sure of abstentions from Mayavatis party. At least a few members will abstain; so do not be surprised, an MP said.        
	The party appears to believe that over the past 24 hours, the tide may have begun turning in the UPAs favour.        
	This has mostly to do with the BJP allegedly developing cold feet about toppling the government now that Mayavati has emerged a third contender in what had so far been a Congress-BJP bipolar battle.        
	But the Samajwadis are also keeping their fingers crossed about H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, both of which had pledged support to Mayavati.        
	Asked which way his three MPs would vote, Gowdas reply on TV sounded as if he was unsure. He said the matter would be clear only tomorrow.        
	Ajit, known to be a hard bargainer, too was unwilling to commit himself. See what happens tomorrow, he said.        
	Asked if there was any confusion in the JD(S), its chief whip M. Shivanna couldnt contain his amusement at first. But then, he had not watched Gowda on TV.        
	I have already issued the whip with all three names and submitted it to the Speaker, stating clearly that we will vote against the government, he said. But when pressed, even he had to give in. Well see tomorrow, Shivanna shrugged.        
	Samajwadi sources conceded that their party was unlikely to be able to pay the BSP back by poaching its members. They, however, argued that only the Samajwadi MPs facing criminal cases had joined hands with Mayavati to avoid government action. There will be desertions after the next election, one leader said.        
	This morning, the Samajwadis showed off a poster that carried the picture of a crown engraved with the images of CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, Mayavati and Advani. The sarcastic tagline ran: Hey Ram. Party general secretary Amar Singh accused the Left of shifting towards the communal BJP.         
	Speaking in the House, Ram Gopal Yadav taunted the Left with references to the 1962 China war. What were you doing when China attacked us? he asked during his speech that began by justifying the deal and went on to castigate the BJP.

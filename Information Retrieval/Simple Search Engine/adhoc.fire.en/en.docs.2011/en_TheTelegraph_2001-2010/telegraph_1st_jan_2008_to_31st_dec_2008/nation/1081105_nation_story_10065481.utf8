	Calcutta, Nov. 4: Assistant sub-inspector Ranjit Mondal says he got a second life last Sunday.        
	The Midnapore police lines officer was one of the four cops in the pilot car of Ram Vilas Paswans convoy that took the brunt of the blast near Midnapore town.        
	We were travelling at great speed, maybe 80kmph or 90kmph. Checking the rear view mirror, I saw the rest of the convoy was lagging behind. So I asked the driver to slow down, said Mondal from his bed in AMRI Hospitals, his legs swathed in bandages.         
	Mondal said once the car crossed Bhadutala, there were no policemen in sight.        
	When we started from Salboni, there was heavy police presence on both sides. But as we approached the Kalachandi canal, the police presence became non-existent, said the ASI, whose left thigh was operated on yesterday.         
	Mondal, a resident of Hooghly, said that as the Gypsy slowed down before the approach to the canal bridge, a deafening sound rattled the car.         
	I was sitting in front. Suddenly, there was this deafening sound that rocked the car and threw it off the road. I was in a daze and was suffocating in the thick smoke that had engulfed the car. I realised we were in trouble and shouted at the driver to slam the brakes. But the car rolled along for some distance before stopping.         
	I saw driver Mukul Phul Mali unconscious at the wheel, blood trickling down his face.         
	The convoy stopped behind the blast spot, but Mondal motioned the cars to drive ahead.        
	After the convoy had passed, I saw the injured policemen and National Volunteer Force jawans, who were with me in the car, groaning in pain. I was in a daze and groped for the walkie-talkie set to contact the control room in Midnapore. I found it but it was dead. I took out my mobile phone but could not get through to any of my colleagues, he said.        
	I opened the door and got off the car. I then noticed a gaping hole in my trousers over the left thigh. Both my legs were blood-soaked. I limped to the back of the car, opened the door and took out the SLR rifles of the policemen. I put them on the side of the road.         
	By then, two cars had pulled up. I bundled the rifles into one of them. Within minutes, a police vehicle arrived and we helped the injured people into the cars, Mondal said.         
	After I helped three of my injured colleagues into the cars, I realised I was bleeding profusely. I felt weak and dizzy. I also realised that it had been a providential escape. Had the explosion happened closer to or under our car, we would all have been dead today.

	Mumbai, July 1 (PTI): Bombay High Court today ruled that aviation authorities could not enforce an old rule that would mean longer flying hours and less rest for pilots.        
	A division bench of Justices S.B. Mhase and Ashutosh Kumbhkoni stayed a circular issued by the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) to bring back the 1992 duty-hour rules and asked the authorities to stick to the 2007 guidelines, favoured by pilots, till the final judgment.        
	The court had a week back admitted a petition by three pilot associations against the decision to keep the 2007 rules in abeyance and revert to the regulations of 1992.         
	The associations represented the crew of Air India (including Indian) and Jet Airways. The pilots claimed that the old rules meant longer duty hours and shorter breaks. This would lead to crew fatigue and aircraft safety risks.        
	The associations alleged that the circular, sent last month, appeared to have been issued under pressure from airlines desperate to cut costs following the recent fuel price hikes.        
	The DGCAs lawyer dubbed the move a policy decision that couldnt be challenged in court. The new rules had to be suspended after some operational difficulties, he said, adding a panel was framing new regulations.

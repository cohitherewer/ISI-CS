          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, July 24: Mayavati may not find it easy to draw the powerful Jats of western Uttar Pradesh into her ever-widening rainbow coalition.        
	Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh was expected to deliver this crucial vote bank to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), but his ally and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait seems to have thrown a spanner in the works.        
	The octogenarian leader of the Bhartiya Kishan Union (BKU), sent to jail by Mayavati a few months ago over an alleged caste slur at her, has termed Ajits move to join forces with the BSP as the height of opportunism.        
	Ajits support base in western Uttar Pradesh is made up by the rich and influential Jat farmers, who revere Tikait as an icon. Political analysts said that if Tikait refused to stand by Ajit, the RLD chief may lose his vote bank among the farmers.        
	Tikaits son and BKU leader Rakesh today said: Ajit Singh did not take into account Mayavatis disrespect for farmers of the region before deciding to side with her. The BKU will not tolerate this.        
	This appears the first ground-level challenge to Mayavatis efforts to widen her coalition after she burst on the national scene as a possible future Prime Minister in the run-up to the trust-vote tussle.        
	She had successfully woven Brahmin support with her Dalit base last year, and is now eyeing Muslim votes as well, having recruited several of the Samajwadi Partys minority leaders. Drafting the Jats, western UPs dominant Other Backward Classes community, would have spread her influence among almost every section of society.        
	The Jats are the majority caste in at least 11 Lok Sabha seats in the region, making up over 40 per cent of voters in some constituencies.        
	However, political analysts say, the Jats were always unlikely to support Mayavati, having been at loggerheads for centuries with the chief ministers caste, the Jatavs, who make up about 18 per cent of voters in western UP.        
	She seems to be in a hurry to forge caste coalitions without doing her homework on their history of alliances and enmities, said Ramesh Dixit, political science professor at Lucknow University.

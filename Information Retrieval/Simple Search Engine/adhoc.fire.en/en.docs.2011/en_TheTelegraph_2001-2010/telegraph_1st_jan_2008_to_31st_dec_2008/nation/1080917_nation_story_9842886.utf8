	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 16: Adding to the concept of quality amenities on campus, SAI International School here is ready with the first world-class communication facility in the state  the Helen Keller Centre of Communication.        
	The centre would help children improve speaking, listening, writing and reading skills in English, Oriya, Sanskrit, Hindi, German, French, Korean and Chinese through video-conferencing and networking with top schools in the country and also abroad.        
	Inaugurating the centre, school education and literacy department secretary Arun Rath said: The venture will bring about a lot of exposure for the students bringing them on a par with the international level.        
	The children today started the first session interacting with the Asoka International School in Nasik and the Savious School in London.         
	Its really exciting to see them live on the screens and talk to them in their language, said Sumin Basu, a student.        
	The centre would be networked with around 30 schools in India having similar facilities. Besides, scores of schools outside India would also be connected.         
	There has been a growing interest among foreign children to learn Sanskrit and English. Similarly our students are keen to learn French, German and Korean. The communication centre, we believe will prove beneficial in bringing out the potential of the students grooming them into multi-lingual communication experts, said principal Arun Prakash.         
	About 320 students of the school would use the new facility centre. We have kept the classes compulsory for all students  both extraordinarily brilliant and remedial. This will also help shy students to overcome their shyness and get more interactive, said B.P. Mohapatra, the director (operations) of the school.

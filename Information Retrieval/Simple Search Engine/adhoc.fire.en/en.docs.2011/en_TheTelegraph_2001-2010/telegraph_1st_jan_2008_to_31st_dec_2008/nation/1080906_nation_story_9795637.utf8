          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The central government will send 6,30,000 doses of a measles vaccine as well as prepare to deliver a Japanese encephalitis vaccine to camps in flood-hit districts of Bihar, senior health ministry officials announced today.         
	Bihar will also receive 100 fogging machines as part of efforts to prevent outbreaks of mosquito-transmitted diseases, ambulances from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, and stocks of 37 drugs, the officials said.         
	The conditions in the flood-affected areas have sparked fears of outbreaks of stomach infections and other illnesses.         
	In the past, floods and even heavy rain in other states in India have led to outbreaks of leptospirosis  a bacterial infection that can be picked up when people who are barefoot or wearing slippers come into contact with infected rodent urine in water.         
	The measles vaccine is only intended for the camps, a health official said.         
	Among the 2.5 million people affected, about 3,00,000 are displaced, and only a fraction of these people are in camps, the official said.         
	Mobile medical teams from Jharkhand and Assam are likely to reach Bihar by tomorrow.

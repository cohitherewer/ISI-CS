          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 18: The government today indicated that it was working towards an independent science meeting that could emerge as an alternative to the Indian Science Congress.         
	The government is contemplating to evolve perhaps a more effective, alternative mechanism for such a science conclave, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal told Parliament today in response to a question about the Indian Science Congress, which had had its first meeting at Calcuttas Asiatic Society way back in 1914.         
	Several thousand scientists attend the annual meetings of the Calcutta-headquartered Indian Science Congress Association, organised every year in the first week of January by a university or an academic or research institution. Delegates at these meetings present hundreds of papers from diverse disciplines of science.        
	But the annual gathering has been under a cloud in recent years, mainly because scientists have often complained about the quality of these presentations.         
	With the passage of time, the number of participants and the number of topics have tremendously increased, thereby making it impossible for any organiser to hold meaningful discussions, Sibal said in a written response to a question by Jyotiraditya Scindia on whether the Indian Science Congress had been losing its substance.         
	A senior department of science and technology official had indicated earlier this year that the government was looking at organising an annual science conference for the Prime Minister and the council of ministers.        
	The idea was that top scientists from across disciplines would present the status of developments in their respective fields at these meets, the official had said.         
	The annual science congress could continue, but this new meeting could be a single-day or two-day affair that could be held at Vigyan Bhavan every year as an alternative to the science congress, the official said. The presentations will be very focused.

	If you have been a business journalist in Mumbai, the sight on Wednesday night of the Taj Mahal hotel in flames would have been one of the saddest.         
	The hotel is one of the citys best addresses for business meetings, conferences, seminars and the like. Barring its smaller business chambers in the new annexe and a modest-sized meeting room atop the same tower, the bulk of events visited by the media happen in the older heritage wing which caught fire.        
	For me it took a while to remember names like the Ball Room, the Crystal Room and the Emerald Room; it took even longer to get acquainted with the north and south tags to some of these. But it was pardonable confusion, almost tradition, on a property older than anyone on its premises.         
	Outside, the Taj was a pure heritage landmark. Crowds always thronged the road in front; people sat or leaned on the low stone wall bordering the sea.         
	From there you could casually gaze at the busy boat jetty next to the Gateway of India and the several stylish yachts anchored offshore. The waters like seawater anywhere else in Mumbais harbour were far from clean. But in a city starved of space and relief, where else but that road and Marine Drive (home to that other iconic hotel  The Oberoi) would you go for a taste of sea breeze and ocean view?         
	Meditate on the scene and you realise the powerful convergence at this point of Mumbai  a monument of an entrance bearing the name of the country, a historical harbour, the best-known property of the countrys biggest hotel chain with guests from various countries, a favourite meeting point for some of the most influential industrialists and a neighbourhood long associated with an evening of fun.         
	My own first visit to Mumbai had included ample beer at Caf Mondegar and a consequent silly chat at Gateway.        
	As a young journalist in the mid-nineties, till then used to seeing famous industrialists in magazine photographs, the Taj brought it all alive for me. But it happened with some turbulence for the Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL), which owns the Taj and has its headquarters in the hotel and nearby, was one of those outfits where the Tatas had to struggle to effect leadership change.         
	It was the last piece of turf to be recovered from the satraps of the JRD era. There was controversy, a stormy AGM, the shift of R.K. Krishnakumar from Tata Tea to IHCL as new boss, the rationalisation of Taj properties and finally, the advent of Raymond Bickson as managing director with a promise to make the Taj a truly global hotel chain.         
	Work as a business correspondent demanded frequent visits to the hotel and over time the property and its staff wrapped itself around you like another familiar corner of the city. You hung around after a media conference in the bookshop; learnt the nature of a busy banquet manager or correctly guessed which steward would serve Ratan Tata.         
	On days when a President or Prime Minister was expected, the entrance to the heritage wing would be framed with flowers, the name of the visiting dignitary etched on it. At the Taj, one met the physicist Stephen Hawking, mathematician John Nash and that maverick tycoon, Richard Branson.         
	It was also there that an advertisement from my childhood acquired flesh and blood  clad in stewards uniform and evidently seasoned at his job, was a man who had modelled years ago as that smiling dentist in countless Colgate advertisements.         
	About three to four years ago, the Taj Mahal hotel was among properties across the Taj chain that got renovated. Most changes in the heritage wing were on the inside, nothing changed outwardly. The most visible change was in the hotels main lobby in the new wing. It was a revitalisation of the flagship of Colaba for though it is the Gateway that stamps the address, it is the Taj that adds the flavour.        
	Wednesday night that whole district was in panic. With Leopold Caf as one site of shooting, one can well imagine what that may have done for life around Caf Mondegar, the Bade Mian kebab outlet  all of which lay in lanes behind the Taj.         
	In August 2003 terrorists shook up the Taj with a blast at the Gateway; this time, the flames reached inside.

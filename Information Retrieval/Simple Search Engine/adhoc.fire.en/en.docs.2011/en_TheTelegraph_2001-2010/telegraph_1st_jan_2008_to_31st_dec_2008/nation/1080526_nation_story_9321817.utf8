          ANANYA SENGUPTA                           Nupur Talwar                                  
	New Delhi, May 25: The special task force probing the Aarushi Talwar murder case today put her mother, Nupur, through a no-holds-barred grilling for over an hour and a half.        
	Nupurs husband, Rajesh Talwar, a dentist, was arrested on May 23. Nupur, also a dentist, had appealed to the cops to defer her interrogation for a few days, but the STF refused her request.        
	The police said she refused to answer some of the 10 questions they asked and the interrogators were forced to bring in a lawyer.         
	Her brother-in-law, Dinesh Talwar, was also questioned today.         
	Before Nupurs interrogation, the STF searched her house for almost two hours. They took away the CPU of the computer that Aarushi used. Rajeshs laptop has already been seized.        
	Police sources said Nupur stuck to her statement to the media yesterday.        
	How can a mother sleep in her room when the father was killing their only child? Can any mother do that? she asked.         
	But a senior police officer said the probe team had crucial evidence against the Talwars.        
	Rajesh Talwar and his wife made an entry at a temple in Hardwar that Aarushis time of death was 2am. That is crucial evidence for us, the officer said.        
	Now its clear that he knew about his daughters actual time of death. How did he know that before the post-mortem report came in?         
	The Talwars had said a domestic help found Aarushi dead in her room when she came to work at 6am on May 16. They left for Hardwar the next day for Aarushis last rites.         
	The police also said they had found one aspect of Aarushis routine odd on the night of her murder.        
	While her earlier mobile call records showed that the 15-year-old generally stayed awake till 11pm-12.30am, on the night of May 15, the call record showed that the last call was at 9.10pm.         
	The police suspect that her phone might have been confiscated during a possible altercation with her parents.        
	The cops today hinted that more arrests were likely.         
	Rajeshs brother Dinesh, however, said: My family and I are 100 per cent sure that Rajesh is innocent. We will fight for him. He is not doing too well, how can a man do well in jail?         
	Dinesh had gone to Dasna jail in Noida with Nupur. They stayed with Rajesh for 30 minutes.

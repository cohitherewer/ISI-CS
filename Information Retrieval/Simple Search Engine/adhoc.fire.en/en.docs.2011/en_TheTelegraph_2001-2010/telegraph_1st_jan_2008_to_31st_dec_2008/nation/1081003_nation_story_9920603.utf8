	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 2: A march and a signature campaign were organised here today supporting the ban enforced on smoking at public places.         
	Students, NGO activists, hoteliers, employees of various private and government organisations, eminent persons from media and common public participated in the march.         
	Children supported the move to ban smoking in public places from today by holding placards demanding smoke-free home and education institutions.         
	Smoke-free environment is the right of every individual and it is a positive step towards a greater cause, said Monalisa Pati, a student.         
	Its a great day for anti-tobacco activists. The ban is indeed a big achievement for those working in tobacco control, said, senior IAS officer Aurobinda Behera, who flagged off the march.         
	The health department officials said letters had already been sent to all departments, DG of Police, district collectors and chief district medical officers for implementation of the new rule.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 3: One of the two women molested by a mob on New Years Eve in Mumbai had got married just the day before.
    
	I just dont want to talk about it anymore. I want to forget what happened. Stop showing my pictures on TV, said Hetal Shah (name changed), from her room in a Juhu hotel.
    
	Hetal and her husband Jiten (name changed), who are from California, had gone to JW Marriott to celebrate the New Year with two of his cousins and were returning to their hotel when they were assaulted.
    
	They were grabbing for my wife and my sister, I was pushed around. They were too many of them. Please leave us alone. We dont want to talk about this anymore. Let us be in peace for the remainder of our trip, said Jiten, at Hotel Royal Garden on Juhu-Tara Road.
    
	Mumbai police today announced a cash reward of Rs 10,000 and above for information on the molesters, whose pictures have been splashed in the media. 
    
	But experts said they might go scot-free in the absence of a formal complaint from the victims.
    
	Juhu police have registered a case of molestation and rioting against 40 unidentified accused on the basis of a complaint lodged by two media photographers. The police are also planning to form a special probe team.
    
	But high court lawyer Amit Kharkhanis said the victims will have to file a police complaint to set the criminal law in motion.
    
	Without the victim identifying her molesters, there is no case, the lawyer said. 
    
	Even if some offenders are arrested, he will be charged with minor offences like obscene behaviour in public or unlawful assembly. Its the victim whose statement in court would make all the difference. 
    
	An officer with Juhu police station said although the statements of the photographers and pictures taken by them could be treated as evidence in court, what eventually mattered was the physical presence of the victims and their statement indicting the accused.
    
	The officer cited the molestation at the Gateway of India on New Years Eve last year to make his point. No case could be pursued because the victim did not file a complaint, the officer said. 
    
	Despite police prodding, the Shahs refused to file a complaint. 
    
	When we got in touch with them, they asked us not to disturb them anymore, joint commissioner of police (law and order) K.L. Prasad said.
    
	Jiten said they didnt file a police complaint because in that mob, it was impossible to recognise the molesters.
    
	It seemed like there were 50 people around all trying to get at my wife and cousin, PTI quoted him as saying.
    
	Initial reports had said there were 70-80 men in the mob.
    
	Somebody pushed all of us on the ground. My brother and I tried to fight the crowd, but they were too many. Thats when some photographers started clicking us, Jiten said.
    
	All of a sudden, there emerged a man wearing a red T-shirt who tried to help us and started shouting for the police. The cops arrived in a few minutes and the crowd thinned out.
    
	Jiten, who was grateful to the man in the red T-shirt, said neither the police nor the hotel should be blamed. 
    
	But his wife was bitter. 
    
	I believe Mumbaikars are not willing to stop and help people in trouble, she said. People just watched as my husband tried to protect me.
    
	The photographers, who had called the police, later said four or five among the mob molested the women while the rest watched.
    
	The incident came a day after the 2006 annual report of the National Crime Records Bureau.
    
	The report said crimes against women were on the rise in Maharashtra. 
    
	As many as 1,045 more cases have been reported in 2006 compared with that of 2005.

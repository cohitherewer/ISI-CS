	Bhubaneswar, May 5: Developmental activities across Orissa were stalled after 3,000 government engineers went on a mass leave from May 2 over non-recognition of their nine-point charter of demands by the government.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today convened a meeting to discuss the matter with a delegation of Orissa Engineers Service Association, where it was decided that a committee would be constituted to look into the demand charter. The committee would be headed by the chief minister himself.        
	Earlier, in a memorandum to Naveen Patnaik the bodys bosses had lamented that the government had not called them for negotiation even after receiving their demands in March.         
	One of their major demands was the appointment of engineers as secretaries in all the engineering departments. The recommendations made by the Administrative Reforms Commission-1967, have been implemented only in the works department, whereas states, including Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Bengal and Maharashtra had implemented all decisions since long.         
	Also, the body has been seeking removal of pay anomalies, especially after the government revised the pay scale of doctors at the entry level.         
	Now, engineers have demanded a revised salary of Rs 13,500. They are also demanding a time-bound scale with revision after every five years of service.         
	Claiming that engineers do essential service like the doctors, the association has demanded that engineers are treated at a par with doctors and entry level posts be upgraded to Junior Class-I, said association general secretary M.R. Nanda.

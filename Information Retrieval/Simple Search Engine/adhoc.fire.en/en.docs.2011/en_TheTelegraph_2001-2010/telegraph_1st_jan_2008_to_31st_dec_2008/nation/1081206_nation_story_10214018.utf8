          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Rahe (Jharkhand), Dec. 5: Maoists stabbed five jawans of state polices special task force and then shot them dead at a village market here this afternoon.        
	Maoists usually kill with bombs, mines and guns in carefully planned, surprise attacks; they are not known to use knives or to engage in messy hand combat in daylight in crowded places.        
	Some 25-odd rebels, all in plain clothes and hiding in shops, pounced on the jawans around 2.15pm as the personnel walked back to the Rahe outpost of Bundu police station.        
	The jawans, aged between 26 and 29, were tired after their shift at an SBI branch 6km from the market, which is about 47km from Ranchi. All of them had joined the force about four years ago.        
	At least five Maoists attacked each jawan. The jawans were dragged to different spots in the market, stabbed and shot. We are not sure whether the Maoists used the jawans Insas rifles or if they had brought their own guns, senior superintendent of police M.S. Bhatia said.        
	He said at least one rebel was injured. We noticed bloodstains on the path towards the Rahe river, about half a kilometre from the market.        
	The police said the villagers were not co-operating with the investigation.

	Ranchi, July 9: Jharkhand MLA and former minister Ramesh Singh Munda was gunned down today by armed men believed to be Maoists while he was attending a programme at a school near the state capital.         
	Two of his bodyguards and a 17-year-old student, sitting close by, were also killed in the shooting in Bundu. The slain teenager has not been identified yet.        
	The stunned state government reacted by transferring two senior police officers and ordering a CBI probe.         
	The Opposition NDA has declared a state-wide bandh tomorrow to protest against the killing.         
	SS High School, Bundu, was the unlikely venue of the attack that occurred around 1.30pm, interrupting an event that was meant to felicitate meritorious students.         
	He had hardly spoken for 15 minutes when 20-25 extremists in civil dress rushed in and began firing at the MLA indiscriminately from their AK-47s and AK-56s, said Shesh Nath Singh, the only surviving bodyguard of the leader.                    Ramesh Singh Munda		    
	The firing lasted 10 minutes. They were so quick that we couldnt react. They took away the weapons of the slain bodyguards, he added.         
	The Tamar MLA, his guards and the student were rushed to hospital, but doctors at RIMS declared them dead at 3.30pm.         
	Munda is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.        
	His dead bodyguards have been identified as Shivnath Minz, 30, and Khursheed Alam, 28.        
	Munda, 52, is the third state leader to fall to bullets of assassins after JMM MP Sunil Mahto and CPI (ML-Liberation) MLA Mahendra Prasad Singh.         
	While Mahto died during a football match in 2007, Singh was killed in the run-up to the 2005 Assembly polls. Last year, Maoists killed the son of former chief minister Babulal Marandi in Giridihs Chilkhari.

	New Delhi, April 16: Indias first postgraduate course that will allow students to simultaneously learn the language and study the history and contemporary politics of three key East Asian economies is set to roll this academic session.         
	Driven by a growing demand from industry and the Centre, Delhi University (DU) is starting the programme that will combine a language course in Chinese, Japanese or Korean with a traditional international studies course.         
	No Indian university now offers such a blend under a single course on any region of the world at any level.         
	This course aims at filling a large void in our understanding of East Asia, by creating a corpus of Indians armed both with the knowledge of a foreign countrys culture and language through a single course, Madhu Bhalla, the head of the East Asian studies department at DU, said.         
	Indias Look East Policy has over recent years led to a spurt in employment opportunities for Indians in China, Japan and Korea, and in companies that originate from these countries, officials said.         
	Language students, however, struggle to understand the intricacies of a foreign culture, they said. Students of international studies, on the other hand, face problems communicating with Chinese, Japanese or Korean nationals.         
	Although companies from these countries have also approached the department for students with jobs as interpreters, DU is aiming at making students of the course eligible for more high-end jobs, Bhalla said.         
	The course is structured to help students rise up the corporate ladder in companies from these countries. They should not be hindered either by a lack of cultural knowledge or language.        
	Modelled on similar courses in western universities like Harvard, the course, for instance, is targeting diplomats who may serve in East Asia.         
	Most Indian diplomats learn about China, Japan or Korea only from their experiences there. This course has an emphasis on Indias relations with these countries, and will equip them with language skills and an understanding of the culture they have to engage with, Bhalla added.         
	The two-year course will consist of seven subjects in each year, including the history, contemporary politics, foreign policy and economies of these countries.         
	Students will study about each of the three East Asian economic powers in the first year. In their final year, they will have to choose one among them.         
	Most top western universities offer the blend of language with culture of a foreign country in their international studies departments, Srimati Chakravarty, former head of DUs East Asian studies department, said.

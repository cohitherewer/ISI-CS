The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul conjures UP meet after 26 years
                                                                                                               Rahul conjures UP meet after 26 years
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, March 20: Rahul Gandhis agenda to shift Uttar Pradesh politics out of Delhi has produced the unthinkable  the state Congress will hold its first meeting in 26 years in Kanpur on March 30 and 31.         
	Sonia and Rahul Gandhi  whose political careers are anchored in the state  are among the 1,200 delegates expected to take part in the conclave.        
	The mother-son duo will also address a public rally in Kanpur on March 31.         
	Party sources claimed the conclave would be a freewheeling session without a pre-determined schedule. It would also be open to the media, the sources added.         
	Congress members, who felt stifled all these years, will be encouraged to speak freely and frankly. At least thats our hope, said Akhilesh Prasad Singh, the spokesperson for the Uttar Pradesh Congress.         
	The sources said Rahul, whose Lok Sabha seat is Amethi, was determined not to let affairs of Uttar Pradesh be remote-controlled from 24, Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters in Delhi.         
	They said Rahul feels that one reason for the Congresss decline in the heartland was that leaders had cut themselves off from vital sources of inputs  the grassroots  and had come to depend on a cabal, which made access to the high command impossible for others.         
	When Rahul speaks of democracy in the party apparatus, this is what he means. Everyone should be heard out, said a source.         
	The sources said he did not want to box the Congress in at Amethi and Rae Bareli, his mothers constituency. As a state office-bearer put it, Rahul wants to demonstrate that the party was still alive, even if it wasnt kicking, in Uttar Pradesh.         
	This was why Rahul had spread himself out and enlarged his concerns.        
	Party insiders said Rahul, after taking the plunge in Uttar Pradesh politics, had taken up a gamut of issues: from raising the demand for a separate Bundelkhand state to asking the state government to remove the value-added tax on shoes made by small manufacturers in Agra.        
	Last week, when members of a Dalit family were killed in Etawah, Rahul did a quick spot-check.

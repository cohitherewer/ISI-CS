          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ravi Shankar Prasad                                  
	New Delhi, April 10: The BJP today welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on Other Backward Classes reservation but demanded the quota be extended to minority institutions.        
	The party was evasive on the exclusion of the creamy layer, preferring to wait and watch and hoping the thorny issue would divide the ruling alliance.        
	The BJP favours equity, social justice and benefit for the OBCs. But the benefit should be extended to minority institutions, party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	It seems strange that those who talk of Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims are denying this benefit in their own institutions.        
	Prasad said there were OBC communities among Muslims and Christians as well, according to the Mandal formula.        
	The BJP had raised the point in Parliament when the Constitution was being amended to allow an OBC quota in educational institutions, though it had backed the legislation like all the other parties.        
	Although most BJP leaders support the exclusion of the creamy layer, the party has been cautious in responding because it expects some kind of churning in the government on this question.        
	Cabinet ministers such as Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have voiced their opposition to this part of the court order, and the BJP feels the differences would put the Prime Minister in a bind.        
	Prasad, therefore, asked for a formal response to the judgment from the Centre even while saying the BJP would come out with its own reaction only after it has thoroughly studied the verdict.        
	Told that the Union human resource development minister, the brain behind the new quota, had applauded the verdict, Prasad shot back: Arjun Singh is not the government.        
	The BJP senses that the Centre would face problems in deciding its collective response. Its for the government to work out the norms for judging who forms the creamy layer, and decide whether a uniform criterion can be applied across the country. Many of the states may have problems accepting the exclusion of the creamy layer.        
	The BJP, once considered a party run by the upper castes, has realised that it is no longer possible to ignore the aspirations of the politically assertive backward castes. It has over the past few years promoted several OBC leaders, and many of its chief ministers have come from this social group.

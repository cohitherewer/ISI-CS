	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Girls at Delhis St. Stephens College may soon get one more hostel in addition to the existing two, but increased accommodation for them means less room for boys. 
    
	A college committee has recommended that one of the four hostels currently occupied by boys be handed over to the girls. The governing council of the college will debate the proposal at a meeting soon, sources said. 
    
	The college had asked the University Grants Commission for permission to build a new girls hostel, but the request was turned down. Faced with increasing demands from the girls to increase accommodation on campus, it had little choice but to propose that one of the boys hostels be converted into an accommodation for girls, officials said. 
    
	The main argument is security. In a city like Delhi, girls are not safe. Boys can live outside campus more safely than girls. Priority clearly needs to be given to girls, a college official said. 
    
	St. Stephens was initially an all-boys college, which later opened its gates to girls as well. Two decades ago, the six hostels  named after former principals of the college  were all occupied by boys. 
    
	Alnutt South in the nineties and Rudra South this century are the two hostels that have been converted into girls residences  the St. Stephens term for hostels.

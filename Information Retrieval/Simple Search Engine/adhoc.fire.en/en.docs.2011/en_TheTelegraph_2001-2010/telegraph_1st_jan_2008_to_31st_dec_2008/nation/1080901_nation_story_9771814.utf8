	Strays arent only a source of nuisance. They can be money-spinners, too. Ask the Rameshwaram civic body, which decided recently to auction the captured animals.    
	Municipal authorities decided to capture the animals and auction them, J.J. Jaleel, the chairman of the civic body, said.    
	The cows and bulls wandering near the towns temples were bothering pilgrims. He claimed some had gone as far as snatching prasad (offerings) from devotees.    
	He recalled an incident in which a cow attacked a boy and left him with a bruised eye. Health officials dubbed the wandering cattle a major health hazard as they defecated on streets. They blamed the owners for the mess, saying they werent taking care of the animals.     
	The trouble isnt cows and bulls alone but canines, too.     
	According to civic officials, stray dogs often snatched food kept for patients in government hospitals.    
	The municipality had been swamped with complaints about the menace and had warned the animals owners of stern action if they were left as strays.                      
	BEST, which runs Mumbais buses, has got a ticket of appreciation  from the mayor whose civic body owns it.    
	Shubha Raul recently gave the service 100 per cent marks for their impeccable services.     
	BEST buses plough in all major roads of the city, making it a very convenient option. Special facilities are given to the handicapped and senior citizens, Raul said after a ride in one of the buses on the 61st anniversary of BEST.    
	The mayor didnt rest at handing out top marks, she urged people to opt for public transport, minimise use of private vehicles and help reduce congestion on roads.    
	Raul made herself an example, too, saying she had been taking the buses since her school days and continued to do so now. She said more AC buses would be run if the passengers increase. (PTI)                  
	Those wielding the stick in Delhi schools face the baton.    
	The Delhi government recently ordered an inquiry into the beating of a girl and the suspension of her brother.    
	Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely ordered the crackdown, saying such incidents would be investigated.    
	We have learnt about the incident which allegedly happened in Tagore International School at Lajpat Nagar. We express deep regret in the matter if it has occurred. The case will be probed by an officer of a rank of a deputy director in the (Delhi) education department.    
	In the case at hand, the principal had allegedly slapped the Class VII girl while her brother, who studied in Class I, was suspended for reasons the school authorities have chosen not to reveal. Their parents claimed the girls eardrum has been damaged.     
	Lovely urged the parents and guardians to come forward and report such matters to the education department so that action can be taken against the guilty. He promised to deal with such incidents in a severe manner.                      
	After Delhis water-logging devils came under the lens, the heat is now on those behind shoddy hospital repairs.    
	MCD commissioner K.S. Mehra recently suspended four MCD officials, including an executive engineer, for poor maintenance of the Kasturba hospital, near Jama Masjid.    
	The quartet has been held responsible for bad renovation work that left the hospital roof leaking and debris lying around weeks after the repairs were over. The 450-bed hospital has the largest maternity centre in Asia.              
	MUMBAI: If your interest in oil goes beyond petrol pumps, be there at Taj Lands End at Bandra Bandstand this Monday. The India Oil amp; Gas Review Expo will focus on products and technology new to India. Call the organisers, Oil Asia Publications Pvt Ltd, at 40504900.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM slams Kosovo stand
                                                                                                               CPM slams Kosovo stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: The CPM has attacked the Centres ambiguous stand on Kosovos independence, saying it was another instance of the Congress-led governments predilection for toeing the American line.         
	An editorial in the forthcoming issue of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy says India, which faced a number of secessionist demands since Independence, should have been categorical on this blatant violation of national sovereignty and brazen use of force to redraw territorial boundaries.        
	Not coming out strongly against the move, the party says, speaks a lot about the predilections of the UPA government.         
	The CPM also alleged that the Centre does not want to take a line that appears to be in dissonance with the US.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: At least three Noida farmers died today after police opened fire to quell a stone-throwing mob of 2,000 demanding enhanced compensation for land they had given up for proposed infrastructure projects.        
	The violence, which left 60 people injured, also claimed a fourth victim, possibly a constable, amid unconfirmed reports that some of the protesters, too, had fired at the police.        
	The trouble started after the protesters, from villages on Delhis outskirts, gathered at the Greater Noida Authority office to demand revised rates for the land the Uttar Pradesh government had acquired in 2006 at Rs 322 a square metre. The farmers said they should be paid at the new rate of Rs 850 a square metre announced in 2008.        
	The farmers were also furious that the government had still not told them what it was going to do with their land. We thought they were going to make good use of our land  build schools, colleges and hospitals. But now, we believe, they are going to give the land to builders, said a villager.        
	Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority chairman L. Srivastava said the farmers had lifted their compensation amounts. There is no reason for them to come and demand an increase now.        
	Matters spun out of control as the protesters began throwing stones at the police. The cops used batons, lobbed tear gas shells and then opened fire. Meerut IG Gyan Singh claimed some of the protesters were carrying illegal firearms. If they had not opened fire, the police would have remained calm, he told PTI.

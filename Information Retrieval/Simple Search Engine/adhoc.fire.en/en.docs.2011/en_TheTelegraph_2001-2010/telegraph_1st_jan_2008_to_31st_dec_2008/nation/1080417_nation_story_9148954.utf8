          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mufti                                  
	Srinagar, April 16: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today raked up another controversy by demanding free passage for Kashmiri militants in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.         
	The leader of the Peoples Democratic Party, a constituent of the ruling coalition in the state, had triggered a storm early this week by demanding that the use of Pakistani currency be allowed alongside the Indian rupee in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	The currency comment sparked protests in Jammu where his effigy was burnt and the BJP demanded that he be tried for sedition.         
	The Congress, the PDPs ally, also reacted sharply with state chief and Union water resources minister Saifuddin Soz terming it highly deplorable.         
	Mufti today not only defended his earlier call but also said: People who want to come back should be given free passage as is the recommendation of one of the five working groups constituted by the Prime Minister. The former chief minister also sought rehabilitation of relatives of militants killed by security forces.         
	In 2006, the PDP, however, had joined the Congress in opposing a similar resolution moved by a CPM legislator in the Assembly.         
	National Conference president Omar Abdullah termed Muftis demand sheer hypocrisy. They had opposed it then and are supporting it now though it is a recommendation of a working group. They want to take credit for it.         
	Mufti said he would take up the currency proposal with the Prime Minister. What I said was that both Indian and Pakistani currency should be used in both parts of Kashmir and its need would arise when trade is allowed across the Line of Control in the coming months.

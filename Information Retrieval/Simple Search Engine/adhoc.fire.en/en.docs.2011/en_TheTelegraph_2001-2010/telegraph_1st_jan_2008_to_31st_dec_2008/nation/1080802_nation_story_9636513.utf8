	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Harkishen Singh Surjeet, communist-pragmatist and former general secretary of the CPM, passed away this afternoon after a long illness. He was 92.        
	Hed been suffering from lung and kidney malfunction for over a year and was regularly in and out of Noidas Metro Hospital, a facility he patronised for personal reasons over arguably better healthcare institutions.        
	In the end, a massive cardiac arrest and galloping septicaemia claimed him.         
	He had gradually developed septicaemia due to persistent pneumonia resulting from low immunity, poor general health and advanced age. Today he suffered a massive heart attack, Dr Purushottam Lal, director of Metro Hospital, said.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who was close to Surjeet, drove down to the Teen Murti Lane residence of Surjeet and expressed her condolences to his wife Pritam Kaur.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh referred to the CPM leader as his dear friend, adding: As I said recently in Parliament, he was one of the architects of the UPA.        
	The CPM, in an oblique riposte to the perception that Surjeet would have been more understanding of the UPA governments position on the Indo-US nuclear deal than successor Prakash Karat, noted in a resolution: He worked tirelessly to see that India maintained its non-aligned and independent foreign policy. His views were sought and his advice heard with respect in political circles.        
	Surjeets remains have been taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for embalming.        
	On Sunday, the remains will be taken to his house and then to the party headquarters for a while before the cremation planned for the afternoon.

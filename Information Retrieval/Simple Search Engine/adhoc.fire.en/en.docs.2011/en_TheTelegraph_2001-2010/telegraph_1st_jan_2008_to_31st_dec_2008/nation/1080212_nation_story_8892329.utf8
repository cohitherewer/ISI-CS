The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC to settle poll code row 
                                                                                                               SC to settle poll code row 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Supreme Court will decide whether the Election Commissions model code of conduct comes into force the day polls are announced or only when the formal notification is issued.         
	The code now comes into effect the day an election is announced. The commission usually issues the formal notification three weeks after the dates are made public.         
	However, two years ago, Tamil Nadu had refused to accept the commissions order to transfer Chennai police commissioner R. Nataraj over his alleged pro-Jayalalithaa remarks.        
	The state government had claimed that the panels directives became binding only from the day the notification was issued.         
	Madras High Court had upheld this view, prompting the poll panel to appeal to the apex court.         
	Today, appearing for the poll panel, senior counsel Fali S. Nariman said the key issue was the commissions power to transfer officials before issue of the notification.         
	This is an issue that occurs constantly, he said, urging the court to decide the matter once and for all.         
	Tamil Nadu counsel Prakasam, however, said the case should be disposed of as the issue had lost its relevance. But Nariman insisted that the powers of the commission should be laid down.        
	 A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, asked the state government to file its response within four weeks.         
	The commission has argued that during the interval between the announcement of polls and the issuance of a formal notification, it has to initiate several steps to ensure free and fair elections.         
	It has to assess the infrastructure and scrutinise the postings of officials, including police.        
	The commission said its powers and jurisdiction in the interregnum had been recognised by the apex court in an order dated April 26, 2001.         
	The court had then clarified that the model code of conduct would come into operation from the date the polls are announced, it said.

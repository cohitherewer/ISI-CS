	New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): The Delhi serial blasts drew condemnation today from Muslim organisations that termed the attack an act of cowardice by inhuman people.        
	The entire Muslim community is against such terrorist acts. These blasts have proved that Delhi police are a total failure in handling such situations... said S.M. Asif, the national president of the All India Minorities Front.        
	The Indian Muslim Council-USA also denounced the synchronised blasts that happened ahead of the festival season for Hindus as well as the minority community.         
	Our sympathies are with the victims and their families, its president Rasheed Ahmed said. The outfit called upon the government and the police to put the security of people ahead of communal politics.        
	The All India United Muslim Morcha said the blasts were an attack on sovereignty, integrity and secularism.         
	These are the work of coward beasts who do not believe in any human values or ethics of any kind, said the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.        
	Kashmir concern        
	In Srinagar, several separatist outfits condemned the blasts, saying the killing of innocent persons is an inhuman act.         
	Both factions of the Hurriyat Conference and the JKLF said such heart-rending tragedies were a matter of grave concern for everyone.

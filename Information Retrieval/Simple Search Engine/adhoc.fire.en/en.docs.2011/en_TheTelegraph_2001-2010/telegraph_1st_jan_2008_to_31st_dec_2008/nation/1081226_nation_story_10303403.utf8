	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 25: A helicopter hovered over Kandhamal today as Christians in the riot-scarred Orissa district went to church to pray.         
	State police chief Manmohan Praharaj said the helicopter was provided by the Centre for aerial patrol in Kandhamal and the neighbouring district of Gajapati.         
	Praharaj, who himself went on aerial patrols, said: Surveillance by helicopter helps build confidence among people who are afraid to come out of their homes. I have visited several churches in Kandhamal and people were happy with the security arrangements.         
	The archbishop of the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, Raphael Cheenath, agreed the prayers had been peaceful everywhere. We had a very peaceful Christmas at all places in Kandhamal and in the coastal districts, he said.        
	Communal riots broke out in Orissa in August-September after the murder of a VHP monk, Swami Laxmananda Saraswati. Sixty people died, most of them Christians.        
	Sangh parivar outfits had called a bandh on Christmas but at L.K. Advanis instance it was called off as the BJP did not want to lose its ally, the ruling Biju Janata Dal, before general elections.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram called up Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday urging him to ensure a peaceful Christmas. Naveen directed the police to take all possible steps to ensure a trouble-free Christmas.

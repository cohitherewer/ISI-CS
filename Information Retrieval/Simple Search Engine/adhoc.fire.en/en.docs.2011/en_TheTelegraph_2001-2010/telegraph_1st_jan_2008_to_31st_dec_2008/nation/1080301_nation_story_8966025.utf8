	Cuttack, Feb. 29: The sine die closure declared by Sambapur University following the alleged rape of a student triggered ripples of protest at SCB Medical College here today.         
	Students of the medical college demanded withdrawal of the university closure following protests over the rape. The medics took out a rally from the campus and staged a demonstration at Manglabag. The college union later submitted a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 12: A scheduled caste undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has alleged discrimination after he and 11 other SC and Scheduled Tribe students were asked to leave this month.        
	The student has complained to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the apex body for redressing the grievances of such groups. The commission has summoned the IITs director on June 17.        
	Twenty students in all, including eight from the general category, were asked to leave in the first week of this month through letters that cited unsatisfactory performance as the reason. All are either completing their first or second year.        
	These students did not respond to attempts to help them improve their performance. The IITs have a minimum benchmark that all students are expected to meet. We have only followed rules in the prospectus, S.R. Kale, the dean of undergraduate studies at the IIT, said.         
	Kale confirmed having received the summons and said the institute was prepared to face the commission.        
	IIT students are marked on a cumulative grade point scale where scores range from zero to 10. Marks are awarded after each of the two semesters in a year. If the average  the weighted mean over all semesters  is less than 4 in a year, a pupil can be asked to leave. Students in the final two years of their four-year undergraduate course can appeal against the order, but not those in their first two years.

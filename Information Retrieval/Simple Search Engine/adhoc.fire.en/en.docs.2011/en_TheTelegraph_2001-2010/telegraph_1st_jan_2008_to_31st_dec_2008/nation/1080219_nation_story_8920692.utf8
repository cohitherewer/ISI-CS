	New Delhi, Feb. 18 (PTI): Romesh Sharma, an alleged frontman of Dawood Ibrahim, and five others were sentenced today to rigorous life imprisonment for hatching a pathetic, chilling and sinister conspiracy to eliminate his fashion designer girlfriend nine years ago.        
	An innocent life was consigned to her heavenly abode by putting an untimely end, additional sessions judge S.P. Garg said.        
	The court also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on Sharma for conspiring to murder his 29-year-old live-in partner, Kunjum Budhiraja.

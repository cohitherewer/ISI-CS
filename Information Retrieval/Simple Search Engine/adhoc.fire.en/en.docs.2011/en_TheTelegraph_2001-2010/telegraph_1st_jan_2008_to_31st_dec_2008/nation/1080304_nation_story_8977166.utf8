     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, March 3: A mob took the law in their hands at Bakhtiyarpur this afternoon and killed two men, who allegedly were trying to flee after firing at a man over a land dispute.
    
	Mohammed Azhar (29) and Mohammed Aslam (30), residents of Chakdaulat village under Bakhtiyarpur police station, were trying to escape after shopkeeper Umashankar Yadav (26) was shot dead by them in Teka Bigha village. 
    
	Yadav was allegedly shot by Azhar from a licensed revolver after a heated exchange at the latters shop around 11.30am. 
    
	Aslam and Azhar were on a motorcycle and were on their way to a field near Teka Bigha village when Yadav stopped them. The two families have been fighting over a plot of land for some time now. 
    
	Patna rural superintendent of police Upendra Kumar Sinha told The Telegraph that Aslam and Azhar were intercepted by a group of irate villagers after Yadav was killed. The mob, carrying lathis, started beating up the two, later snatched their licensed revolver and shot them dead with it. 
    
	Though we have recovered the motorcycle, the revolver owned by Azhars father, Mohammed Kalam, is missing, said Sinha, adding that the police had intensified patrolling in both the villages. 
    
	Sinha said: This case seems to be a case of revenge. We are trying to maintain law and order in the two villages. A case has been lodged against unknown persons, but no arrest has been made.

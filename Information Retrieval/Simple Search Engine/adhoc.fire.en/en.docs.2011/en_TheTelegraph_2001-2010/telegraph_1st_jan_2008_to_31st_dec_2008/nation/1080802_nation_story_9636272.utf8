The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defence licence raj comes to end
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Defence licence raj comes to end
  - Govt revises military purchase policy         SUJAN DUTTA                           Antony                                         
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Centre today began dismantling a licence raj in defence production and goaded the private sector towards large-scale joint ventures with foreign manufacturers in a new policy to procure military equipment worth an estimated $50 billion in the next five years.         
	The new and revised policy has been in the works for over six months but with the Left out of the government now, it has become more convenient for the defence establishment to implement it.         
	The purchases that are planned will make India one of the largest markets for weapons makers. About 30 per cent  $15 billion  is estimated to be re-invested in the country by foreign vendors in partnership with Indian companies under the offsets policy.         
	This DPP (defence procurement procedure) is revolutionary. We are doing away with the licence raj. Till now, the industries had to get a licence from the defence ministry and the department of industrial production. Now they dont need a licence from us. This will create a level playing field. We are experimenting, defence minister A.K. Antony said this morning while announcing the new policy. The policy takes effect from September 1.         
	Antony did not clarify the governments position on a move to grant Raksha Udyog Ratna (RUR) status to select private companies to treat them on a par with defence public sector units like Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.         
	The Tatas, the Mahindras and Larsen amp; Toubro are among the companies tipped to get RUR status. They are in talks with major arms makers and military equipment suppliers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and British Aerospace for joint ventures.         
	Trade unions and the Left are opposed to the RUR policy.         
	Defence procurement procedures are to be reviewed every two years. The liberalisation in the offsets policy that allows greater play to private companies comes at the insistence of foreign manufacturers who are participating in big-ticket military competitions such as the procurement of 126 multi-role combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force at an estimated $10 billion.         
	DPP-2008 will also allow the foreign companies who win orders to bank offsets, meaning they can create reinvestment projects in two years after winning a big order in anticipation of future obligations.         
	But the DPP has still not addressed a key issue raised by western, mainly American, companies  indirect offsets, which would allow re-investment in sectors other than in defence.         
	Antony said DPP-2008 has three objectives at its core  transparency in deals with no agents (middlemen) being allowed, speedy purchases and indigenisation.         
	Nearly 70 per cent of Indias military equipment is imported. The capital expenditure earmarked in the defence budget for procurement of new equipment in the current year is Rs 37,000 crore.

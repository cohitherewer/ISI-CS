	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 7: Organ donation in Orissa is yet to catch up its estimated pace, feel experts.        
	The waiting list for organ transplants has been running uneven as demand exceeds supply. In fact, hospitals here are equipped only to conduct kidney and eye transplant.         
	We have been taking up the matter with some of the leading private hospitals like Kalinga Hospital, Sum Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Science and Hi-tech Medical College. We are hopeful that by the year-end necessary systems will be in place. We also expect to get the required approvals from the competent authority, said T.N. Panda, the managing director of Multi Organ Transplantation and Human amp; Educational Research (MOTHER).        
	The organisation serves as the vital link between a donor and recipient and takes steps for identification of donors and the retrieval, preservation and transportation of organs for transplantation.         
	Figures reveal that there have been about 17 kidney transplants this year at Kalinga Hospital and Hi-tech Hospital in Bhubaneswar. Recipients are chosen on the grounds of need, longest waiting time and by blood group and if necessary, by tissue characteristics.         
	While there are about three to four kidney transplants every month, non-availability of organs has been posing a huge problem for patients waiting for transplants who do not know where to go        
	There is an immediate need to encourage and promote cadaveric organ transplantation and stress on the procurement of organs for transplantation and promotion of organ donation. The aim has to be increasing the availability of and access to donor organs for saving life of patients, Governor M.C. Bhandare said at the foundation day of MOTHER today.        
	The railways has also granted concession in basic fares to patients while travelling alone or with an escort for dialysis or kidney transplant to recognised hospitals.

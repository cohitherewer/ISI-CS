          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, July 25: Chief of a Bodh Gaya-based residential madarsa has been jailed on charges of sodomy.         
	The madarsa head, Shaheeruddin, was arrested late on Thursday evening after a 13-year-old pupil lodged a complaint against him alleging that the priest had been exploiting him for six weeks.         
	The victim, a resident of Malmal village of Madhubani district, met senior police officers with his guardian at the janata durbar on Thursday to register the complaint.         
	According to Bodh Gaya deputy superintendent of police Rajvansh Singh, doctor Sartaj Khan of Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital examined the victim. During the test, the doctor saw clear signs of sodomy.         
	The victim also informed officers that he was last sodomised on July 20, 2008. The student first revealed his trauma to one of his madarsa friends and then to his family elders.         
	The police picked up the teacher yesterday and lodged a case under Section 377. The news was received across the town with disbelief as Shaheeruddin is deeply respected in his community.         
	The madarsa, in the eye of the storm, is run on charity money. Shaheeruddin is regarded as the main resource mobiliser. Hundreds of his supporters laid a siege around the police station on Thursday midnight demanding his release.        
	Shaheeruddin supporters alleged that the charges were cooked up by the boy, who, a supporter said, was awarded corporal punishment by the institution head recently.

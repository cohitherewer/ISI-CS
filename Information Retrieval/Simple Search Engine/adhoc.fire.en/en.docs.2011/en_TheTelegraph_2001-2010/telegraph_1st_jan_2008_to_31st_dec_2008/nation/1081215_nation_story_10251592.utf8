	Cuttack, Dec. 14: Indian Post will bring out an envelope with special cancellation as part of the 8th Barabati Nrutyotsav scheduled to start at the Killa Maidan here next week.        
	The envelope and special cancellation depicting Barabati Fort, Ravenshaw College and high court would be released by the postmaster general on the inaugural day of the national festival on December 20.        
	Odissi Nrutya Mandal has been organising the Barabati Nrutyotsav since 2001.        
	To promote classical Indian dance and music, the postal department would also organise Uniculturepex-2008, a philatelic exhibition on all dance and music forms of the world, during the week-long dance festival, sources said.        
	Several other features would be introduced in the fest to be organised in collaboration with the state tourism department and the Cuttack district administration.        
	For the first time, we have decided to dedicate each evening to Odissi dance and music maestros who are no more with us, Odissi Nrutya Mandal general secretary Guru Ashish Kumar Das said.        
	Fifteen other dance troupes, six of them from Calcutta and one from Assam, would participate in the festival.

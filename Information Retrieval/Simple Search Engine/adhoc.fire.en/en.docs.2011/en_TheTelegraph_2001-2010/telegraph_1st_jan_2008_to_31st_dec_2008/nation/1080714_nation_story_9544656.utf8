The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Collectors to monitor rice scheme
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Collectors to monitor rice scheme
          SUBRAT DAS                          All for polls                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 13: Orissa Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, after declaring his party and government is ready for polls, has started to take steps to gear up the official machinery to carry out his political agenda.         
	Naveen has effected bureaucratic reshuffles at the secretariat as well as in the district to streamline the official machinery.         
	Taking cue from the spectacular poll success of the N.T.R. government in Andhra Pradesh in early eighties after a rice scheme, five days ago Naveen announced a similar populist scheme of providing 25kg rice every month to all BPL families at a subsidised rate of Rs 2 per kg.         
	The government has issued an official notification to implement the announced scheme.         
	Taking another step forward, Naveen has decided to convene collectors conference tomorrow in the capital to ensure effective implementation of the scheme.        
	Sources said the chief minister is laying extra emphasis on the successful implementation of the scheme that may help influence the poor electorate in a big way.         
	Around 55.5 lakh families across the state are expected to benefit from the scheme.         
	The move has twin objectives: to woo the poor who constitute more than 47 per cent of the population in the state and to snub the UPA government at the Centre for the price rise of essential commodities.         
	Announcement of the rice scheme has obviously unnerved the Opposition parties. They apprehend that the scheme, if properly implemented, would tilt the balance in favour of the ruling BJD-BJP combine in the next polls.         
	The government has, thus, decided to ensure proper implementation of the scheme and is planning to make the collectors, the pivots in the administration, accountable for its success or failure.         
	Sources said the chief minister is going to ask the collectors to ensure the success of the scheme and take stern action against unscrupulous traders and corrupt officials.         
	The food supplies and consumer welfare department has prepared guidelines for the collectors. Officials in the secretariat said that the implementation of flagship schemes of the government would be reviewed at the collectors conference.         
	In the past few years, Naveen Patnaik has launched state-funded schemes such as Biju KBK Yojana, Gopabandhu Gramin Yojana, Madhubabu Pension Yojana, Biju Grama Jyoti Yojana and Mo Kudia Yojana, after charging the UPA government at the Centre of neglecting Orissa, an NDA-ruled state.         
	Last week, the government finalised an agriculture policy that was due for eight years. The policy includes assistance and subsidy for the farming community, a major vote bank in the state.

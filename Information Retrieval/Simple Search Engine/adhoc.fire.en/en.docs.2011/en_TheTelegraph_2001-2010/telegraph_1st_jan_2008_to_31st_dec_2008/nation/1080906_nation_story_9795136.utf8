  - Kashmiri wears student union crown for first time        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Adnan Nayeem Asmi. (Prem Singh)                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: He has little of the hair that once made Mahendra Singh Dhoni famous, but Adnan Nayeem Asmi is keen to emulate other characteristics of his idol to build bridges of his own.         
	Dhoni is so cool and calm. Hes my favourite cricketer. I would like to learn from his positive qualities as a leader, he says, speaking with a distinctive Kashmiri drawl.         
	I get tense under pressure, he smiles shyly.         
	As Kashmir simmers with calls for azaadi (freedom), the Srinagar boy has emerged the toast of one of Indias most elite colleges  with Hindi songs on his lips and a pledge to advance democracy, at least in his college.         
	Asmi was on Wednesday elected president of the Student Union Society (SUS) at Delhis St. Stephens College, the first Kashmiri to hold the post in the institutions 152-year history.         
	A third-year student of the bachelor of arts programme  a restructured form of what was earlier the B.A. pass course  Asmi has worked with the SUS for the past two years.         
	In Kashmir, all student unions are banned. I would never have got the opportunity of working in a student body there. I wanted to utilise the opportunity here, he says, adjusting the rim of his glasses.         
	Sincerity peers out from behind those spectacles, and it is hard to doubt what he says.         
	Asmi was voted the most hardworking SUS member in his first year, and was in the student cabinet last year.         
	He went to school in Srinagar  Tyndale Biscoe School till Class XI and then S.P. High School  and topped the state board examinations.         
	My parents wanted me to study further outside Kashmir. I gave the St. Stephens interview and was lucky to be selected, he says.         
	Asmis father, a State Bank of India employee in Srinagar, wants him to join the Indian Administrative Service after college. It took the boy a month-and-a-half to convince his father to allow him to contest for president of the SUS.         
	My father wanted me to study in the third year for the IAS. I have finally managed to convince him to let me drop a year if necessary to study for the IAS.         
	In college, Asmi wants to deepen the roots of democracy. The SUS president  traditionally no more powerful than school head boys or head girls  should take stands, he says. Over the last two years, the SUS has slowly become more active. That transformation needs to be strengthened. There are issues on which we will support the administration vocally, but at times we may need to oppose them, too.         
	The Adnan Sami fan  he insists he likes the songs and not just the name, which he shares  says he wants to involve students who opposed him in the polls in his work.         
	The SUS has worked like an autocratic organisation, not paying heed to opposing views. I will involve all those who opposed and make them part of the student cabinet.        
	He wants to start a class representative council  a body of selected representatives of each class  that he will involve in the SUS.         
	Asmi wants to build bridges back home, too  both literally and figuratively. As an IAS officer, I would like to be posted in Kashmir. Civil servants have a fantastic opportunity to contribute to nation building. I want to build roads and bridges across Kashmir.

	New Delhi, April 21: Biochemical fingerprints of urine may offer a new way to assess the risk of blood pressure, heart disease or stroke in different populations, a new international study has indicated.         
	Researchers have found that patterns of metabolites the broken down by-products of food and drink  in urine significantly vary from country to country and even within populations, influenced by peoples diet and the bacteria they harbour in their guts.         
	Jeremy Nicholson at Imperial College, London, and his colleagues analysed 4,630 samples of urine from four populations from around the world in a metabonomic study  comparing the metabolites excreted by different populations.         
	Their results, published today in the journal Nature, point to novel urinary biochemicals that appear to be related to blood pressure, a key risk factor for both coronary heart disease and stroke.         
	The metabolic profile of a person captures diet, the gut microbes and the persons genetic make-up, Nicholson, a professor of biological chemistry at Imperial College said over the phone.         
	Gut microbes may vary significantly across populations, he said. A study published earlier this year had revealed differences between Chinese and American gut microbes.         
	Youre born with your mothers microbes, but then you get new ones from the environment and from the diet. Exposure to antibiotics can also influence the microbial pattern in the gut, Nicholson said.         
	The researchers picked urine samples from volunteers in cities in north and south China, Japan, the US and the UK and identified nearly 30 metabolites that appeared linked to blood pressure.         
	They found that high levels of alanine  a by-product of animal protein  was associated with high blood pressure. But two other metabolites  formate and hippurate  were inversely related to blood pressure. The higher their levels in the urine, the lower the blood pressure.         
	Hippurate and formate are both connected to gut microbes, Nicholson said. They are formed when starch is broken down by microbes in the human gut.         
	Although genes may determine the risk of certain diseases, these findings highlight in a new way the importance of diet in raising or reducing the risk of chronic lifestyle related diseases.

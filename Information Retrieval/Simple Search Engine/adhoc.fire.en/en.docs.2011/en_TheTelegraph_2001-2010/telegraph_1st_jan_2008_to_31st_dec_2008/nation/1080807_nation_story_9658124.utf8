          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A masked protester in Kashmir. (AFP)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 6: One more land protester died in riot-rocked Jammu today even as a separatist leader in Muslim-majority Kashmir decided to trample the Line of Control in an emotional appeal to break the Valleys economic blockade.        
	Hurriyat Conference leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq called for breaching the LoC to restore the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road link as the Kashmir Valley remained cut off from the rest of the country.        
	We will announce the date after August 15, he said. We urge the people of Muzaffarabad to help us in this period of crisis.        
	The peace bus to and from Muzaffarabad now runs every fortnight. Talks to begin trade between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad are due, but there has been no progress so far.        
	Observers said the Muzaffarabad chalo call was aimed at mobilising masses against the blockade of the Srinagar-Jammu highway by Amarnath protesters and take the land battle to the rival camp.        
	The Valley shut down following a call for civil curfew by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani to protest an all-party meeting in Delhi.        
	In Jammu, the army opened fire in Kathua, killing one person and injuring two.        
	Protesters stoned the house of former PDP minister Manjeet Singh in Vijaypur, and injured a security officer.        
	People from villages crossed the 70-metre-wide Tawi river  the waist-deep water flows at a moderate speed  by foot to join protests in Jammu after the army prevented them from entering the city.         
	Jammu deputy commissioner Mandeep Bhandari said the situation, on the 14th day of the strike, was better. Curfew was relaxed for four hours in the morning so that people could do purchases.        
	The state governments efforts to defuse the crisis by revamping the Amarnath shrine board, however, flopped. Eight members put in their papers today to pave the way for the reconstitution.         
	But the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, heading the agitation, said it would settle for nothing less than revocation of the order cancelling land transfer to the shrine board.        
	 In Kashmir, Mirwaiz said he was not against separate statehood for Jammu but only in two-and-a-half Hindu-dominated districts.        
	The Dogras are trying to project it as an issue between Jammu and Kashmir, but the fact is that they live in just two-and-a-half districts of Jammu province. People of Rajouri, Poonch and Doda and parts of Udhampur are with us, he said.        
	Mirwaiz, however, seems to be talking of an earlier division when Jammu had six districts. The province now has 10 districts, of which Hindus dominate five and Muslims the rest.

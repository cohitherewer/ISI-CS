	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Bose Corporation India, the acoustics company, has shut down its research and development centre in Bangalore for lack of availability of skilled engineers.        
	The operations at our R amp;D centre in Bangalore shut last year. While the set-up started with a few people, we could not continue since there were not enough skilled people who specialised in embedded software, said Ratish Pandey, general manager.        
	Five engineers in the Bangalore centre have been relocated to the US.

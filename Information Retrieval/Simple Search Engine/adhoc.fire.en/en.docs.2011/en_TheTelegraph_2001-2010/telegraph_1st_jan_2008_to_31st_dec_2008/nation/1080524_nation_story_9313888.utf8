The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Motive surprises more than daughter killing   Affair not reason enough to kill: Experts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Motive surprises more than daughter killing   Affair not reason enough to kill: Experts
          G.S. MUDUR                          People gather outside the Talwars residence in Noida on Friday. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, May 23: Fathers and mothers have in the past burnt, drowned, hacked, strangled and shot their own children from various motives, according to medical studies on parents turning killers.        
	But a father slicing the throat of a teenaged daughter to keep a shroud over a scandal would be a rare case, scientists said.        
	Noida-based dentist Rajesh Talwar was arrested today on the charge of killing his daughter Aarushi, 15, because she was threatening to expose his extramarital affair or, according to an alternative version, the familys lifestyle.        
	A psychologist familiar with similar situations said such a response from a father would surprise him.        
	I know fathers with teenage daughters who resent the extramarital relationships, but Ive never seen a father fly into a rage (over such an issue), said Rajat Mitra in New Delhi, who has specialised in criminal psychology.        
	Fathers in such situations typically become defensive with their daughters. They struggle to get them to look at their point of view.        
	Most filicide (parents killing their children) cases in India involve mothers killing their children and committing suicide, or impulse killings, or honour killings, said Bansi Dhar Gupta, head of forensic medicine at Medical College, Jamnagar. Gupta has just completed a five-year study on eight cases of mothers murdering their children in the Jamnagar region.        
	Psychiatrists have studied filicide for over 40 years, hoping to decipher psychiatric symptoms shown by the killers that might help identify children at risk.        
	Studies of child murders in Sweden and Australia during the 1980s and 1990s had found that about 85 per cent of the children were killed by their parents, according to one review of filicides.        
	Even the small island nation of Fiji recorded 49 filicides  13 children killed by fathers and 39 by mothers  from 1982 through 1994.        
	Indias National Crime Records Bureau recorded 1,450 murders of children in 2006, but does not specify how many were killed by their parents.        
	Any murder is an aberration for society, said Vivek Benegal, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore. But the act of killing a person youre responsible for is higher on the scale of horror and far more difficult to understand.        
	In one of the earliest analyses of maternal filicides, US psychiatrist Phillip Resnick found that altruistic motives  murders stemming from love  accounted for half the instances. The murders were intended to protect the child from real or imagined suffering.        
	Gupta said each of the eight cases he and his colleagues had examined over the past five years could be classified as altruistic. The mother appeared fed up with her life and worried about what would happen to the child, or children, after she was dead. So she killed them and committed suicide.        
	But impulsive behaviour and personality disorders play a part, too.        
	Some people have a short fuse, and some have different ways of valuing what is good and what is bad, Benegal said. Some individuals do not find it necessary to follow social values or taboos.        
	In Fiji, a father flew into a violent rage over his wifes reluctance to warm his dinner and killed four of their children. Another man killed his wife and five children because he suspected his wife of infidelity.         
	One man killed an infant because he could not stop her from crying.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Utsav Bhasin after his arrest on Friday. Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Utsav Bhasin, 20, who sneaked out with his fathers BMW and rammed it into two young men who had quit their jobs to pursue their dream to be filmmakers, was arrested today.        
	One of his victims, Anuj Singh, 25, has been declared brain dead. His brother Kshitij today expressed the familys wish to donate his organs.        
	Anuj and his childhood friend, Mrigank Srivastava, 29, who is injured, were brought to the AIIMS early yesterday after the speeding BMW knocked down their motorcycle near the Moolchand flyover in south Delhi around 3am.         
	They were returning home to South Extension after watching a film.         
	Utsav, whose father N.K. Bhasin had hired a chauffeur for his son because he did not trust his driving, has told police he was out on a long drive after dinner at 24/7, an upscale restaurant in Greater Kailash. While family members said he had left with sister Sakshi, 16, the police said a girlfriend was in the car with Utsav when he crashed into the motorcycle.        
	Grandfather Narendra Bhasin, who is ill, said: We had dinner together at 10pm. After that I went to my room. I got to know about the accident only around 7am when I woke up and put on the TV. I dont know where the two (Utsav and Sakshi) have gone. I dont have any idea who was driving.        
	After speculating initially that it must be a case of drink-driving, DCP South H.G.S. Dhaliwal said: It is an accident case. We are investigating from all angles. We have arrested Bhasin from ISBT at Kashmiri Gate where he was probably trying to flee the city. Utsav has a valid licence till 2019.        
	Utsav was granted bail on a Rs 20,000 surety and the condition that he stay within 30km of the police station and avoid talking to the media.         
	The accident comes within days of the verdict in the BMW hit-and-run case, in which another rich kid, Sanjeev Nanda, had run over and killed six persons while driving drunk. Nanda has been sentenced to five years in prison.        
	Utsavs father, an industrialist, is out of the country and his mother died of breast cancer three years ago.        
	Other than the six-month-old BMW, the family has three cars  Honda Accord, Honda City and Chevrolet Optra  with a driver for each.         
	Utsav, a former student of Delhi Public School and the Institute for Integrated Learning in Management, had learnt to drive a year ago. He was to leave for Singapore on September 23 to pursue his MBA.

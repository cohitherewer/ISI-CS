                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJD leader quits
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           What now?                                  
	Bhubanswar, April 30: Senior BJD leader and former finance minister Panchanan Kanungo today quit the party citing lack of internal democracy and failure of the coalition government to fulfil electoral promises.         
	Announcing his resignation at a news meet today, Kanungo said he was quitting because he did not want to be a part of the autocratic attitude of the leadership and the misrule.         
	Comparing the BJD to the Mughal empire under Aurangzeb, the disenchanted leader said the party was suffering from infighting. He added that the party would meet the same fate as that of the Mughal empire that collapsed and disintegrated.         
	BJD has drifted from the principles and ideology on the basis of which it was founded 10 years ago and the coalition government had failed to fulfil promises given to the people, he alleged. The former finance minister lamented that his suggestions for the formulation of a mining policy and agriculture policy were not implemented.         
	Kanungo alleged that the BJD-BJP government was promoting the interest of the mining lobby sacrificing the states interest. The law and order machinery has collapsed and it is evident from the spurt in crime and corruption.        
	The rebel leader did not reveal his future plan, but sources close to him said he was likely to join Nationalist Congress Party or Samrudda Odisha, a regional outfit.         
	BJD general secretary Surya Narayan Patro, on the other hand, said Kanungo has the habit of changing colours for his personal gain.

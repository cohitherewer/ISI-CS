          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The BJP stuck to its stand on the Jammu agitation a day after the Prime Ministers Independence Day appeal to political parties not to divide people in the name of religion and to unite to resolve the crisis.        
	Speaking informally to the media, a senior BJP leader today blamed the mess on the Union home ministrys alleged incompetence.        
	He also attached little significance to the governments proposal for a neutral mediator between the leaders of the Jammu and Valley agitations.        
	Let the land transfer order be restored and we will convince the Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, the BJP general secretary said.        
	This was a candid admission that the BJP, which describes the Jammu protests as a peoples movement, held decisive influence on the agitation.        
	Taking a cue from L.K. Advanis August 13 letter to the Prime Minister, which accused the government of suppressing the nationalist sentiments in Jammu, the BJP general secretary ridiculed the Congresss progress from Muslim appeasement to separatist appeasement.        
	The government erred on four counts. First, it succumbed to the pressure mounted by the separatists in the Valley. Second, it did nothing to counter the false propaganda that the land transfer was permanent and meant for colonisation, the BJP leader said.        
	Third, it did not counter the propaganda about the economic blockade (the BJP denies theres an economic blockade of the Valley) and fourth, it totally misread the nationalist feelings of the people of Jammu.        
	On the proposal for a neutral mediator, he said: The government is supposed to be the best neutral arbitrator. And there is nothing to adjudicate. The government has to take a decision.              
	The party believes the Valley erupted on a false pretext while Jammu has a genuine sense of hurt. It says the protests in Jammu have not been violent or anti-national.        
	Even yesterday, the Sangharsh Samiti boycotted the governments Independence Day functions but organised parallel functions in every district, the leader said.        
	While the government function in Jammu had 250 people, the citizens I-Day celebration was attended by 50,000 people. The government should see this reality. Unfortunately, the government has alienated itself both in the Valley and in Jammu.        
	The BJP is critical of the role played by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its leader, Mehbooba Mufti. It thinks Mehbooba has been speaking the language of separatists while National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah is a nationalist.        
	It feels the Congress played a negative role in the state by forming a coalition government with the PDP, which ended up joining the march to Muzaffarabad along with the separatists.

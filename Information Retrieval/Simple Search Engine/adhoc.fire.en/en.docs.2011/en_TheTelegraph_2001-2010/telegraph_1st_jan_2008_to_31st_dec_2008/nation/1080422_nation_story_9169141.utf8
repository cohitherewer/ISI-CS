          SANTOSH SINGH                      Aurangzeb. Telegraph picture                          
	Patna, April 21: A Bhagalpur rickshaw-puller was beaten up by a mob as well as police personnel and dragged by a bike for allegedly stealing a gold chain on August 27.         
	Nearly eight months on, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) asked the Bihar government last week to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation to the victim and his family, but the state machinery in the Bhagalpur district appears to be clueless about the directive.         
	Nathnagar circle officer Kundan Kumar said: I have not received any order from the district magistrates office and have never dealt with such a case. Also, I am not conversant with the process of paying compensation.        
	Sanjay Kumar Modi, the lawyer of the humiliated richshaw-puller, Aurangzeb alias Salim, told The Telegraph: We have heard about the NHRC order, but no government official has approached us so far.         
	Salim (21), has been lodged in the Bhagalpur jail since August 27, when the bike-drag incident took place.         
	TV channels beamed footages of L.B. Singh, a personnel of Nathnagar police station, tying Salims hands to his motorcycle and dragging him along a Bhagalpur market. Constable Ramchandra Rai was seen beating him up. A mob, too, joined in.        
	On April 18, a team of the human rights panel that probed into the incident found the two policemen guilty and asked the Bihar government to give a compensation package to Salim for his humiliation and torture.        
	The NHRC took suo motu cognisance of the matter that had evoked a public outcry and extensive media coverage.         
	Last September, the human rights team visited Bhagalpur to record the statements of deputy superintendent of police (town) Anjani Kumar and officer in charge of Nathnagar police station Mohammad Javed. The team also met Salim in the jail and recorded his statement.        
	Modi, the lawyer of Salim, said his client had been languishing in jail for no fault of his. He insisted that Salim was not guilty and was passing through Manaskamna Chowk with his family to visit Bihpur when some people suspected him to be a chain-snatcher and beat him up.        
	He said that the two erring personnel, temporarily suspended under media pressure, were later transferred and reinstated. Now that the human rights panel order has indicted them, the Bihar government should initiate fresh action.        
	Modi has filed a complaint in the Bhagalpur chief judicial magistrates court against the police atrocity.         
	The court has already recorded the statement of Salims aunt and would record the versions of his sister and grandmother soon.

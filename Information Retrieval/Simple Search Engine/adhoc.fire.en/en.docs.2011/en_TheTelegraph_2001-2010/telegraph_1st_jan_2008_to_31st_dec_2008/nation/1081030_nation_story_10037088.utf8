                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     All anger and little unity in heartland 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Politicians in the Hindi heartland erupted in anger at the killing of a migrant labourer in Mumbai but they hardly spoke the same language.        
	Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh tried giving a clarion call to political parties from north India to uphold the honour of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar but Lalu Prasad concentrated his firepower on the BJP.        
	For a while it sounded like an Amar Singh-Lalu Prasad chorus but not after the Samajwadi leader dared the railway minister and Ram Vilas Paswan to resign from the cabinet in protest against the Vilasrao Deshmukh governments failure in controlling the situation.        
	Lalu Prasad dismissed the Samajwadi leaders suggestion of resignations lightly and later spoke to Amar on phone.         
	Amar also suggested that politicians in Uttar Pradesh should unite like those in Bihar  Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Paswan had set aside years of animosity and met the Prime Minister after the gun-wielding Rahul Raj was shot down in Mumbai.         
	But Mayavati, the Samajwadi Partys bitter rival and Uttar Pradesh chief minister, had not publicly responded to the suggestion till this evening. Mayavati wrote to the Centre demanding measures to check the attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra but did not refer to Amars proposal that all north Indian politicians should go to Maharashtra to instill confidence among the people of the region living there.        
	On a day threats flew thick and fast, none of the north Indian leaders approached leaders or MPs from Maharashtra to search for a solution.        
	Samajwadi leader and MP Mohan Singh criticised Lalu Prasad, Paswan and Nitish for raising the provincial placard for Bihar when the trio met the Prime Minister recently. It is only creating more regional and provincial politics while this country goes towards bifurcation, he said.        
	NCP leader Sharad Pawars daughter, Supriya Sule, refused to comment on the issue. Pawar and Sule are in Baramati for Diwali celebrations.        
	Although Lalu Prasad did not bite the resignation bait, he did not spare Deshmukh. Terming the state government weak, Lalu Prasad warned that the railways might stop servicing any state that did not ensure security.        
	The railway minister hastened to add that his warning was not meant to any particular state, suggesting that it could also be a reminder to Bihar chief minister Nitish.         
	Agitators had set trains on fire in Bihar last week after Raj Thackerays supporters had beaten up railway job-seekers appearing for a test in Maharashtra  the flashpoint for the current controversy.        
	Lalu Prasad spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Deshmukh about the incidents.        
	Launching an attack on L.K. Advani, Lalu Prasad accused the BJP leader of not saying a word against the Shiv Sena which used derogatory language against north Indians. The Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna had recently published an editorial that claimed credit for attacks on north Indians.         
	Amar warned that the Congresss fortunes would be affected in the forthcoming polls because of the incidents in Maharashtra.

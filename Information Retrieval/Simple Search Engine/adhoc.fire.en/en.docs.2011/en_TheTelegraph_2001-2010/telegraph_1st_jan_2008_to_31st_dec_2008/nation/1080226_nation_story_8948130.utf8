          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, Feb. 25: A day after an unconscious and possibly abused student was found on the university premises, tension prevailed in Sambalpur and the Burla university campus.         
	Students of Gangadhar Meher (autonomous) College in Sambalpur and Jyoti Vihar in Burla blocked roads and the national highway demanding arrest and punishment of the culprits. Collector Pradipta Patnaik discussed the matter with the college students and assured prompt action. Thereafter, the students withdrew the blockade.         
	However, students of Sambalpur University continued blocking NH-6 till the evening and ransacked the university office protesting against the callous attitude of the hostel warden and hostel superintendent, which allegedly led to the incident.         
	Sambalpur superintendent of police Sanjay Kumar said the police today arrested four youths allegedly involved in the incident. I will request the fast track court to dispose the case immediately and give instant justice to the victim, Kumar told the reporters today.        
	The girl is yet to regain consciousness, but her condition is said to be better.

	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Zeeshan, one of the men arrested in connection with last Saturdays blasts, was writing exams during yesterdays police encounter in Jamianagar, the Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) said today.        
	Officials at the IIPM confirmed that Zeeshan was a student, who had joined the institute in 2005 for a two-year course. But he had failed to clear 25 per cent of his papers, and was yesterday appearing for supplementary tests  in social marketing and rural marketing  till late afternoon, a top IIPM source said on condition of anonymity.        
	The exams started around 10am and ended only around 4pm. We have attendance records that show he was writing the exams, the source said.         
	The shootout took place after 11 in the morning.         
	Zeeshan needed 160 credits to get a degree, but had managed only 120, the source said. He had recorded 79 per cent attendance during his two years at the IIPM, which the source described as above average.         
	At the end of his course, Zeeshan had got a placement at an export firm called Monarch International, the source said.        
	He was normal and never gave the slightest hint that he could be involved in any such activity. We hope the allegations are not true, PTI quoted an IIPM spokesperson as saying.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     IAS officer minus duty
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 30: Senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik was relieved from his duty today after he was divested from official responsibilities and declared an officer without duty by the government last night.         
	On Monday, Patnaik had admitted before the police that he had met gangster Raja Acharya on March 16 and had asked Biranchi Das to arrange a meeting to sort out the conflict between Raja and actress Leslie Tripathy.         
	On the other hand, Chagala, the co-accused in murder, had claimed that the bureaucrat was the main conspirator in Biranchi murder case and had paid Rs 2 lakh to Raja to eliminate the coach.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik decided to strip him off official responsibilities yesterday night after discussing the matter with director-general of police G.C. Nanda. Such behaviour is inappropriate for a senior official. Our action is justified, Naveen told the media today.         
	Patnaik was the commerce and transport secretary and had additional charge of the chairman of Orissa State Road Transport Corporation. He was also working as the nodal officer for Posco steel plant project.         
	The tainted officer handed over the charges of commerce and transport department to energy secretary S.C. Mohapatra this morning and drove back home.         
	After being declared officer without duty, Patnaik will draw his salary, but will not be assigned any duty and allotted any office chamber.         
	Patnaik told the reporters that he had no regret. My conscience is clear. I tried to help a girl (Leslie), who was threatened by a gangster, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Chagala was sent to the Jharpada jail today. His narco- test reports are yet to come out.

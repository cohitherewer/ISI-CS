	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Mamata Banerjee justified her rejection of the governments latest Singur offer by citing in public the word maximum in the Sunday agreement but sources said she did not harp on the point during the meeting with the chief minister this evening.        
	The absence of such an insistence in private has made a section of officials feel that she might still be open to a rapprochement after displaying maximum resistance in public to any compromise.        
	Mamata feels to the maximum means most of the land for rehabilitation will be from inside the Nano complex while the government says the words stand for as much as possible.        
	Sources said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told her during the meeting that it would be difficult to get the Tatas to agree to part with land already allocated for the project. However, after returning home from the meeting tonight, Mamata clung to the word maximum.         
	The chief minister told me only 70 acres could be spared from within the project area for the unwilling farmers. But the agreement reached at Raj Bhavan in the presence of the governor had clearly said maximum land would be given from within the project area. I refused to accept the chief ministers proposal as it goes against the spirit of the agreement, she said.         
	The chief ministers second proposal to offer monetary compensation in lieu of 100 acres outside the project area is also not acceptable, Mamata added.        
	She had readily agreed to attend the meeting when Bhattacharjee made the request on her cellphone around 5.45pm today.         
	The meeting began at 6.45pm on a happy note with the chief minister and Mamata expressing their desire to end the standoff, but the mood turned sombre 15 minutes later when Bhattacharjee said only 70 acres could be spared from within the project area.        
	Asked if the talks failed because of the chief ministers unacceptable proposals, Mamata said: I wouldnt like to call it a failure. The problem can be sorted out if the government is serious about going by the agreement. Let us have more discussions.        
	She claimed that the Trinamul members on the panel formed to look into the scope of land return had identified 300 acres within the project site.

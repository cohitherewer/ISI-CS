	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Nirmala Devi, a migrant worker from Bihar, had to flee her home in Maharashtra when Raj Thackeray started flexing his muscle.         
	She made the mistake of working in India. Had Nirmala been in Qatar, she would not have been left to fend for herself.        
	In the Gulf country, the Indian government would have ensured that the following facilities were available to her:        
	A minimum monthly salary        
	Stipulated hours of work        
	 Free medical check-up         
	 Overtime payment         
	Access to embassy during a crisis.        
	The reason: India and Qatar have a bilateral agreement on manpower that dates back to 1985.         
	An additional protocol signed on November 20, 2007, ensures that Nirmala would have got the benefits even if she is an unorganised sector worker.         
	The overseas affairs ministry in India would also have given her special training had she gone as a domestic help to Qatar.         
	While the migrant labourers in Nashik are made to run, Indian workers abroad can tap legal avenues and demand the intervention of the ministry to ensure that their interests are protected.         
	India has a labour protection agreement with Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. Similar agreements with more Gulf countries and Malaysia are at an advanced stage.        
	The proposed labour agreements have provisions for basic monthly salary, hours of work, overtime pay, payment by cheque, termination of contract, free transportation to the place of work and free medical check-up.         
	Comprehensive talks were also held with countries like Canada and Poland for better treatment of Indian migrant workers.         
	The overseas affairs ministry has a constant review facility when Indian workers are in trouble abroad.        
	A meeting of the heads of Indian missions of Gulf countries, Malaysia, Jordan, Libya and Yemen in New Delhi last September had approved a package of measures for the protection and welfare of women.        
	The package includes minimum wage, a 24-hour helpline, shelters for runaway maids, legal assistance and healthcare support.         
	The ministry is also setting up a think-tank to carry out international labour market research and devise a strategy to enable Indian workers to tap employment opportunities overseas.         
	Indian workers in the Gulf are estimated at 4.5 million and their annual remittances at $10-12 billion.        
	What about giving the same relief to Indian migrant workers at home? Its easier said than done because of various factors, overseas Indian affairs minister Vayalar Ravi said.        
	Irudaya Rajan of the Centre for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram, who specialises in migration studies, said: It is true that we dont have a policy to protect the interests of the internal migrant workers. However, we cannot mix migration with politics as 30 per cent of Indians dont live in their place of birth. Migration is a fact of life and everyone has to accept it.

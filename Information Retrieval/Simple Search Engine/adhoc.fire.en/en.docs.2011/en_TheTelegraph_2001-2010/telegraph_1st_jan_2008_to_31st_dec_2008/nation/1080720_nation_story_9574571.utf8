	Ahmedabad, July 19: Neighbourhoods around Asaram Bapus Motera ashram seethed today after police arrested two dozen local people for yesterdays riots but did not touch a single follower of the spiritual guru of Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani.        
	Residents said the situation had turned explosive following the ashram-neighbourhood clashes and last nights arrests, including those of eight office-bearers of the local BJP unit where too anti-ashram feelings run high.        
	The Bapu and the sadhaks (ashram inmates) are notorious for hooliganism and arrogant behaviour, said Pankajbhai, a former panchayat member in Motera.        
	State home minister Amit Shah, however, promised an impartial probe and said the police would examine TV footage to identify the rioters who left more than 25 people injured. Ahmedabad police commissioner .P. Mathur said he had already sought TV clips.        
	Yesterday, Asaram allegedly instigated his followers to attack journalists and local people, who had called a Motera bandh after a police clean chit to the ashram in the mysterious deaths of two gurukul students. The residents retaliated by burning ashram buses and trucks and stoning devotees gathered for Guru Purnima.        
	The residents, backed by social organisations and traders bodies, observed another Motera bandh today and have called for a chalo ashram tomorrow, which the heavy police security is likely to foil. This will be followed by a call for a Gujarat bandh on Monday.        
	The residents expect support for the bandh in places like Surat, Godhra and Rajkot where the ashram is accused of grabbing land.        
	Today, residents of Ahmedabads Nirnayanagar  where the dead students lived  were stopped by the police on their way to meet home minister Shah and seek a CBI inquiry into the deaths. Twelve of them were detained.        
	A group of 70 journalists too were detained for over two hours as they marched towards the ashram, shouting slogans against Asaram for the attack on the media that has left a woman TV reporter badly injured.        
	Shah later condemned the attack on the media but would not comment on the death of the boys  Dipesh Vaghela, 10, and his cousin Abhishek Vaghela, 11  whose mutilated bodies were found on July 6 on a riverbed near the ashram.        
	Their fathers Praful and Shantilal, who believe the boys were murdered in an ashram ritual, want a CBI inquiry and are on a fast.

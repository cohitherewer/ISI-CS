	Cuttack, July 2: The Cuttack Central Co-operative Bank (CCCB) will waive Rs 256.35 crore agriculture loan of 1,97,642 small and marginal farmers in 466 co-operative societies across Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Jajpur districts.        
	Claiming the waiver to be the highest in the state, Ashok Kumar Ojha, the president of CCCB, said: This will be highest among the 17 central co-operative banks in the state both in terms of loan waiver and beneficiaries.         
	Meanwhile, the Federation of Presidents of Primary Agriculture Loan Co-operative Societies in undivided Cuttack has alleged raw deal to thousands of farmers. Its strange that farmers who were regular in their loan repayment schedule have been deprived, said the federation president, Mahendra Kumar Nayak, who led a protest demonstration at CCCB.

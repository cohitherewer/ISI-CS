          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Supreme Court has said preventive detention orders can be challenged even before they are executed.        
	Earlier, a habeas corpus petition could not be filed before the accused person had been held or had surrendered. Preventive detention orders are usually served in cases that come under special laws relating to drug dealing, smuggling and terrorism.         
	The apex courts observation came during the hearing of a petition filed by Maharashtra resident Deepak Gopaldas Bajaj, detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974.        
	He was accused of importing duty-free goods meant to be used as raw material for manufacturing export products but were sold in the local market instead.        
	The prosecution argued that Bajajs plea challenging the preventive detention order served on him could not be entertained as it had been filed before the order was executed.         
	The court, however, held that it could intervene in cases where it believed the order had been passed on erroneous, vague, extraneous and irrelevant grounds, or the authority that passed it had no power to do so. If a person against whom a preventive detention order has been passed can show that it is illegal, why should he be compelled to go to jail? the court asked.        
	It said sending an innocent person to jail could irreparably tarnish his or her reputation. Reputation of a person is a facet of his right to life.         
	The court added that a police officer should be able to justify an arrest apart from his power to do so.

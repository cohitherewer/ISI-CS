	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 19: Less than 12 hours after a worker died at Rourkela Steel Plant, 13 employees were left unconscious after carbon monoxide from captive power plant-I leaked this morning.        
	Six of them  being administered oxygen at the ICU at Ispat General Hospital  are critical but out of danger, deputy superintendent of police R.K. Panda said.        
	The mishap took place around 8am when gas leaked out of the pipe connected to the blast furnace. Earlier on Monday night, a similar leak from the same pipe had been reported and the management repaired a defunct water-seal valve.        
	Today, the valve ruptured to backfire the gas leading to the accident.         
	Gas from blast furnace and carbon monoxide gas are mixed together in the cleaning pipe. Plant staff working at the adjacent electrical control room and rest room inhaled the poisonous gas. The fan and the air-coolers added to the gas spread. While 60ppm is the level at which the gas can be termed safe, the concentration today was 1,200ppm, said plant officials.        
	The panic made the workers of the captive power plant-II to scurry for cover. Work in the plant was stopped after rumours spread. Those admitted to the hospital include two officers, including senior manager Biswajit Sahu and deputy manager K.L. Bhoi, said Panda.        
	An inquiry has been ordered into the incident, he said.        
	This was the third accident within a week. A contractual employee was killed last evening when a heap of earth of an under-construction wall collapsed. The incident happened at the steel melting shop-II as the deceased was working 20ft underground when the earth caved in killing him on the spot.

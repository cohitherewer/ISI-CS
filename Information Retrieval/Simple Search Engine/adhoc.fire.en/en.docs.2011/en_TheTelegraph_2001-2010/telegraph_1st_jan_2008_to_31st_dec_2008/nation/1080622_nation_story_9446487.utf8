	New Delhi, June 21 (PTI): The defence ministry has given a clean chit to its Jammu public relations officer who had briefed the media about Pakistan intimating India about movement of militants along the LoC.        
	Army chief General Deepak Kapur had complained to the ministry against the officer, Lt Col. S.D. Goswami, claiming that he had wrongly informed journalists about Pakistan sharing information on militants plan to infiltrate into India.        
	But today, a senior ministry official said: We will not initiate action against Lt Col S.D. Goswami, as he has given a satisfactory explanation on the source of his information and how the confusion occurred.

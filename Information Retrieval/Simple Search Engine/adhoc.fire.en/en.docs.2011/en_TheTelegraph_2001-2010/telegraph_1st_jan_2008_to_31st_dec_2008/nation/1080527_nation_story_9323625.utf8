          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mother and child                                  
	Sambalpur, May 26: A new scheme called Yashoda, launched for the first time in Sambalpur government hospitals, is expected to boost child welfare and post-natal care in the country.         
	After the success of Janani Surakshya Yojana, Yashoda would target the newborns and their mothers while they are still there in the hospitals, said P.K. Hota, the director of the Norway-India Partnership Initiative and a former health secretary. For the scheme, volunteers (called Yashodas) would be appointed for a monthly fee and they would be responsible for the post-natal care of mothers and babies while they are still in the hospitals.        
	For now, 12 Yashodas at an honorarium of Rs 3,000 per month, have been appointed in the headquarters hospital and they would boost post-natal care, hoped the Sambalpur chief district medical officer, P.K. Nayak. So far, the Yashodas have taken an oath to serve with sincerity  like mothers  and not like professionals, who have been assigned any job.        
	Yashoda would motivate mothers to stay in the hospital for 48 hours after childbirth and learn ways to take better care of the newborns and themselves, he added. A well-cared mother and child can make the future better for any country, Hota explained.         
	Under the scheme, Orissa would receive an annual grant of Rs 1.5 crore, he said and appealed for the fair utilisation of funds.        
	With him minister of health Sanatan Bisi, P.K. Hota, Sambalpur revenue divisional commissioner and Sambalpur collector, director of national rural health mission and P.K. Nayak inaugurated the scheme and appealed to the Yashodas to serve with total dedication.         
	Since the scheme began in Sambalpur, it is a matter of pride for us and our Yashodas should set an example for the rest of the country, said the minister. Jharsuguda and Angul will be covered under the scheme very shortly, he added.

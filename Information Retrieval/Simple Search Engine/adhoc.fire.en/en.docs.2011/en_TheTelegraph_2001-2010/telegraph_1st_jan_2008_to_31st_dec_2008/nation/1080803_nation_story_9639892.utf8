	Warangal, Aug. 2 (PTI): The charred remains of 29 passengers who died in the Gautami Express fire yesterday were brought to a government hospital here for forensic tests.        
	Relatives of the victims who had gathered at the MGM Hospital today broke down on seeing the skulls and other body parts that came wrapped in white sheets. What a cruel fate! We were not able to even see the bodies of our dear ones, a woman wailed.        
	Four doctors have begun the forensic examination that is likely to be completed by tomorrow.        
	After conducting the forensic tests, we will be able to give the age, sex, height, cause and time of death of the victims, which would help in establishing their identity, Dr Rajmohan Lal, a forensic expert, said.        
	Five coaches of the Secunderabad-Kakinada Gautami Express were engulfed in flames last night. Most passengers were asleep when the train, running at 100km an hour, was approaching Mahbubabad.        
	The authorities have handed over the bodies of two women  Bhagyalakshmi and Sarita  to their relatives.        
	Five of the eight injured have been shifted to the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad.        
	Railway officials said 32 people died in the fire.        
	The burnt bogies have been moved to Kazipet junction near here for experts to probe what caused the fire, the officials said.         
	The commissioner of railway safety will conduct a public inquiry into the mishap on August 4 and 5 at Warangal. Witnesses can depose before the commissioner, a top security officer said.

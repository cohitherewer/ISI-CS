	Midnapore, Jan. 12: A grieving 21-year-old, still in love with slain Visva-Bharati girl Saswati Pal, today slashed his wrist to end his agony after refusing food for several days.
    
	Santu Har, a resident of Konnagar in Ghatal, about 130km from Calcutta, was admitted to a hospital where doctors said he was recovering but critical.
    
	He has suffered huge blood loss as he slit a vein in his left wrist, said Jayanta Sasmal, a doctor at the Ghatal sub-divisional hospital.
    
	The abortive attempt came six days after Saswati was shot dead in a Visva-Bharati hostel room by Amaresh Kundu, 29, who also wanted to marry her but was spurned by the 21-year-old Sangit Bhavan student.
    
	The shooting prompted governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who is also the universitys rector, to ask Visva-Bharati authorities to look into students demands for more security. 
    
	Gandhi, who visited Santiniketan a day after the shooting, today wrote to the students saying he had referred to the vice-chancellor their security proposals, which include round-the-clock vigil at all the 46 hostels, adequate sodium vapour lights and reduction of entry and exit points.
    
	Santu, who works in a private firm in Calcutta, told reporters from his hospital bed that he had an affair with Saswati about three years ago, around the time the two were preparing for their higher secondary exams. 
    
	Saswati and I used to attend a coaching class. At that time, I had an affair with her and wanted to marry her, he said.
    
	Santu had returned to Ghatal from Calcutta after last Sundays incident and had attended Saswatis cremation. Ashok Shi, who works at the crematorium, said since then, he had been offering flowers every day. 
    
	Santus mother Sikha said her son and Saswati were good friends.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CRPF, cops in explosive spat
                                                                                                               CRPF, cops in explosive spat
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir police have locked horns over whether the explosives haul near the site of Sonia Gandhis Bhaderwah rally was set up.        
	The CRPF has dared the police to arrest commandant B.S. Dara of 113 Battalion who headed the raid on the house of one Hafizul Gani in Shinote last Thursday.        
	Sonias rally was to be held less than a kilometre away the following day.        
	The spat has raised questions over VIP security and accountability. The police, who claim the haul was a hoax, are in a spot over what would have been their failure to prevent a possible terror strike.        
	Both have ordered inquiries into the incident.        
	Why dont the state police take action against the CRPF commandant if he is in illegal possession of explosives? Let the law take its course, a senior CRPF official said.        
	Officials are worried that Gani, from whose house the explosives were found on a tip-off, is walking free. The CRPF does not have the power to arrest citizens.        
	Security drills begin at least a fortnight ahead of a VIP rally, especially in sensitive states like Kashmir. The police are red-faced that an explosive powder, suspected to be RDX, was found the night before as it implies that they did not do enough on the ground before Sonias visit.        
	The Congress chief is a special protectee and any threat to her is viewed seriously.        
	Security experts say central intelligence agencies also chip in to double-check threats in sensitive places.

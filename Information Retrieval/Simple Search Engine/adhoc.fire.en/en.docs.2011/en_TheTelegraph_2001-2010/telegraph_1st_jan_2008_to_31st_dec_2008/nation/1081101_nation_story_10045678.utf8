	Oct. 31: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today warned the people of Maharashtra not to encourage mindless attacks on youths from the Hindi heartland as it would end up isolating Mumbai, the financial capital of the country.         
	Addressing a public meeting in Ghato, about 40km from Hazaribagh, Nitish said: The Constitution states that people are free to go anywhere in the country and work there. If the spate of violence dose not stop, Mumbai will soon be isolated from the rest of the country.        
	Mumbai has become an important centre of different types of business, because capital investments from across the country are pumped in there. Where will be Mumbai go, if the flow of funds choke? he asked.        
	Insisting that junge raj prevailed in Maharashtra, Nitish demanded both CBI and judicial inquiries into the death of Rahul Raj. Even if he was hijacking a bus, the police had adequate opportunities to detain him and put him before a court of law. But they chose to kill him, he added.        
	Repeating his demand for imposing Presidents rule in Maharashtra, Nitish said that those who were opposing the celebration of Chhath in Maharashtra should not forget that such opposition would have wide-ranging repercussions across the country. Had such elements been there in Bihar, we would have shown how they ought to be dealt with, he added.        
	Later in Ranchi, Nitish advised slain party legislator Ramesh Singh Mundas widow Vasundhara Devi to get ready to contest the by-election for Tamar Assembly seat.         
	I have secured Nitishjis blessings. He advised me to begin my preparations for the bypoll, Vasundhara Devi said after the meeting.        
	Nitish said that even after the bifurcation of the state, people of Bihar and Jharkhand remained united. He also claimed that development was on course in Bihar.         
	On education, he said his government had already recruited two lakh teachers and another one lakh teachers would be appointed soon to improve the teaching standards in schools of Bihar.        
	Earlier, at Ramgarh near Ranchi, he inaugurated a youth hostel and unveiled the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

BJP and left target a common enemy          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                LK Advani speaks in Parliament. (PTI)		    
	New Delhi, July 21: L.K. Advani today absolved the Left of what the BJP describes as the sins of the UPA government, restricting his attack to the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.        
	The leader of the Opposition made no critical comments against the communists, his pet aversion for decades. He even managed to sound sympathetic towards the Left for the way it had delayed withdrawing support to the government for so long and seriously tried to find a way out of the crisis.        
	Advani had no doubt that the crisis was of the Prime Ministers own making, and had not been engineered by the Opposition or the Left.        
	This has been invited by the government itself, and Mr Prime Minister, I am sorry to say, by you personally, Advani said.        
	He cited Manmohan Singhs interview to The Telegraph last year, in which the Prime Minister had said that if the Left wanted to withdraw support, so be it.        
	Please dont blame anyone else. It is your government and in a way you, personally, and even the Congress president, without whom you would not take a single step, is to be blamed. The Opposition has played no role in this, Advani said, adding that the BJP was not in the business of destabilising governments.        
	Initiating the debate, the BJP leader didnt make any new point and mostly repeated what he has been saying over the past few months.        
	He said the UPA was like a patient in an ICU room, that the deal appeared to be between two individuals and not two sovereign countries, and that it turned India into a junior partner of the US.        
	Advani said his party favoured strategic ties with the US but would never accept a deal that made India subservient to the Americans.        
	Advani warned the government against deluding the nation about the volume of power that would accrue from the nuclear deal. He cited figures and claimed that even in 2030, nuclear power would make up a very small fraction of the countrys total generation.        
	This argument, however, goes against the BJPs claim that it could have supported the deal but for the Hyde Act.        
	Arguing that the debate should consider the totality of the governments performance, he mentioned issues such as rising inflation, the continuing agrarian distress, Ram Setu, misuse of the CBI and the Amarnath land row.        
	He concluded by saying the people would throw the government out even if it survived tomorrows trust vote.

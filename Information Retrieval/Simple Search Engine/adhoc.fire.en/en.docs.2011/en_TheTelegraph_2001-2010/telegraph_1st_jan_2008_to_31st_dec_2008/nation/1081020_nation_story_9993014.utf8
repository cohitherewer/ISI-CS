	Chennai, Oct. 19 (PTI): Dayanidhi Maran today handed his resignation letter as Lok Sabha MP to party chief M. Karunanidhi citing atrocities on Tamils in Sri Lanka.        
	Maran, DMK MP and the estranged great nephew of the Tamil Nadu chief minister, said: I handed over the resignation letter. I (would) also like to voice solidarity with all the DMK MPs in raising the issue.        
	The former Union IT and communications minister said in the letter: Through media reports I came to know that at the all-party meeting held in the city recently, it was decided that if the Centre did not take any positive steps on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue within two weeks, all the MPs from Tamil Nadu would resign their post.        
	Karunanidhi, from whom Maran had been keeping a distance of late, said: It was a normal meeting. He gave his resignation letter to me. As per the decision taken at the all-party meeting, we have time till October 28 and by then all the resignation letters will be with me.

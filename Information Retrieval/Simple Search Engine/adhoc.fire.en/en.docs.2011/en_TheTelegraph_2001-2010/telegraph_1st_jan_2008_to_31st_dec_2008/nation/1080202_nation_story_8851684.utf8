     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Feb. 1: Rajesh Gupta, one of the accused in Gurgaon kidney racket evading arrest, was picked up by New Delhi police under similar charges in 2000.
    
	While calling it a conspiracy by some Delhi doctors to frame his son, Guptas father  Raghuvar Shyam Gupta (80)  today told reporters here some people in the national capital were not happy with his son and implicated him in the recent kidney racket case.
    
	Raghuvar, a Danapur resident and a small trader, conceded his son was arrested in New Delhi in 2000 for his alleged involvement in a kidney racket. Gupta senior said: I had been to Delhi to seek his release from jail. The case is still pending. My son was innocent then, he is innocent now.
    
	The senior Gupta, who lives at his Danapur house with his another son, said Rajesh had a brilliant academic record with an MBBS degree from Rajendra Medical College and Hospital (Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences now) in Ranchi and a master of surgery degree from All India Institute of Medicine Sciences. Raghuvar said Rajesh had not been absconding. My son practises at Doctors Colony at Saraiyaganj, Muzaffarpur. He has gone to Calcutta two days ago for a week, said Gupta, declining to give the contact number of his son.
    
	Once he comes to Patna after a week, I will ask him to talk to reporters and present his side, said the father rubbishing charges against his upright son.
    
	Raghuvar said generally people do not like talents from Bihar and so his son was framed. 
    
	Rajesh had returned to Bihar in 2001 and started practising at Muzaffarpur. He had of late moved to Gurgaon after low turnout of patients at his Muzaffarpur clinic. Rajeshs father, however, said Rajesh continued to practice at Muzaffarpur. 
    
	Guptas neighbours do not know much about Rajeshs activities.

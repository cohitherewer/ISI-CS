The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Britain reluctant to bail out Tatas Jaguar 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Britain reluctant to bail out Tatas Jaguar 
          AMIT ROY                           The Jaguar car emblem                                  
	London, Dec. 18: Tough times lie ahead for Ratan Tata following a signal today from Peter Mandelson, the business secretary of the UK, that he was not inclined to respond positively to a request for financial assistance from Jaguar Land Rover.        
	The government and Jaguar Land Rover are discussing a bailout, it was confirmed, but Mandelsons instinct seems to be that the Tata group, having bought the prestigious British brands earlier this year following the purchase of Corus, is rich enough to sustain the automobile company through troubled times.         
	But the times are unprecedented and if Barack Obama bails out the American car giants, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, the British government might also find a way of helping Tata Motors.         
	Car production slumped by a third last month, new figures showed today. The number of cars built in factories in the UK was 97,604, down by 33 per cent on November last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.         
	David Smith, the CEO of Jaguar Land Rover, commented: We fully support the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders call for a range of support measures for the car industry  suppliers, manufacturers and dealers  as has been forthcoming in other countries. The situation in the UK is a national emergency requiring urgent action.         
	He added: We believe that Jaguar Land Rover plays a critical role in the car industry in the UK, supporting up to 75,000 jobs and spending around 3 billion a year on research and development and purchasing in the UK.         
	It has been reported that Jaguar Land Rover is seeking 1billion, though this figure has not been confirmed.         
	One problem for the government is that it does not want to set a precedent by helping one private firm when most others will have to be turned down. However, this principle has already been breached by Gordon Browns bailout of Northern Rock and the billions being pumped into the banks.         
	We are looking at the (automobile) sector as a whole, Mandelson said today. I have had discussions with the owners and management of Jaguar Land Rover in particular, because they argue that they are under particular strain. But they have owners who are well-resourced, who have the first responsibility for sustaining the companies that they own in existence and in production for the future.         
	Mandelson was blunt: I dont have an open cheque-book.

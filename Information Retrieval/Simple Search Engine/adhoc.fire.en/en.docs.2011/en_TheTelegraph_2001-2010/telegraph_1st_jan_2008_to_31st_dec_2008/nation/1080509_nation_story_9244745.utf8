	Patna, May 8: A four-hour puja, a gala feast and slogans  Bhagar Yadav, the dreaded gangster and don of Champaran, gave himself up before police in a flamboyant ceremony today.        
	Bhagar (55) operated mainly in and around north Bihar districts along the Indo-Nepal border. In the seventies, he, Nema Yadav and Vasudeo Yadav founded the Jungle Party, an outfit infamous for robberies, abductions and murders.        
	Today, he surrendered from his mistresss home in Patkhaura jungle, a part of the Udaipur forest range, in front of a Kali temple that he had built for his mistress, next to her home.         
	True to his style, the man who carried a reward of Rs 2.25 lakh and was wanted by the police for past three decades, performed a four-hour Kali puja and organised a feast for hundreds of people before surrendering.         
	Today, the don turned into a gracious host serving curd, vegetable curries, rice, lentil and sweets to villagers who had gathered to witness the spectacle.         
	Cries of Bhagar Yadav jindabad rented the air as the don placed his single-barrel carbine and a .315-assault rifle along with two of his accomplices, Laxman Choudhary and Lakhi Choudhary.         
	West Champaran superintendent of police K.S. Anupam witnessed the act. Bhagar and his accomplices will be prosecuted according to the provisions of the law and merit of the cases against them, said Anupam, who reportedly played the lead role in the surrender.         
	The don today spoke like a true diplomat as he bid goodbye stating: My political opponents have framed me in criminal cases. I am innocent. Bhagars first case, a dacoity, was registered in 1977 when he was just a member in the gang run by Basudeo and Nema Yadav.         
	Bhagar shot into prominence when he gunned down the five killers of his brother Lachhan Yadav, who was also a gangster, in 1984.         
	Though Bhagar maintained an identity of a fugitive, indulging in murders and abductions in East and West Champaran districts in Nepal and in Deoria of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, he amassed huge wealth, besides gaining political clout.         
	District officials say that originally a very poor man, Bhagar now has more than one hundred acres in his possession besides a couple of small crushing factories in Nautan. Bhagar hails from Nautan, which is a sugarcane rich belt.        
	His other brother, Sattan Yadav, won the Nautan Assembly seat in 1995 as an Independent and later joined Lalu Prasads RJD.         
	His son, Amar Yadav, born from his wife Sarswati Devi, became the chairman of West Champaran district Council in 2001. Amar unsuccessfully contested the 2005 Assembly polls from Nautan on an RJD ticket. He and his wife were elected as members of the district council in 2006.         
	Be it the regime of Jagannath Mishra or Lalu Prasad or Nitish Kumar, Bhagar stayed unchallenged in his kingdom ruled rather ruthlessly by the Jungle Party, particularly in Nautan and Bairia besides the Balmikinagar forests bordering Nepal.         
	Sources close to Bhagar say that growing pressure from the Naxalites, who have spread their tentacles in the Indo-Nepal border areas, led to todays surrender. It seems that the rebels made many attempts to eliminate the don and his accomplices.

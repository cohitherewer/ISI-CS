	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The global slowdown could help improve ties with Pakistan, some diplomats reckon.        
	The optimism is based on the assessment that the global financial crisis has hit Pakistan harder and could force it to rely more on India, for instance by raising exports. Pakistan also gains if it steps up imports from India, mainly because of lower transport costs.        
	A boom in trade between the two neighbours this year has added to the optimism. India is Pakistans neighbour, and with a huge market, a source pointed out.        
	Pakistans foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi is arriving on November 26, a day after the home secretaries of the two countries meet in Islamabad.        
	India could face tough questions in the talks over recent revelations on last years Samjhauta Express blasts that had killed 68 people, mostly Pakistanis.        
	Pakistan, which has sought a $7.6-billion IMF bailout after its foreign exchange reserves began to dry up, can save scarce dollars and fight its runaway inflation better if it buys essentials from India, instead of Europe and Japan.        
	India has greater diplomatic leverage if Pakistan is more economically dependent on it, though Islamabad had resisted doing so until it began to feel the slowdown heat.        
	A former diplomat said Delhi would have to watch how far Pakistan overcame domestic pressure to be more dependent on India, a resistance that had prevented economic ties from prospering in the past.        
	We want Pakistan to have more stake in India through its goods, a source said, pointing to cement exports from Pakistan as an example. Pakistan also wants trade in 200 new items.        
	Already, the source said, the situation is 80 per cent in favour of India  exports to India make up 80 per cent of the commerce between the two countries now.         
	The trade stood at $2.8 billion so far this year, a leap from around $200 million three years ago. Another $6 billion, sources said, comes from unofficial trade, of goods routed through the Gulf and elsewhere to get around curbs.        
	The commerce could get a boost if more gateways are opened. Opening of the land route will do a world of good. That will save a lot of transportation cost, the source said.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Asif Ali Zardari had agreed on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meeting in September to open the Wagah-Attari road and Khokrapar-Munabao rail route for all permissible items of trade. However, only six to eight items have been allowed through these routes, the source said.        
	The signs in other areas have been encouraging. The acrimony in the wake of the Kabul blast, in which Delhi had accused Pakistans ISI of having had a hand, has subsided.        
	Cross-border infiltration has come down since July and the Indus water treaty mechanism will hold its 100th meeting next week, signalling a big progress in ties.

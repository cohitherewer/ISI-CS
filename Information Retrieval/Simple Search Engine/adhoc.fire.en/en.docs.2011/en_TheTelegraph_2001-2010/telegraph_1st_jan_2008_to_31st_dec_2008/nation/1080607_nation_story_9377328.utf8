          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, June 6: Mukul Pathak, a journalist arrested on Tuesday for allegedly trying to bribe the CBI to help Assam minister Ripun Bora wriggle out of a murder case, pointed a finger at the investigating agency today.        
	Inside Tis Hazari Court this morning, Pathak only asked for fresh clothes and expressed satisfaction at the CBIs conduct. But once he came out, Pathak told reporters that the nephew of a CBI officer and a surrendered Ulfa militant (Sulfa) were involved in the bribery routine that put Bora in jail on Wednesday.        
	Bora was arrested in Delhi after he was allegedly caught trying to pay a Rs 10-lakh bribe to a CBI official to hush up the murder case against him. He has since been sacked as education minister.        
	Police were granted a days remand to question Pathak today. Tomorrow, he will be produced in court along with Bora and a third accused, Maheshwari.        
	Pathak named Abhigyan Gogoi, the nephew, and Digant Saikia, a surrendered militant, as being involved in the bribery case. The arrested journalist alleged that the duo had approached him and made an offer for Bora.         
	According to the offer, Bora was to pay Rs 3.5 crore to hush up the murder.         
	However, instead of Rs 3.5 crore, only Rs 17 lakh was paid in sums of Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, Pathak alleged.        
	I do not know about this, but if it is true then it will be a matter of investigation, CBI director Vijay Shankar told The Telegraph.        
	Boras wife and daughter were allowed to meet him today for half an hour at the CBI headquarters.        
	The CBI had raided the former ministers houses in Guwahati and Delhi yesterday.

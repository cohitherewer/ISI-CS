          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, July 25: The BJP leadership feels the talk of big-ticket reforms getting a push with its support is premature.         
	The dominant view is the governments trust vote win has no sanctity and hence the BJP isnt obliged to cooperate.        
	Most leaders are in a combative mood and expect to the fight the government with renewed vigour instead of facilitating its recovery by backing its agenda of reforms.         
	The bitterness created by the tug-of-war during the trust vote hasnt gone, with the stage set for a conflict over the cash-in-the-House episode. The BJP suspects the ruling combine is itching to turn the tables on the three MPs who displayed the currency notes inside the House.        
	Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh has already moved a privilege motion against the BJP members. But the BJP is ready for the faceoff and the MPs  Ashok Argal, Mahavir Bhagora and Fagan Singh Kulaste  today filed a formal complaint, as desired by the Speaker.         
	They have named Samajwadi leader Amar Singh in and given the sequence of events, detailing how they were offered Rs 3 crore each, and even handed an advance.        
	BJP leaders assert they will take the alleged bribery battle to any extent, a stance that will strain their ties with the government further.         
	The personal tiff between the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Leader of Opposition, L.K. Advani, is another sticking point. With such animosity, it is difficult to see the party playing a comrade-in-arms to push the unfinished economic agenda, sources said.        
	There is a section, though, that believes supporting big-ticket reforms shouldnt be a problem as the BJP itself is committed to them. Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha reinforced such a perception when he said yesterday that the party could consider supporting the government on reforms. If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh takes the initiative and contacts L.K. Advani with specific proposals, the party will examine them.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had said after the trust vote the government would approach parties that support reforms, but there were hurdles.         
	One BJP leader said: Supporting the government shouldnt be a problem on this (liberalisation) under normal circumstances. But the party is rattled after the trust vote and its first priority is to put its own house in order. We arent thinking about the governments agenda at this juncture.         
	The BJP is confused about the course of reforms and hasnt reviewed its economic philosophy in the last four years. Party chief Rajnath Singh constituted a committee headed by Murli Manohar Joshi to study the matter but no substantive work has been done so far.

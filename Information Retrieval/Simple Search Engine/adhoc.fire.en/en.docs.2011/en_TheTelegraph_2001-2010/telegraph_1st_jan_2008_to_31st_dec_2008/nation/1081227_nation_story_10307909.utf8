          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Dhaka/New Delhi, Dec. 26: Dhaka has moved two warships to confront an intrusion by three Indian vessels, apparently including two naval ships, for oil and gas exploration in alleged Bangladeshi waters.        
	Some officials, though, said the alleged intrusion took place in disputed waters off Bangladeshs southwest coast.        
	A Bangladesh navy frigate and a battleship were sent to the scene last night and the Indian ships were asked to back off. Dhaka has ordered a probe following which appropriate action would be taken.        
	Bangladeshi media quoted foreign ministry officials as saying an Indian survey vessel, backed by two navy ships, had intruded into our waters for hydrocarbon exploration. It was the survey vessel that was guilty of the intrusion, they said.        
	An Indian official said it was unnecessary on Dhakas part to create an issue over what was not a naval ship. It was a ship hired by the petroleum ministry for surveying. The ship was never in Bangladeshi waters, the source said. He did not comment on whether there were supporting navy vessels.        
	The source said the Indo-Bangla technical committee on maritime boundaries was to meet early next year, and both countries were expected to address disputes to it instead of acting unilaterally.        
	A Bangladesh foreign office spokesman said Dhaka had asked Delhi to stop all exploration in its waters till maritime boundaries were settled fully. Bangladesh will lodge a formal complaint with Delhi in a day or two.

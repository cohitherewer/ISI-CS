	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 17: The decision of the Sangh Parivar to observe Orissa bandh on Christmas defying the government ban sparked an uproar in the Assembly with the Opposition demanding a statement from the chief minister clarifying his governments stand on this.        
	Angry Opposition members stormed the well and shouted slogans, forcing four quick adjournments for 45 minutes. Normalcy was restored in the House after Naveen Patnaik gave a statement reiterating his governments stand that no bandh would be permitted on December 25. Religious festivals of every community should be days of amity and goodwill, said Naveen, while appealing to the members not to entertain any doubt on the governments commitment.

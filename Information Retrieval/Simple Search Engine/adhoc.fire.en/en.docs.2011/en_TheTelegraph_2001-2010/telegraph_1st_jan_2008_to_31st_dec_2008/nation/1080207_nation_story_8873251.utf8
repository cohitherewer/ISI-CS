	Chandigarh, Feb. 6: Having had a field day with cricket commentary and TV shows, Navjot Singh Sidhu is ready for a new innings  as an actor in a Punjabi film.        
	The former cricketer and Lok Sabha member from Amritsar yesterday announced he had accepted a role in My Pind-My Home, saying he hoped to be accepted as warmly in films as he has been as a commentator.         
	Politics, cricket and cinema are three mediums that can transform the lives of people, Sidhu said here.         
	Popular singer Harbhajan Mann will play the lead in the film, directed by Manmohan Singh, with Punjabi actress Kimi Verma. Gurpreet Guggi and Rana Ranbir, who featured in The Great Indian Laughter Champion, a TV show Sidhu judged with Shekhar Suman, have also been cast.        
	The movie revolves around the desire of youths to leave Punjabs villages for foreign shores.         
	Sidhu said he was offered roles in Hindi films over the past few years but had turned them down. I accepted this film because the script is close to my heart. There is an exodus of youths from Punjab, which is a serious problem. My role is teaching them ways to stay back and work for the welfare of their village. It is the urge to do something that made me accept the role.        
	Mera Pind-My Home, set against the backdrop of a Punjab village where the characters lead a tough life, aims to send the message to Punjabis who are seen to be laid-back when it comes to working for their own land and people.        
	Sidhu asserted that his entry into films would not affect his political career. My mission lies in politics and my politics lies elsewhere. I see myself settling in politics.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, June 15: The dredging of Hirakud reservoir is expected to be complete before the end of this month.         
	The digging process would help open a clear passage to Sasan canal and facilitate smooth water flow during the dalua crop in summer.         
	From now, water will always be available in the Sasan canal, said J.B. Mahapatra, the superintendent engineer of Hirakud project.        
	The dredging began on April 28 and more than 1-lakh-cubic-metre of earth have been dug so far.         
	Since the canals mouth was higher than the water level, problems in discharging water used to arise in summer despite sufficient water.         
	The dredging is being done across 1km in the main and link canals inside the reservoir. The canal is nearly 2.5 to 3m deep and 36m wide.         
	Development commissioner-cum-additional chief secretary R.N. Bahidar, Sambalpur collector Pradipta Kumar Patnaik and senior officers of water resources department have visited the site and expressed their satisfaction over the progress.         
	The Sasan farmers will surely benefit, said Patnaik.         
	Labourer dies        
	A labourer died and two were critically injured when a wall of a closed oil industry collapsed on them at Majhipali under Sasan police station, 10km from here.         
	The deceased has been identified as Kunu Jhankar of Majhipali.         
	This was Kunus first day at work. The injured persons are Ranga Chhatriya and Khirod Mallick. The maintenance work of the oil mill began today. Villagers demanded adequate compensation for the deceaseds kin.

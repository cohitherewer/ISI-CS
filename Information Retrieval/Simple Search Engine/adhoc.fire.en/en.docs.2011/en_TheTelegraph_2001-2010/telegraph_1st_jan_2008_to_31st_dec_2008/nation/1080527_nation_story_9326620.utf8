The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karnataka cheer for poll-bound Chauhan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karnataka cheer for poll-bound Chauhan
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, May 26: The Karnataka election verdict has brought cheer to BJP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, whose state Madhya Pradesh goes to polls in six months.         
	Equally depressed is the Congress camp in the state.         
	Our victory in Karnataka prepares the ground for our victory in Madhya Pradesh, too.         
	Under Rajnath Singhs leadership and L.K. Advanis guidance, the BJP will win the next general elections and Assembly polls in MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi, Chauhan said.        
	 The Congresss initial confidence of cashing in on the anti-incumbency factor is now dwindling as the recent Lok Sabha by-election has gone the ruling BJPs way.         
	Moreover, factionalism within the party unit and the central leaderships indifference towards the state are also factors that have demoralised the rank and file.         
	State Congress leaders said if a traditional stronghold like Karnataka was lost, there was little hope for Madhya Pradesh that has been electing 20 and more MPs for the BJP since 1991.        
	The leadership issue is bothering them the most.         
	According to the Congress tradition, the party does not project any leader as chief minister. But there are many office-bearers who favour projecting a candidate.         
	Their argument is that in the era of television, identifying a leader and his caste base and image plays a critical role in influencing voters.         
	Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Suresh Pachauri has been rather clueless since his appointment in February.         
	He has not succeeded in holding a show of unity in the state despite his desire to bring all senior leaders on the same platform.

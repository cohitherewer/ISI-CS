	Bhopal, Feb. 11: Young lovers in Madhya Pradesh are in safe hands this Valentines Day, thank Rahul Gandhi.        
	The state chapter of the National Students Union of India, now under Rahuls charge, has decided to take on the Bajrang Dal and provide a ring of protection to young lovers who could get cosy and coo a little more this Thursday.        
	State NSUI secretary Naveen Choubey said his organisation would set up a helpline of sorts to protect lovers who face harassment.        
	NSUI workers will be deployed at various places to ensure that Bajrang Dal workers, or anyone for that matter, do not disturb young couples. Then they will inform police in case anyone is harassed and take the law into their hands if the police fail to act, Choubey said.        
	Since he was appointed AICC general secretary, Rahul has been handling the Youth Congress and the NSUI. Party leaders said there was no written communication from Delhi about Valentines Day, but the NSUI had decided to showcase that under Rahuls leadership the students wing was not sitting idle.        
	Valentines Day has a history of turning violent in Madhya Pradesh. There is heavy police deployment at parks, hotels and restaurants in Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior. Bajrang Dal teams keep vigil at public places to shoo away young couples on the ground that Valentines Day is alien to the cultural ethos and brings in vulgarity in society.        
	The Bajrang Dal today began by praying to lathis and batons, which will be used to discipline lovers. State convener Devendra Rawat said: We will catch hold of couples meeting in public places, parks and restaurants and get them married. If they dont get married, the girl will have to tie a rakhi on the boy.        
	Other organisations like the Christian Justice Forum and the Youth Awareness Ring, too, have decided to take on the saffron brigade. The police said none would be allowed to interfere with the personal freedom of a person.

          G.S. MUDUR                          The W2M satellite                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: A European launch vehicle today ferried into space Indias first satellite built for a foreign customer, a 3,460kg communications capsule that is the heaviest so far from the Indian Space Research Organisation.         
	The Ariane 5 launch vehicle placed into orbit the W2M satellite designed to provide radio, television, cable and data services across Europe, North Africa and West Asia, 32 minutes after lift-off from a spaceport in French Guiana at 4.05am Indian time.         
	Antrix Corporation, Isros commercial arm engaged in exporting space products and services, had built the satellite in partnership with EADS Astrium, a European space company, under a contract for $33 million, Isro officials said.         
	The W2M satellite  operated by Eutelsat, a European telecommunications provider  has a designed life of 15 years.         
	Antrix had provided the main satellite structure for W2M, its mechanical subsystems, satellite control systems, propellants and tanks and power systems and solar panels. Antrix had also integrated and tested the satellite at Isro facilities in Bangalore.         
	India has supplied space industry hardware and services for nearly 15 years and launched several satellites for foreign customers aboard the home-grown Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle beginning with Korean and German mini-satellites in 1999.         
	Antrix earnings touched Rs 940 crore during 2007-08, a 41 per cent rise over the previous year. But W2M marks our entry into the market for commercial satellites, a senior Isro official said. Antrix has made reasonable profits from the W2M deal, the official said, but declined to provide details.         
	European partner Astrium delivered the communications payload for the satellite which has up to 32 transponders  the wireless transmitter-receiver systems that relay broadcasting and data signals to Earth.         
	Antrix is also responsible for early orbit operations  multiple firings of an onboard rocket motor through which W2M will be guided from its initial elliptical orbit towards its final parking slot over 16E longitude.

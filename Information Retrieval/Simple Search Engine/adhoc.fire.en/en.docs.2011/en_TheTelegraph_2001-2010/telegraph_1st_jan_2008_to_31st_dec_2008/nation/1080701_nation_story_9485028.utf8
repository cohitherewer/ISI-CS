          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 30: The Supreme Court today accused the Gujarat government of having found a soft target in social scientist Ashish Nandy, and sent it notices on a petition that sought to prevent the states police from arresting him.        
	An FIR has been registered against Nandy, listing non-bailable charges that carry three-year terms, after he wrote a newspaper article blaming the Gujarati middle class for the states hate politics.        
	An Ahmedabad-based NGO, the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), then filed a complaint saying the article was intemperate and vituperative and showed Gujaratis in poor light.        
	The charges against Nandy include promoting enmity between groups, harming national integration, and waging war against the state, his lawyer said.        
	Nandy, a Delhi resident, had sought quashing of the FIR in Delhi High Court, which issued notices to the Gujarat government but did not grant interim protection against arrest. He then moved the Supreme Court.        
	The apex court lauded Nandys strong and positive views and asked Gujarat to respond by tomorrow. The state has found a very good soft target, the bench observed.        
	The Gujarat government had ordered five FIRs to be filed on the NCCL complaint  the four others against the publishers  on April 15, three months after the article was printed. The police filed the FIRs on May 30.              
	Some of the cases against the daily are pending with Gujarat High Court, where the state has already promised not to arrest the accused (but Nandy is not among them).        
	The NCCL had earlier filed a PIL accusing social activist Medha Patkar of misusing foreign funds to stall the Narmada dam project. The apex court had thrown it out and fined the NGO Rs 5,000.

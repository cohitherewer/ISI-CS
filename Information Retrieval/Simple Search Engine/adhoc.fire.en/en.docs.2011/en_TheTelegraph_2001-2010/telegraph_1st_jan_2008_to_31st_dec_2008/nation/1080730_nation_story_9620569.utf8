                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP goes mute after Sushma charge
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Sushma: Irresponsible?                                  
	New Delhi, July 29: The BJP has been numbed by the charge levelled by Sushma Swaraj that the blasts are a conspiracy to divert attention from the cash-for-vote scandal.        
	Although the party did not issue a denial considering Sushmas seniority, it was not willing to defend her either.         
	A day after Sushmas statement, senior leaders said no comments to queries. Sources said the partys regular news conference was cancelled because no spokesperson was willing to face the media.        
	Privately, some leaders expressed shock at her irresponsible remarks and said the party had not authorised her to level such a charge.         
	BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley appeared on a television channel yesterday itself and mentioned that he would never say a political party could engineer blasts. Today, he refused to comment on Sushmas remarks.        
	But Jaitley gave a glimpse of the partys mind when he said: All the recent blasts have been executed by Huji, an al Qaida front.        
	He blasted the government for not arming investigative agencies with firm legal teeth and went to the extent of calling home minister Shivraj Patil illiterate for his remarks on the legal position. But he maintained a studied silence on Sushmas charge.         
	Even Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, known for his belligerent posturing, kept his counsel.         
	One senior BJP leader said: There are some leaders in the party who are totally confused after the shocking defeat in the trust vote.... Now they are doing bizarre things in frustration.         
	It is not just Sushmas remark that has raised eyebrows in the party.         
	Jaswant Singh went to Amar Singhs house in the midst of the high political drama. Now, we are fighting the same Amar Singh through a failed sting operation. Then Jaswant revealed a topple plot before the media. After that, Advani allowed party MPs to wave currency notes in the House. None of these was considered decisions and was done out of personal whims, a BJP leader said.

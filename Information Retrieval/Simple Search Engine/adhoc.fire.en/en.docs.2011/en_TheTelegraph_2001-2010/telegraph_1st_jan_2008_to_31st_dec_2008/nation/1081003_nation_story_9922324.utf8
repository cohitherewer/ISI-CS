          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The BJP today said its stand on the nuclear deal had been vindicated by the unambiguous and conclusive remarks of US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice that any nuclear test by India would have serious consequences, including sanctions.        
	BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said his party had been correct when it argued that India had abrogated its right to conduct nuclear tests forever.         
	Asked if his party was still determined to scrap the deal if it came to power, Rudy said the BJP-led NDA would certainly conduct nuclear tests if required and review the pact to suit Indias interests.         
	The extraordinary commitment made to the US Senate reiterates that the US President could waive all co-operation if India were to conduct a nuclear test, the BJP spokesperson said. This may be a victory for the UPA, but it is a colossal loss for India.        
	Claiming that Delhi had acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Rudy demanded an answer from the Prime Minister and his team who have been vociferously boasting of the deal.         
	He alleged that the publicised virtues of the deal are non-existent in the final outcome.         
	Rudy accused Manmohan Singh of leading the country into a blind trap. A deal has been done but sovereignty has been compromised, he said.

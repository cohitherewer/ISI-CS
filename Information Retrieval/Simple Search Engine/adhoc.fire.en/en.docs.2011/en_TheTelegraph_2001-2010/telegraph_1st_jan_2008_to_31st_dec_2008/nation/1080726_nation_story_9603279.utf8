          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, July 25: The Centre has blamed inadequate local intelligence for the blasts in Bangalore today.         
	Minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal said Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh had been warned through advisories. The Centre had found the state intelligence networks weak and they had been unable to predict attacks.         
	Sources said Karnataka complained that there was no specific intelligence from probe agencies in Delhi.         
	But home minister Shivraj Patil put the ball in the states court when he said that he hoped the Karnataka government would provide security to citizens.        
	He promised additional help, though.         
	Yesterday, representatives from seven states had gathered in North Block where the special secretary (internal security), M.L. Kumawat, asked them to spruce up local intelligence networks.         
	Home ministry officials would not name the states, but sources said Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh had attended the meeting. The ministry did not confirm Karnatakas participation.         
	The review, ministry officials said, was part of an initiative to ensure the speedy and adequate attention of the probe agencies and co-ordination among them to bring investigations to their logical conclusion.         
	After the blasts, Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta spoke to the Karnataka chief secretary and the director-general of police while the ministry followed the routine of sending a team from the national bomb data centre.         
	Preliminary investigations reveal crude bombs were used but it is premature to say who has done it, Gupta said.         
	The Centre, which promptly points to the ISI and Pakistan-based militant outfits, did not name any outfit. The failure to crack previous blast cases is being seen as the reason for this.         
	The probe into the Jaipur blasts as well as the explosions in Ajmer, Faizabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Malegaon and Hyderabad have all hit dead ends.         
	The only connection intelligence agencies have established is a link between the Hyderabad blasts and the Ajmer dargah explosion as well as the serial bomb attacks in Uttar Pradesh. Most blasts have occurred either on Tuesdays or Fridays, it has been observed.

	Patna, Jan. 31: Security beefed up at all vital installations here ahead of Republic Day have been withdrawn except from the Mahavir temple and the Patna Sahib gurdwara. 
    
	The Bihar administration has extended the police deployment at the two religious shrines till further orders. Teams of Bihar Military Police have been guarding the two vital religious places since January 25. Eleven armed policemen headed by an assistant sub-inspector have been deployed at the Mahavir temple, while eight armed policemen have thrown a security ring around the gurdwara.
    
	Bihar State Religious Trust Council chairperson Kishor Kunal told The Telegraph: We have not received any specific threat against the Mahavir temple or the Patna Sahib, but the security has been intensified in and around the religious places as a precautionary measure. We have been co-ordinating with the state police about the security of other religious places across the state. 
    
	Kunal said all devotees were being frisked with metal detectors and the west gate of the temple had been permanently closed for effective surveillance. He, however, allayed any apprehension of terrorist threat to the temple.
    
	We do take precaution during and after Republic Day. We are more alert about the security of religious places owing to growing threats from militants in the state, he added. Three to five thousand devotees visit the Mahavir temple everyday.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 26: Religious fanatics are worse than terrorists and do not belong to any religion, the Supreme Court said today.        
	The apex courts comments came as it directed the Gujarat government to notify it within 10 days on the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that will further probe the 2002 Godhra train carnage and nine riot cases.        
	The court had announced the team yesterday and included two officials from outside Gujarat in it.        
	These are cases where there is an element of communal disharmony, which is not to be countenanced, a three-judge special bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said, adding that the sensitive nature of the incidents warranted an SIT.        
	Theres an agreement (between the state and the victims) on the need for a Special Investigation Team to further probe these cases.        
	The court recorded that the Gujarat government, through its counsel Mukul Rohatgi, had said it had no objection to the probe so that peoples faith in the transparency of its action is fortified.        
	The government is not interested in shielding the guilty and wants them punished, the bench said. This is a fair approach by the state.        
	The court also seized the opportunity to lash out at fundamentalists.         
	Religious harmony is the hallmark of a democracy. No religion teaches hatred. If in the name of religion, people are being liquidated, it is essentially a slur and a blot on a society governed by the Constitution of India, which in its Preamble refers to secularism, it observed.         
	Former CBI director R.K. Raghavan will head the five-member SIT, with the other outsider in the team being former Uttar Pradesh-cadre IPS officer C.B. Satapathy. Three IG-rank officers from Gujarat  Geeta Johri (the convener), Shivanand Jha and Asish Bhatia  are the other members.         
	The SIT will be free to decide the modalities of its functioning and the state will offer help when needed.         
	The court asked the SIT to investigate cases where victims have alleged that their complaints were completely ignored and further investigate other complaints.        
	It will submit its report to the court within three months in a sealed cover to enable it to determine the future course of action.

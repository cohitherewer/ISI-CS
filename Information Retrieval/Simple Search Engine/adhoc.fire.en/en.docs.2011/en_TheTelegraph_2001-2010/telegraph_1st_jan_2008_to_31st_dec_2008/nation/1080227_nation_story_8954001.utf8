     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: India today tested a submarine-launched missile that can launch a nuclear warhead with a range of 700km.
    
	Defence technologists who supervised the experiment did not disclose the results till this evening. 
    
	The K-15 missile launch had been expected since the chief controller of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), S. Prahlada, said early last week that government approval had been sought for the test.
    
	The Centre is circumspect about releasing detailed information on its nuclear deterrence policy. The K-15 is an integral part of Indias nuclear doctrine of no first strike that envisages creating capabilities to launch nuclear warheads from land, air and sea. 
    
	Todays test launch, around 1pm, was from a pontoon simulating a submarine off the coast of Visakhapatnam. DRDO sources said the missile was capable of ranges between 500km and 700km. They refused to say whether the test missile had been assigned a definite target or whether it had been successful in its mission. 
    
	The data have yet to be analysed. It is a very complex experiment. We can say that the test-firing was successful. The missile was tracked by sensors through its route, official DRDO sources said. 
    
	US defence secretary Robert Gates, who reached New Delhi today, said we will deal with the world as we find it when asked if he was perturbed by the Indian test launch of a nuclear-enabled missile. In effect, Gates said the missile test would not have an impact on the intensifying India-US military-to-military relations.

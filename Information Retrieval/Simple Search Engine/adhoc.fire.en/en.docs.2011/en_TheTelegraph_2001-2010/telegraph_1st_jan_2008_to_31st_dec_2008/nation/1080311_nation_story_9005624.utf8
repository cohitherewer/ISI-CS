The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flier data to land before flight
                                                                                                               Flier data to land before flight
  - Airlines asked to give passenger details to immigration in advance        BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                                          
	New Delhi, March 10: Come April 1, Indian immigration authorities will know exactly who they will be welcoming at major airports much before flights land.        
	India has made it mandatory for all international airlines to provide information about the passengers and crew on board to immigration officials at the destination airport.        
	The Advance Passenger Information System (Apis) will not only pave the way for enhanced screening of passengers, but will also facilitate expeditious immigration clearance, junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said.        
	The name, gender, date of birth, nationality, passport details such as the country of issue and country of permanent residence, and visa details of each passenger and crew member have to be sent within 15 minutes of take-off.        
	Sources said an Apis pilot project had been implemented at the Indira Gandhi International Airport since July 1, 2006. Only Air India was providing passenger details to the immigration authorities in Delhi, said an official of the civil aviation ministry, which is collaborating with the home ministry on the project.        
	From April 1, Apis will be in place at airports in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kochi. It will be extended to all other international airports later.        
	The pilot project at the IGI airport was a useful learning process for the immigration authorities. It helped them streamline their India-Apis data centre. As soon as the airport received information about the passengers on board, they tallied it with their own data of wanted criminals against whom there was an international lookout notice. It helped in their passenger profiling system and also in clearing passengers expeditiously, a senior security official said.        
	A notification amending the Foreigners Order, 1948, for implementing Apis had been published in the Gazette of India on January 24, 2008.        
	The sources said home secretary Madhukar Gupta held a series of meetings with all those involved in implementing the system. These included officials in the ministries of civil aviation, external affairs and information technology and in security and intelligence agencies.        
	The system had become necessary mainly as a counter-terror measure. Security and intelligence agencies had been pressing for it for almost a decade. Countries like the US, Canada, Australia, China, Mexico, South Korea, Bahrain, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa already have Apis in place. In this day and age of international terrorism, we have to be vigilant, the security official said.         
	Moreover, the volume of passengers coming to India has increased, and many are inconvenienced by delays in immigration, customs and security checks. Apis is likely to facilitate faster clearance for most passengers since their records would have been verified in advance.        
	Officials said all passenger data would be kept confidential and would not be put to any commercial use. However, it will be shared with security, intelligence and border control agencies, the official added.

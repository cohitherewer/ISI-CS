	New Delhi, Sept. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs declaration to President George W. Bush of how the people of India deeply love you triggered derision and consternation in political circles here today.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said: Everybody knows that the PM loves President Bush. Why should he bring the people of the country into it?        
	Many in the Congress shared the feeling. Although a trifle amused at the love-fest, they wondered if Singh should have claimed the right to speak for one billion Indians  especially when he wasnt a directly elected MP.        
	Hes perhaps still high on the Singh is King euphoria after the government won the trust vote. We shouldnt grudge him the happiness, a Congress official said, barely hiding his sarcasm.        
	A second Congress member said the only consolation was Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari outstripping Singh in his exchanges with Sarah Palin. Zardari told the Republican candidate for Vice-President that she was gorgeous and virtually threatened to hug her.        
	But another Congress member said: In Pakistans macho society, Zardaris remarks would not be seen as something spoken to a Republican but to a beautiful lady. In India we have a huge problem with Bush.

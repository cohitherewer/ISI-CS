          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 17: Orissa High Court today endorsed appointment of former Lokpal Justice S.C. Mohapatra as head of one-man commission by the state government to probe into the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four others on August 23 and incidents of violence in Kandhamal thereafter.        
	The court ruled that a former Lokpal could be appointed head of a commission of inquiry even as Section 5 (3) of the Lokpal Act makes him ineligible for further appointment after retirement. We reach the inescapable conclusion that the commission of inquiry does not fall within the disability described under Section 5 (3) of the act, observed the division bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice B.N. Mohapatra.        
	The ruling came while dismissing the petition filed by Utkal Christian Council secretary Jyotsna Rani Patra. The petition had alleged that the appointment was illegal.

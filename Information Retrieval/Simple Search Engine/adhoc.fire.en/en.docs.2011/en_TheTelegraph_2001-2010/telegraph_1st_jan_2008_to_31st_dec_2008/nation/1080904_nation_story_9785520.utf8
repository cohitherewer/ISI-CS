In between     Patil sees fear and deserted villages 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shivraj Patil in Kandhamal on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 3: Union home minister Shivraj Patil said after a visit to Kandhamal today that the violence-scarred district was something in between volatile and normal.        
	I wouldnt say that it is volatile, neither is it normal because villages are still deserted. Its something in between, Patil told reporters at the airport here before returning to Delhi.        
	Tiangia village, where four persons were killed, was deserted, shops were closed and homes were locked up.        
	In Udaygiri village, too, businesses were closed and roads empty. We could not find any people there and at the relief camp, the people said they were afraid to go back, Patil said.         
	The minister condemned the violence that has racked the Orissa district since the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati last month. Christians came under attack, with homes and prayer houses set ablaze. More than a dozen people have died in communal clashes.        
	These are unfortunate incidents and they divide the society in the name of religion and caste. Probably everybody has realised the futility of such violence, the minister said.         
	But he skirted questions on who was responsible for the clashes. Naming one party or group would be indulging in a blame game. I am not accusing anybody at this point. Let the investigation into the case begin.         
	Instead of apportioning blame, lets shoulder the responsibility to provide security, peace and full protection to the people.        
	The minister announced central assistance of Rs 3 lakh to the families of each of the 16 dead. The Centre has provided the state 33 companies of paramilitary forces and one helicopter, he said. The governments primary task is to provide relief to those affected. Then homes have to be rebuilt with the institutions.        
	Asked if he was happy with the Orissa governments performance, Patil said: I am not here to give judgement or to give a clean chit to anybody.

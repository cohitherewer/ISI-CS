                              Sonia with Singh at the launch of the book Gandhi ka Path on International Non-violence Day in New Delhi. (PTI)                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 2 (PTI): Sonia Gandhi today hailed the passage of the Indo-US nuclear deal as a landmark that would be mutually rewarding for India and the international community.         
	The passage of the Indo-US civil nuclear agreement by the US Congress is a landmark development, the UPA chairperson said in a statement, adding that the deal would help address the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.        
	Lavishing praise on Manmohan Singh, Sonia said the agreement marked the successful culmination of a process initiated by the Prime Minister in July 2005. He was guided by Indias supreme national interest, which the Congress has endorsed throughout, she said.        
	I specially congratulate Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who has demonstrated a firm resolve in taking forward this bold initiative.        
	Sonia described the pact as an acknowledgement of Indias impeccable credentials and said it would pave the way for the countrys integration into the global mainstream.        
	This historic step as well as the NSG exemption has opened the door for India to enter into civil nuclear co-operation with the US and other major countries with advanced technologies, including France, Russia and the UK.        
	The Congress president said the deal would also boost the countrys agricultural growth. It will contribute immensely in augmenting the much-needed energy generation capacity for agriculture and in meeting our developmental objectives, she said.        
	Sonia also complimented the countrys nuclear scientists for making India self-reliant in nuclear technology.

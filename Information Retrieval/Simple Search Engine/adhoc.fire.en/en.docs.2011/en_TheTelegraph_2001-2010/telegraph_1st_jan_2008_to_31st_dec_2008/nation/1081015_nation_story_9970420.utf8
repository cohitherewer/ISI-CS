          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 14: Keralas Catholic Church will battle proposals by a reforms panel to legalise euthanasia and abolish a law that makes suicide attempts an offence.        
	It will also protest against a suggestion to impose a fine of Rs 10,000 for having a third child.        
	The Pro-Life Committee of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council will kick off an agitation tomorrow against the proposals made by the state law reforms commission. A prayer is planned at St Marys Pro-Cathedral, to be followed by a march to the secretariat.        
	Keralas Left government has not revealed its mind yet but the church believes the state will accept most of the recommendations.        
	The commission, headed by jurist V.R. Krishna Iyer, has suggested a draft bill allowing mercy killing in cases where preservation of life is medically impossible and the patient is undergoing insufferable physical or mental pain. Three state-recognised doctors must certify that a case is fit for euthanasia.        
	The proposal defines euthanasia as deprivation of life by oneself, or by any other person at the instance of the person whose life is lost, or by a medical practitioner doing any act or omission resulting in termination of life.         
	However, the secretary of the Catholic councils pro-life committee, Father Jerome Fernandez, says modern medicine has ways to minimise pain and the state is responsible for creating facilities for the aged and the diseased.         
	On the suggestion to delete Section 309 of the IPC, which makes suicide attempts an offence, a pro-life votary said: The proposal to make suicide legal in the name of poverty, debt and chronic illness is flawed and... will lead to a spurt in suicide rates. The government should provide counselling to the suicide-prone instead of scrapping the law.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Nepali Prime Minister Prachandas decision to go to Beijing ahead of a customary visit to New Delhi is being seen as a snub and a setback by India.         
	Though Prachandas visit is not strictly bilateral  he has accepted an invitation for the Olympics closing ceremony  foreign office sources here said that in breaking the tradition of New Delhi being the first foreign port of call for any Nepali head of government, the Maoist leader was effecting his promise of creating a New Nepal which will maintain equidistance and equiproximity with China and India. This means a significant shift in Nepals external outlook and has New Delhi worried.         
	Prachanda is probably also making his displeasure with India clear, a source said. Ever since they won the elections, they have nursed a sense that India was unhappy with the outcome of the polls. They also believe that New Delhi tried (unsuccessfully) to upstage the Maoists and help G.P. Koirala retain prime ministership in the political confusion that followed the splintered verdict.         
	The sources were keen to emphasise that India had maintained a strictly hands-off policy in Nepal since the elections and wanted Nepali democracy to take its own course after the abolition of constitutional monarchy. The Maoists, though, continue to harbour political grudges against India.         
	The latest provocation for them was a series of high-level meetings that caretaker Prime Minister G.P. Koirala was able to hold in New Delhi on his way back from the Saarc summit in Colombo earlier this month. Koirala tried to indirectly project these meetings  UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani were among those he had discussions with  as indication of Indian support to his premiership claim. That irked the Maoists, too.         
	New Delhis disappointment over the alacrity with which Prachanda accepted Beijings invitation is perhaps even greater because Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had personally requested his newly elected Nepali counterpart to visit.         
	Our Prime Minister was among the first to congratulate Prachanda so it isnt as if we have been averse, or even cold, to the Maoist leader assuming office, a source said. Technically, it could be said he has only gone to attend the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games but it is also true that an invitation from New Delhi was on Prachandas table. In bypassing it on his way to China, he is surely sending a message.         
	Diplomatic circles in Kathmandu are putting an even larger interpretation in Prachandas Beijing move. This is not so much a signal from Prachanda as it is from China, a Kathmandu-based western diplomat told The Telegraph over telephone. Getting Prachanda to Beijing before he went to New Delhi is the Chinese way of putting India on the alert in the region.         
	The backdrop to this, the diplomat explained, was Indias increasing affinity with the West, particularly the US.         
	With the nuclear deal being pushed hard by the US, the Chinese imagine a US-Japan-India axis in the region. They are subtly letting India know it should be mindful of potential trouble in its backyard because it becomes an enthusiastic member of the anti-China formation in these parts.

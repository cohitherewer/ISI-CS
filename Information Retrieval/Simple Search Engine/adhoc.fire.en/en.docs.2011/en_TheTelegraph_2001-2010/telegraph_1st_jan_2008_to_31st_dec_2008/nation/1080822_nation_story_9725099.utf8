          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 21: Weeks ago former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty was charged of sexual harassment and now deputy Speaker Prahalad Dora is facing dowry demand slur.         
	Smita Majhi, who married Doras son Chinmaya a month ago, filed an FIR against the family at Jeypore town police station in Koraput this morning. Smitas parents reside in Jeypore.        
	In her FIR, Smita has accused Prahalad Dora, his wife, daughter and son of torturing her for dowry.        
	According to Smita, she was regularly beaten up by the family and was forced to leave her husbands Bhubaneswar home and return to Jeypore.         
	Smita had married Chinmaya on July 9, 2008. The marriage was solemnised at Simhanchalam in Andhra Pradesh according to the wishes of the grooms family.        
	The dowry demands made by the grooms family were also taken care of. Dowry included Rs 2 lakh cash and furniture worth Rs 3 lakh, Smita has claimed in her FIR.         
	Once in Bhubaneswar, Smita has alleged that she realised that her husband was already involved with another woman. In her FIR, Smita has alleged that Chinmaya would often return home drunk and beat her up, lock her inside a room and not give her food. Eventually, Smita managed to escape and come to her parents home to file an FIR.         
	Smita has further accused Dora staying silent while his son misbehaved with her. Dora, a BJP member, is an MLA from Chitrakonda constituency and has been the deputy Speaker since 2004.        
	A case of dowry, torture under Sections 498/A, 323, 506, 494 and 34 IPC and under Section 4 of Dowry Prevention Act, has been lodged against the accused, said an investigating officer.        
	Deputy Speaker Dora, has dismissed all allegation as false, baseless and motivated.         
	Addressing a news conference at Bhubaneswar today, the deputy Speaker said his daughter-in-law wished to become a constable, which he was not willing to consent to.         
	She was enraged when I refused and threatened to kill us, he said.         
	He added that his son Chinmaya, had lodged an FIR at the Capital police station (Bhubaneswar) in this connection. Dora, who is a member of the tribal community, said demanding dowry from brides family was not a tribal custom.

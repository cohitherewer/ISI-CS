	Seven-day song for Guinness glory    
	Viraag Wankhade did not eat or sleep for seven days. He only sang.     
	The 34-year-old from Navi Mumbai completed the non-stop crooning feat  an attempt to win a place in the Guinness World Records  recently.    
	Although trained to be a civil engineer, Viraag wanted to be a playback singer but could not make it in Bollywood. So, he thought he would do something different to show his musical talent.    
	Viraag started singing at 12.23pm on April 20 and stopped at 12.26pm on April 27. He belted out over 1,500 songs for nearly 120 hours. And to watch him, 2.3 lakh people from all over Maharashtra came.     
	In case he should fall ill, a panel of three doctors stood by.    
	Viraag had registered with the Guinness World Records three years ago and had been preparing since.

	Ready for rails before time  
	In a country where trains hardly come on time, the Delhi Metro finished work before schedule.    
	The capitals authorities did a successful test run on the first section of Phase-II of the Metro seven months ahead of the deadline.     
	The run on the 3.1km Shahadra-Dilshad Garden stretch, which has three stations, began at 10am after a small puja. Three trial runs were conducted successfully between 10am and 1pm, Delhi Metro spokesperson Anuj Dayal said.    
	The trial runs will continue for at least three to four weeks and the section is expected to be opened by the end of May or the beginning of June when it was originally slated for opening in December.

	Ticket to ride cheapest  
	Next time you go to see someone off at the New Delhi railway station, dont buy a platform ticket. Buy a ticket to ride up to Nizamuddin station instead.    
	Its cheaper by a rupee and you also get to spend more time with relatives on the train.     
	The ticket for the 8km ride costs Rs 2 while the platform ticket costs Rs 3.    
	According to railway guidelines, the minimum cost of a train ticket should be Rs 4 for a distance of up to 10km, Rs 5 for 10-15km and Rs 6 for 16-20km. A platform ticket for Rs 3 is considered to be the cheapest among all.    
	When asked, railway officials attributed the unusual ticket price to the reduction in the fares announced recently by Lalu Prasad in the rail budget.

	Junk food alarm  
	Almost every second school student in Delhi consumes a bottle of soft drink everyday, a new study by a consortium of doctors in the capital has shown.     
	The study by the Delhi Diabetes Research Centre, supported by the Delhi government, has also shown that one out of every five students eats fast food daily.     
	The findings of the study have surprised even us, said Ashok Jhingan, the director of DDRC . The study covered students from both government and private schools.     
	Of the students surveyed, 47 per cent said they drank a bottle of cold drink everyday. Eighteen per cent said they ate fast food every day. Four out of 10 students said they never exercised in school.

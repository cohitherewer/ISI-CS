The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UK visa 
                                                                                                               UK visa 
                            
	New Delhi, March 31 (PTI): Professionals and highly skilled persons migrating to Britain will have to apply for visa under a new points-based system, which comes into force in India from tomorrow.        
	The point-based system-tier 1 (PBS-TO), which covers highly skilled migrants, entrepreneurs, investors and international graduates, replaces the earlier highly skilled migrant programmes applicable to them.        
	The initial visa will be granted for three years instead of the earlier two years.        
	India, an important source for Britains highly skilled migrants, will be the first country to introduce the new visa regime. The roll-out for the rest of the world will take place in summer, a British high commission statement said.        
	The new system is expected to make the visa process easier for legitimate travellers and tough for those intending to cheat the system of immigration. It will ensure unwanted outsiders do not enter and settle in Britain.        
	Anybody trying to cheat the system will be banned from applying for a visa for 10 years.        
	Under the PBS-TO, visa applicants will need sufficient points to qualify. Points are awarded for objective criteria such as qualifications, previous earnings, age and experience in the UK, the statement said.        
	The new system allows those wanting to work in Britain to calculate, before they make their application, whether their points add up to entry as a highly skilled worker, British high commissioner to India Richard Stagg said.

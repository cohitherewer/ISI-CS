	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 19: In the absence of male members who have been fleeing to forests to avoid arrests, tribal women in strife-torn Kandhamal district are spending sleepless nights. Now, it is not the fear of rioters but of CRPF camping there. The jawans allegedly storm the houses and molest them.        
	Women are being mercilessly beaten up and there have been several attempts to rape, said Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram general secretary Laxmikant Dash, who had managed to reach here along with a handful of tribal women from the district. Such is the situation that to save themselves, the women are fleeing into the forests at night, he added. Addressing reporters here today, the group explained the harrowing experience they had been facing back home.        
	Damaging household goods, forcibly taking away gold ornaments, cash, poultry, vegetables and livestock  the CRPF men are doing all to terrorise us, said Prashanti Pradhan, a tribal woman from Chinchidi village in Raikia. The women would approach the state women commission and the human rights commission to demand a proper inquiry into atrocities against them.        
	Narrating some episodes of police atrocities  which they plan to submit to the human rights commission here  the members said that at Tengadapada in Tikabali on October 1, the police forced all passengers to get down from a bus. The driver and conductor were beaten up and all the passengers were made to crawl on the ground.         
	In Raikia on October 13, a few Christian youths molested a girl of Ramgudia village in the presence of the CRPF. The girl was saved after women present there raised a voice. In Tikabalis Pasara village on October 2, an old woman suffering from paralysis was kicked by the CRPF jawans and Rs 10,000 was also taken from her. She has since been admitted to the MKCG Hospital for treatment. In Beragaon on October 3, the CRPF jawans tortured women and beat them up brutally.        
	Similarly, two girls of Gaonala village of Gadaguda panchayat in Udaigiri were taken to police station after their mother was beaten up. The girls were put up whole night with the CRPF team and the next morning sent to jail. No medical tests were conducted on the girls, stated the report presented to the commission.        
	Safety and security of poor tribal women are in jeopardy. In spite of complaints, the government is doing nothing to protect them. On the other hand, those sheltered in relief camps are getting free food, medicines, clothes and other essentials, Dash said.        
	Meanwhile, Kandhamal police chief S. Praveen Kumar said one tribal was injured in a mob attack at Laburi village under Katingia panchayat in Raikia police station. He has sustained bullet injuries on his leg and was admitted to Phulbani district headquarters hospital. However, there is no communal link in the attack, he said.

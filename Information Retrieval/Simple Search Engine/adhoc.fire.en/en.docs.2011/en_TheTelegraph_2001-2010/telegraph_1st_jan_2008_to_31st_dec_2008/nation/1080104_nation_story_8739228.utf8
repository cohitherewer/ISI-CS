     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
             The high court
                 
	Cuttack, Jan. 3: The newly introduced commissionerate system in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack is ready for its first encounter with the judiciary, as a PIL on the traffic chaos in Cuttack was lodged in Orissa High Court recently. 
    
	The high court has directed chief police commissioner B.K. Behera to submit a detailed plan of the measures, which would be adopted to tackle traffic anarchy in the city. 
    
	A two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and M.M. Das issued the order on Wednesday while expressing concern over the amateurish system in Cuttack, during a hearing on Cuttacks civic problems. 
    
	The court reportedly was dissatisfied with the joint report submitted by the state transport department and police administration together on the proposed measures to improve traffic. 
    
	A detailed blueprint is warranted as the report was incomplete and the proposed measure was at best sketchy, the court observed, while directing the chief commissioner to submit a complete report by January 18. 
    
	With the number of vehicles on the Cuttack roads increasing every day, along with a increasing population and space crunch, the traffic system in the silver city has gone for a toss  the PIL alleges. 
    
	So far, the joint report states, the administration has notified 11 stretches of roads as no parking zones and has identified over 20 parking lots. The administration has also installed electronic signalling system at Badambadi Square and Link Roads, which are major problem spots. About 1,200 vehicles pass through Badambadi every minute. 
    
	The court, however, want the electronic signalling systems to be installed at Sikharpur  on the NH-5, Satichaura and Khannagar on the Ring Road, Chandi Chowk and Barabati Stadium. 
    
	Meanwhile, Cuttack collector Sujata Kartikeyan has issued an order making it mandatory for all up-coming commercial and business establishments to set aside 20 per cent of its space for parking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Waiver cut-off to be raised: Sonia
                                                                                                               Waiver cut-off to be raised: Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Sonia in Rajasthan on Thursday. (PTI)    
	Jaipur, April 3: Sonia Gandhi kicked off her partys Rajasthan poll campaign today, saying farmers owning more than two hectares will also be brought under the loan waiver soon.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has made several suggestions that can help more farmers benefit from the write-off, Sonia told a gathering of about one lakh tribals in Rajasthans Baneshwar.        
	MP Rahul Gandhi, Sonias son, had recently requested the Centre to raise the cut-off for the waiver, proposed in the Union budget, from two hectares.        
	Sonia accused Rajasthans BJP government of having failed to utilise funds sent under the Centres National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Baneshwar is in Dungarpur, which was one of the first districts where the scheme was implemented.        
	The rally venue is close to the confluence of the Mahi, Som and Jakham, a major tribal pilgrimage centre. The Congress had suffered heavy losses in Rajasthans tribal belt in the last Assembly elections in 2003.        
	Sonia said it was up to the state governments to keep a check on prices. She said the Centre had not raised the prices of food and petrol in spite of spiralling international oil prices.        
	She took a dig at the BJPs shadow Prime Minister over his claims about the hostage-passenger trade-off following the 1999 Kandahar hijack. She said it was surprising that L.K. Advani did not know that Jaswant Singh was accompanying terrorists to Kandahar. Advani, who was home minister at the time of the hijack, has claimed that he was not consulted.         
	This was Sonias first visit to Rajasthan since her meetings with flood victims in Kawas and Malwa in Barmer in August 2006.

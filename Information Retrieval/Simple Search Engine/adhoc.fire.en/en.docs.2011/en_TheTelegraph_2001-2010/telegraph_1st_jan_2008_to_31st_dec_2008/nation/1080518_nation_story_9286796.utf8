          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 17: Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan today said the criminal justice system needs to be revamped to implement internal laws on crimes like terrorism, money-laundering and arms and drug smuggling as well as to address human rights violations.         
	It is imperative that the criminal justice system be revamped to address these concerns, Balakrishnan said at a seminar here.        
	Balakrishnan said arbitrary high-handedness and human rights violations by security agencies alienate the people, who fall prey to those working against national interests.        
	For this, an appropriate legal framework, particularly in criminal justice, would go a long way in supporting law enforcement agencies and making them legitimate in the eyes of the citizens.        
	He cited the example of anti-terror laws Tada and Pota  one was allowed to lapse and the other was repealed on grounds of misuse  to make the case for an effective criminal justice system.         
	The proponents of terror, armed with modern technology and assisted by a multitude of sleeper cells, have spread their influence even to areas hitherto inaccessible, the Chief Justice said and added that any counter-terrorism method should also secure the support of local people.

	Cuttack, Oct. 28: The arrest of Bihar-born Gunjan alias Biswajit Kumar Shaw (29) by Cuttack police from Munger has allegedly exposed an inter-state arms smuggling racket that had spread its network to Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.        
	According to the police, Gunjan, who was produced before a local court on Monday and was remanded to judicial custody, was the kingpin of the arms racket that smuggled country-made Mauser pistols and revolvers to Orissa.        
	Investigations revealed that improvised firearms, made in Munger, were much in demand in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar and were routinely smuggled through conduits.         
	Three persons, including a woman, arrested from a city lodge on October 20 were engaged by Gunjan to deliver consignments in Cuttack.         
	During the arrest, four country-made pistols and revolvers, nine single shot pistols and 90 rounds of ammunition were seized from the trio  Rajesh Choudhury (27) and Meena Devi (24), who were posing as a couple and Rajdip Ranjan Poddar (42) of Kasimnagar area in Munger.        
	Gunjan was the key player, said A.N. Sinha, the Cuttack deputy commissioner of police.         
	So far, the kingpin had confessed to running the smuggling racket and has added that Mausers, being sold for Rs 40,000 previously, were now available for Rs 11,000 due to the racket.        
	Police are now on the look out for the potential customers and clients for whom the October 20 consignment was brought to the city.         
	Investigations have led to some probable leads, we are working on it, Sinha said.

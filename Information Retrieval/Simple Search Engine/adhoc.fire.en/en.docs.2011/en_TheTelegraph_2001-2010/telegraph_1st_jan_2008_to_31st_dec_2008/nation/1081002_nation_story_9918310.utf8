	New Delhi, Oct. 1: One in two urban Indian men are unhappy with the hardness of their erections, Pfizer, the vendor of Viagra, claimed today, relying on a survey of perceptions of about 200 males from seven cities.         
	About 50 per cent of urban Indian men believe they do not have optimal erection hardness, medically graded as EHS-4, says the 13-country Asia-Pacific survey sponsored by Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals.         
	A senior company official said cultural factors in the Asia-Pacific region influence action  or inaction  related to erectile dysfunction. Men are not really ready to talk about it or to seek medical opinion, said Chandrashekhar Potkar, director of medical and regulatory affairs with Pfizer. This is part of an attempt to study the Asia-Pacific population at length, he said.         
	The survey was based on street intercepts with no knowledge of the medical history of men who volunteered to be questioned about how they rated their own erections, an Indian andrologist familiar with the methodology and findings said.         
	Some may need medical treatment, but others may only require a change in lifestyle, said Rupin Shah, consultant andrologist at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai. Too much stress can also lead to mild dysfunction.         
	But other medical experts not associated with the study have questioned the methodology and the conclusions. Medical history is crucial. Diabetes, high blood pressure and prostatic illness can all affect erections, said a senior doctor who has specialised in public health and pharmacology. Data about erectile dysfunction without medical history is incomplete.         
	Sex is also not always physical. There are psychological factors, interpersonal factors that influence sexual performance, a doctor said. Did the survey probe such issues?         
	The Asia-Pacific survey picked up 3,957 sexually active men from the general public, between 25 and 74 years of age who had had sexual intercourse at least once in the past 12 months.         
	Pfizer officials in India declined to provide comparative figures from each of the other 12 countries. Some of the data is still being analysed, but overall the Indian figure is consistent with the Asia-Pacific average, an official said.         
	Across the Asia-Pacific region, 57 per cent of men were not very satisfied with sex, according to the findings of the survey conducted between May-July 2008.         
	Pfizer is the manufacturer and seller of Viagra, the drug used to treat erectile dysfunction which was introduced in India about three years ago. But generic versions of the product are being sold by Indian companies.

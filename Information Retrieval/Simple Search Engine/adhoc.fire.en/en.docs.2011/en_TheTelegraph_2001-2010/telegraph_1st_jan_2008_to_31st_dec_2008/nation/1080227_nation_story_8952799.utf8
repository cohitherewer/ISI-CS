	Bhubaneswar, Feb 26: Lalu Parasad gifted the state Rs 366 crore more than the previous fiscal, promised four new trains, vowed extension of the journey of one and enhancement of the frequency of two others in the 2008-09 rail budget.
    
	But the sops were not enough to please the Orissa chief minister. Its disappointing, said Naveen Patnaik. He said that his request to Lalu Prasad for an outlay of more than Rs 1,330 crore was denied and Orissa received Rs 972 crore.
    
	No new lines have been sanctioned. The Bhubaneswar-Ranchi Garib Rath, announced by the minister last year, has not been introduced. The KBK region has been neglected and the rebel-hit areas have been ignored, he added.
    
	However, Orissa railway mandarins agree that the state received a good treatment in the (2008-09) budget with an allocation of Rs 972 crore as against the previous years Rs 606 crore. 
    
	Transport minister and BJP leader Jaynarayan Mishra differed, though. The allocation might seem higher, but a chunk of it will be spent on electrification of inter-state tracks and doubling of rail lines, he said.

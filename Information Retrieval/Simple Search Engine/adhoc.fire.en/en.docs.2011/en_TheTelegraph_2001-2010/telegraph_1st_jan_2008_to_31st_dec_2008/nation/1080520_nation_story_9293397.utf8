	Bhubaneswar, May 19: The Orissa government would now knock on the doors of the 13th Finance Commission to declare heatwave and lightning as natural calamities after repeated pleas to the Centre to do the same failed.         
	Every year, Orissa loses around 200-300 people to lightning. Similarly, heatwave claims around 50 lives every year. While the official heatwave toll last year was 48, the number in the past two months this summer has already reached 40.

	They pointed out that the Centre has, on the other hand, declared avalanche a major disaster in Uttaranchal as a natural calamity.         
	If the Centre declares heatwave and lightning as natural calamities, a victims family will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 1 lakh from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.         
	Now, the government pays Rs 50,000 (lightning) and Rs 10,000 (heatwave) to the kin out of its own funds.         
	State disaster management secretary G.V.V. Sharma said the government will be submitting the proposals to the 13th Finance Commission soon.         
	Meanwhile, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today announced that the state would be providing free food and shelter to people affected by fire for 15 days after the incident. Besides, they would be provided financial assistance to rebuild gutted houses and purchase utensils as well as clothes.         
	According to provisions under the Orissa Relief Code, each family living in urban area would be entitled to an assistance of Rs 25,000 for a fully damaged pucca house and Rs 10,000 for thatched and mud houses in rural areas.         
	If the affected people belong to BPL category, they get Rs 35,000 under the central governments Indira Awas Yojana or the state-funded Mo Kudia Yojana, said an official.

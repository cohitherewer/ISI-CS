The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi pays back Patels
                                                                                                            Modi pays back Patels
  - Group gets lions share of berths, riot-tainted MLA in        BASANT RAWAT                          Modi: Cabinet call                                        
	Gandhinagar, Jan. 4: Narendra Modi today inducted the first 18 ministers into his new government, heavily rewarding the Patel community for belying pre-poll predictions that it would unite against him.        
	Of the nine cabinet ministers and nine ministers of state, five are Patels who make up just a seventh of the states population.        
	The chief minister, having demolished party rebels in the Assembly elections, dropped seven of his previous ministers and brought in nine new faces.        
	Regionally, Modi favoured north Gujarat and Saurashtra, where the BJP did better than expected, with 13 of the 18 berths. Modi was said to be facing a Patel revolt in Saurashtra but the BJP won 33 of the regions 58 seats.        
	Of the 25 ministers in the pre-poll government, only nine have made it this time. Other than the seven Modi has dropped, two were denied tickets and seven lost the elections.        
	Prominent among those dropped are Ashok Bhatt, Bharat Barot, Anil Patel and Bhupendra Lakhawala. Bhatt, however, could be elected Speaker, sources said.        
	In 2002, Modi had decided to drop him but Bhatts supporters marched to Gandhinagar to stall the move. Now that the chief minister has emerged stronger than ever, there is unlikely to be any serious protest though he has axed so many ministers.        
	In the cabinet, Modi has retained five ministers  Vaju Vala, Narrota Patel, Anandiben Patel, Ramanlal Vora and Mangubhai Patel  and brought in four new faces: Jaynarayan Vyas, Nitin Patel, Fakir Vaghela and Dilip Sanghani.        
	Vyas, Nitin Patel and Vaghela were cabinet ministers in the government of Keshubhai Patel, Modis predecessor and the rebels mentor. Sanghani used to be MP from Amreli but lost the Lok Sabha election in 2004. A Patel loyalist, he has switched sides.        
	The nine junior ministers are Amit Shah, Saurab Patel, Jaswantsinh Babhor, Purshottam Solanki, Maya Kodnani, Parbat Patel, Kirtisinh Rana, Jaysinh Chauhan and Vasan Ahir.        
	The ministry has just two tribals though the states tribal population equals that of the Patels. The Other Backwards Classes have four berths and the Scheduled Castes just two.        
	Former Narmada development minister Jaynarayan Vyas has been given a cabinet berth after five years in the political wilderness.         
	In the run-up to the Assembly elections, he had been given the job of defending Modi on television. He seems to have been rewarded for a job well done.        
	MLA Maya Kodnanis induction as junior minister could create controversy. She is accused of inciting the Hindu mob in the Naroda-Patia massacre of February 28, 2002, and rights activists are likely to protest against her appointment.        
	Kodnani, a doctor, is a Sindhi and L.K. Advani loyalist. Modi wanted to deny her a ticket but Advani ensured that she was not only fielded but got a ministry berth, too, sources said.

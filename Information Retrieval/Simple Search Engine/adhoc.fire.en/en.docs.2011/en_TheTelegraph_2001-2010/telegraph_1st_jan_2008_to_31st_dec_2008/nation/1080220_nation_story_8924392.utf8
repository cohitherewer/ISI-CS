          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19: National Congress Party president and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today lambasted the BJD-BJP government in Orissa for neglecting the farmers and the poor.         
	Addressing the Parivartan Samavesh, the first rally organized by the party after its merger with JD(S) and Orissa Gana Parishad, a regional outfit, Pawar said the economic condition of the people, especially the poor, had deteriorated during the eight-year rule of the present government.        
	Orissa has remained the poorest, thanks to apathy of the Naveen Patnaik government. I fail to understand how this government has never presented the case of farmers before the Centre, said the union agriculture minister.

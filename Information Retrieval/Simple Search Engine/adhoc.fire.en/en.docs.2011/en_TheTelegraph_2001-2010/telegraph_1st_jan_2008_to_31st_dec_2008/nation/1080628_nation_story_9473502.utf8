	Cuttack, June 27: Orissa High Court postponed its verdict on legality of vesting amrutamanohi land of Lord Jagannath with the state government to July 16, reports our correspondent.        
	The two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and M.M. Das deferred the case after state revenue commissioner-cum-secretary G.V.V. Sharma appeared in the court and clarified the governments stand on the issue.        
	The outcome of the case assumes significance as nearly 44,535 acres in Puri were recorded as amrutamanohi land, but were vested in the government in 1974. Amrutamanohi lands are extensive properties endowed to Lord Jagannath but in the possession of maths and other religious institutions connected with the Puri temple.

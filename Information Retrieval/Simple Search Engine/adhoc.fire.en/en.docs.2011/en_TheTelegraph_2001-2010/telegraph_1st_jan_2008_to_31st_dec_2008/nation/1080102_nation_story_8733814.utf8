     RADHIKA RAMASESHAN
             Rahul
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is not expected to wear his familys political mantle for another six years  till he is 25 and eligible to contest an election. 
    
	Rahul Gandhi is not handicapped by age. He will turn 38 on June 19, has been declared the Congresss heir apparent by seniors in the party, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and holds a formal position with a specific mandate.
    
	But nobodys sure if he will lead the Congress in the 2009 general elections. Sources said they would get an inkling of Rahuls future role  he is general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India  after the results of 10 state elections due in 2008 come in.
    
	Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram go to polls this year. 
    
	The Congress has lost all the elections it has fought since the Amethi MP started campaigning. 
    
	While no one suggests Rahul is to blame even partially, sources said he was unlikely to lead a losing coalition in 2009. He is not expected to take the lead role unless he is convinced the Congress can win 200 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and function as a stronger nucleus of the next coalition than it is now with 152 MPs, they added.
    
	The party is looking at the 10 state polls as a dress rehearsal for the general elections.
    
	It is in power in only three of the states: on its own in Delhi and in an alliance in Jammu and Kashmir and Meghalaya. On Indias political map, these would be considered unsubstantial because between them, they have only 15 MPs. 
    
	Rahul is clear that unless the Congress gets its act together in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Tamil Nadu, there is no way the party can touch 200 seats, sources said. 
    
	Maharashtra is the only other big state in the Congresss kitty but there, too, the party is in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).
    
	The Congresss assessment is that it would have to wrest Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan from the BJP, win Karnataka and keep Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi and Meghalaya before Rahul can start to think big.
    
	He belongs to a family, a dynasty, so there are pressures and expectations. The bar is very high for Rahul as it was for Rajiv Gandhi, said Sachin Pilot, one of the Congresss young MPs.
    
	Another compelling reason that Rahul may have to wait is the realisation in the Congress that Sonia is the tallest leader the party has now. 
    
	Unlike his father and uncle Sanjay Gandhi, who had a sweeping mandate from the time they entered politics because Indira Gandhi wanted it that way, Rahul is conscious that his mother is in control and he will implement only what she wants. 
    
	He is also cautious in his conduct. Careful not to repeat the mistakes his father made, Rahul keeps self-appointed advisers at bay. He is straight, matter-of-fact and to the point. Theres no idle chatter with him, said an Uttar Pradesh MP.

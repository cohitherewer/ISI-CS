	Dec. 4: Maharashtra industries minister Ashok Chavan has emerged front-runner to replace Vilasrao Deshmukh as chief minister.         
	Most of the states Congress MLAs have extended support to the son of former Union home minister S.B. Chavan for the post his father once held, sources said.        
	They added that the other candidates discussed were Narayan Rane and Kopargaon MP Balasaheb Vikhe Patil.        
	Chavan pipped the rest by dint of the one attribute the Congress cherishes the most: lineage. That he is a Maratha too proved an asset because the Congress did not want to annoy this dominant community by bringing in a non-Maratha like Sushil Shinde, a Dalit.        
	While Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony were soliciting MLAs views in the morning, speculation was settling in on another Maratha: Rane. But his origins in the Shiv Sena went against him.        
	The Congress also factored in the possibility of ally NCP anointing another former Shiv Sainik, Chhagan Bhujbal, in place of R.R. Patil, who stepped down as home minister.        
	We cant have two former Sainiks in the two top posts, a Congress source said.         
	Vikhe Patils chances were spoiled by a similar reason: he is from the BJP.        
	NCP sources said Pawar was keener on Rane or Vikhe Patil because he believed that the Congresss true blue Marathas would feel betrayed by their leaders and could shift their loyalties to him. The Congress apparently sniffed this too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Survival test for two-seat Farooq
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Survival test for two-seat Farooq
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Farooq: Afraid?                                  
	Srinagar, Dec. 22: Farooq Abdullah will be fighting to save his political career on Wednesday when he faces the electorate for the first time from urban Srinagar.        
	That the National Conferences (NCs) candidate for chief minister is contesting from two constituencies, Hazratbal and Sonwar, betrays his fear that no seat in Kashmir is safe for him. It has given the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) a stick to beat him with.        
	The PDP is saying I was afraid of losing and that is why I am contesting from two places. But you need to have heart to do so. I can contest from anywhere and it (Kashmir) is my place, Farooq said.        
	The former chief minister had never lost from Ganderbal between 1983 and 1996, but left the seat to son Omar in 2002 who lost to the PDPs Qazi Afzal. Omar again fought from Ganderbal this time.        
	Farooq had at first decided to contest only from Hazratbal, famous for the shrine that houses a relic of Prophet Mohammed, and whose new complex was built by Farooqs father Sheikh Abdullah. The seat has always gone to the NC since Sheikh Abdullah joined electoral politics in 1975.        
	But Farooq realised the contest would be difficult this time. His challengers are the Congresss Aga Mohsin and the PDPs Asiya Naqash, both political greenhorns. Aga is banking on the support of the seats sizeable Shia voters who will hold the key if the Sunnis boycott the polls.        
	Asiya too has made significant inroads into Hazratbals rural pockets as a corporator in the Srinagar civic body.        
	Farooq, therefore, decided to fight also from Sonwar. But here too he faces a challenge from the PDPs Ghulam Qadir Pardesi.        
	In case both constituencies boycott the elections, Farooq and his rivals are evenly matched since they all have small bands of dedicated workers who can swing the battle in their favour. If Farooq fails to win either seat, it could be curtains for his political career.        
	Farooq sahib is himself his biggest enemy. He has a non-serious image. The kind of statements he has issued like PoK should be bombed may do great damage to him and the party, an NC leader said.        
	Srinagars eight constituencies were once considered NC bastions. Its from this city that the party had risen to challenge the might of the Dogra rulers in the 1930s.        
	The partys dominance was challenged for the first time in the 1987 elections by the Muslim United Front, an alliance of various groups that are now spearheading the separatist struggle. The NC swept those polls but it is widely believed that the election was rigged.        
	For the past two decades, the party has maintained its hold over the city by default. Srinagar has boycotted every single election over these years, leaving the field open for a small but dedicated network of NC workers. That advantage may be gone. In the past six years, the PDP has built its own network, small but dedicated.

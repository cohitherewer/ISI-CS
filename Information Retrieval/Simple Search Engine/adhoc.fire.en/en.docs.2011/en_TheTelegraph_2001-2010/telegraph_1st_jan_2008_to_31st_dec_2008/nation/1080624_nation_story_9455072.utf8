	Mumbai, June 23 (PTI): Indian drug manufacturers are facing an acute shortage of imported erythromycin thiocyanate, a key component in certain antibiotics.        
	There will be a shortfall of 1,500 million tonnes (mt) of the chemical, the estimated demand for which is 2,700-2,800mt annually, the Indian Drug manufactures Association has written to the Drugs Controller General of India.        
	As there is no substitute for erythromycin thiocyanate and other high-range macrolides, we request you to allow the clearance of all consignments on a fast-track basis till December 2008, it said.

	Raipur, Oct. 17: The Bijapur district collector faced the election commission axe after the former was reportedly not satisfied with preparations made in the district  incidentally the worst rebel-hit district in Chhattisgarh  for the ensuing Assembly election.        
	State government sources said the commission ordered the removal of Bijapur district collector late on Thursday and asked the government to enforce the order with immediate effect. Following the commissions order, the state transferred Bijapur district collector L.S. Ken, sources said, adding that the mining director, M.K. Tyagi, would replace him.         
	The poll panel action came after senior commission officials recently held a meeting in the divisional headquarters of Bastar to review the preparations for the ensuing Assembly elections in November.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has won the presidents post of the Delhi University Students Union, wresting it from the Congresss National Students Union of India after eight years.         
	The NSUI retained the other three posts of vice-president, general secretary and joint secretary in elections that are traditionally considered a pointer to state polls. The Delhi Assembly elections are due later this year.         
	Nupur Sharma of the ABVP won the presidents post by 1,639 votes, defeating Sonia Sapra of the NSUI. Manohar Nagar, Manish Choudhary and Ashish Gehlot of the NSUI became the vice-president, the general secretary and the joint secretary. The NSUI held all four posts in the outgoing panel.         
	Despite winning the top post, the ABVP has alleged irregularities in counting and demanded a recount.         
	We are happy with the victory to the presidential post. But we have lodged a complaint with the university authorities against what we believe are serious irregularities in counting, which have denied us victory to other posts, said Niharika Sharma, Delhi general secretary of the ABVP.         
	The students union president can use executive powers only if there is a divide in the four-member panel.         
	Soon after the results were declared, outgoing president Amrita Bahri said the onus would be on Sharma to work with the NSUI winners.         
	The university has a student voting population of around 80,000. Roughly 30,000 voted in yesterdays elections.

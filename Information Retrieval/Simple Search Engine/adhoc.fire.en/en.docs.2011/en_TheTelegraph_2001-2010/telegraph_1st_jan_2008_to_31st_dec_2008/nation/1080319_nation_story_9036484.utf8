The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Blacklist Israel arms firms: Left
                                                                                                               Blacklist Israel arms firms: Left
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 18: The Left has asked the Centre to take action on Israeli firms in the way it had taken steps against Bofors of Sweden and Denel of South Africa.        
	The move followed the Lefts dissatisfaction with the governments go-slow on defence deals with Israel.         
	By turning a blind eye to systematic violation of Indian laws by Israeli firms, India is sending out wrong signals to international arms manufacturers at a time when India is embarking on huge overseas military acquisition, with the potential to corrupt and derail the entire system, the CPM, the CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP have written in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	This is the second defence-related issue the Left has taken up this week. Yesterday, its members of Parliament demanded an explanation from the Centre of the conditions for the navys purchase of the US warship Trenton (now named the INS Jalashva).         
	In the defence ministry, the top brass is worried that with the Left taking up these issues so frequently, an unspoken agreement to keep military deals and modernisation programmes beyond politics may have broken down.         
	We have been noting with growing concern the manner in which arms deals with Israel are being conducted. Israel is already the second-largest supplier to India. It is now clear that Israeli arms manufacturers, including government-owned entities, have been blatantly violating Indian laws by using middlemen and by giving kickbacks to officials involved in the decision-making process, the Left leaders wrote.         
	The immediate provocation for the letter was the CBIs arrest of arms dealer Suresh Nanda, suspected of illegally functioning as an agent for Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) and the Rafael corporation.         
	The leaders said there was now enough evidence that the IAI and Rafael had bribed and corrupted the system to win orders. In Israel, they pointed out, Moshe Keretz, who headed the IAI for 20 years till 2005, has been arrested and is facing prosecution.         
	Regrettably, despite all this evidence, the UPA government has shown a remarkable reluctance to take action against IAI, Rafael and other Israeli arms companies. The Swedish firm Bofors was blacklisted after the involvement of middlemen was proved in the notorious deal. The South African firm Denel was similarly blacklisted in 2005 for resorting to agents and kickbacks.         
	But demands that similar action be initiated against IAI and other Israeli firms have been ignored. Some high authorities have bent over backwards to argue that the cases were not similar in some unexplained manner, the parties wrote in the letter.         
	The Left was aghast that the government had further cemented the alliance with IAI by signing a massive $2.5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore) deal for co-development of more advanced Barak NG (new generation) and Barak-8 missiles with longer range and for land-based anti-missile applications.

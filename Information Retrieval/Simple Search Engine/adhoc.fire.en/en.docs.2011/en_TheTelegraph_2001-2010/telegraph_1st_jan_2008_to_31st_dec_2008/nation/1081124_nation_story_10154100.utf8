                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Police failure on lips, PM plans revamp 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh with Intelligence Bureau chief PC Halder in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Police and intelligence agencies have failed to prevent Naxalite and terror attacks, the Prime Minister said today and announced a task force for overhauling the security set-up.        
	The inability of the intelligence agencies and the police to obtain pinpointed and actionable intelligence and in time has enabled these outfits to carry out some high-profile attacks, Manmohan Singh told the annual conference of state police chiefs and senior officers here.        
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan will head the task force, comprising officials of central and state agencies. It will draw up a roadmap for a new command structure.        
	The Prime Minister used the occasion to remind the officers that aspersions were being cast on police impartiality. And while I recognise that much of this is motivated, you must face up to the reality that many are convinced that the police are less than fair. This is so even when policemen die in the line of duty, Singh said.        
	The reference, coming against the backdrop of allegations of bias in recent terror probes, appeared directed not only at policemen but also at fellow politicians.        
	L.K. Advani has accused the Maharashtra anti-terror squad of torturing Malegaon blast suspects. Amar Singh had questioned the Jamia Nagar encounter in which Delhi police inspector Mohan Chand Sharma died.        
	The admission about the failure to prevent the spread of Naxalism and the announcement of a task force come a year after the Prime Minister dubbed Left-wing extremism the biggest security challenge before the country.        
	Today, the threat seemed as strong as ever when Singh said the task force would develop within 100 days an integrated capability to address challenges in the areas of Left-wing extremism, terrorism and insurgency.        
	 The objective is to strengthen inter-state and inter-agency collaboration and develop a Net-centric information command structure that enables state and central agencies to access and exploit information in a secure and timely manner, the Prime Minister added.         
	The task force headed by Narayanan will be followed by a committee of five state police chiefs, on a rotation basis, to advise the government on matters related to the police, Singh said.         
	He nudged the home ministry to seek inputs from officers in the field. The contours of internal security have changed fundamentally over the years and the basic character of threats has become greatly enlarged and more complicated.        
	Singh called for attitudinal changes in the police, saying efforts to turn them into a professionally competent and technologically advanced force havent shown tangible results on the ground. The panel of state police chiefs will assess what needs to be done.        
	The emphasis of the revamp will be on technology and achieving a networked security architecture, with Singh saying the police have not been able to grapple with unforeseen risks and hidden threats well.

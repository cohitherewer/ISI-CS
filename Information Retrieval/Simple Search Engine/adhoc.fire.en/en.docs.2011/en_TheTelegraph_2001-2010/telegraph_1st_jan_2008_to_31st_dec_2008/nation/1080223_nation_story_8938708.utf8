          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Supreme Court today slammed Raj Thackerays sons-of-the-soil theory but refused to take any action against his party.        
	We will not permit Balkanisation of this country. This sons-of-the-soil theory is not acceptable to us, a bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said.         
	The court dubbed the Maharashtra Navnirman Senas attacks on north Indians a dangerous tendency, but said it could not give an order to derecognise the party.         
	Have you approached the Election Commission? the chief justice asked the lawyer who had filed the petition. The MNS headed by Raj (in picture) is a registered party but has yet to be recognised by the poll panel.        
	The court also refused to issue a directive to the Maharashtra government to stop the violence against north Indians. Law and order is a state subject. The state government will take care of it.

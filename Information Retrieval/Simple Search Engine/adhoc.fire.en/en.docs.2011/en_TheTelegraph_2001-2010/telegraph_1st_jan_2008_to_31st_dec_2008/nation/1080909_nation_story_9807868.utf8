	New Delhi, Sept. 8 (PTI): The US today said India had missed a major opportunity for a liberalised regime on the much sought-after H1B visas by not agreeing to the Doha deal in Geneva in July.        
	Among the issues on the table in the Doha round were Mode 4  movement of professionals  and potential to raise the cap on H1B visas. By not participating fully in the round, India missed an opportunity to be able to work on these issues that are important for its future, David Bohigian, assistant secretary (market access and compliance), US department of commerce, said at a CII seminar here.        
	Talks between 30 key trade ministers for a global trade deal collapsed at the WTO headquarters over differences between India and the US on a safeguards mechanism for farmers in developing nations against import surges.        
	The US issues about 65,000 H1B visas every year allowing foreign professionals to take up temporary work in the US.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | To Sonia, with My Life
                                                                                                               To Sonia, with My Life
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 22: L.K. Advani today called on Sonia Gandhi and gifted her a copy of his autobiography, possibly picking Holi to bridge a 10-year communication gap.        
	Two days after the Congress stayed away from the book release, he and his wife dropped in at 10 Janpath and exchanged pleasantries with Sonia over sweets. Sources said politics did not figure in the 15-minute chat.        
	Political tongues are wagging overtime on what could have prompted the BJP leader to break the ice. Since Sonia became Congress chief, the two have come across as not being on the best of terms or as rivals ready to snipe at each other.        
	Advani also presented Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a copy of the book. But the visit did not cause a flutter since Advani, as leader of the Opposition, has been interacting with him.        
	Advani apparently sought an appointment with Sonia saying he wanted to gift her My Country My Life. Political observers said the book might just have been an excuse Advani could be trying to redeem his image after his elevation as the NDAs Prime Minister candidate.        
	Some said the gesture marked a change in Advanis political outlook, though it wasnt clear what exactly they meant. Others said he could be trying to increase his acceptability.        
	Former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee shared a cordial relationship with Sonia.        
	The freeze in communication between Advani and the UPA chairperson has often been talked of in political circles. A section of Congress leaders has said an informal channel with the BJP would facilitate national consensus on issues like the nuclear deal.        
	In a recent interview, Advani had said it was sad he did not have any communication with Sonia and the strain was reflecting on his relationship with Singh.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said Advanis spontaneous gesture was met in equal spirit by Sonia.        
	This is the interesting thing in a democracy  they are political adversaries though they may not be personal enemies, he told PTI.        
	Advani has made critical references to Sonia in his book, including her foreign-origin controversy and the Bofors scandal.        
	He has accused her of active and irrefutable collusion in covering up Ottavio Quattrocchis role and said it is devoid of any political morality and unbecoming of a person aspiring to hold highest executive office in India.

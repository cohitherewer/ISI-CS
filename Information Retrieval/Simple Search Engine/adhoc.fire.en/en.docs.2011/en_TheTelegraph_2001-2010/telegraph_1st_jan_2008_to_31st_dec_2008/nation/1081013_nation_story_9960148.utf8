          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 12: For 75-year-old Balaram Rout, a retired IAS officer, it has turned out to be virtually an unending ordeal.        
	Over 17 years ago, a day before his retirement, vigilance officials conducted raids at his residence. Though a criminal case was registered against him a fortnight later under the Prevention of Corruption Act, there had since been no trial.        
	Rout had joined the Orissa Administrative Service on March 10, 1956, and was promoted to the Indian Administrative Service on August 6, 1988.         
	He retired as settlement officer, Cuttack-Puri major circle, Cuttack, on superannuation of service on July 31, 1991.        
	Official records show S.R. Singh, the inspector of police (vigilance cell), registered the disproportionate assets case involving nearly Rs 7 lakh on August 14, 1991. But the chargesheet was filed after a long delay of nearly five years by H.C. Mohanty, deputy superintendent of police (vigilance cell) on June 30, 1996, for his trial in the court of law.        
	Worse, still the trial proceedings had not started till date.         
	While not a single witness was examined, at least seven of them had died during this period.        
	The retired bureaucrat, finding no way out of this torment, has filed a petition in the Orissa High Court seeking intervention against infringement of his right to speedy trial guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.        
	From the date of the institution of the case and criminal proceeding thereof, he is spending his days with great anxiety and mental agony, he said in his petition, adding that the delay in trial all these years has disturbed his peace of mind and made him incapable of pursuing his avocation of life.        
	Rout has further pointed out that the prosecution had so far not been able to produce a witness for examination despite clear orders from the trial court. More so, all the important witnesses for the defence had died one after the other, he rued.        
	The petition has cited the names of seven persons who had died between January 1992 and November 2007 as important witnesses (relatives) who could have testified about his income which had not been accounted for by the prosecution.        
	Routs entire period of service was taken as check period and he was found by the state vigilance to have allegedly acquired and possessed pecuniary resources to the tune of Rs 7,20,997 disproportionate to his known sources of income by corrupt and illegal means.

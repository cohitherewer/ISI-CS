	McCluskieganj, Oct. 16: Suspected Maoists attacked McCluskieganj station late last night and abducted four railway employees.         
	According to porter Bhubaneswar who witnessed the raid, the rebels reached the station, 60km from Ranchi, around 11.45pm.         
	Assistant station manager Kamal Kishore and guard Munshi Prasad were in the main office. Holding guns to their heads, the gang forced the duo to lead them to the houses of deputy station managers S.D. Ekka and S.K. Kujur.        
	All four were whisked away into a nearby forest, Bhubaneswar said.        
	Police blamed the Jharkhand Prastuti Committee, a breakaway Maoist group, though it hasnt claimed responsibility for the incident.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 20: The Supreme Court has asked judges to punish rash drivers with deterrent sentences that sow fear in their minds, and not to be lenient even towards first-time offenders.        
	A two-judge bench said courts should ensure that a driver must always keep in his mind the fear psyche that if he is convicted (of killing) due to his callous driving he cannot escape jail sentence.        
	The court also urged the government to give these convicts driving and traffic lessons, as well as lessons in moral responsibility, while they are in jail as part of a correctional course.        
	Judges should pass sentences bearing in mind the galloping trend in road accidents in India and the devastating consequences visiting the victims and their families. While considering the quantum of sentence (for) rash or negligent driving, one of the prime considerations should be deterrence, it said. This is the role the courts can play in lessening the high rate of motor accidents.        
	The order comes a month after the apex court had said it was useless directing governments to crack down on reckless driving since they were uninterested in enforcing traffic rules and ignored court orders on the subject.        
	A week before that, a speeding bus had killed 21 people in Calcutta amid revelations how driving licences were bought and rash drivers escaped the law thanks to police inaction, political patronage and union pressure.        
	However, the court today also asked the government to consider parole to the poorer rash-driving convicts who may be their familys bread-winner  though only after they have completed the correctional course.        
	Sentencing must have a policy of correction. This driver, if he has to become a good driver, must have a better training in traffic laws and moral responsibility, with special reference to potential injury to human life and limb. Punishment must, therefore, be accompanied by these components, it said.        
	The state, we hope, will attach a course for better driving together with a livelier sense of responsibility. Maybe the state may consider, in cases of men with poor families, occasional parole and reformatory courses without the rigour of the old rules.        
	The court today restored a one-year term awarded to bus driver B. Nagabhushanam, who had killed a seven-year-old girl in 1999 on the Bangalore-Hindupur road.        
	He had been sentenced to a years simple imprisonment and fined Rs 1,000 under Section 304A (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), and given one month and fined Rs 500 under Section 279 (rash driving).        
	The high court had cut the 304A jail term to six months, leaving the rest of the sentence intact. The apex court restored the trial court sentence, citing an earlier judgment that advised deterrent sentences in such cases.        
	A professional driver must constantly inform himself that he cannot afford to have a single moment of laxity or inattentiveness, the court said.         
	It added that the driver should not take a chance thinking rash driving need not cause an accident; that an accident need not kill; that even if someone dies he may not be convicted; and that even if he is convicted the courts would be lenient.

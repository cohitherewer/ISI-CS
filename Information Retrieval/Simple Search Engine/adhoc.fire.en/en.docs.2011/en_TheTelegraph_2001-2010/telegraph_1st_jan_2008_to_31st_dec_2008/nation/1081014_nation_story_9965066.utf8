	New Delhi, Oct. 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court today questioned the legal standing of NGOs fighting on behalf of Singur farmers whose land the Bengal government had taken over for the now scuttled Nano project.        
	We dont allow somebody else to file petitions on behalf of others, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said while hearing a petition filed by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR).        
	The comment came after Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the association which claimed it was an old human rights organisation of Bengal, said though the Tatas had moved out of Singur, in Hooghly district, the land still remained with the government.        
	The Tata Motors project last week moved to Gujarat after weeks of protests led by the Opposition Trinamul Congress over the return of acquired plots to unwilling landlosers.        
	The bench, which also included Justices P. Sathasivam and Aftab Alam, said the petitioner had to disclose who these landowners were. They (landowners) can say they have not authorised you to file the PIL, the court said.        
	When Bhushan said rules were not followed while acquiring the land, the court tagged the issue with other petitions pending before it.        
	Earlier, Kedar Nath Yadav, a practising lawyer, had also challenged the acquisition of land for the Nano project.        
	In its petition, the association had challenged a Calcutta High Court decision that upheld the land acquisition by the state government as legal.        
	The association said the high court had failed to consider that the acquisition was conducted without any attempt by the government to look for alternative plots suitable for industry, several of which are lying vacant in the state itself.        
	The governments move, it added, was against the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Families, 2003, and the National Policy for Farmers, 2008.        
	Bhushan said taking over land for a private company at the expense of the livelihood of several thousand people, environmental degradation and loss of vital food production was a colourable exercise of power as the acquisition was not in pursuance of any public purpose.        
	The government should have invited tenders, he added, and contended that the purported notification under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, for taking over nearly 1,000 acres of fertile farmland was not in public interest.        
	The association sought a directive from the court to restrain the state government from taking any steps to acquire the land and from interfering with the right of landowners and farmers to possess and use their lands.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: A police informer who had turned into a trigger-happy robber terrorising Delhi was shot dead today, two months after a hunt began for him.        
	Bunty alias Om Prakash, 37, and his accomplice Rajesh, 28, were killed in an encounter in Badarpur, on the capitals border with Haryanas Faridabad, early this morning.        
	Bunty, the kingpin of what came to be known in Delhi as the bikers gang because the thugs sped in and out of spots on motorcycles, had become notorious because they opened fire whenever they were stopped or chased.        
	The 5.30am encounter occurred when police were alerted about the presence of the duo in a Badarpur house.        
	On seeing us, they locked themselves in and started firing. They were shot dead in retaliatory fire, an officer said.         
	The gunbattle left three policemen injured, but they are out of danger. Three imported and four country-made pistols, live cartridges and knives were recovered from the spot.         
	It was a hot pursuit. Bunty was on alert and as soon as the team reached the spot, he opened fire at our personnel, Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said.        
	According to PTI, a police tip-off suggested the duo had wanted to kill two businessmen who they feared could depose against them whenever they were caught and tried.         
	A probe is on to uncover possible links of the owner of the house where Bunty and Rajesh were holed up with the gang.        
	Bunty, wanted in 22 cases of murder and robbery, had formed the bike gang last year while he was in jail.        
	The doors to Buntys home in south Delhis Sangam Vihar were shut. Relatives refused to talk. His family had reportedly disowned him a year ago. Neighbours said Bunty didnt stay there but came once in a few months.        
	Buntys uninterrupted crime run and his ability to bamboozle Delhi police had embarrassed the force given that he had been their informer until a few years back.        
	Later, he had turned against the very force he worked for. As an informer, he had helped in the arrest of several dreaded criminals after coming out of jail, where he had spent three years from 2002 to 2005.

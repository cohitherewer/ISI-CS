                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wanted, pale face for Buddha

	Cannes, May 20: A hunt is being launched immediately in India and Nepal for an actor, aged 24-30 but not too dark, to play the lead role in an international film, Buddha, the movies director, Pan Nalin, has announced in Cannes.        
	This is not one of those Shekhar Kapur may do projects, according to Nalin (in picture), a Gujarati who shifted to Paris as a young man when Bollywood sent him away with a cuff round his ears when he expressed a desire to make movies.        
	Nalins international hits now include Samsara and Valley of Flowers. We are locked in, we are in advanced negotiation with the Mahindra amp; Mahindra group, the budget will be $15-18 million, they are getting into entertainment and will fully support this movie, he said.        
	We have just hired a reputed international casting director, Victoria Thomas, who did Last Samurai and Blood Diamond; we will shoot 30 per cent of the movie in India but most of it in Thailand which has lakes and lush forests, he added.        
	We begin principal photography in October and the shoot will be three-and-a-half months long, he continued.        
	 The script, too, is written jointly by me and a Hollywood writer, Tinker Lindsay, and that is also locked in. I am under pressure to start the shoot, which, in a way, is a good thing.         
	There is only one hitch  there is as yet no Buddha. We are looking for an Indian star  we are looking all over, the director said.        
	Hence, Nalin is beginning a search for the right actor in India and in Nepal, where Siddhartha Gautama is believed to have been born 2,500 years ago in Lumbini.        
	It will be one of the most expensive movies made out of India through a company, Monsoon Films, where I am a partner he said.         
	We do need one or two big names to make the film marketable but they must be international names  an Indian name is not enough.        
	He confirmed he had met Aishwarya Rai a couple of months ago and offered her the role of Princess Yashodhara, the wife his Siddhartha will leave behind to seek enlightenment. Shes thinking about it, was as far as Nalin would go.         
	As Nalin was talking to The Telegraph last night, seated on a bench on the Croisette, he recognised a South Korean actress doing a photo shoot with snappers from her own country.        
	She is the Aishwarya Rai of South Korea, enthused Nalin. Except she is a better actress.         
	Lest Aishwarya be offended, he added hastily: Aishwarya has the perfect face.         
	Nalin is open-minded about where he might find his perfect Buddha. Although he did not say so  and this is not quite in the same category as black girls being chucked out of cheerleaders troupes in India  perhaps dark complexioned actors should save their postage stamps for another job application.        
	So should established stars such as Hrithik Roshan. He looks nothing like Buddha, Nalin pointed out.         
	It is not that he pretends he knows what Buddha looked like though Nalin has spent the last three years doing exhaustive research into his subject.         
	But he has concluded that his Buddha will have to be on slightly the paler side. Buddha came from people known as satyans, who were of strong Aryan descent.         
	The chosen one may have slightly mongoloid features, a little like Keanu Reeves, but he must be a very good actor though not a well known star. He will have to age to 45 years during the course of the film.        
	 Should the Indian sub-continent fail to deliver, Nalin will go global with his hunt.         
	Buddha was completely a human being, there should not be a reverential approach  thats one thing I have decided, he emphasised.         
	We may have turned him into a God. We wont knock him. When we discover the man, we will have much more respect for him.

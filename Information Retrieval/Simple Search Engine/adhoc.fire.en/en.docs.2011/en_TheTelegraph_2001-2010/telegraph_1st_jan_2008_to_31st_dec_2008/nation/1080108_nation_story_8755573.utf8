     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Chennai, Jan. 7: India and the US will set up teams of experts to find ways of ensuring safe food and drug imports into each others territory.
    
	Both countries announced this here today, with visiting US officials hastening to say the move was not a reflection on the quality of Indian exports to America.
    
	The idea is rather to strengthen the integrity of the made-in-India brand by anticipating and correcting problems, said the secretary of the US department of health and human services, Michael . Leavitt.
    
	He blamed Beijing, saying import safety had become a public issue in America after recent worries over the quality of certain products brought in from China. These include dog and other animal feed and toys with lead paint, which have become symbols of profound anxiety all over the world.
    
	Leavitt, who began a six-day tour of India today, faced the media with health minister Anbumani Ramadoss after three-hour bilateral talks.
    
	Certain products are categorised as drug products in India and as food products in America, Ramadoss told reporters. These differences should be bridged using our common goals, Leavitt said.
    
	The panels will explore firm agreements between the two countries, the US official said, adding that if the marketplace was to punish rapidly those who do not produce effective and safe goods, consumers needed to be provided with more transparent information.
    
	Asked if such a bilateral agreement would not encroach on the domain of the World Trade Organisation, Leavitt said: Clearly any standard needs to be established on the basis of the best available science.
    
	Leavitt said the US had a good system of import safety but it was not adequate for the future. So there was a need to collaborate and network with other countries. The US panel will include members from Americas well-known Food and Drug Administration.
    
	India will set up a bureaucratic group headed by the health and family welfare secretary and a technical group led by the former Indian Council of Medical Research director-general, Dr N.K. Ganguly.

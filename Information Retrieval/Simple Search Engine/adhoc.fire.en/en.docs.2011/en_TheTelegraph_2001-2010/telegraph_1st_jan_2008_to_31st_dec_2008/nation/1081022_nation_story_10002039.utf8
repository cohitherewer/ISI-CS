                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     13 sailors freed after fresh hijack
                            
	Mogadishu, Oct. 21 (Agencies): Somali gunmen acting as freelance coast guards freed a hijacked Indian dhow and its 13 crew members after a battle with pirates off the countrys northern coast, a official said today.        
	The hijack, which took place this weekend, came days after India decided to deploy a warship to patrol the Gulf of Aden in the wake of a spate of pirate attacks on merchant navy vessels in the African waters.         
	Four of the pirates were captured during todays shootout and another four escaped, said Ali Abdi Aware, the foreign minister of Somalias semi-autonomous region of Puntland. None of the dhows crew was wounded.         
	Somalia does not have a formal coast guard, but groups of heavily armed clan-based militias sometimes do the job for local authorities.        
	The cargo-laden Indian vessel was en route to Somalia when it was seized, said Noel Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureaus piracy reporting centre in Kuala Lumpur. The bureau received a distress report from a third party yesterday and is still verifying the time and date of the attack, he said.         
	However, suspense persisted over the fate of another 18 Indian crew members taken hostage by Somali pirates aboard the MV Stolt Valor last month.        
	The attacks came despite increased international co-operation to crack down on pirates in the region. It shows that the momentum is still there, the attacks are continuing in this key shipping route, Choong said.

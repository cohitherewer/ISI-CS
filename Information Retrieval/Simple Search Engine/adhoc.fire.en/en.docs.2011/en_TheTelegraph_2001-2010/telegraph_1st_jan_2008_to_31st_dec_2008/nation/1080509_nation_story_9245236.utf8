          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 8: Raja Acharya, the prime accused in the murder of Biranchi Das, was subjected to intense interrogation for more than four hours today.         
	Though police officers were tight-lipped regarding the outcome, police sources said the gangster, during interrogation, revealed vital clues.         
	Acharya, who was brought on remand by the city police from Panaji for five days, was quizzed by additional commissioner of police Y.B. Khurania, who heads a special interrogation team, deputy commissioner of police Himanshu Lal and investigating officer P.K. Patnaik.         
	The interrogation was held at the Infocity police station.         
	Although the team declined to divulge any details to the media, they presented an interrogation report to the new police commissioner B.K. Sharma, who took over last night, replacing B.K. Behera.         
	Behera was shifted after Raja Acharya named him as one of the conspirators in the murder along with former IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik, album co-ordinator Jubuli Sunderray and actress Leslie Tripathy.        
	Sharma, who took over as the new police commissioner late last night, did not interrogate Acharya.         
	He, however, called on the chief secretary and home secretary today and later spoke to the media stating that he would see that the investigation is completed within the time frame.         
	Sharma, however, refused to comment on the case.         
	He ruled out the possibility of change in the investigating team. Asked if he would form a new team, Sharma said: There is no guarantee that a new team will perform better,.        
	Previously, Sharma headed the crime branch wing of the Orissa police.        
	Hearing stalled         
	The PIL seeking the arrest of senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik for alleged involvement in the murder of Das and a CBI probe into the murder could not be taken up for hearing due to the absence of the petitioners lawyer.         
	The PIL was listed for hearing for admission today in the court of the two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B.N. Mohapatra. The bench, however, could not commence hearing as the petitioner counsel Arun Kumar Budhia was absent.        
	The court issued directions for fresh listing of the case on Tuesday.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Baker jailed for killing cow
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 9 (PTI): A Delhi court has sentenced a baker to one year in prison for stabbing his neighbours pregnant cow to death.        
	Naseem Khan, 25, allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed the cow three times when it entered his south Delhi shop and started munching on foodstuff. The animal died on the spot.        
	The court pronounced Khan guilty under Section 429 (mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any elephant, camel or horse) of the Indian Penal Code.        
	The prosecution has succeeded in proving its case against the accused beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt and that he gave blows to the cow, which caused her death, the court said.        
	The court rejected Khans plea for leniency on the ground that he had aged parents and a child to look after. Khan had also cited his lack of criminal record.        
	Complainant Vir Singh, Khans neighbour, told the court the accused had stabbed his pregnant cow on May 20, 2001, after it entered his bakery at Sangam Vihar.         
	Singh identified Khan during the trial as the accused, the court noted, adding that the defence did not cross-examine the complainant.        
	It is settled law (that) if the witness is not cross-examined on any point, his testimony is deemed to be accepted by the accused, the court said.        
	It dismissed Khans plea that he had been framed, saying there was no record of enmity between the complainant and the accused.

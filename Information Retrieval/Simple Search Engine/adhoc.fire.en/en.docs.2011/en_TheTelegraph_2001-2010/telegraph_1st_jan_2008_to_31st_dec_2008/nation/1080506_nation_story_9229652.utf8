          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           A file photo of Budhia   Singh and mother   Sukanti Singh      
	Bhubaneswar, May 5: Gangster Raja Acharyas arrest may be the talk of the town but it means little to Sukanti Singh, the mother of Budhia Singh.         
	Braving the scorching sun, she has been visiting Bargarh police station for the past two days to check the progress of her complaint against late Biranchi Das related to misappropriation of funds from the Budhia Singh Welfare Trust for Children.         
	Sukanti had filed an FIR against Biranchi in December, 2007 accusing him of embezzling crores received from individuals and organisations. Sukanti had alleged that the embezzled amount was around Rs 6 crore, including Rs 27 lakh donated by a steel company and Rs 19 lakh by a Dubai-based firm.         
	Sukanti today pressed for an inquiry into the fund scam and sought criminal action against those who had misappropriated funds. My son has not received a penny from the trust meant and named after him, she rued.         
	In 2006, Biranchi had gone to Dubai to meet the Koohiji Group chairman who donated Rs 19 lakh for Budhias education, health and future well being, she added. I dont even know who runs the trust now and how much money has been siphoned off, she added.         
	The wunderkids mother was allegedly crestfallen when she learnt that the investigating officer who was looking into the case had been transferred. My complaint was then against Biranchi Das. Now, I want to know who else are involved in the funds scam, she said.         
	Sukanti would soon be meeting the chief minister with her complaint. Maybe next week, she said.        
	The demand assumes significance as the Orissa police is still probing into the possibility of fund scam being a reason for Biranchi Dass murder. Even Chagala, a close aide of Raja Acharya, in his statement to the police had alleged that a fight over the ownership over Rs 9 crore in the trust fund had led to the coachs death.        
	Officers at Bargarh police station said it was going to be difficult to establish the claims for the lack of proof.

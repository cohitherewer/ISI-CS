          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 28: The Kerala unit of the Janata Dal (Secular) has merged with the Samajwadi Party in a leg-up for Mulayam Singh Yadavs national aspirations but analysts predicted an uneasy entry for the heartland outfit in the Left-led southern coalition.        
	Sources said the state CPM as well as its allies  like the CPI and the RSP  have reservations on the Samajwadi Party joining the ruling Left Democratic Front.        
	Sources in the state CPM said though the Samajwadi Party and the M.P. Veerendra Kumar-led JD(S)  an LDF constituent  have merged, demands for more seats would come up in the next elections.        
	The allies are worried because it would change the balance of power in the LDF.        
	The JD(S) has five MLAs and a minister in the state cabinet. The SP is looking for a toehold in the state and would ask for more seats in the elections, which, in a way, would affect the largest ally in the front, the CPM, said a leader.        
	Going by the normal practice, we cannot expect smaller allies making any concession for the SP when it comes to seats, the leader added.        
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, however, said his party would now have a far more formidable presence in the south, especially in Kerala, where we had no existence earlier.

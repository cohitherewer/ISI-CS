The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jag caged, Jack to flutter free 
                                                                                                               Jag caged, Jack to flutter free 
          AMIT ROY                           The Union Jack flutters next to a Jaguar flag at a UK plant                                  
	London, March 26: The Indian jhanda will not flutter gloriously over Jaguar and Land Rover plants in Britain even though two of the best loved names in British cars are now slipping into the care and protection of Tata Motors, it was made crystal clear to The Telegraph today.         
	The main reason why Ratan Tata, Ravi Kant, the managing director of Tata Motors, and other Tata executives were able to win over the trust and confidence of the unions was because of their repeated assurances that Jaguar and Land Rover would continue to be manufactured in the UK and the new Indian owners would respect the quintessentially British character of the two brands.         
	The stereotype is that the Land Rover is used by country folk, especially landed gentry who pull on green wellies (as Helen Mirren did in her Oscar winning role in The Queen) as they go off on tours or pheasant shoots on their rolling acres, while the Jaguar is much more stylish.        
	We call them iconic British brands, a spokesman for Unite, the main union at Jaguar and Land Rover, educated The Telegraph.        
	Although the British are comfortable with Americans taking over their companies, they do wonder whether an Indian company, which has attracted a lot of publicity over the creation of the Nano, will be able to handle two prestige cars at the opposite end of the spectrum.         
	Today, it was acknowledged the challenge will be to sell Brand Ratan Tata as an understated luxury item from India. He may have to play up ownership of the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai as also belonging to his portfolio alongside the Nano (which one union spokesman described as the worlds first disposable car).         
	The desire not to ruffle British feathers means there will be no jingoism and definitely no Indian flags over British plants, where today workers expressed concern about whether they would be able to keep their jobs in the long run. But those interviewed also said they were happy they still had jobs.         
	Four workers leaving the Land Rover site in Solihull, West Midlands, at lunchtime smiled and put their thumbs up as they drove out of the gates.         
	One said: Its great news. Were really pleased.         
	Another employee, who had been with the company for 20 years, called the move a good thing. We have all kept our jobs, which is what everybody wanted.         
	But fellow worker Derrick Robinson commented: I just hope we dont get stitched up again.         
	The business model, it was pointed out by Financial Dynamics, which does the PR for Tata in the UK, would be partly Tetley Tea. Tatas purchase of the company eight years ago has not endangered the British cuppa.

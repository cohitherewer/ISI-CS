	New Delhi, May 15: The Centre today announced a two-year extension of the ban on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.        
	A home ministry notification said pro-LTTE forces were exploiting the turbulence in Sri Lanka to cause disquiet in Tamil Nadu.         
	The LTTE was included in the Centres list of terrorist organisations under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. It is one of 34 outfits declared unlawful under the act.

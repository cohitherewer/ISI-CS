          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 31: Two months after a nun was allegedly raped during a mob attack in Orissa, five policemen have been suspended.        
	The five have been placed under suspension for professional misconduct and negligence of duty, home secretary T.K. Mishra said.        
	The nun, who addressed the media in Delhi last week, said policemen ignored her pleas for help as she was being paraded half-naked through a Kandhamal street after the rape. She added that they had pressured her not to file an FIR on the August 25 assault.        
	Under pressure after the meet, chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday sought a joint report in 24 hours from Kandhamal collector Krishna Kumar and superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar.        
	Assistant sub-inspector Rasananda Mallick, special armed police havildar major K.N. Mohapatra, and havildars S.K. Hamim, J.S. Khan and B.K. Mohanty were suspended today.

          SHEENA K                              
	Raipur, Feb. 15: Jammu amp; Kashmir and Assam model will be followed in Chhattisgarh to fight Maoists.         
	The state will have a unified command like the one existing in Jammu amp; Kashmir as well as in Assam to fight the red army active in the interior parts of Chhattisgarh, Union home minister Shivraj Patil said yesterday night after a high-level meeting here.         
	The decision to set up the unified command was taken to ensure better co-ordination between the state and central forces fighting the rebels in the interior areas. Like Jammu amp; Kashmir and Assam, Chhattisgarh chief minister will be the chairman of the unified command.         
	Earlier, Patil held a marathon meeting with Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan, chief minister Raman Singh and senior officials of the central and state governments. The meeting continued till late in the evening.        
	Matching the states demand for more force and resources to deal with the rebel menace, the Union government has decided to deploy five battalions of central forces in Chhattisgarh. The state at present has 13 battalions of paramilitary forces deployed mainly in Bastar  the worst-hit pocket of the state.         
	The Centre has also given consent to the state to raise four India Reserve Battalions (IRBs) with special emphasis on guerrilla warfare tactics and training.         
	The state will also get seven armoured vehicles besides 13 already rolling in the dense forests of Bastar.         
	The biggest breather for the state reeling severely from Maoists terror was the acknowledgement from the Union government for its campaign against the rebels.         
	I think the state government is doing excellent job in fighting the Maoists and I congratulate the chief minister for the same, Patil said, adding that the Centre would provide all possible assistance to the state in its fight against red terror.

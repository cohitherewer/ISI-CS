          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 16: The BJP and the Left, which have been crying the loudest for the common man burdened by price rise, cut a sorry figure in the Lok Sabha when the issue was discussed today.         
	While the empty BJP benches during the important debate stood out, the Left suffered a loss a face when it was revealed that procurement of foodgrain was among the lowest in Bengal.         
	The communists used harsh words in the House, as they have done outside, with the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta asking agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to prove he existed.        
	There are market forces, there are corporate houses, there are SEZs, there are black marketers but there is no government, Dasgupta said.        
	When it was his turn, Pawar pinched Dasgupta and his colleagues to show them he existed.         
	Bengals track record is one of the worst in procurement. Out of 147 lakh tonnes of rice output in the state, only three lakh tonnes have been procured there, the minister said.        
	Foodgrain procured by states at a minimum support price contributes to a national pool, which serves as a buffer stock and is also used to dole out grain to the poor.        
	The Left parties were up in arms after Pawars statement, but Speaker Somnath Chatterjee came to the ministers rescue.         
	You are on a very weak wicket. Dont shout you are not doing justice to the people of Bengal, Chatterjee told the MPs from Left-ruled Bengal.         
	Pawar, accused by the Left of letting loose unscrupulous traders who exploit the poor, appeared determined to call their bluff. He dwelt on Bengal for quite some time.         
	 Kindly improve your procurement. States like Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have over 90 per cent success rate. But Bengal, along with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, is very bad. Procure more rice and I promise to keep the entire stock in the state. We will distribute that rice to the poor at the BPL rate, the Centre will bear the financial burden, but first do the procurement, he said.        
	Caught on the wrong foot, the Bengal communists shifted gear to ask why the rice quota for Kerala had been reduced. You increase your procurement level and I will increase the quota for Kerala, Pawar shot back.

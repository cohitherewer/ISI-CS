          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, March 25: The BJP wants to release the old Ayodhya genie from a new bottle. The party will campaign to get Faizabad district renamed Ayodhya, hoping to turn its fortunes around in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The district should be named Ayodhya since its holy soil produced an icon like Ram, Ayodhya MLA Lallu Singh said today.        
	Party sources said the BJP youth wing met today and decided to hold demonstrations across the district to pressure the Mayavati government.        
	Ayodhya and Faizabad are twin cities in Faizabad district. Electorally, Ayodhya is one of Faizabad Lok Sabha constituencys seven Assembly segments.        
	A nascent demand for renaming the district had existed for some time, but the BJP decided on a campaign after receiving a fillip yesterday from popular yoga exponent Baba Ramdev.        
	Speaking in Lucknow to a large crowd of devotees, the yoga guru had exhorted the states Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government to change the districts name.        
	If Mayavati does it, she will win the hearts of millions of Indians since Ayodhya is known across the world as Rams birthplace. On the other hand, the name Faizabad does not have much appeal any more, Ramdev, revered by politicians across parties, said.        
	Faizabad city was built in 1730 on the Ghaghra Saryus banks by nawab of Bengal Ali Vardi Khan. It became Avadhs capital under its second nawab, Saadat Khan, before the honour passed to Lucknow.        
	If the name Faizabad goes, part of Avadhs history will go with it. This is a silly proposition, a history professor of Lucknow University said.        
	The BJP, however, has already tasted blood. The Delimitation Commission, whose redrawn map of state constituencies came into force in late 2005, had recommended that the Ayodhya Assembly seat be renamed Faizabad because large parts of Faizabad city now fell under it.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party government accepted the suggestion but backtracked in the face of demonstrations and retained the original name.        
	We saw the renaming as a conspiracy to water down Ayodhyas importance in the countrys electoral history. We have now won that battle, Lallu Singh said.        
	The BJP has in the past, too, demanded changes to place names  such as Lakshmanpuri for Lucknow  based on its claims about Indian history. But the latest campaign may have to do with more mundane considerations.        
	Delimitation has changed the caste demography in Faizabad Lok Sabha seat as well its Assembly segments, replacing a large chunk of upper caste voters with backwards. The BJP, which won three of the seven Assembly seats in 2002, retained only Ayodhya last year.        
	The Lok Sabha seat is held by the BSPs Mitrasen Yadav, who drubbed Lallu Singh in 2004.

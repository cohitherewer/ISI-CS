	Bhubaneswar, May 20: Suspended lady marshal of Orissa Assembly Gayatri Panda, who had levelled sexual harassment charges on former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty, failed to appear before the State Human Rights Commission for the third time today.         
	Though the lady in question could not be contacted, Nihar Panda, her father, said Gayatri could not make it for security reasons.         
	There is a threat to her life. Until we are provided enough security, she cant venture out, he added.        
	Gayatri was supposed to reach the commission today for interrogation. Earlier, too, she had ignored the commissions summons twice.         
	The commission had issued notices thrice before asking Gayatri to formally record her statements before a panel and its last deposition was scheduled for May 2. However, Gayatri did not turn up.         
	Meanwhile, the former Speaker is yet to be questioned by the commission. But police and State Womens Commission have quizzed him. Following the cry over the slur, Mohanty resigned while sports minister Debasish Nayak was dropped from the ministry. Mohanty had dismissed charges against him as a fallout of a conspiracy. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had referred the matter to the state commission after the Opposition did not agree for a probe by a House committee.

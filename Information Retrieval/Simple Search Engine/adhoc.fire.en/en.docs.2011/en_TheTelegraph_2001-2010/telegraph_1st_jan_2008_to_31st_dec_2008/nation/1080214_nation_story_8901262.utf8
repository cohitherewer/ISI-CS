          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                          Priyanka                                   
	Shimla, Feb. 13: Priyanka Vadras Shimla plot is under the scanner but the new BJP government has asserted she wasnt being targeted and her allotment was one of 200 such clearances being examined.        
	Were not targeting a particular person. All decisions made by the previous (Congress) government during its last six months are being reviewed. Were also examining land purchase permissions, revenue minister Gulab Singh Thakur said, without naming Priyanka.        
	The two-month-old regime is of the view that the land purchase clearances were not transparent and granted only to please people said to be close to the government.        
	Priyanka, Congress chief Sonia Gandhis daughter, bought about an acre in Charabra, 16km from here, for Rs 46.79 lakh in a deal sealed on August 24 last year, telling the government it was for a house and an orchard.        
	Under the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972, which bars land transfers to people other than farmers, special permission is given to non-residents to buy up to 500 square metres for a house. The limit is 4 acres for the purposes of agriculture and horticulture.        
	Prem Kumar, the states financial commissioner (revenues), said: As a policy decision, we are reviewing land purchase permissions given during the last six months (of the previous government). The process is under way. The department is looking into violations, if any.        
	Special permissions, of the kind granted to Priyanka, arent easy to get, though the government has given such clearances to a number of influential people. Dubious land deals - in Shimla, Dharamshala, Manali and Chamba - have come to light in the past few years. Sources in the revenue department spoke of 4,000 clandestine deals where regulations had been violated.        
	Priyanka bought the property - it has a cottage, a small pond and is ringed by pine forests - from a well-known business family here. The land is close to the Kalyani helipad, used exclusively by the President.         
	Out of the Rs 46.97 lakh paid, Rs 25,000 was for registration and Rs 2.34 lakh for stamp duty, said Kehar Singh Khachi, Congress leader and caretaker of the property.        
	Weve completed all formalities and the clearances have been given under the tenancy and land reforms acts. The Presidents secretariat (approached because of the helipad) has also allowed a two-storey house, Khachi said.

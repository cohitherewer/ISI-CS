	New Delhi, Aug. 19: India today asked Russia to stick to delivery schedules of contracted military equipment at a review of defence pacts that highlighted more glitches than achievements.         
	Delhis pending military projects with Moscow is estimated to be worth more than $14 billion.         
	Four important defence agreements were discussed at a two-day meeting of the Indo-Russian Working Group on Shipbuilding, Aviation and Land Systems.         
	The two sides were led by Ajoy Acharya, additional secretary, department of defence production, and Karavaev Igor Evgeniyevich, the director of Russias Department of Defence Industry Complex.         
	Strangely, an official brief on the meeting given in the afternoon was cancelled in the evening and replaced by a note from the defence ministry.        
	The note said: The talks were held in a highly professional manner in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. The sides exchanged views on implementation of current projects like T-90 tanks, missile systems, various shipbuilding activities and aviation sector projects like the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and multi-role transport aircraft. They also agreed to take steps for ensuring their successful implementation.        
	After the meeting, defence ministry sources told reporters Russia said it would abide by schedules it had agreed to on the T-90 tanks that are now taking over in the frontline of the Indian Armys armoured corps.         
	Both sides agreed to ensure efficient and well-timed execution of important projects, defence ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said.         
	But the statement could barely conceal areas of discord in the Russia-India military co-operation programme.         
	Russia is by far Indias largest supplier of military equipment  accounting for nearly 65 per cent of the imported hardware  and the two countries are now engaged in complex talks to resolve a dispute on the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov. Russia has demanded about $2 billion more than the contracted price for the vessel.         
	But this afternoons meeting dwelt on other military contracts, each of them important for Indias armed forces that have embarked on a rapid modernisation programme.         
	The Indian side asked for a commitment from Russia on product support for indigenous production of T-90 tanks.         
	The T-90 is the armys main battle tank now and 310 tanks were first contracted in 2001 after the home-grown Arjun did not meet the standards.         
	India intends to buy a total of 1,000 T-90s, for an unstated price  though industry sources put the figure between Rs 12 crore and Rs 14 crore each.         
	The defence ministry sources said several issues  like the tanks anti-aircraft gun mount, ventilation system, torsion bar and gun barrels  were sought to be resolved at the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Haneef keen on Australia
                                                                                                            Haneef keen on Australia
          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          Haneef at his in-laws house in Bangalore on Saturday. (Bangalore News Photos)                                  
	Bangalore, Jan. 5: Australias Gold Coast is where Mohammed Haneefs heart still is.        
	Just back after Haj, the doctor who spent 27 days in custody for alleged links with a UK terror plot today said he would like to go back to his old job if Canberra assured him the past would not come back to haunt him.        
	Looking thinner but more relaxed than he did when he landed here last July, Haneef said he was considering job offers from various places, including West Asia, but the Gold Coast hospital remained his first preference.        
	I have not heard from them but they have indicated that they would like to have me back, he told The Telegraph, happy his work visa was reinstated by a Brisbane court last month.        
	I expect compensation from the (Australian) government but we have still not discussed how to go about it. But more than that, I am greatly relieved that the issue has been cleared.        
	Haneef was accused of having a hand in the failed UK terror plot as he had allowed his distant cousin Kafeel Ahmed, allegedly involved in the attack, to use his mobile SIM card.        
	Without naming any country, the doctor said he had an open job offer that he could take up any time. But he was also thinking of doing his postgraduation in Bangalore, he said.        
	I am interested in applying for a PG seat. My areas of interest are general medicine and radiology. In fact, instead of a job offer, I wish the (former) Karnataka chief minister had offered me a PG seat, which I would have taken up gladly, he said.        
	H.D. Kumaraswamy had offered Haneef a government job of surgeon rank, though he has only cleared his MBBS.        
	Asked if the experience in Australia had left him bitter, Haneef said: I have no comments as there are legal issues pending.        
	He said his main worry for the moment was the health of his wife Firdous and baby Hania who were both unwell.        
	I am yet to sit with my family and discuss future options. They are not quite happy to send me back to Australia but I see a better future for myself there. Thats one reason why I moved to Australia from the UK, he said.

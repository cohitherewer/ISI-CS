	Cuttack, Feb. 14: Ramdev, the yoga guru, today claimed that performing Kapalbhati, a breathing exercise in his package of seven exercises, for 30 minutes a day, uninterruptedly for nine months, leads to rebirth of the human body.        
	The biochemistry of the body starts changing within nine days of putting into practice pranayam and the genetic element changes for the better after nine months of sincere practice, he said.        
	In the process the body is freed of all diseases, even incurable diseases like cancer, ovarian cyst, thyroid, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, fibrosis of lungs, psoriasis and leucoderma, said the 39-year-old yoga exponent who was conducting a morning session here on the second day of his six-day yoga science camp.        
	More than 5,000 people are attending the camp.        
	The progression is similar to the way a child gets a shape in the womb in three months and the complete body in nine months. Pranayam gives a completely transformed body complex. It gives a person a new life, Ramdev explained.        
	The yoga guru had recently been engaged in a war of words with the Indian Medical Association (IMA).         
	In January, the IMA had invited the yoga guru to prove he can heal cancer patients after he accused doctors of spreading and cashing in on disease.        
	I do not do any magic or miracle. Neither do I give any false hopes to people. Everyone can experience a transformed existence by putting pranayam into practice for self-testimony, said Ramdev, explaining that the exercises ensure that adequate oxygen reaches the blood and organs in the human body.         
	In the process, new or extra stem cells are produced and degenerated cells are regenerated, he said.

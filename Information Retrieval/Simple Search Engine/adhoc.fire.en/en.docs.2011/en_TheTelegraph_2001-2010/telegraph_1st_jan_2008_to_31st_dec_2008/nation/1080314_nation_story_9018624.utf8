          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, March 13: A 15-year-old died when a former Sikkim minister, suspected to be under the influence of alcohol, lost control of the car he was driving and ploughed into pedestrians on a busy road this evening.        
	One person was hospitalised with serious injuries while two others escaped with minor bruises.        
	Witnesses said Sonam Choda Lepcha, who once won on a Congress ticket from Dzongu in north Sikkim, was drunk and lost control while trying to negotiate a steep gradient next to a community hall at Jeewan Theeng Marg.        
	They said the former legislator, who was driving a new Tata Indica, also hit an electricity pole and narrowly missed hitting several other pedestrians.        
	The former minister was also injured and has been admitted to a nursing home in Siliguri. A case of rash driving has been registered against him.         
	Police said he would be arrested once he is discharged from the nursing home.        
	Sources in the police said tests had been carried out to determine if Sonam Choda had consumed alcohol above the permissible limit for driving but the results were yet to come in.        
	Yankee Lepcha was rushed to Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital in Gangtok, but the 15-year-old girl succumbed to her injuries.        
	A seriously injured Sangay Doma Shenga, 25, has been referred to a nursing home in Siliguri.        
	Michael Limbu, a home guard, and Chanda Subba escaped with minor bruises.

  Home parallel in G8 case          MANINI CHATTERJEE                           Manmohan in Japan. (AP)                                        
	On board the Prime Ministers Special Aircraft, July 7: It was a throwaway line on the ways of the world that managed to reveal that Indias famously apolitical Prime Minister had a canny grasp of realpolitik after all.        
	The world system, he told reporters accompanying him to the G8 summit in Japan, is not a morality play; it is a power game. Those who have power do not want to share it with others. So it is a struggle.        
	He was talking of Indias case to join the powerful G8 Club as a full member but he could well have been referring to the events that had taken place back home. Nearly 11 months after his interview to The Telegraph daring the Left on the nuclear deal (If they withdraw support, so be it), the Prime Minister and his men were visibly buoyant at having stayed the course and won the day eventually.        
	And though he did not spell it out, that victory had come by waging a hard-fought power game  a personal struggle against his own party chief and a political battle against the Left.        
	And if he had broken bread with Samajwadi Party leaders, including the likes of Amar Singh, to achieve that objective, well  Indian politics, much more than the world system, was not exactly a theatre for morality.        
	But it is not domestic politics that particularly enthuses Manmohan Singh who was ready to go down on what many still regard as an issue of arcane foreign policy. It is India and her place in the world that obsesses him.        
	And buoyed by his success in staring down Messrs Karat and company on the nuclear face-off back home, Manmohan made it clear that he was all set to take on the world community in pushing Indias case for a place at the global high table.        
	Be it climate change, energy security, spiralling food and fuel prices or the world financial system, Manmohan made it clear that India had an opinion and would not be shy to state it.        
	Asserting that India would not give in to pressure to cut carbon emissions at the cost of development, the Prime Minister referred to his offer at the last G8 summit at Heiligendamm that Indias per capita emission of greenhouse gases would never exceed the average of the developed countries and therefore if the developed countries make deeper cuts that will also be an incentive for us to move at a faster pace.        
	On the issue of climate change, he said: Our position has been made amply clear India cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as a major polluter (with) greenhouse gases. Our contribution to emissions is less than 4 per cent. On per capita basis, it is among the lowest. For us, the topmost priority is development, to solve the problem of chronic poverty. India accepts its responsibility (to work for sustainable development) but I do not think we are in a position to take responsibility by way of international target reductions and that is the broad thrust of our approach.        
	On the spiralling oil prices, the Prime Minister accused international financial institutions of not doing enough. Iterating the need to create a forum where producers and consumers can sit together and work out modalities to introduce greater stability in pricing, he said: And I regret to note that the international community has been far less active to deal with the problem of the oil crisis than was the case in the first crisis of 1973 or the second crisis of 1978.         
	On calls for the expansion of the G8, the Prime Minister said: Most countries agree a world forum that does not include countries like China, India and Brazil is not representative or well equipped to handle global problems in an increasingly interdependent world.        
	Expansion may not be on the cards now but sooner or later the world power structures would have to alter their ways of seeing.         
	The Prime Minister also pointed out that the global food crisis had got closely interlinked with the energy crisis since a large part of agricultural crops are now being devoted to the production of bio-fuel.        
	The world must look at this new disequilibrium which threatens to create a situation that countries may solve the energy problem but there will be increasing poverty and hunger, he added.        
	And finally, the economist in him called for a re-look at the balance of power in the international financial systems since the bulk of savings originated in Asia today and the western institutions acted only as intermediaries. I think the world has to find ways and means to recognise this new reality, he insisted.

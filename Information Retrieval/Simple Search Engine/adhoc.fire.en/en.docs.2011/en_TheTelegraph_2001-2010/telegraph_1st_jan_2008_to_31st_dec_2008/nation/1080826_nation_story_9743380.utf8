          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Supreme Court today extended the ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) by six weeks.        
	The outfits former chief, Shahid Badr, had requested the court not to prolong the extension, but his plea wasnt accepted.        
	The court set September 24 for hearing the Centres appeal against a tribunals order that had on August 5 lifted the curb on the outfit. The apex court stayed the order the very next day till it took a decision on the legality of the ban.         
	Today, the Centre said Simis activities had seen a manifest increase from 2006, when the ban was first imposed, to 2008.        
	It cited seizures of weapons and the arrest of several Simi members in connection with terror plots to back its argument. The Centre claimed the group carried on its activities clandestinely despite the ban.

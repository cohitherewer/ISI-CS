          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 25: India has given Nepal a ballot-paper printing machine that the neighbour will use during its Constituent Assembly elections on April 10.        
	The handing over of the printer, worth Rs 64 lakh, was part of Indias ongoing assistance to the peace process in Nepal and for successful Constituent Assembly elections, a foreign ministry official said.         
	Indias ambassador to Nepal, Shiv Shankar Muk- herjee, handed over the machine.        
	An estimated 17.5 million people in Nepal will vote to put in place a 601-member House that will draft the new Constitution and serve as Parliament in the interim period.         
	India had given the electronic voting machines to Nepal last April. The machines will be used in the Kathmandu-1 constituency.         
	Election commission officials from India have already trained their Nepal counterparts on the technical nitty-gritty of running a poll panel.         
	Another team of experts that will provide technical support for electronic voting will be in Kathmandu during the elections.         
	Delhis helping hand to Nepal comes after a similar exercise with Bhutan, another neighbour, which held its first general elections on March 23.         
	Poll panel officials trained the Bhutanese election workers through various programmes that exposed them to the poll process in India.

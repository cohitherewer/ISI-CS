	New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): A Delhi court has directed the defence ministry to pay Rs 17.61 lakh as compensation to the family of an ex-serviceman who was crushed by a speeding military truck in west Delhi six years ago.         
	Nandan Singh was riding his scooter when the truck, jointly owned by a commanding officer of the Sikh regiment and the ministry of defence, knocked him down.        
	Since the offending vehicle was owned by the commanding officer of the Sikh regiment and the ministry of defence, they were jointly liable to pay the compensation, judge Deepa Sharma said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Threat to VC, before first day 
                                                                                                            Threat to VC, before first day 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 4: Kashmir University vice-chancellor Riyaz Punjabi appears to have come under militant threat even before he takes up his new assignment on Monday.        
	Four outfits believed to be shadow organisations of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and other militant groups today accused Punjabi of having a hand in the encounter death of Hizb commander Mohammad Abdullah Bangroo in 1990.        
	The outfits  Al Nasreen, Farzandan-e-Milat, Save Kashmir Movement and Al Istiqilaal  issued a statement alleging Punjabis appointment was a deep conspiracy to undermine the freedom struggle.        
	We can never forget the death of our colleague (Bangroo), spokesperson Yousuf Anwar said.        
	His (Punjabis) appointment is a deep conspiracy to undermine the freedom struggle. The government has ignored a number of deserving senior university professors.        
	Punjabi had quit teaching in Kashmir University and left the Valley following the allegations. He had then joined Jawaharlal Nehru University.        
	The professor, who has yet to arrive here, said from his Delhi home that he was not aware of any militant threat.        
	My job at the university will be purely academics and no politics. I want the university to compete with any premier institute in the country.        
	The militant outfits also accused Punjabi, originally a Srinagar resident, of waging an anti-movement propaganda from Delhi over the last 15 years.         
	He launched a vicious campaign in London and Geneva against the freedom struggle. His job is to undermine the movement, the statement said.        
	Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul Mujtaba tried to play down the threat, saying Kashmir University VCs were generally well protected.        
	We have not been approached so far by anybody for more security. But every KU vice-chancellor is well guarded. There is strong security presence at both his office and residence, Mujtaba said.        
	Punjabis appointment follows the return of student activism on campus after a two-decade ban. Students were barred from floating unions on the ground that they were supporting secessionist activities.        
	The Kashmir University teaching association, research scholars and non-teaching staff have hailed Punjabis appointment and offered him full cooperation.

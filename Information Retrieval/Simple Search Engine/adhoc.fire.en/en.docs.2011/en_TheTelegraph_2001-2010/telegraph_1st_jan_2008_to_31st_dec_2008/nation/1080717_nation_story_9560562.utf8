	Bhubaneswar, July 16: Seventeen Orissa police personnel on an anti-Naxalite mission were today blown up in a landmine blast in Malkangiri district when they were on their way back to base.        
	The special operations group members were clearing trees blocking the Kalimela-Motu road when rebels triggered the explosion near a Bangladeshi refugee village (MV126), killing them on the spot.        
	The blast, which occurred about 600km from Bhubaneswar, came on a day the Centre was reviewing the action taken to counter Naxalite menace in Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Deputy inspector general (operations) Arun Kumar Sarangi said the van ferrying the policemen was flung about 200ft above the ground and blown to smithereens. Although it was an anti-mine vehicle, it was unable to withstand the intensity of the explosion, he said.        
	Two inspectors were among the victims. A dead jawan was identified as Saurav Chandra Mishra.        
	Late last month, the Naxalites had ambushed a ferry carrying elite Greyhound commandos of Andhra Pradesh in the Balimela reservoir in Malkangiri district. About 38 commandos had been killed.        
	Last night, a group of Maoists attacked the home of a BJP leader and torched five of his vehicles in a village (MV96) in the same district.        
	About 15 armed rebels entered Subal Bals residence, ordered his family to leave and went on a looting spree, Malkangiri police superintendent S.K. Gajbhiye said.        
	They then set his vehicles, including a jeep and two two-wheelers, on fire before vanishing into the nearby forests. Bal is a former member of the local panchayat samiti.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who was in New Delhi today, condemned the dastardly act. He announced a compensation of Rs 14 lakh for the families of each victim and a job for one member. If there are no eligible candidates, the slain jawans salary will be paid till his retirement date, an official release said.        
	In New Delhi, Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta reviewed the Naxalite situation in the four states.        
	Senior officers of the home ministry, chief secretaries and state directors general of police reviewed the implementation of integrated action plans to counter the menace. A new inter-state task force is likely to be set up.

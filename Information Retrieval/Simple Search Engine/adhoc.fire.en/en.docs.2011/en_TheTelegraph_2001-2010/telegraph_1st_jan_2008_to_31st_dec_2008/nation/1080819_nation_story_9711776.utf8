	Lucknow, Aug. 18: Mayavati knows how to protect her politicians, never mind that ordinary people remain the most vulnerable to terror attacks.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government today revealed in a statement that it provides police gunners to 463 people, most of them politicians.        
	Of them, 379 politicians get the gunners for free. Thirty per cent of these politicians have had a brush with the law and some are wanted in criminal cases.        
	The statement was a written reply by the chief minister to a question about terror threats to MLAs. Mayavati assured the legislators that whoever among them feels they are under threat would be brought under the security ambit. The charge, at a mere 10 per cent of the actual cost, works out to Rs 2,279 a month.        
	The cost of providing security cover to one person is Rs 22,794 a month.        
	Mayavati said the gunners are provided to state ministers, members of the state information committee and its chairman, the zilla panchayat chairman and the heads of government corporations and councils. The list has been drawn up on the recommendations of a government expert committee, she added.        
	The others who get security have been chosen on the recommendations of district and state-level security committees after assessing their financial status.        
	The chief minister said police gunners could also be provided to recognised politicians besides lawyers and witnesses in sensational cases.         
	Mayavati had recently decided to enhance her own security. The exercise will cost the government Rs 57 crore a year, sources said.         
	Ordinary people, though, have reason to fear for their lives. According to a study by a voluntary organisation, over 70 per cent public places in the cities do not have proper security.         
	B.N. Mishra, a clerk in a Varanasi court, was crippled by the November 2007 serial blasts. He might have been spared the misfortune had the government and its police shown some alertness, social workers allege.        
	Three months of hospital treatment cost Mishra Rs 3 lakh but, he said, the government was yet to reimburse the amount.        
	The callousness of the government towards public security shows its insensitivity, said R. Verma, former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University and a social activist. I dont say there is no need for security for politicians, but what about the man on the street?

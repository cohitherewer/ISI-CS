	Grand-scion joins family business    
	The DMK dynasty is getting fatter by the day. M. Karunanidhis grandson Arivunidhi is the latest in line to join the family business.    
	Arivunidhis relatives have put in a good word for the young man, asking his granddad to open the partys door for him.    
	The DMK patriarch had gone to attend a party to celebrate the 60th birthday of his eldest son, M.K. Muthu, Arivunidhis father.     
	Muthu, who had a brief stint on the Tamil silver screen in the early 70s, had never evinced interests in politics. But according to his relatives, Arivunidhi, a doctor, would rather address rallies than wield the scalpel.    
	He is keen to join politics and devote all his time to it if you give him your consent, his relatives reportedly told Karunanidhi.     
	The grandfather has given his green signal. I will not stand in anybodys way, he said.    
	But grandson or no grandson, the once-bitten Karunanidhi is taking no chances. Still smarting from the blow dealt by grand-nephew Dayanidhi Maran, the DMK chief said: I expect only one thing, after entering politics, they should not be back-stabbing politicians.          
	Queen on India cruise  
	Queen Victoria is dropping anchor in Mumbai. The worlds second-largest luxury cruise ship will touch the citys shores for a fortnight.    
	The 90,000-tonne palace on water, which was inaugurated by the Prince Charless wife Camilla, is on its maiden world tour.    
	The liner is replacing the popular Queen Elizabeth 2 in the stable of the 168-year-old Cunard Line, the British shipping company which also owns the luxury ship Queen Mary 2.    
	Queen Victoria will first travel to Chennai on March 23 and then sail towards Kochi. It will dock in Mumbai on March 28.    
	Managing director of Cunard Line Carol Marlow said the ship offers a unique blend of ocean travel of the old days along with modern facilities like the second-largest floating library, a theatre and live orchestra.    
	In custody, an elephant    
	Police in the temple town of Tiruvarur had a tough BJP processionist to deal with  an elephant.    
	The party wanted the famous Shiva temples chariot to be taken out and pulled on the day of Ayilya Nakshatra in the Tamil month of Panguni (which fell on March 18). But the temple authorities found it unnecessary.    
	Not ready to relent, the BJP made a small chariot resembling the biggest temple in the state.     
	About 30 party workers took out a procession led by the elephant. But as the march was against police orders, all were arrested, including the elephant.     
	The pachyderm was taken to an enclosure near the temple and confined. This sparked tension in the town, but was defused later.     
	However, its not known if the elephant made a trunk call for help.          
	Power palette  
	Woman power recently found expression in paintings, sculpture and photography at an exhibition in the capital.    
	Inaugurated by chief minister Sheila Dikshit, the exhibition called Celebrating Womanhood had on offer the paintings of Laila Rajpal Khan, Priti Girjala, Meghna Oberoi, Ananya Bannerji, Meena Deora and Shobha Broota.    
	We brought together women artists who have achieved recognition and excellence in fine arts, said curator Lovy Singh after she presented a charcoal painting by Bannerji, titled Mother and Child, to Dikshit.    
	It (the exhibition) is very good exposure for both the artists and us to see what is happening around the world, the chief minister said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 14: Orissa High Court today banned the ongoing lawyers strike in Berhampur (southern Orissa) and issued directions to police to ensure resumption of court proceedings.         
	The court also gave a free hand to the district police to initiate criminal proceedings against the lawyers hindering police action.         
	The two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B.N. Mohapatra issued the ruling based on a PIL issued by one Debashis Mohapatra and two others.         
	The high court today termed the strike illegal, as it was adversely affecting peoples fundamental rights.        
	There is already a Supreme Court ruling on such strikes, the court reminded all those present.        
	The lawyers had launched the strike after the high court rejected chief minister Naveen Patnaiks proposed permanent or circuit benches at Sambalpur (western Orissa) and Berhampur in November 2007.

	Patna, May 22: Shaken by reports of custodial death and cases of police atrocities in Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar today urged the state police to ensure the protection of human rights in the state.        
	The chief minister chaired a meeting of senior officers that was attended by the director-general of police, superintendents of police of all the districts and senior officers today.        
	Recently, an elected panchayat ward member, Phekan Pandit (60), died in police custody in Vaishali earning state police a bad name.        
	Adding fuel to fire, six nails were found embedded in the deceaseds back.         
	Nitish Kumar directed the police set up to increase the number of criminal cases under the speedy trial to break the morale of the criminals, who were already on a back foot due to police pressure.        
	The chief minister asked the police set up to stay more vigilant in protecting the construction companies engaged in development work across the state. We have received reports that some companies are still being forced to dole out levy to the criminals. The practice must stop, he warned.        
	Meanwhile, another dreaded gangster and one of the founders of the Jungle Sena in Champaran region, Basudeo Yadav, reportedly surrendered on May 24 due to the police pressure mounting on the criminals.         
	The Jungle Sena, an outfit of dacoits and abductors, has been operating in Champaran, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Nepal for the past three decades.         
	Recently, Bhagar Yadav, the chief commander of the party (Jungle Sena) surrendered before the police.

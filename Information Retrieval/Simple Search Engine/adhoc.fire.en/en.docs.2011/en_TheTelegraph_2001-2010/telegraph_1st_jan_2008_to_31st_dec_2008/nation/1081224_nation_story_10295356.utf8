The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Its official: Nun to identify accused
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Its official: Nun to identify accused
          OUR BUREAU                           After the massacre                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 23: The nun, who was raped in Kandhamal four months ago, is expected to attend the test identification (TI) parade of accused in Cuttack on January 3.        
	Of course she will attend the TI parade according to the courts directive, confirmed Father Joseph Kalathil, the vicar-general at the Bhubaneswar archbishiops house. The Father, however, could not confirm the date and time of the nuns arrival in the state.         
	On the other hand, the inspector-general of police (crime branch), Arun Roy, seemed unsure as to whether the nun would indeed appear for the parade. It is up to her to decide, he added.         
	On December 18, the court of Cuttack sub-divisional judicial magistrate had fixed the date and venue of the TI parade and accordingly issued a notice to the 29-year-old victim to be present.         
	The nun had stayed away from Orissa since the alleged incident on August 25, two days after VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati was murdered. She was interrogated by the crime branch officers at an undisclosed location in New Delhi on November 18. On November 10, the Baliguda SDJM court had issued notices to the nun for the parade on November 10 and later rejected her plea where she had asked for more time.         
	She had also filed a petition in high court for a TI parade outside Kandhamal, preferably in Bhubaneswar or Cuttack. The high court on December 5 had ordered that the TI parade would be held in Cuttack.         
	Condolence meet        
	Kandhamals tribal community has announced a plan to hold a condolence meeting on Christmas Day for the victims of past years communal violence.         
	We have sought the district administrations permission to observe Martyrs Day at Barakhama on December 25, the day Khageswar Mallick, a tribal leader was killed in the violence, said Lambodar Kanhar, secretary of Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti, an organisation of Kandhas. We will hold our programme with or without the district administrations permission, Kanhar said.         
	The bodys plans to observe Martyrs Day in the communally sensitive Barakhama has, therefore, caused apprehension of a repetition of last years communal violence. On December 25, 2007, as many as three persons, including Mallick, died and 34 were injured between December 24 and January 7.

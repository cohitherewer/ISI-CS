  - Study shows little difference between drinking habits of Indian men and women        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, April 29: Women in India binge on alcohol as much as men, and over half the nations drinkers are engaged in hazardous drinking, studies compiled into Indias first alcohol atlas have shown.         
	Although alcohol use is still lower among women, there appears little difference between typical drinking patterns of men and women, the atlas has said.         
	Studies indicate that eight out of 10 Indian men drinkers and six out of 10 women have five drinks in a typical drinking session, a level addiction specialists describe as hazardous drinking.        
	The aim of the game here is drinking to intoxication, said Vivek Benegal, associate professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore. His studies on patterns of alcohol use by women and the health and economic impacts of alcohol consumption in India were key components of the atlas released today.         
	The Nimhans studies and others elsewhere in the country point to a signature pattern for alcohol use  solitary drinking, mainly spirits instead of beer or wine, and more than five drinks per session.         
	Its a dangerous way to use alcohol, Benegal told The Telegraph.        
	The patterns we see here translate into economic, social and health problems, he said.         
	We do see some people following a different pattern  moderate drinking or drinks mainly with food, but theyre in the minority. Moderate drinking is a cultural practice.         
	Studies have also shown a dramatic decline in India in the age when drinking starts  from 28 years in the 1920s to 19 years in the 1980s.         
	Doctors estimate that nearly 20 to 30 per cent of admissions or medical consultations in India are directly or indirectly related to alcohol consumption.         
	Health studies have indicated that seven out of 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis and seven out of 10 cases of liver cirrhosis are a direct result of alcohol abuse.         
	A study by a Nimhans team led by Benegal and extrapolated to the nation shows the excise revenue earned by the Centre and all state governments is Rs 216,00 crore. But the total cost of management of the consequences of alcohol use is more than Rs 24,400 crore.                     
	Just as with tobacco, the health and economic losses far outweigh any economic gains, said Johnson Edayaranmula, a member of the Indian Alcohol Policy Alliance, which produced the atlas.         
	Alcohol use is among Indias gravest public health issues, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said today after releasing the atlas. Were going to earmark funds for a national alcohol control programme.         
	Doctors point out that women are prone to developing problems earlier than men. Women have higher fat content and female sex hormones modify the metabolism of alcohol, Benegal said.         
	Several research studies have shown that moderate drinking has a protective effect against heart disease. But public health experts say the mechanism of action is still unclear.         
	A cause-and-effect relationship for this has never been proved, said Vijay Chandra, regional adviser on mental health and substance abuse, World Health Organisation.

	New Delhi, Feb. 1: L.K. Advani, master of the politics of rath yatra, would now rather be Prime Minister than charioteer.
    
	A campaign vehicle drove out of the BJP headquarters today, but instead of Advani it carried his cutouts. The decorated Sankalp Sandesh Vahan  a converted Canter truck  was flagged off by colleagues Arun Jaitley and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.
    
	Unlike his Ram Rath that split the country over the temple in Ayodhya, the vahan that will tour 10 Uttar Pradesh districts showing films and street plays on the rise of terror will have no explicit communal message.
    
	Instead, the BJP chose to quote mentor Deen Dayal Upadhyay: Till the Hindu is alive, there is no threat to Islam. There is no difference between Ram and Allah. The conflict is not of religion but of aspirations. The vehicle also took care to include quotes from Mohammad Asafullah Khan along with Sardar Patel and Swami Vivekananda. 
    
	Rising prices, agrarian distress and the problems of youths, women and the weaker sections will be highlighted. 
    
	The BJP has not changed its philosophy, but as Advani the hawk tries to step into Atal Bihari Vajpayees moderate shoes, it is looking to soften its image. 
    
	The main slogan is: Vande mataram kamal nishan/ Maang raha hai Hindustan (Hindustan is asking for Vande mataram and lotus, the BJPs symbol). 
    
	But there will be no Sadhvi Rithambara spitting venom at Muslims. The films will have an underlying message of Hindutva but avoid anti-Muslim rhetoric. 
    
	Naqvi said the vehicle will create a favourable atmosphere for Advanis rallies. Instead of going on a rath yatra, the shadow Prime Minister will this time board the vahan only to address rallies.
    
	Around two dozen such vehicles will be readied. They will cover the 297 seats the party has identified for serious contests. All the vehicles will have performers from the party who will do street plays in villages to convince people about the UPAs failures, he said, adding the campaign would continue till the polls.

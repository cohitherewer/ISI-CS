          SUJAN DUTTA                           Hawk                                  
	Bidar, Feb. 24: The induction of the Hawks into the Indian Air Force marks a generation change in the training of its fighter pilots.        
	In the years since the IAF first asked for advanced jet trainers (AJTs), it has lost nearly 150 pilots in accidents, many of them because of human or technical errors on the demanding MiG 21.         
	The MiG 21 is a very unforgiving aircraft, said the chief instructor in Bidar, Group Captain Mike Fernandez, explaining the leap rookie pilots had to take while moving up from the subsonic Kiran Mark II aircraft to the supersonic MiG 21.        
	Fernandez himself first trained on the Iskra, now decommissioned, and then went on to fly MiG 29 aircraft.         
	He says the Hawks will eventually replace the entire training schedule that is now conducted on the Kiran Mark II and the MiG 21. The Hawk is a less risky regime, it gives warnings, keeps the pilots aware.        
	The training schedule is being realigned. Starting July this year, 35 trainees will be taken in for the first course lasting a year and a half.         
	So far only eight Hawks have landed in India. The induction of 66 will continue till 2010.         
	At the core of the Hawks forgiving nature is the HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) concept. The tandem-seat cockpit  in which one pilot sits behind and above the first  of the Hawk Mark 132 is customised for the Indian Air Force. With HOTAS, the pilot(s) do not need to take their hands off the stick and can access all fighter cockpit functions from it.         
	The stick is a head with switches, toggles and buttons to control the firing mode, keep the aircraft steady and align it for landing, take-off and other manoeuvres.        
	In airforce parlance, combined with the heads-up-display, it improves the pilots situational awareness. Pilots do not have to take their hand off the stick or their eyes off the horizon. Nearly all modern fighter cockpits run on the HOTAS concept.         
	This is a big difference, combined with the hydraulics. On the old Kiran, it is largely mechanical, says Fernandez. Todays youth are more comfortable with such technology, I can see it even in my children who are so computer-friendly.

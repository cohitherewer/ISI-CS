          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: Aggrieved over the neglect and apathy of Indian Railways to Orissa, a House committee of the Assembly, headed by the Speaker, today decided to meet the railway minister to demand allocation of more funds in the coming budget.        
	The panel will go to New Delhi in the second week of November to meet railway minister Lalu Prasad, said a member of the House.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the house committee on railways, chaired by Speaker Kishor Kumar Mohanty today.        
	Earlier this year, the committee members had met railway minister Lalu Prasad on January 30 and submitted a memorandum demanding allocation of Rs 1,330 crore in the 2008-09 railway budget.        
	However, Rs 949.34 crore, a per cent of what was required, was provided in the budget for various projects in the state, rued committee members.        
	The railway minister did not meet most of the states demands, they added.         
	A major chunk of the funds provided in the rail budget was for electrification projects, which was in the interest of railways and conducive for quicker transportation of coal and cargo, observed a member.        
	It was decided that the committee would reiterate the long-standing demands and also put forth new demands for development and expansion of railway network in the state.        
	Official sources here said the railway ministry had been requested for allotment of Rs 175 crore for Haridaspur-Paradip rail line in 2008-09 and ensure expeditious completion of the project.         
	However, only Rs 80 crore was provided in the budget and no deadline for completion was fixed.        
	Similarly, as against the demand for allocation of Rs 120 crore for Lanjigarh-Junagarh rail link, a meager Rs 35 crore was allotted.         
	For another important rail link  Khurda-Bolangir rail line  only Rs 32.34 crore was allocated as against the demand for Rs 150 crore.         
	The response of the railway ministry to the states demands, a committee member stressed, was not only disappointing, but was inadequate.         
	In terms of allocation of funds for ongoing projects, sanction of new railway lines, survey, introduction of new trains, extension of routes and increase in frequency, the budget left a lot to be desired.        
	The house committee had demanded the sanction of nine new railway lines for 2008-09.        
	But not a single rail line was sanctioned. Similarly, out of the demands for sanction of surveys for new railway projects, only one (Barbil-Banspani railline) was agreed to. Lalu Prasad was also requested to provide Rs 50 crore for sanction of four new electrification projects for 2008-09.         
	But, not a single proposal was considered.         
	Out of the 19 proposals for the introduction of new trains, the railway ministry did not consider even a single one, while the demand for extension of four trains was ignored.

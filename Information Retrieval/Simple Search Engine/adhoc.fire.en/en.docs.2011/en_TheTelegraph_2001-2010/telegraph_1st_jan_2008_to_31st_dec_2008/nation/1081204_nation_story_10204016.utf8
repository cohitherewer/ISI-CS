          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani in Delhi. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: The BJP is planning an offensive against the Centre by focusing on what it calls the casual treatment of credible intelligence inputs about the Mumbai attacks.        
	The partys core group will meet tomorrow to prepare a response to the situation arising out of the warlike onslaught on Mumbai, the Manmohan Singh governments inadequate response and Pakistans defiance.        
	The leadership feels passions are running high in the country and tough posturing on Pakistan will go down well with most people. The party set the tone for hard decisions at tomorrows meeting by demanding destruction of terror training camps in Pakistan. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: Pakistan should be made to destroy the terror camps under international supervision through a UN mandate.         
	Prasad said Pakistan had violated UN Security Council resolution 1373 and India should now seek redress at the global forum. The resolution is aimed at placing barriers on the movement, organisation and fund-raising activities of terrorist groups.        
	He said Pakistans rejection of Indias demand for 20 wanted terrorists wasnt unexpected but its belligerence on a day Condoleezza Rice was in New Delhi was a poor reflection of American influence on Islamabad.        
	The BJP will question the government on what the navy chief described as systemic failure and the public sparring between intelligence and security agencies.        
	Prasad described revelations in the media about the alleged lack of action on intelligence inputs as proof of the governments criminal negligence. He said the Centre must provide answers to questions such as who processed the inputs, who was in command and, eventually, who was speaking the truth.         
	Ironically, the BJP intensified its offensive on a day the RSS second-in-command, Mohan Bhagwat, said this was not the ideal time for partisan warfare.         
	The BJP, too, asserted it would support the governments efforts to fight terror but said it couldnt be stopped from pointing out the mistakes and failures of the administration and the political leadership in a democracy.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 23: Constituencies reserved for the Scheduled Castes should be rotated, the delimitation commission has suggested to the government.        
	Some constituencies have been reserved for SCs for four to five decades and there is a strong public demand for rotation, the commission chairman, Justice Kuldip Singh, said at a function today.        
	The Delimitation Act, 2002, doesnt allow rotation, so the law would need to be amended if the suggestion is accepted.        
	A second suggestion from the commission, which handed in its report towards the end of last year, is that delimitation should be carried out every 10 years, one after each population census.         
	This, it believes, will keep matters simple.         
	The commission also recommended that the next population census, due in 2011, should be conducted panchayat-wise so that the following delimitation is held on the basis of panchayat boundaries.

	Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 31: A holidaymaker said to be with roots in Calcutta died when he fell off a houseboat while leaning forward to throw up in the backwaters in Kerala this morning.
    
	Police identified the victim as Pulak Roy Chowdhury, 44, saying he hailed from Calcutta and had moved to Kerala two years ago to work there.
    
	Bengal police said this evening they had not been informed of the incident, probably because the victim had been living in Kerala for sometime and was not a tourist.
    
	The police said Roy Chowdhury, reportedly on self-medication for indigestion, felt uneasy, leaned out to vomit when he lost balance and fell headlong into a canal at Kanjippadam off Cherthala, some 40km from Kochi. 
    
	Hearing the screams of Roy Chowdurys wife Anamika and two children, two crew members jumped into the water and searched for him. They were joined by residents who arrived in country boats and canoes. But the search was in vain.
    
	Roy Chowdhurys body was later traced with the help of the police.
    
	The water at the spot is about 18 feet deep. Sources said even experienced swimmers would not go down beyond a point for fear of getting stuck in mud. 
    
	Roy Chowdhury, who had expertise in wool yarn weaving, had moved to Kochi along with Anamika and the two children, Sayali, 13, and Simran, 8.
    
	Binu Raj, a general manager at another spinning unit, said he had rung up Roy Chowdhury to wish him on the New Year. 
    
	But when Raj got a return call half-an-hour later, he could hear only wails of the grieving family. First I thought Roy Chowdhury must have become too sick and there was a medical emergency. I could not figure out what had happened. Then a friend, Arnab Chowdhury, who was in the same boat, told me what happened, Raj said. 
    
	Raj said he had advised his friend to see a doctor before the trip and take proper medication as the family planned to spend the New Year on board and return the next morning. 
    
	The local police station in-charge, Shaji, said such mishaps were rare in the Alappuzha backwaters. Since the boats ply only in the backwaters, free from waves unlike at sea, they are considered safe.
    
	However, in wide-bodied houseboats, getting too close to the rim or moving about carelessly on the deck are dangerous, Shaji said.

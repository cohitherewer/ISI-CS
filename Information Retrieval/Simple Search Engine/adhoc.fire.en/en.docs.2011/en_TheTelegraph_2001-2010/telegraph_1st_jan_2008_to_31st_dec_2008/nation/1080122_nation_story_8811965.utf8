	Bangalore, Jan. 21: Police have confirmed one murder among the 20 that serial killer Chandrakanth Sharma claimed to have committed in Maharashtra between 1978 and 1981.
    
	Manmad police today said they had registered a case of unnatural death in the Maharashtra town in 1980, which seemed to tally with Sharmas claim.
    
	The 48-year-olds confession had come after he and his family  wife Harsha and son Monto, 21  were arrested on Friday for allegedly strangulating their landlord, Raghavan, and setting his body on fire in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. 
    
	Bangalore deputy commissioner of police (south) Alok Kumar told The Telegraph that officers in Manmad had told a Bangalore police team, which had taken Sharma to the Maharashtra town, that they had registered a case of unnatural death when a person identified as Manmohan Singh was found dead.
    
	Sharma had listed Singh as one of his victims and claimed he had stabbed him following differences over sharing brokerage of a real estate deal that both were involved in. 
    
	Kumar said it was not clear why Manmad police had registered a case of unnatural death when the victim had clearly been knifed. Police sources, however, said it was normal for officers to first register a case of unnatural death and convert it into a murder case after investigations. 
    
	Our police team is checking the records. We are taking Sharma to Mumbai tomorrow to check three murder cases there. It will take some time before things fall into place.
    
	Kumar said the police had drawn a blank in Pune where Sharma claimed to have murdered six to seven persons, including five during communal riots.
    
	Sharma had told the police that a person named Amar, who owned Hotel Amrapaali in Pune, was his fourth victim. But the police have no records to match his claim. 
    
	The hotel owners, too, had said there was no one called Amar in their family and that no murder had taken place on the premises since 1976 when the eatery opened.
    
	But we are not taking any chances. We will try and verify all the cases. After Mumbai, we will take Sharma to Nashik and speak to his family members. Maybe they can throw some light, Kumar said.

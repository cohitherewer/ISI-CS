          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: The Orissa Assembly today witnessed an uproar with the members belonging to both the Opposition and the treasury expressing their anger over the alleged disrespect shown to the elected public representatives.        
	Drawing the attention of the House during the zero hour, the BJD-BJP deputy chief whip, Mohan Majhi, said a room had been booked in Orissa Bhavan, a rest house of the state government in New Delhi, in his name from January 26 to 31. But to his utter surprise and shock, he was told by the Orissa Bhavan officials that the particular room was reserved in the name of an IAS officer couple  Ardhendu Sekhar Sarangi and Madhur Sarangi.         
	I left the place in protest and stayed in a hotel when I found that a smaller room was booked in my name, said an agitated Majhi.        
	The government deputy chief whip, who enjoys the status of a minister of state, wanted to know if IAS officers were superior to a public representative as per the protocol.        
	He urged the Speaker to take appropriate action against the officials who had shown favours to the IAS officer couple and harassed him.        
	Majhi was supported by several ruling party and Opposition members, who described the incident as unfortunate and serious.        
	Sharing the concern of the House, Speaker, Maheswar Mohanty directed the government to enquire id there had been any violation of the Warrant of Precedence and take action against the erring officials.

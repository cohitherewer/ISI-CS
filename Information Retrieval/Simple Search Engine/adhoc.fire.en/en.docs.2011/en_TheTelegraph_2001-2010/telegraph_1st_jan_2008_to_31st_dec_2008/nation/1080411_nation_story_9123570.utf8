          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, April 10: JHV Distilleries and Sugar Mills Limited is in trouble, so could be its patron  BJPs national spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudi.        
	The state government today issued showcause notice to JHV asking them to explain why they failed to open a factory in Marhaura, Chapra, as was promised.         
	The showcause follows chief minister Nitish Kumars order to the cane commissioner to probe the failure to open the factory.         
	The failure had in 2006 forced farmers to burn sugarcane cultivated on hundreds of acres, bringing disrepute to the then NDA dispensation.        
	We have asked the JHV management to explain why it got farmers to grow sugarcane in over 65,000 acres in 2006 after promising to buy the product to feed their proposed mill in 2007-08, said the cane commissioner, Bhrigunath Upadhyaya.         
	The government has also asked the management to explain why it did not provide compensation for the financial damage the farmers had to suffer due the factory not being opened, he said.         
	The cane commissioner said the government has fixed April 20 as the last date for the management to reply.         
	The affected farmers are sceptical about the outcome of the probe. They had formed a forum to carry out their agitation against what they describe as cheating.         
	We will wait for the probe to conclude. But we are not sure if the cane commissioner will be able to investigate the issue in a genuine way when a high-profile NDA leader (Rudi) has a role in the matter, said the president of the farmers forum, N.K. Singh.        
	In December 2006, Rudi and chairman, Jawahar Jailswal were present at a function in Marhaura to announce the take over of a sugar factory in Marhaura.         
	The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction had in 2006 settled the assets and liability of the sugar factory in India to JHV. Rudi brought its chairman to the congregation of thousands of farmers in Marhaura. The farmers were asked to grow sugarcane in their fields to feed the mill.

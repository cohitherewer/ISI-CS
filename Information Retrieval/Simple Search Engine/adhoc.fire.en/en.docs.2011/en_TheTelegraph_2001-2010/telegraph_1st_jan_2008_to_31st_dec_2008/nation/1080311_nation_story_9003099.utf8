                                                                                                               Stamp strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 10: Execution of sale deeds and financial transactions remained crippled for the eighth day today as the stamp vendors strike continued.         
	Nearly 6,000 Orissa vendors are on strike in response to a call given by the Orissa Stamp Vendors Federation. Vendors in the state account for a combined purchase of Rs 1 crore a day, of which Cuttack and Bhubaneswar have a share of over Rs 40 lakh.         
	The federation has demanded an increase in the limit to sell non-judicial stamps. The impasse over the issue is continuing, as the government has not yet responded to the demand of the vendors. The federation representatives met revenue minister Manmohan Samal and finance minister Prafulla Ghadei on Saturday. The revenue minister had no time to listen to our demands on that day, but assured to look into the matter on March 14 after returning from New Delhi. The finance minister, on the other hand, said our pleas had not reached him, the federation secretary Ramkrushna Parida told The Telegraph today.         
	Orissas revenue department is expected to react to the issue only after the state finance department gives its nod. Vendors are peeved, as the government has not directed treasury offices to act even after assuring to raise the limit of selling non-judicial stamps to Rs 2 lakh over a year ago. At present, vendors are allowed to buy stamp papers up to Rs 50,000. The federations executive body, which met here on Sunday, decided to continue with the strike.

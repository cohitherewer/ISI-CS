The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cracked: Code of clubbed fingers

	New Delhi, June 28: Ever seen someone with swollen red fingers and fingernails and superstitiously waved the person off as unlucky? Or wondered why he or she should have clubbed fingers at all?        
	Thanks to researchers at the University of Leeds, some clues to the puzzling deformity are at hand. Hippocrates identified the condition over 2,000 years ago but so far there have been no answers on why fingers swell up or why they do in conjunction with other ailments, especially lung cancer.        
	Or even of heart disease, hyperthyroidism and gastro-intestinal diseases.        
	The team from Yorkshire Regional Genetics Service, including Professor Bonthron and Dr Chris Bennett, stumbled upon the first clues while scanning medical literature.        
	We found that in cystic fibrosis patients who have undergone a lung transplant, their finger clubbing goes away. The same happens in empyaema patients who have had their lungs drained. It suggested that impaired lung function was somehow crucial to finger clubbing  but we didnt understand how, said Bonthron.        
	So Bonthron, Bennett and their colleagues set out to study patients suffering from inherited primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO), a genetic disorder in which finger clubbing is accompanied by painful joint enlargement and thickening of the bone.        
	Their findings zeroed in on a fatty compound called PGE2, produced by the body to mediate the effects of internal inflammation. But crucially, once its work was done, PGE2 was broken down by an enzyme, 15-HPGD, produced in the lungs.        
	The patients were, however, found to have genetic mutation that prevented the production of 15-HPGD, resulting in accumulation of as much as 10 times of PGE2 in their systems. If you dont have this enzyme, the PGE2 isnt broken down normally and simply builds up, said Bonthron, whose findings have been published in Nature Genetics.        
	In lung cancer patients, it is most likely the overproduction of PGE2 by the tumour that causes the clubbing. In congenital heart disease, blood bypasses the lungs, where PGE2 is normally broken down by 15-HPGD.        
	The researchers have suggested that a urine test for levels of PGE2 may be useful to diagnose unexplained finger clubbing and understand whether it is the symptom of something more serious.        
	The results also suggest that drugs such as aspirin, used to prevent PGE2 production, may be effective in reducing the painful symptoms of finger clubbing.        
	It has taken 2,000 years to make the connection. Actually, when you look back, its rather obvious. When we found this gene, everything else fell into place, Bonthron said.

	Srinagar, Aug. 2: Blockaded from the rest of India by Amarnath land protesters, Kashmirs fruit growers have threatened to sell their produce across the Line of Control.        
	They want to take the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road on Monday, unwilling to risk travelling down the blocked Srinagar-Jammu highway, the Valleys link to other parts of the country.        
	The fruit growers want the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad link revived for trade  only the peace bus now travels down the route.        
	A senior government official said there was no question of allowing trucks to travel on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road illegally. He said the situation might worsen since the separatists too have raised the pitch for an alternative road.        
	This time of the year, Kashmir starts sending its horticulture produce to various parts of the country. But several trucks have been attacked by mobs in Jammu and many loaded vehicles are stranded on the highway.        
	We have decided to take the Muzaffarabad road because the government has failed to come to our rescue, said Ghulam Rasool Bhat, president of the Kashmiri Fruit and Vegetable Growers and Dealers Association.        
	Bhat said hundreds of fruit trucks were stranded at various places on the highway to Jammu while many others had returned.        
	We have already suffered losses of Rs 60 crore. We fear all our fruits will rot here. The only option is to sell our produce in markets across the LoC, he said.        
	The Jammu protesters are also said to be targeting vehicles carrying supplies to Kashmir. The fruit growers said they had handed a memorandum to the Sopore subdivisional magistrate seeking an end to the blockade.        
	Kashmir divisional commissioner Masood Samoon hoped the highway would soon be cleared. The security forces have been called for the job, he said.        
	He added that the Valley had enough stocks to weather the blockade. But the fruit dealers face a problem.        
	The protests in Jammu had begun last month after the state government cancelled the allotment of 40 hectares of forest land at Baltal to the Amarnath shrine board.        
	Leela Karan Sharma, convener of the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti which is leading the Amarnath land campaign, said no traffic would be allowed on the Srinagar-Jammu highway until the land was restored to the shrine board.

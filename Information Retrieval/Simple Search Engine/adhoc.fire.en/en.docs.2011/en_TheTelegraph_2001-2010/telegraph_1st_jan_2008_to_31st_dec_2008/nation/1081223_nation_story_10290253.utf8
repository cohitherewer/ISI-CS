                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cash cloud on IPL swap

	Mumbai, Dec. 22: The trading window for crickets richest tournament opened today amid the shadow of the global meltdown and its possible impact on spending by Indian companies.        
	Franchise owners of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will get a month to exchange and buy players of rival teams, with no upper limit being set for the price.         
	IPL sources said the franchisees, all of whom are keeping an eye on their finances, would prefer to wait and watch. Negotiations are going to be hard in these times of cash crunch. Everybody is going to keep their wish list of players, or even those on sale, close to their chest to get the best bargain, said the CEO of a franchisee.        
	Franchisees can either trade in cash or go for a barter exchange. There will not be much movement now. Things will hot up around a week before the trading window closes on January 22. But cash purchases will be few as there is not enough cash available, said an IPL source.        
	Also, the franchisees would want to keep cash in hand for the second round of player auction scheduled for February 6. Each team can spend up to $7 million  up from last seasons $5 million  for players who did not participate in the inaugural edition.         
	Media planners say the cash crunch could hit IPL 2009  the tournament dates are yet to be announced  though the maximum ad spend will still be anchored over it.        
	The volumes of spend on sponsorships and television spots will be lower because of the meltdown. But the IPL will continue to be the major draw for ad-spending, said Shashi Sinha, CEO, Lodestar Universal, a top media buying agency.        
	The BCCI, for example, has raised ground sponsorship rates to $7-8 million, up from $5-5.5 million. Not many would be willing to shell out this kind of money, said an IPL franchisee source. Teams get a part of the ground sponsorship money.         
	IPL sources say among the players in the trading basket are Shoaib Akhtar of the Kolkata Knight Riders and Shahid Afridi and Herschelle Gibbs of the Deccan Chargers.        
	Akhtar, who largely sat out the IPL, playing three matches for five wickets, has been a bit of a headache for the team owned by actor Shah Rukh Khan and friends.        
	The Pakistani speedsters controversial past relating to drug abuse and his inability to be a team person has put him in the too-hot-to-handle category, say IPL sources.        
	Besides, we have a fantastic bowling line-up, even without Shoaib. We need to focus on our batting, especially at the number 5 and 6 positions. We will go for the best T20 talent available in the country, said a top KKR source.         
	The franchisees are also in a fix on whether Pakistani players would be allowed to participate in the light of the Mumbai attacks. But, sources said, they expect the government to come out with a clarification on the issue.

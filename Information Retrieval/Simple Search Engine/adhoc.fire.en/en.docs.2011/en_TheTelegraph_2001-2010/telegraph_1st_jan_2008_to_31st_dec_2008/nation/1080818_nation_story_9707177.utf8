	New Delhi, Aug. 17 (PTI): The telecom department is the final authority that can direct private and PSU operators to penalise any agent or franchisee if their conduct is found to be a threat to security, the Centre has told service providers.         
	The step is aimed at preventing use of mobile phones to trigger blasts.        
	The telecom department has amended all licences, including unified access service, cellular mobile, basic and other types, issued on or before 2001.

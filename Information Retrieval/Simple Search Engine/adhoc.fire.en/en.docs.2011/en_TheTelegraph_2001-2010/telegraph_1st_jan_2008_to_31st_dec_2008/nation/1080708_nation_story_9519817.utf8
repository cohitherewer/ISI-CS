	New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): Niamutullah, the Afghan official killed in the Indian embassy today, was a die-hard fan of anything Indian, from Bollywood to curry.        
	And he hated the Taliban because they had killed his family. In the end his enemies got him, but he will live on in the memories of the Indians he sought out, befriended and protected in a foreign land.        
	The young, soft-spoken Tajik would often take young Indian visitors under his wing, showing them around and using his extensive connections to win them huge bargains at carpet and cap stores.        
	His reach extended to important people, too. Through his intervention, one could meet the adviser of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and other leaders, said a journalist who knew Niamutullah well.        
	A PTI journalist has to say this about him:        
	I first met Niamutullah soon after the Northern Alliance armies swept into the city in late 2001. Fluent in English, he made himself my guide, helping me cover the events in the post-Taliban era.        
	He guided me to areas that were safe and told me which were not. Niamutullah said he hated the Taliban because their forces had bombed his ancestral house and killed his family members during their attacks on the areas north of Kabul.        
	In 2004, on a visit organised by the US State Department, I met Niamutullah again. He offered to be my guide but this time I had to decline (since) the US embassy in Kabul had organised a guide for us.        
	But he would meet me every evening at a guesthouse in the Wazir Akbar Khan area, where Hindi film songs would play, and later guide me to Indian restaurants.        
	The visit took us to Taliban strongholds of Ghazni and areas where the US forces had set up command centres on the key Kabul-Kandahar highway.        
	Niamutullah struck an instant chord with common people. I wanted to buy a few of the famed karakuli caps and he took me to some famous makers who gave discounts.        
	I bought $500 caps but paid only $150. I got carpets worth $800-900 for just $250 from Kabuls famous chicken street.        
	His dream was to visit India. Niamutullah said he loved Delhi restaurant food and Indian films.        
	I am a die-hard fan of Karims and Bollywood movies, he would say. He was planning a visit to Delhi in the winter.

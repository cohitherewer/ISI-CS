	New Delhi, June 5: Even before Manmohan Singh had asked his colleagues to be a little austere with foreign trips, one minister had his takeoff grounded.        
	Panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar would have been in America or Norway by now, but the Prime Ministers Office shot down his plans. The red light flashed on May 30, almost a week before the government was asked to practise austerity.        
	The Prime Minister has not approved the above visit of the minister and the delegation, says a PMO document, a copy of which is with The Telegraph.        
	Aiyar, who had planned his visit between May 31 and June 12, will instead be busy with a four-member panel the Congress has set up to rebuild the party.        
	It is the past record of Aiyars ministrys enthusiastic international relations that is believed to have invited the axe. The ministry even has an international relations section with an exclusive adviser.        
	Last October, Aiyar had invited and hosted a team led by the local government minister of Norway. The ministry paid the hefty bill for the Norwegians three-day stay at Hotel Hyatt.        
	In September, Aiyar took a delegation of women panchayat leaders to China, who almost came back without visiting a village because the local authorities wouldnt allow them. A trip was finally arranged to one village for a few hours.        
	A delegation also visited Pakistan last year.         
	The ministry has signed memorandums of understanding with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Another would have been signed between June 7 and 12 had visit to Norway and America been cleared.        
	Aiyar, a former IFS officer who would have liked to be foreign minister, has also been to Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Australia, the UK, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Sri Lanka on as panchayati raj or sports minister.

          POULOMI BANERJEE                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: The guest list has been halved and the glitz replaced by grit as the Voras prepare for a wedding in the time of war.        
	When Dubai-based businessman Ramesh Vora chose November 30 as the date and Mumbai as the venue for daughter Aditis wedding, he had planned a gala weekend.        
	Now, with a devastated Mumbai in mourning, the Voras are resigned to a ritual minus revelry.        
	All our guests from abroad have gone back home or cancelled coming. Even those from Delhi, Calcutta and other parts of the country have decided not to come to Mumbai. I can understand their fear, Vora told The Telegraph this afternoon, muted strains of sangeet rehearsals audible in the background.        
	We are holding three functions: the sangeet today at the Hyatt hotel and the wedding tomorrow at the Lokhandwala Complex followed by a reception at Vile Parle. But it will be a low-key affair.        
	The usual band music with the baraat has been muzzled; the violins meant for the wedding day silenced. But the missing friends and family are the biggest blow.        
	Late on Wednesday, my daughters Lebanese friend, who had come down from Dubai with her husband, called from the hotel. They were scared and shifted to our house in Vile Parle. The next day they left, said the jeweller, who has strong business links with Calcutta.        
	Another of my daughters close friends heard about the attack as soon as she landed in Mumbai from Iran and took the next flight out.        
	The shadow of the terrorist siege will touch every aspect of the familys celebrations, starting with the sangeet.        
	No vehicles are being allowed into the Hyatt compound. The guests, the baraati  everyone will have to get off outside the hotel and walk. Hotel authorities have also asked us to post two family members at the entrance to identify every arriving guest, Vora said.        
	Similar scenes are being played out at star hotels in Calcutta where stilettos are being forced to totter the last mile while attending social functions behind closed doors.        
	It is just unfortunate timing for the Voras. Given a choice, who would want to go to Mumbai this weekend? said a friend of the family in Calcutta who has decided to give the wedding a miss.

	Bhubaneswar, June 11: The Indian Meteorology Department has plans to launch a dedicated weather TV channel through public-private partnership, said director-general of meteorology Air Vice-Marshal Ajit Tyagi.         
	Briefing the reporters here about IMDs modernisation plans, Tyagi said the proposed weather channel would be finalised by end of 2008.         
	The channel would initially telecast programmes on weather for six hours a day he said, adding that it would be expanded to 24-hours after a while. Insat-III D is likely to be launched by end of this year or early next year and a receiving station will be set up at New Delhi which will send real time data to regional meteorology centres, said the IMD head.        
	Unfolding the modernisation plans during the 11th Year Plan, Tyagi said an estimated Rs 900 crore would be invested in the first two years. The focus would be on observation, communication, remote sensing and dissemination of information to public.         
	We want to cover all districts with automatic weather stations and rain gauge stations which will help us in real-time data collection on intensity of rain and wind speed, he said. An agro-meteorology service will be launched across the country by the end of this year.

	Smoke hangs on hookah bar ban    
	A legal smoke hangs over Mumbais hookah bar ban.    
	Bombay High Court recently questioned the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbais decision to ban hookah bars and asked it to file an affidavit. A division bench issued the directive while hearing a petition of the owner of one such bar, Cosmic Restobar.     
	The owner, Bharat Sheth, challenged the ban on sale of hookahs in eateries and restaurants. Is there any provision in law which bans hookah bars? the judges asked.    
	Sheth argued, on behalf of those facing the curbs, the civic authorities corporation had no jurisdiction to implement such a measure under the cigarette and other tobacco products (prohibition of advertising and regulation of trade production, supply and distribution) act of 2003.    
	The civic bodys lawyer argued the ban was clamped on the basis of licence conditions on public safety and fire hazards.    
	The judges shot back, asking: When you say public safety, there should be guidelines.         
	Off food to attain salvation    
	A 72-year-old sanyasin in Mysore has been fasting for almost a month now to attain moksha (salvation). Her case is getting more curious by the day as she has successfully divided the Lingayat community.     
	While swamijis and some well-wishers have urged Sharane Gowramma to relent, there are an equal number, including saffron-clad swamis, egging her on to keep fasting till she dies.    
	Already, she is being worshipped as hundreds throng her house everyday asking if she has achieved the final results that she set out to achieve. Gowramma says she has taken the extreme step of her own accord as she feels fasting is one way of surely leaving this world and attaining salvation.     
	She says the Lingayat philosophy inspired her to answer the Sallekhana, or gods call.    
	Rival rails, paper pays    
	A war over TV signals has spawned a newspaper boycott.    
	The DMK leadership recently asked leaders and party workers to stay off Dinakaran, the paper owned by the Maran brothers with whom M. Karunanidhi has fallen out.    
	The edict means no DMK ads, press statements or any other party information will be given to the daily. The trigger for the fiat appeared to be the blanket coverage the paper had apparently given to Jayalalithaas swipe at Royal Cable Vision, the cable service firm set up by Karunanidhis elder son, M.K. Azhagiri.    
	The report, apparently with a picture in which the ADMK leader was shown grinning, also featured her allegations about Azhagiri arm-twisting cable firms in Madurai.    
	Azhagiri, she alleged, was putting pressure on operators to shun Sumangali Cable Vision, the Kalanidhi Maran-owned company. that has dominated the business.    
	The DMKs directive was published in party organ Murasoli.         
	MCD facelift    
	The capitals civic body, the MCD, doesnt only change the face of Delhi. It sometimes helps change the faces of people, too.    
	The MCD recently, with a city hospital and US NGO Smile Train, organised a camp where free treatment is being offered to those born with facial disfigurements, like cleft lips.     
	Twenty-one patients were a screened in Trilok Puri, in the citys east, surgeon S.C. Sood of Sant Parmanand Hospital, part of the initiative, said. Medicines will also be given free.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Supreme Court has rapped the army for flouting its guidelines and not setting up a complaints cell to look into sexual harassment allegations made by a lady teacher of an army public school.        
	The teacher had accused Colonel Hitendra Bahadur, the vice-chairman of the school managing committee, of allegedly making sexual advances at her and even professing his love for her in a letter in mid 2004.        
	She was sacked from General B.C. Joshi Army Public School in Pithoragarh in December the same year after she complained to chairman D.C. Grewal about the matter. The school is run by the Army Welfare Education Society.        
	It is a matter of great regret that the army failed to provide a complaint mechanism and ignored the decision of this court the Supreme Court noted recently.        
	According to the courts guidelines on sexual harassment, all workplaces with more than 10 employees have to set up a complaints cell, order a probe if a woman makes a complaint and take disciplinary action if necessary.        
	The court said the school had set up a complaints cell for other teachers and staff, but none for entertaining a complaint of this nature.        
	Even the purported disciplinary action does not provide a complete picture. A report was submitted but whether any further action has been taken or not is not known.        
	At the time of the complaint, the woman was the school principal. Bahadur was a deputy commander of 69 Mountain Brigade posted at Pithoragarh. He is alleged to have written her the letter when he was later stationed at Sonamarg.        
	When the teacher reported the matter to chairman Grewal, he asked her, in October 2004, to put the allegations in writing. She was dismissed on December 4, 2004, on the basis of two anonymous complaints.        
	The woman then moved the high court, questioning the legality of the sack order. A purported school inquiry ruled out harassment in January 2005 but recommended counselling for Bahadur.        
	The school contended that Bahadur had nothing to do with its daily operations, so the letter sent from Sonamarg could not amount to harassment at the teachers work place.        
	But the court held in May 2006 that the case of sexual harassment is evident from the contents of the letter.        
	When Grewal and Bahadur moved the apex court, it said it would not be proper to enter the merits of the case since the petition was pending before the high court.        
	But it noted: It is not in dispute that no complaint committee has been constituted. It then asked the high court to appoint a three-member team headed by a woman to look into the matter.

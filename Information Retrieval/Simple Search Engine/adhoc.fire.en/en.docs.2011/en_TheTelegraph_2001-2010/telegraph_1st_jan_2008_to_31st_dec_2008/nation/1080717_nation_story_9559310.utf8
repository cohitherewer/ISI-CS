          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 16: In a major reprieve to the Manmohan Singh government, Patna High Court today granted bail to a convicted MP and permission to another to take part in the trust vote.         
	The courts division bench comprising Shivkiriti Singh and Abhijit Sinha allowed LJP MP Surajbhan Singh, convicted by a fast-track court for the murder of a farmer, to vote.        
	The same court allowed permission to the Siwan RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin to take part in the proceedings of the two-day special session of Lok Sabha beginning from July 21.         
	Both the MPs belong to parties that are components of the UPA. They have already stated that they would go by their respective parties whip warranting them to vote in favour of the July 21 confidence motion.         
	Their presence is all set to add to the number of MPs in favour of the Manmohan Singh government, so crucial for the UPA government after the withdrawal of the Lefts support. RJD sources revealed that the party was trying for a similar reprieve to its Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav who stands convicted in the murder of communist leader Ajit Sarkar and is lodged in Tihar jail.         
	We are confident of garnering the support of the MPs, enough to ensure the governments victory in the House, said RJD chief Lalu Prasad.        
	The court granted bail to Surajbhan despite prosecutions vehement opposition. Prosecution counsel Shyamseshar Dayal argued that two witnesses in the Rami Singh murder case, in which a fast-track court had sentenced Surajbhan to life imprisonment on June 25, had deposed during the trial that he had shot the deceased in the temple.         
	Surajbhans lawyer Rana Pratap Singh, however, rebutted the charge and said the injury report in the case maintained that the deceased was shot in the back. No evidence of the MPs direct involvement in the murder exists, he contended.         
	Shivakirti Singh and Abhijit Sinha allowed Shahabuddins prayer to go to Delhi for the trust vote, after hearing counsel Y.V. Giri and Rajiv Giri, besides the counsel for the state. In fact, there was a precedent in the don turned MPs favour, for the high court had allowed him to participate in the presidential polls, too.         
	Referring to BJP leader L.K. Advanis remarks that the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was banking on the support of convicted MPs, RJD spokesman Shyam Razak said: The UPA governments probity can not be questioned. The law and constitution allow MPs to take part in parliamentary proceedings. It does not require a debate.

                                                                                                            Plea against culling order
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Crying over culling                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 5: Poultry farmers in the state today sought judicial intervention in the killing of healthy birds following a directive from the Centre.        
	The alliance of All Orissa Poultry Farmers Association, All Orissa Layers Farmers Association and All Orissa Broiler and Integrator Association filed a petition in Orissa High Court here challenging the governments decision in pursuance of a Centre directive. The associations have also sought an interim stay order on culling operations in Orissa. We dont agree with the central governments plan because no poultry here has been proven to be infected so far, Milan Rout, the president of All Orissa Layers Farmers Association, told The Telegraph.        
	The February 1, 2008, order from the Centre directed the state to cull birds in farms located up to 5km near the border of Bengal Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand and Orissa. Though the administration had initially been reluctant to cull healthy birds, on Monday the state government decided to take no risk and implement the Centres order.        
	According to the petition filed today, the government had tested birds within the 5km radius of the Orissa border, but no case of bird flu was found. Also 4,811 serum samples, clinical samples and dead birds were sent to Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Calcutta and High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal, but all of them tested negative.         
	Meanwhile, Maneka Gandhis People for Animals Orissa affiliate today described the governments decision as unethical, especially since the reports were clear.        
	We want the government to concentrate on ensuring that no birds entered Orissa from the border areas. But the decision to kill large number of chicks even as none is effected by the flu is unfortunate, said J.B. Das, the secretary of PFA-Orissa.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Two years ago, Ratan Tata had accused some of our competitors of fuelling the Singur controversy. Today, he wondered aloud how Mamata Banerjees agitation was funded after all.        
	Tata was asked if he thought competition had had any role in the events that led him to pull out of Singur.        
	At this point, I would not like to respond, except to say that it has made us wonder where some of the funds for the agitation, and the arrangements of the logistics have come from. And that does lead us to pondering on what may be behind some of this agitation, he said.        
	In a December 2006 television interview, Tata had accused his business rivals of trying to delay the project.        
	Let me just say it is not just political, because I happen to know that some of our competitors are also fuelling some of this fire. They would be very happy if the project got delayed, he had said.        
	A leading passenger-car maker would face severe competition when the Nano hits the market with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh. A Nano rollout could be bad news for some two-wheeler makers too, for the cheap car is bound to tempt many two-wheeler riders to switch.        
	The Nano appears also to have fuelled the imagination of many other auto makers who are planning rival budget cars. A leading Indian two-wheeler maker has announced plans to develop a car that would compete with the Nano in its price tag.        
	The chairman of a two-wheeler maker had publicly supported Mamatas agitation, saying she was fighting for farmers and not votes. But soon afterwards, he expressed support for Tata too.

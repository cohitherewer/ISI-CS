The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Loan waive quandary
                                                                                                               Loan waive quandary
          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 2: Approximately 25 lakh marginal farmers in the state are expected to gain from the loan waiver proposal in the Union budget, but confusion prevails over the eligibility criteria for availing the benefit.        
	The state government officials are still not clear as to which type of loan would be waived, who would be eligible for it and what would be the cut-off date for availing the waiver  despite the Union budget specifying details.        
	Moreover, fate of farmers who have taken loans from private moneylenders and unorganised agencies remains sealed. Though money-lending business has been banned in the state, its still in practice in remote tribal areas. The tribal community also mortgage crops to private moneylenders.         
	The government should come out with a clear-cut guideline on the loan waiver policy and rescue innocent farmers who have availed loans from private moneylenders in absence of institutional credit mechanism, said Bibhudendra Pratap Das, the president of Orissa Krushak Mahasangh.         
	Else, farmers will never be liberated from loan bondage, he added.         
	A senior official in the co-operation department said: Agricultural loan is not given just for raising crops. It is also given for digging ponds, purchasing tractors and equipment. Its also granted for pisciculture, poultry and sericulture. So its not clear which will be exempted.         
	Co-operation minister, Surama Padhy remained sceptical as to whether the populist scheme announced by the UPA government would benefit farmers.        
	Farmers would have benefited more had there been a slash in the crop loan interest rate to at least 4 per cent, she said.         
	Interest rate slash, arrangements for agricultural produces and proper minimum support price would have been a permanent answer to green woes, Padhy added.

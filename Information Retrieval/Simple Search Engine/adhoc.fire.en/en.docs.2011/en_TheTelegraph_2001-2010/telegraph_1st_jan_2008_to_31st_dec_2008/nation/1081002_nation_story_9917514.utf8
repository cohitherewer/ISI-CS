          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: A circular has been issued to all states and Union territories to ensure no hospital, government or private, turns away HIV-positive patients, the Centre informed the Supreme Court today.        
	It must be ensured that there is no discrimination or stigma to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) at healthcare facilities or otherwise. Cases of denial of services to positive patients should be viewed seriously and action initiated in all such cases, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium said, quoting a health ministry memorandum.        
	All doctors, nurses and hospital staff, whether in the public sector or private sector, shall treat PLHAs in a professional and humane manner, treating them always with dignity and care. No doctor or nurse shall refuse to treat a PLHA on account of his/her positive status. In treating a PLHA, there shall be no discrimination or stigma whatsoever, he said.        
	Subramanium was appearing for the government after a petition, filed on behalf of the Occupational Health and Safety Association, sought court intervention to ensure proper care and treatment for people living with the disease.        
	After the court asked the Centre to take appropriate measures, the health ministry issued a memorandum on August 26, 2008, asking all states and Union territories to comply with the directives within six weeks.        
	The memo has mandated state governments to set up anti-retroviral therapy centres and ensure that PLHAs have free access to these centres. Free treatment would have to be ensured at all these centres, the memo said. HIV test kits would also have to be made available.        
	All advertisements offering potential cure for HIV must be banned and such organisations should be dealt with strictly, as there is no proven cure available for HIV/AIDS so far, the memo said.        
	The Centre assured the court that Union and state governments would ensure every HIV-positive person on anti-retroviral therapy was given an Antodaya Anna Yojana card, which would help them get foodgrain at highly subsidised rates.        
	The governments, the Centre said, would also ensure that such persons have job cards and employment in accordance with the national rural employment guarantee scheme.        
	The governments 14-point memo has been vetted by the apex court, which will monitor its implementation.

	The maids must be at least 30 years old and paid a minimum monthly salary of 1,100 dirhams (Rs 11,000).         
	The regulations, framed by the ministry of overseas Indian affairs, come into effect immediately and cover pending applications for such jobs.         
	Hiring under the rules, which will be extended to other countries later, will ensure maids get a fair deal and are not exploited in any manner.         
	To employ such women  called female household service workers in official parlance  an employer should have an income of at least 10,000 dirhams (around Rs 1 lakh) per month. An Indian national must guarantee the employers character and social standing.        
	The employer will have to approach the Indian embassy/consulate, accompanied by an Indian national of good standing, who will personally guarantee the character and the social standing of the intending employer, one of the conditions governing recruitment of housemaids said.        
	The maid will have to be given a cellphone on arrival. She, along with the employer, will be required to report to the embassy within two weeks of her arrival in the UAE.         
	The job contracts will have to be attested by the Shariat court in that country and its ministry of justice and Islamic affairs, besides the ministry of foreign affairs.        
	Maids can be hired directly by the employer or indirectly through registered recruitment agents in India. In the direct method, the employer will have to deposit 9,200 dirhams (Rs 92,000) as security or provide a bank guarantee of the same amount to the Indian embassy.         
	The money will be refunded in cases where the job contract is terminated by mutual consent. An application will have to be made and the employer will have to appear before the embassy in person along with the maid.

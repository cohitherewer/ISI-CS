The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Comrades split over divorce timing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Comrades split over divorce timing
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, July 5: The divorce with the government is imminent but the comrades are divided over when to end the marriage.        
	CPI chief A.B. Bardhan today threatened to withdraw support if the Congress didnt reply to a Left letter by July 7, the day the Prime Minister leaves for the G8 summit in Japan, but his CPM counterpart said he would wait.        
	I will wait for the reply from Pranab Mukherjee since he is the convener of the Left-UPA committee on the nuclear issue, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat told The Telegraph.        
	The letter had asked the foreign minister to inform the Left definitely by July 7 whether the government was taking the safeguards agreement to nuclear watchdog IAEA, but a Congress spokesman yesterday said sovereign governments couldnt be subjected to deadlines.        
	Both Karat and Bardhan attended an event this evening to mark the birth centenary of parliamentarian Hiren Mukherjee.        
	In the morning, Karat met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and CPM Bengal secretary Biman Bose at the state party headquarters. Karat, Bhattacharjee and Bose then visited Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake home where the party patriarch, insiders said, advised caution.        
	But Bardhan appeared firm on withdrawing support if the Congress didnt respond before July 7. We didnt want to pull the rug from under the governments feet when the Prime Minister is abroad, he told a CPI state council meeting this afternoon.        
	But the Congress spokesmans comments on the letter, which represents the opinion of 60 MPs, only reflects the partys arrogance. If the Congress wants to precipitate the crisis, we may be forced to pull out, he said but insisted it was not our intention.        
	The CPI leader said the Left would meet President Pratibha Patil the day it withdraws support and urge her to ask the government to prove its majority in Parliament.         
	But indicating differences within the bloc, he added that it was the CPIs position and the four Left parties would decide on July 8 when to pull out.        
	The RSP and the Forward Bloc, too, want to withdraw support if the government ignores the deadline.        
	CPM insiders, however, said Basu and other Bengal leaders had advised Karat not to take any hasty move.        
	Party central committee members said CPM leaders could write to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and UPA allies. No hope of rapprochement is left. But we have to follow the due process of the divorce so that we are not blamed for hasty decisions, said one.         
	Karat gave the impression to his comrades that he would like to wait. .         
	If he (Manmohan) commits himself (on the deal) to President Bush at Hokkaido, we would have no option but to withdraw, a central committee member quoted Karat as saying.        
	At the evening event, Karat said it was not possible to talk of inflation and the oil price hike without referring to American occupation of Iraq and its threat to Iran. We are against the Indo-US nuclear deal because it is detrimental to our energy security, Karat said.

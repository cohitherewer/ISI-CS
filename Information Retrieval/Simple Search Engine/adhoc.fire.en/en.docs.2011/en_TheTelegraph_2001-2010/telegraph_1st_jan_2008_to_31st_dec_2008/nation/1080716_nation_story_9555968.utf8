                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Captain alleges torture
                            
	Chandigarh, July 15 (PTI): A woman captain in the army today alleged that she was physically and mentally tortured by her superiors, a charge denied by the army.         
	Ever since I was posted at the Army Service Corps battalion in Kalka (in Haryana) in October 2007, three of my officers started physically and mentally torturing me, the officer, who made a written complaint to the army authorities on July 13, alleged.        
	The captain, who is unmarried, said her parents and sister had often stayed with her. This irked the three officers who always forced me to throw them out. If I did not pay heed to them, I was sent on duties to far off places, she said. The officer also said she had been put under house arrest.         
	An army spokesperson denied the allegations and said an officer of the rank of a major general had gone to Kalka to probe the allegations.         
	He said the woman officer had been earlier asked to lead a convoy to Pathankot but she had given some lame excuses to avoid the duty.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

       
	Camera brakes on highway bandits
  
	If eyes fail to track down the robbers, the cameras wont.
  
	Police in Thane, which borders Mumbai, have set in motion the plan to slam the brakes on the spate of highway robberies by installing high-resolution cameras at toll points along the national highways leading out of the city.
  
	The process is under way and cameras will be installed within three weeks and the biometric systems within four to six weeks, a senior Thane police official said.
  
	The biometric systems  like the ones used by some countries in issuing visas  will store the fingerprints and other features of drivers going past these toll points.
  
	The police will keep a database of the thumb impressions. The records will help trace criminals, the officer said. 
  
	The cameras, using a 500GB hard disk each, will retain the data for 15 days at a time. Later, the images will be loaded onto computers in control rooms. A driver will be questioned if the information given at one checkpost does not match those furnished at others down the highway.
    
	High-tea tables at IIM
  
	The campus of one of the countrys top business schools now has a high-tea corner where students exchange notes and engage in animated debates over a cuppa.
  
	In a novel initiative, the Indian Institute of Management here leased some space to Tata Tea on its hallowed campus for setting up Chai Unchai.
  
	The place is not a kiosk, nor is it a parlour, but a unique retail channel in the out-of-home segment that connects with the youth, company officials said. More such outlets are likely to come up on campuses across the country. 
  
	The cool new adda is not just about tea, though. Non-tea beverages and snacks, including lip-smacking chaats, are also served. Officials said the company was also planning to open such outlets at shopping malls.
  
	Reality show, now on radio
  
	Move over television, its radios turn to give viewers a sense of reality. 
  
	Radio City, which can be heard on 91.1 FM in Delhi, has launched the first-ever reality show on Indian airwaves. Pop band Euphoria performed at its launch earlier this week. 
  
	There was no Shilpa Shetty, though. The actress participated in the UK reality show Big Brother, where she won after claiming she was racially abused by other competitors. Shilpa and others had lived together in a house for a month without any communication with the outside world. The show had spawned a copycat, Big Boss, in India. 
  
	But a National School of Drama festival of plays recently beat all TV reality shows. A graduate from the institute lived inside a glasshouse, visible to all visitors, for 15 days, alone. NSD officials conceded that the glasshouse was probably a bigger draw than their plays themselves. 
  
	What was certainly true was that many people got late for their play because they kept watching the glasshouse, an official said.
    
	Scare terminal
  
	Officials at Chennai airport spent much of the Republic Day weekend dealing not with the passenger rush but scares.
  
	On Sunday, the culprit was an unclaimed handbag, which sent authorities into a tizzy and sparked a security scramble. The bag was put in a cool box for bomb-related tests. It was taken out after 24 hours, officials said. 
  
	he previous day, Republic Day, had brought another bag of worries for the airport after a handbag and a cardboard box were found in the international terminal.
 
	Delhi: This Thursday, New York-based artist S. Ekatherina presents India, Sensuality and Spirituality, an exhibition of her photo paintings at Gallery Nos. 5 and 6 in the Lalit Kala Academy, Rabindra Bhavan. The venue is on Copernicus Marg near Mandi House. Time: 11am to 7pm.

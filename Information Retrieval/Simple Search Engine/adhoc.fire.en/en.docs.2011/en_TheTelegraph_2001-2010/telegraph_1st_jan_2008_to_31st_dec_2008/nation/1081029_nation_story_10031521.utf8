          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers rebuild home after supercyclone                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 28: Tiding over the losses following disastrous supercyclone in 1999, the Orissa government is now determined to ensure better preparedness to overcome disasters of any magnitude in future.        
	On October 29, 1999, the supercyclone had hit the Orissa coast, devastating 14 coastal districts. Besides claiming nearly 10,000 lives, it crippled the states economy.         
	But the state has been successful in turning a sad event into an opportune moment not only for stocktaking but also to ensure better preparedness.         
	Instead of recounting the sad memories of the supercyclone, October 29 is observed as State Disaster Preparedness Day and National Day for Disaster Reduction every year.        
	Learning from the sad experience, an independent body titled Orissa State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA), the first of its kind in the country, has been established. The Orissa model has been followed by Gujarat, which has set up a similar body and the National Disaster Management Authority has been put in place on the lines of Orissa.        
	Probably with this years unprecedented floods on the back of its mind, the state government is focusing on flood and coastal erosion management.         
	We have decided to focus on management of floods and coastal erosion this year while observing the cyclone anniversary, said N.K. Sundaray, the managing director of Orissa State Disaster Management Authority.        
	A mobile-based application for generation of data for disaster management, developed by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), would be launched at the Orissa Disaster Preparedness Day function tomorrow, said Sundaray.        
	NRSC, in collaboration with OSDMA, Sophitorium Institute of Technology and Lifeskills, is using this unique device for the first time in the country for creating a database of relief shelters, hospitals and supply godowns in Puri district on a pilot basis, he said.        
	This mobile device deployed in the field can transmit factual details collected by the enumerators and fed as input with a photograph of the facility or location to the server computer.        
	This year, Orissa has witnessed floods in two phases  June and September. The last round of floods in Mahanadi river system was the unprecedented one, affecting five million people living in 7,632 villages in 19 districts.

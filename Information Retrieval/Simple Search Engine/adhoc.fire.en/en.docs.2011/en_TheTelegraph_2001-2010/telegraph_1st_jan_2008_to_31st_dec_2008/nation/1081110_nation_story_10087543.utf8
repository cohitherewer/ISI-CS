          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 9: A religious association from Kandhamal, Hindu Jagaran Sammukhya, today blamed police for targeting Hindu activists, instead of providing them the necessary security.         
	The association members were referring to the Saturday night arrest of their district-general secretary, Simanchal Patra, who was taken into police custody after the association sought protection for him.        
	Condemning the arrest of innocent Hindus in Kandhamal, the groups state president, Ashok Sahu, said that police were framing charges against innocent civilians and adopting a partisan attitude. Activists are being killed by militant and the government is not bothering about the Church-sponsored violence, he said.        
	Laxmikant Dash, the general secretary of Orissa Vanabasi Kalyan Ashram, was accompanied by Karendra Majhi, the MLA from Baliguda and Padmanabh Pradhan, the president of Kui Sanskrutik Parishad.         
	The political and religious leaders also called on the director-general of police at the police headquarters in Cuttack after a man called Dhanu Pradhani was murdered in Kandhamal.        
	During an hour-long discussion, they called the DGPs attention to the letter which Swami Laxmananda Saraswati received before he was murdered on August 23.        
	They submitted a list of 15 people who have been allegedly targeted by the church for elimination under the garb of Naxalite operation. The DGP reportedly expressed his inability to give protection to all people in the list, that allegedly included the name of Dhanu Pradhani, who was found killed, and of Karendra Majhi, the MLA who accompanied the group.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: A 60-year-old woman rammed her car into 11 pedestrians, killing one, on a busy road in central Mumbai this afternoon.
    
	Indrajit Kaur, a homemaker, lost control of her Hyundai Santro near a flower market on Senapati Bapat Road in Dadar around 1.45pm when the place was teeming with office-goers taking a lunch break.
    
	Kaur is a resident of Juhu. She was immediately surrounded by passers-by and she is still in a state of shock. She hasnt been able to tell us how or why she lost control, inspector Madhukar Sankhe of Dadar police station said.
    
	He added that Kaur was not drunk. However, she was definitely speeding and a case of rash driving has been registered against her, Sankhe said.
    
	The officer said the woman was carrying a valid driving licence. 
    
	The injured have been admitted to KEM Hospital, Nayar Hospital and Poddar Hospital in central Mumbai.
    
	In India, over 60 per cent of road accident victims are pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. Studies have revealed that older drivers are involved in more fatal car crashes than any other age group except teenagers. Drivers over the age of 75 also violate traffic rules more than youngsters.
    
	Two of the most common violations, failure to yield the right of way and failure to obey a traffic sign, often lead to accidents at intersections, where situations require a quick response, full peripheral vision and interaction with other drivers. In addition to the normal changes in vision, older people are more likely to have medical conditions that can affect driving performance, K.K. Aggarwal, executive vice-chairman, Heart Care Foundation of India, has said on Delhi traffic polices website.
    
	Although there is no upper age limit for drivers in India, physical fitness at the time of renewal of licence is a must. 
    
	We cannot deny a person his licence just because he is old. This completely depends on the individuals physical state, said an officer at the Regional Transport Office.

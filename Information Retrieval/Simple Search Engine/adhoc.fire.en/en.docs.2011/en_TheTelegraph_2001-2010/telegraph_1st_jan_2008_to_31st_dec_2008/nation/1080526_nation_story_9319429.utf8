          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 25: Inspector-general (prisons) S. Thyagarajan today accused associates of top criminals lodged in Jharpada jail of the Saturday nights bomb attack on the prison.        
	It may have been a member of any gang who wished to create mischief on behalf of his boss. One can say that the crme-de-la-crme of the Orissa criminal world is lodged in this jail. We are investigating into the matter and hope to make a headway soon, Thyagarajan told the reporters today.         
	Lodging notorious gangsters can be a dangerous task both for the police and prisoners, too, as Jharpada jail authorities found out last night, when unidentified people hurled crude bombs at the special jail around 9pm.         
	The silence in and around the Laxmisagar area (where the prison is located) was shattered by deafening explosions and the prison premises was filled with smoke almost immediately.         
	Jail superintendent Prashant Das, who was caught unawares, immediately pressed the danger alarm, while Laxmisagar police rushed in to help.         
	One of the bombs hurled at the prison had blown off outside the jail premises. Pieces of the exploded bombs were collected today both from inside and outside the jail.        
	An unexploded bomb that had fallen near the womens cells was defused last night.         
	Thyagarajan and deputy commissioner of police Himanshu Lal inspected the spot today before addressing the media.         
	We are taking the matter seriously. A police platoon would be deployed around the jail to avoid a repeat of such incidents in the future, said the inspector-general.         
	The incident could have been avoided had there been special watchtowers to keep a constant vigil. We have plans to construct watchtowers soon, he added.         
	The Jharpada jail lodges quite a few colourful characters of the criminal world  Raja Acharya, Anil Chhotray, Hyder and Suleman.         
	Raja plea rejected        
	The local sub-divisional judicial magistrates court has rejected Raja Acharyas petition seeking admission to a government hospital on health grounds.         
	The court has extended his judicial custody for 15 more days (till June) and has fixed the final hearing on May 26.         
	Raja Acharyas defence lawyer Bana Mohanty said: We had informed the sub-divisional court that Rajas pulse rate had been high for the past few days and that he was not feeling well. But the court rejected our plea.

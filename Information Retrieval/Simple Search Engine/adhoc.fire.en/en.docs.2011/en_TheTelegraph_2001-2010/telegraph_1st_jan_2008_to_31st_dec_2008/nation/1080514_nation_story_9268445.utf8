          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                      
	Mumbai, May 13: The Shiv Senas regional agenda invaded the symbol of Indias global rise today when it protested at the Bombay Stock Exchange demanding it rename itself Mumbai Stock Exchange.        
	Bal Thackerays party also wants names changed of public institutions and private companies such as Bombay High Court and Bombay Dyeing. Its sudden revival of its old Marathi pride agenda is believed to be a competitive response to Raj Thackerays anti-north Indian campaign.        
	Activists of the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena, the Shiv Sena student wing, tried to enter the bourse three times but were prevented from any vandalism by police, who detained 24 people.        
	The outfits president, Abhijit Panse, then handed over a memorandum to the BSE security chief, warning he would be back if the stock exchange did not change its name within 15 days. BSE authorities have promised to act on the memorandum soon, Panse told reporters.        
	Bourse officials, however, said no assurance was given. The BSE is registered with the Registrar of Companies, and there is no question of changing its name, an official said.        
	We would have to register afresh if the name is changed. We are certain this campaign will die down.        
	Shiv Sena activists also blackened several shop signboards in Pune and Nashik that had Bombay written on them, with the party womens wing leading the charge in Nashik.        
	On Sunday, some party activists had vandalised the signboard of the Bombay Scottish School, Mahim. Bombay Dyeings boards at its Worli and Aurangabad mills did not escape either.        
	Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena looked on amused, claiming the success of its anti-north Indian campaign had frightened its parent party.        
	From celebrating Uttar Pradesh Day to raising the Bombay-Mumbai issue  its a huge U-turn for the Shiv Sena, MNS spokesperson Shirish Parkar said.        
	Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut dismissed the claim. This is not a new campaign for us. In 1995, Bombay legally became Mumbai but some establishments continue to use Bombay. We want Bombay High Court renamed Mumbai High Court, and the high courts at Madras and Calcutta renamed Chennai and Kolkata High Court.        
	Mumbai institutions that have retained Bombay in their name include the Bombay Gymkhana where the first-ever Test was played in India, the 125-year-old Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The Tata headquarters is still called Bombay House.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bokaro, April 21: Bokaro became a fortress on the eve of the Prime Ministers visit as over 5,000 police personnel were pressed into service to maintain vigil.        
	Six IPS officers and over 112 magistrates have been posted in the steel city in Jharkhand for the security of Manmohan Singh, who is scheduled to fly to Jamshedpur after laying the foundation stone for the expansion project of the Bokaro steel plant.         
	The IPS officers  Vijaya Laxmi, Pankaj Kamboj, Jatin Narwal, Kuldwip Dewedi, Durga Oraon and Asim Vikrant Minz  will be positioned at different spots from the Bokaro aerodrome to the Sector V ground, where Singh will do the honours.         
	The district administration has ordered all schools in Bokaro to stay closed to ensure students do not face problems when buses stay off roads during the Prime Ministers three-hour visit.         
	National highways and roads through Bokaro will be sealed from midnight.        
	Bokaro superintendent of police Priya Dubey said she and other officers were leaving no stone unturned to ensure foolproof security for the Prime Minister.         
	We have strictly followed the rules as specified in the Blue Book after consultation with the SPG, said Dubey.

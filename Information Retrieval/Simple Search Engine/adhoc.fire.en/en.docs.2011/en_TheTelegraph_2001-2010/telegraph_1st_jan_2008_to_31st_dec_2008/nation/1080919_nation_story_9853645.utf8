          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Biswamohan Pani                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 18: Brundaban Pani and his wife Satyaprabha are helpless.         
	The elderly couple residing in the old Bhubaneswar area cant but make frantic efforts to bail out their son Biswamohan in the US who was recently charged by the FBI of stealing company secrets from software giant Intel.        
	Biswamohan, 33, a former employee of Intel has been found with stolen design plans for processor chips. He worked as a designer with the chipmaker giant at the companys plant in Boston. In June, Biswamohan left Intel to join Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).        
	The stolen chips, considered confidential were found from his residence in the US during an FBI raid and he was charged in late August.        
	His parents in Orissa, however, said that he was being unnecessarily harassed in a trade dispute between two international software giants: Intel and AMD. Both the companies are rivals and my son has been unnecessarily dragged into this. We want him back in Orissa at any cost and will approach the government for help, said Brundaban.        
	The case is being tried at US District Court in Boston, although he was not arrested.

										      SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI      night at oberoi                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: As I drive towards Oberoi Hotel at 10pm on Wednesday, the city looks like never before  dead.         
	It is a ghost town with barricades. On-the-edge policemen lunge at every passing vehicle to carry out checks.        
	All arterial roads are blocked and Marine Drive where Oberoi stands resembles a battle zone.         
	Suddenly, around 11.30pm, there is a commotion. Move out of the way. Gunmen, shooting recklessly from a car, are coming this way, a policeman announces.        
	Panic ripples across the crowd of over 100.         
	A few cars pass, but nothing happens. Things calm down a bit.        
	In the stillness of the tense night, Jayshree Mansukhani, 65, begins to sob.        
	My daughter-in-law has come down from the US for a visit and was having dinner with her cousins at the Frangipani restaurant of Oberoi, when two gunmen barged in shooting. She called around 10.15pm to say she was okay, but we have not heard from her since. Can you find out if she is safe? she pleads to no one in particular.        
	The Mansukhanis, who trade in textiles, live 2km from Oberoi at the upscale Walkeshwar neighbourhood.        
	Around midnight, some hotel staff and guests come out, their hands up.        
	An ambulance rushes in soon after and three bodies wrapped in bloodstained sheets are carried away in a flash. More ambulances scream their way into the spot.        
	Around 2 in the morning, two army trucks carrying about 50 commandos arrive.        
	Now these are the guys  the only people who can do something, says Ratna, a bystander munching peanuts being sold by a hawker doing brisk business in this hour of crisis.        
	The commandos line up and wait in a column. An officer leads them to the far end near the NCPA, where Marine Drive ends. I join a couple of reporters in the commandos trail. They ignore us.         
	The commandos wait in the shadows, keeping a watch on the hotel. A group hides behind the parked vehicles and then quickly enters the building.        
	The rest climb down to the seaside and make their way through the concrete boulders towards a sewage line from the hotel.        
	The calm of 3.15am breaks with a loud explosion from the hotel. Police personnel patrolling Marine Drive order us to move out.         
	There is a lull till 4.30am when a VIP car arrives with an entourage. State leader of Opposition Ramdas Kadam steps out.        
	Around 5, police commissioner Hassan Gafoor arrives with some other senior officers. The elite commandos of the National Security Guards soon follow suit. They storm into the building 45 minutes later.        
	Jayshree lies down on a seat on the promenade and falls asleep. Her husband Ramnath, 70, seeks solace from the sea. There is no news of our daughter-in-law yet, he sighs.        
	It is 8am.         
	My phone rings. It is from my home in Calcutta. One of my relatives, I am told, has been killed in another terrorist attack elsewhere in the city. I need to help his parents find his body.        
	I leave for JJ Hospital, where my 28-year-old relative lies dead, shot in the head, three days before his wedding.        
	Behind me, gunshots ring out of Oberoi Hotel.

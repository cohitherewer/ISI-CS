                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Hotel to pay for car theft
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 1 (PTI): A hotel is responsible for the safety of guests vehicles parked on its premises, the national consumer commission has said, asking the Hyatt to pay Rs 2 lakh to a visitor whose car was stolen from its parking lot.        
	When a uniformed valet with his imposing figure asks for the car keys, he inspires confidence in the consumer and, therefore, for the management of the five-star hotel to shirk the responsibility of the safety of the car parked on its premises does not augur well, the commission said.        
	The panel passed the order on a petition filed by the Hyatt challenging a state commission order directing it to pay Rs 2 lakh to Atul Virmani, whose Maruti Gypsy was stolen from its parking lot in 1996.

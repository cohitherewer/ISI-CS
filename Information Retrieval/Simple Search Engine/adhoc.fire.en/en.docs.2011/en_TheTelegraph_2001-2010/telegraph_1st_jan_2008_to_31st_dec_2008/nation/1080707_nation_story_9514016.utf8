  - Bakul boost to students story-telling sessions          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rapt attention                                        
	Bhubaneswar, July 6: Bakul Childrens Library today started a series of story-telling sessions for city students aged between 10 and 12 on the institute premises.        
	With oral tradition fast losing out to television and films, members of Bakul believed that story-telling could do with a fresh package  so instead of familiar faces, interns working under Unicef and based in Orissa for now would double up as story-tellers.         
	The tales, too, would be from unfamiliar shores across the seas.        
	We found quite a few people from different countries willing to help us out. Our programme is titled Once upon a time...stories and storytellers from across the globe and it started from today with American citizen Colette Liddell, said a member.         
	Liddell who is in Orissa for a fortnight, offered to tell a story first and she would be followed by Cathy Cuadra (from Germany), Su Hyun Kim (from Korea) and Nicole Goldstein (from the UK). The four are Unicef interns.         
	After they leave, Bakul has storytellers from Ireland, Holland, Belgium, France, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Japan, China, Malaysia, Kenya, Denmark and Turkey waiting in the wings.         
	The sessions would be interactive and children would get to know of the countries first hand, about their histories, geography and culture. Its not only about stories, but as much about the country and the origin of the stories, said the director of Bakul Foundation, Sujit Mohapatra. We are sure that we will be able to continue with this programme on an uninterrupted basis, he added.         
	Bakul also plans to introduce storytellers from other parts of India and dedicate one Sunday every month to stories from within India.         
	The library has also started a regular programme of reading assistance. The new programme will run every week, from Monday to Saturday, where children would be provided reading assistance. Besides, there are plans to have games, activities and dramatised storytelling  to help kids read and write.

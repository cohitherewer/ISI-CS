	Mumbai, June 30 (PTI): The Maharashtra government today told Bombay High Court that Abu Salem would be allowed to go to other cities to attend trials if the special anti-terror court permits.        
	Earlier this year, the government had issued a directive that the gangster should not be taken out of Arthur Road Jail in central mumbai, where he is currently lodged as an undertrial.         
	Salem had challenged the order.

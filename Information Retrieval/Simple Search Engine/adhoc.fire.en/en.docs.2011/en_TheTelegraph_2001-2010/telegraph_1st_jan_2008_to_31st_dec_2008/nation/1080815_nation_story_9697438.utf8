          ANANYA SENGUPTA AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Mourners in the village in Greater Noida . (Prem Singh)                                  
	Greater Noida/Lucknow, Aug. 14: The Rawal family in a Greater Noida village got Rs 1.9 crore from the government two years ago for their 59,440 square metres of land.        
	If they could sell the plot at current market prices today, directly to the companies building townships in the area, the Rawals could have been richer by up to Rs 119 crore.        
	Anger at the huge mismatch simmered inside Gopak Rawal and many other land-sellers from 10 local villages till it erupted into yesterdays protests when police firing killed at least three of them, including Gopak.        
	The farmers knew they could no longer benefit from the steepling market rates, but were demanding an increased compensation that the Uttar Pradesh government had announced in April last year.        
	At Rs 850 a square metre  compared with the old rate of Rs 322 that the Mulayam Singh Yadav government paid in 2006  the Ravals would have made an extra Rs 3.2 crore over and above what they were paid.        
	Unlike Nandigrams farmers, those here had no issues about selling their land but only about the price, Gopaks son Satinder made it clear. In 2006, the government had promised to revise the rate. When we demanded our right yesterday, it showered bullets on us, he said.        
	In the past two years, the villages here have seen no development, but look at the tall buildings that have come up! The government has taken our land at such low rates and is selling them to private companies, who are paying far less than they would if they had bought it directly from us. We know what the market prices are.        
	The authorities have given 12 villages to Ansal properties, four to HCL, one to Ambuja Cement, so now we have realised where our land is going. We didnt give up our ancestral land so that urban townships can come up here with no space for the poor, said Rupesh Verma, a local lawyer helping the farmers.        
	According to property dealers, land rates in Greater Noida have risen fourfold in the past two years, with residential plots selling at Rs 10,500 per square metre (from last years Rs 5,900) and land for commercial complexes at Rs 20,000 (up from last years Rs 12,000).        
	Mulayam today threatened an agitation over yesterdays deaths and sent five Samajwadi Party MPs to meet the farmers, but sources in the Mayavati government blamed Mulayam for the mess.        
	Mulayam had raised the compensation rate from Rs 322 to Rs 850 a square metre one month before the May 2007 elections. He did not make the hike retrospective, and wasnt around after the polls to implement it.         
	When Mayavati began offering compensation under the new rates to farmers elsewhere, those in Greater Noida felt cheated and demanded parity.        
	At least 65 villagers went missing after yesterdays violence, which threw up the bodies of three protesters and possibly a policeman. Today, the farmers threatened more unrest. If our demand is not met, we will immolate ourselves before everyone, said Ram Dev Rawal, member of the Greater Noida Kisan Sangharsh Manch.        
	Let alone give us our dues, the government hasnt even given back the bodies of our loved ones, said Rakesh Bahadur. They offered us cheques for Rs 3 lakh at the police station to sign away the bodies to the police. They held our relatives hostage if we didnt sign. Now they have performed the last rites without even letting us know.

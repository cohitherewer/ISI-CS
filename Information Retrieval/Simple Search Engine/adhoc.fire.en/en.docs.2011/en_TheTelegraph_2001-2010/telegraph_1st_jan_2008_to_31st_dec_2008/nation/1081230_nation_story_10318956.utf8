	Chandigarh, Dec. 29: Trade through the Attari-Wagah border is continuing despite the bilateral tension after the Mumbai attacks, but there has been a fall in the number of trucks crossing over.         
	There has been a slowdown because of the fear of a war and rumours generated in the Pakistani media that trade through the land route has stopped. But trade is continuing, said Rajdeep Uppal, the secretary of the Amritsar Exporters Chamber of Commerce, over the phone.        
	Sources said the number of trucks crossing over every day had come down from about 150 to some 100-110.        
	Uppal said trade with Pakistan had slowed down because of the economic meltdown but now with war hysteria being drummed up on both sides, there could be yet another slowdown.        
	The volume of annual trade between the two countries stands at $2.3 billion (Rs 11,155 crore).

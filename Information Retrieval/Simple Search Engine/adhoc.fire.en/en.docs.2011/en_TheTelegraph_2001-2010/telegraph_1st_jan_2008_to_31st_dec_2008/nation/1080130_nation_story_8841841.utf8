	Mumbai, Jan. 29: The driver of the Maruti Omni in which five children were burnt alive had ignored the warning of a mechanic and carried out unsafe alterations to run the car using petrol stored in a bottle, police said today.
    
	However, the Maharashtra transport commissioner expressed doubts on the police version.
    
	The police claimed that a garage mechanic, who serviced the white Omni hours before it went to Millat High School to pick up children, told them he had warned driver Rafiq Qureshi that it was highly unsafe to run the car by modifying the refitting mechanism.
    
	Qureshi, whose elder brother Jabbar is the owner of the vehicle, had ignored the warning and used two tubes to connect the plastic bottle containing petrol with the carburettor to run the car on petrol instead of LPG.
    
	The refitted Maruti van can either be run on LPG or petrol. Qureshi had run out of LPG and carried out the alterations on his own to run the car on petrol. During the alterations, the wiring was not done properly, leading to a short circuit. The petrol bottle kept open behind the seat fed the fire, resulting in the tragedy, said senior inspector Kiran Sonone.
    
	But transport commissioner Shyamsunder Shinde told The Telegraph: A vehicle retrofitted with gas kits has a petrol tank at the back. When the driver starts the vehicle, it is petrol which provides the ignition, and then the car switches to LPG fuel supply. 
    
	If a driver wanted to run the car on petrol, he should have put the petrol in the tank. I am not sure what kind of alterations the police are talking about.
    
	Sonone said that apart from car manufacturers, the refitting of LPG or CNG kits in private vehicles should be done by authorised dealers. 
    
	Qureshi has violated the Motor Vehicles Act by carrying out alterations in the seating arrangements also, and ferried schoolchildren without the permission of the regional transport office. The RTO issues specific permission to school buses to ferry children as public carriers, the officer said.
    
	Qureshi has been booked under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
    
	Under this section, an accused can be jailed for up to 10 years, but Qureshi could be imprisoned for life if the police succeed in proving that he intended to cause death.

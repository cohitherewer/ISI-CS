	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Former chief ministers Ghulam Nabi Azad and S.M. Krishna are likely to be made part of Sonia Gandhis team of Congress general secretaries.        
	The shuffle is expected after January 14. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh too could change his team of ministers around this time.        
	With the National Conferences Omar Abdullah set to head the Jammu and Kashmir government, Congress sources said Azads role in the state had become marginal. He is unlikely to agree to be a state minister or lead the Congress legislature party. Azad has told aides it is time he got involved in national politics.        
	Krishna, a former Karnataka chief minister, is trying to find his feet in Delhi either as a minister or a general secretary. He is not happy being just a Rajya Sabha member.        
	The exits of general secretaries Margaret Alva and Ashok Gehlot have vacated two posts. Another former chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh of Maharashtra, is not likely to make the cut.        
	Azads critics are keen to thwart his re-entry into the Congress headquarters. They had suggested the Congress accept the PDP proposal to have a coalition government that Azad would lead instead of playing second fiddle in a Congress-NC alliance. Azad, however, checkmated them by facilitating Sonias decision to have a tie-up with the NC.        
	Deputy CM        
	Former Speaker Tara Chand Sharma has emerged frontrunner for the Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief ministers post. The Congress and the NC will also have an alliance for the Lok Sabha polls.

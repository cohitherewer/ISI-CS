The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll panel split on Sonia notice
                                                                                                               Poll panel split on Sonia notice
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11 (PTI): The Election Commission cannot make up its mind whether it should send Sonia Gandhi a disqualification notice for having received a Belgian state honour.        
	A Kerala advocate had sent a complaint seven months ago to the President saying the Congress chief should lose her parliamentary seat because accepting the honour amounted to owning allegiance to the Belgian Constitution.        
	Today, the poll panel, asked to look into the matter by the President, appeared divided.        
	One of its three members said there was nothing wrong in issuing a notice and seeking Sonias comments before disposing of the matter. A second felt there was no need to send a notice. Another meeting is likely tomorrow to reach a conclusion.        
	Under the Constitution, the Election Commissions advice to the President is binding.        
	Sonia was awarded the Order of Leopold, Belgiums second-highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate during her visit to the European country in November 2006.        
	The Congress dismissed the complainants claim. Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: It is a laughable complaint. It has no basis.         
	He argued that by the complainants logic, the South African government should have exiled or disqualified Nelson Mandela after he received the Bharat Ratna.

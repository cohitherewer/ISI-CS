          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: Inspired by chemists in a Pune laboratory, Hyderabad-based biologist J. Gowrishankar had exploited a trick hed played on a bacteria to earn royalty from his research a decade ago.        
	Now, Gowrishankar himself may emerge a model for a new generation of scientists across India being spurred by the government to create, market, and share intellectual property from their research.         
	A bill approved by the cabinet yesterday will allow scientists engaged in government-funded research to earn royalties or licence fees that might emerge from their discoveries or innovations.         
	The Protection and Utilisation of Public Funded Intellectual Property Bill, 2008, will make it statutory for all institutions, including universities, to introduce intellectual property-sharing policies.         
	Scientists would be able to get not less than 30 per cent of royalties or licence fees that might spring from any technology or innovation their research yields, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said.        
	The bill is modelled on the American Bayh Dole Act passed in 1980, which had played a key role in propelling research in the US in the 1980s, said Somenath Ghosh, director of the National Research Development Corporation.         
	Several institutions such as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research already allow their research staff to share royalties or fees from any technology transfer.        
	While he was at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, in the mid-1990s, Gowrishankar had developed a new process to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of using bacteria as miniature factories for biochemicals. He patented the process in the US, Europe and Japan, and the technology was picked up by a foreign company. When royalties began to flow in, the money was shared by research team members, the institution and an employee welfare fund.         
	The motivation came from chemistry people at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune who had pioneered several new processes and marketed them, he said.

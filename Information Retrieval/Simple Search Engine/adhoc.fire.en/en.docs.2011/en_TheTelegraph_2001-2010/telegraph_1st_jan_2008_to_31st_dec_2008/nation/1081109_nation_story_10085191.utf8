                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Foraged army shell kills five in Bengali slum
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                               The mothers of two of the five rag-pickers killed in the Meerut blast. Picture by Rajesh Kumar      Meerut, Nov. 8: A mortar shell exploded in a Bengali-dominated Meerut slum this afternoon, killing five young rag-pickers who may have picked it up from an army firing range 3km away.        
	Police said the victims were boys and girls aged between 10 and 19. Eight others from the slum, all rag-pickers, were injured and have been taken to hospital.        
	Many families in Bengali Basti, mostly populated by migrants from Assam, earn a livelihood by rummaging through waste dumps, and the Meerut Cantonment firing range is one of their favourite hunting grounds.        
	The blast took place when the victims were trying to extract copper from a live mortar shell, Meerut inspector-general of police (IGP) Gurudarshan Singh said, adding that copper from shells casing fetched a good price.        
	The police found six more live shells at the spot, which the army has taken away.        
	Many of the slums 3,000 residents had shed tears when blasts shook Assam last week, said Abdul Hassan, who had arrived from the northeastern state about four years ago after the Brahmaputra gobbled up his land. Today Hassan was mourning for his 14-year-old son Rezzak Ali, killed in the 4.30pm explosion.                  An injured child being taken to hospital. Picture by Naeem Ansari      
	My son would go to the cantonment and get some saleable materials. I never thought these could be dangerous to his life, Hassan said in clear Bengali.        
	He said Rezzak earned about Rs 60 a day, enough to feed his parents, brother, five sisters and himself. Sometimes Hassan himself lent a hand.        
	According to army sources, a private contractor collects the scrap after every firing exercise. However, some shells fail to explode and get buried in the soil, which are later collected by rag-pickers from the slum who dont realise they are live ammunition.        
	Ammunition often fails to activate at the point of contact. The unspent artillery may escape inspection, Brigadier S.K. Chatterjee said.        
	Thousands of munitions are fired for training purposes and the army isnt casual about these things. Every bit of ammunition is accounted for. But like everything else in this country, ammunition too gets recycled. The casing brings good money, so the scrap collectors look out specially for them.        
	Residents of the neighbourhood told the police that the slums rag-pickers had been carrying on this risky business for a long time. We will look into the allegations and take precautionary measures to avoid a repeat, IGP Singh said.        
	We have ordered a probe into how live army mortar shells reached the garbage dump, additional director-general of police Brij Lal said in Lucknow.        
	This isnt the first time that unexploded artillery has found its way into civilian areas. In 2004, a shell had exploded and killed three rag-pickers in Meerut.        
	In 2006, the police had found ammunition dumped on a roadside in the industrial town of Faridabad, Uttar Pradesh.

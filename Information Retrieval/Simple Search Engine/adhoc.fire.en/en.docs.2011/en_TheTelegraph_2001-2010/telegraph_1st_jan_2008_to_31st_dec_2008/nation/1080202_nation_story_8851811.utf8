     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Feb. 1: Ten scheduled caste men from Jehanabad, who were being forced to slave as bonded labours at Sonepat, Haryana, for two months, were rescued on Friday evening.
    
	Three workers, who had managed to escape from confinement at a brick kiln under Purkhas police station of Sonepat, reached Jehanabad on January 30 and apprised the matter to the Jehanabad district administration. Gorakh Mochi, Dipal Manjhi and Bindeshwar Manjhi, all residents of Bigha village under Madanganj block, narrated their harrowing tale to Jehanabad district magistrate Sanjay Agrawal.
    
	The trio told Agrawal that 13 of them, 12 belonging to the mushahar caste and the last of cobbler caste, had gone to Sonepat three months ago in search of employment. There, one Jaipal Singh engaged them at a brick kiln. Once they started working, they were made to slave 14-16 hours, paid meagre and not allowed to quit the job.
    
	Agrawal, who took up the matter with the Sonepat district commissioner and the superintendent of police, said: The 10 workers were rescued during a raid this evening. The kiln owner was forced to pay up their wages. But no formal case was lodged against him. The local police are escorting the labourers to New Delhi by train from where they would take another train to Bihar.
    
	Agrawal told The Telegraph: It seemed to be a case of forced labour rather than illegal confinement. 
    
	What the trio narrated to me implied that they had taken up the jobs at will, but were being forced to work afterwards.

	New Delhi, May 28: The Supreme Court has upheld a life term awarded by a Tada court to a Punjab militant for killing a colleague who had broken ranks to give up violence, reports our legal correspondent.        
	The accused, Dilbagh Singh alias Bagha, shot Jagmail Singh as he was returning home with his father, 65, and brother on May 9, 1992. Jagmail was armed at the time  the weapons given to him by the government for protection against attacks by former colleagues  but couldnt retaliate as he was caught off guard.        
	As Jagmail lay injured, one of Dilbaghs associates snatched his 7.62-bore rifle and shot him from close range.         
	On a complaint filed by Jagmails brother, who was also injured along with their father, Dilbagh was arrested on July 17, 1999, and tried in the Tada court at the Nabha jail. The life sentence was given on February 26, 2007, along with smaller terms under Tada and the IPC. Today, the apex court upheld the order.        
	The prosecution had argued Dilbagh was angry with Jagmail because he had given up his militant ways and married.        
	Jasbir Singh and Bawa Singh, who had carried out the attack on Jagmail with Dilbagh, were killed in a police encounter.

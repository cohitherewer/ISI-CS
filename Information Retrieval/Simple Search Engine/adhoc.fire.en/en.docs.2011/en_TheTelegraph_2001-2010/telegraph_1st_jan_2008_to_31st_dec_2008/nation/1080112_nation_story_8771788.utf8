	New Delhi, Jan. 11: India expects that a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency will be concluded next week during the final round of talks in Vienna, after which it will seek a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
    
	The government expects to conclude the agreement even though the UPA-Left panel is supposed to vet the draft before it is signed. Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon today said that after the conclusion of the agreement, India would make a diplomatic push to rally support from among the 45 member countries of the NSG. 
    
	There have been three rounds of talks (with the IAEA) and (there will be) another in mid-January where we hope to wrap it up, Menon said. 
    
	India will expect its friends to stand up and be counted when the proposal for the India-specific waiver comes up in the NSG. The US is expected to take the initiative in getting the waiver through. 
    
	Asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would bring up the issue in his talks during his visit to China beginning on Sunday, the foreign secretary said India was not specifically seeking a commitment from Beijing right now for its help in seeing the 123 Agreement with the US through the NSG. China is a member of the NSG. 
    
	This was because the time was not yet ripe for that. Only after the safeguards agreement with the IAEA is concluded , the diplomatic push for a waiver from the NSG will be made. The next round of talks between the Indian negotiators and the IAEA is likely on January 16. 
    
	Menon said India and China had engaged in nuclear commerce to a limited extent in the past. We have worked together in the past. China, at one stage, supplied low-enriched uranium for Tarapur. We will certainly raise the subject (of nuclear commerce) again, he said. 
    
	Despite the optimism in the government, the implementation of the India-US nuclear deal is still in doubt. There have been hitches in the talks with the IAEA for the safeguards agreement itself. 
    
	The toughest part of the negotiations in Vienna is likely to involve Article 5.6(c) that provides for India to take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies. 
    
	Section 5.6(c) specifies that India will place its civilian nuclear facilities under India-specific safeguards in perpetuity and negotiate an appropriate safeguards agreement towards this end with the IAEA. 
    
	However, it is still unclear what corrective measures India has outlined to the IAEA. One option for India would be to pull the reactor out of safeguards and provide it with domestic fuel. However, this could be interpreted by IAEA board members as an escape route that India would have out of safeguards in perpetuity. 
    
	India could in principle seek fuel guarantees during the safeguards negotiations, but the IAEA has no provision yet to guarantee nuclear fuel. 
    
	But the IAEA has received proposals that it should maintain a nuclear fuel bank. Last year, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an international organisation governed by a board of governors from 10 countries  including India  announced that it would contribute $50 million to the IAEA to create a stockpile to support countries which choose not to build an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle.

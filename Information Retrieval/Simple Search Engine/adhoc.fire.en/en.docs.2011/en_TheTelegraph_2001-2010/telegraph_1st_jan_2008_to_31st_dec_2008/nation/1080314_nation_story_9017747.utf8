The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MPs for vitamin shield in milk
                                                                                                               MPs for vitamin shield in milk
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 13: MPs cutting across parties are lobbying for a law to force dairies and companies to add Vitamin A to the milk they sell.        
	At least 15 MPs have agreed to back the initiative, aimed at reducing malnutrition among women and children. Milk, when processed, loses most of its Vitamin A, which helps eyesight and overall growth.        
	Announcing the initiative today, Lok Sabha MP Sachin Pilot said milk industry representatives had expressed support. But it would be naive to think that companies will add Vitamin A on their own. The law is essential.        
	The initiative is backed by the UN-recognised Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (Gain), which is working to curb malnutrition in the developing world.        
	Pilot has moved a private members bill in the Lok Sabha to try and get the law enacted. Fellow Congress MP Mabel Rebello has moved a similar Bill in the Rajya Sabha. The MPs and Gain want the companies to add a supplement that provides 2,000 units of Vitamin A in every litre of milk.        
	Fresh (unprocessed) milk contains 1,300 to 1,800 units of Vitamin A a litre. But most of the vitamin, soluble in fat, gets removed when fat is eliminated during processing.        
	The toned milk we consume has hardly 650 units of Vitamin A per litre, said R. Sankar, senior manager and South Asia regional representative of Gain.        
	The initiative aims to provide more Vitamin A than milk contains naturally. We are looking at making milk a medium to supply Vitamin A to meet the bodys total dietary needs, and not just at replenishing the amount lost in processing, Sankar said.        
	Cooperatives like Amul do already add the supplement to some of their products. Mother Dairy adds it to the milk it provides through vending machines, but not to its milk pouches.        
	Leaving it to the discretion of the companies puts those that add the supplement at an economic disadvantage. Although the government subsidises these companies, the reimbursement is inadequate, Sankar said.        
	Pilot said health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had shown a positive response. Private members bills are placed in a ballot and randomly selected. We hope it will come up this session, Pilot said.

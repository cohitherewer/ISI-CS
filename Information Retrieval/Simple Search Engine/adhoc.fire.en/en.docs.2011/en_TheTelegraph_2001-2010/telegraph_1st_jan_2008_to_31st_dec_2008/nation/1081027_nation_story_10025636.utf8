              Sunshine option: solar rickshaws    
	Everything under the sun is being explored to keep Delhi green. And, almost literally so, eyes are on solar rickshaws.    
	The Delhi government has decided to usher in green rickshaws in the walled city, or old Delhi as it is often referred to by locals. This is also the area where the battery-operated buses introduced last year were a success.    
	The 210kg rickshaws can run as fast as 20kmph, according to a senior official. The Union science and technology ministry had presented the rickshaws before chief minister Sheila Dikshit and explained to her its advantages. Impressed, the chief minister said the battery rickshaws would go a long way in phasing out the ones pulled manually.    
	Civic authorities had shut out ordinary rickshaws in the area two years ago to free choked roads but the ban proved to be ineffective.    
	A solar panel is being set up near the Chandni Chowk Metro station to charge the rickshaw batteries, a process that experts say should take around five hours.                  
	Shadow on Besant landmark    
	A legal tug-of-war is on over an Annie Besant landmark.    
	Madras High Court recently dismissed a petition seeking a stay on the demolition of Besant Memorial Building, popularly known as Gokhale Hall.     
	The building was constructed in 1914 by the freedom fighter for the welfare of youths.     
	A life member of the Young Mens Indian Association, founded by Besant, filed the plea, saying the forums secretary planned the demolition despite opposition from life members. The high court asked the petitioner to approach a lower court.     
	The building is still strong and needs some repairs, the petitioner says, as its European-style dome has been made with ancient stones.     
	The building, which once had a gymnasium, lecture hall and a library, is now used for cultural activities and freedom fighters conferences. (PTI)              
	Land for party hub    
	A piece of prime plot in Hyderabad valued at Rs 87 crore has gone for Rs 20 lakh to build a Congress hub that will teach how to implement Mahatma Gandhis ideals.    
	The 10 acres in the Bollaram area have been allotted to the Andhra Congress for a national-level training institute for party workers and future leaders. The Hyderabad collector had computed the value of the plot.    
	The Congress regime headed by Y.S.R. Reddy ignored the suggestion of the chief commissioner of land administration that the land was too valuable to be given on an acreage basis.     
	The government has claimed the proposed institute will run activities for the uplift of weaker sections. The allotment has been made in favour of the state Congress chief on payment of a nominal value of Rs 2 lakh an acre.    
	Ironically, Congress sympathisers had refused to vacate a plot near the party headquarters in Nampally for the institute, prompting former state chief Keshava Rao to ask the government in March 2005 for land.                
	Hospital boost    
	One of the countrys prominent mental health institutes has been expanded to offer more emergency services.    
	The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, which draws many patients from Bengal, now has three more blocks for emergency services, open psychiatry and neurological rehabilitation.     
	The state-of-the-art emergency block, inaugurated recently, is equipped with a 20-bed ICU, operation theatres, general wards and other facilities. The Rs 15-crore facility will help provide integrated services. (PTI)

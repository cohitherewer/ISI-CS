	Mumbai, July 14 (PTI): Bombay High Court today said that members of private clubs and gymkhanas could not be denied card room facilities because these were not public places.        
	A division bench of Justices R.M.S. Khanderparker and Amjad Sayed said: Once it is established that private clubs and gymkhanas are not public places, it is the right of the club members to have access to card rooms.        
	The order was passed on a petition filed by the citys top clubs and gymkhanas challenging an order passed by Mumbai police commissioner Hasam Gafoor. According to notices issued by Gafoor on, clubs and gymkhanas had to obtain a licence to provide the card room facility to members.

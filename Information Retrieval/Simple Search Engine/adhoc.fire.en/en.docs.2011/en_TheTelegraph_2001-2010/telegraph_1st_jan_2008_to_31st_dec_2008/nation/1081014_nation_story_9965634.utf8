  - Mobile captures mahouts with machetes           JOHN MARY                          The elephant, Avoor Kannan, in Chepad, Kerala                                        
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 13: A three-year-old temple tusker was tortured for over a week by its keepers apparently angry that it had lashed its trunk at a new mahout.        
	Images of Avoor Kannan, with cuts and bruises caused by weapons, appeared on TV, prompting forest minister Benoy Viswom to seek a report from the state wildlife warden.        
	Locals had heard the tusker of Sree Krishna temple at Chepad, around 105km from Kochi, wail during the daily flogging sessions in the backyard of the shrine. Many had hoped the temple administration would intervene.        
	When the beatings continued for several days, two youths decided to record the cruelty and make it public. Yesterday afternoon, the duo captured on their mobiles the mahout and his deputy taking turns to clobber the elephant, its legs chained to two coconut trees. One of them landed machete blows on its right leg.        
	Sadly, the men, supposed to care for it, were seen venting their fury on the defenceless animal, said one of the youths.        
	The mahout had told some of the local people who had protested the torture that the beatings were part of the disciplining regimen. Not convinced, the youths asked the manager of the temple to intervene. A police sub-inspector arrived but left after admonishing the mahout. The temple is governed by the Travancore Devaswom Board, which oversees shrines in south Kerala.        
	Experts said such savage methods were primitive.         
	A few years back, a rogue tusker caught at the Peppara forest range near the state capital died of internal bleeding after being caged and put through disciplining sessions. Modern taming methods use tranquillisers and minimal force.        
	Kerala has of late witnessed an increase in incidents of elephants running amok, sometimes leading to human casualties. Some of the aberrations have been blamed on gruelling sessions and lack of rest for the animals.        
	Poet Sugahtha Kumari said the government had drawn up guidelines to protect elephants but it wasnt clear if the norms were being applied. This incident stokes our fears.

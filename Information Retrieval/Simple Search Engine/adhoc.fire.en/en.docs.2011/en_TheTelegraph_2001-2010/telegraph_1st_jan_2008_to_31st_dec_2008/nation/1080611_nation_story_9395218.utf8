	Monsoons here, so are wet woes     
	The monsoon officially rolled into Mumbai last weekend, a few days earlier than usual, bringing with it the dreaded waterlogged roads, cave-in deaths and stalled trains.    
	But what poured cold water on the civic authorities claims of preparedness was the sight of leaking roofs and brimming buckets under those spots in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation offices.    
	Roads became impassable rivers, and pedestrians waders. Some flights were diverted to other cities, many more were delayed.     
	A senior BMC official described the leakages as minor but cheerfully pointed out that they were still working.    
	But few were ready to share his optimism. The common refrain was that if the BMC couldnt keep its own house in order, it could hardly keep Mumbai afloat.    
	There were some, though, who relished the wet spell after weeks of intense heat. Children splashed and squealed in puddles. Couples took strolls in the drizzle. Hundreds crowded onto promenades on Marine Drive to watch a stormy Arabian Sea. A few others savoured an unofficial holiday because of the disruptions. (PTI)        
	Tube thrills for Gurgaon    
	Those in Gurgaon, the IT boomtown outside the capital, can hope to glide across to Delhi with the Haryana government deciding to release cash for the Metro extension.    
	The state government will pay Rs 71 crore for the project this year. Its total annual share works out to Rs 141.75 crore. The project is expected to be completed by January 2010.    
	The decision to hand the cash was taken last week at a meeting of the high-powered committee constituted to monitor major infrastructure projects in Haryana. Chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda heads this panel.    
	Plans to extend the Metro to Delhi airport from Connaught Place, in the heart of the city, have already been cleared. The link to Gurgaon will start from the airport. (PTI)    
	Stray terror in Chalukya hub    
	Dogs in Rajahmundry, Andhras cultural capital on the banks of the Godavari, have set off fears of a rabies epidemic.    
	Such is the menace of the unruly pack that nearly 10,000 to 15,000 cases of dog bites have been reported from East Godavari district, of which Rajahmundry is a part, every year.    
	It is estimated that the stray population in the town, which was the seat of power for the 11th-century Chalukyas, could be 11,000. Pet dogs could number 10,000.    
	Fed up with the lack of action, Congress councillors recently laid siege to the municipal corporation office and obtained a written assurance from the commissioner that the bite-happy pack would be tamed soon.    
	In fact, the civic body had begun a crackdown but was forced to backtrack after Blue Cross, an animal rights NGO, secured a stay from the high court on their elimination.    
	ut even when it wants to, the civic body cant do much: it has only one health officer to tackle dog bites, monkey menace, mosquito stings and other such hazards.        
	Airport honours    
	Bangalores new airport will have a formal inauguration, having already been opened to the public on May 24.    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has accepted the state governments invitation to do the honours. Chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa had put the request when he met Singh during his recent visit to the capital.     
	Yeddyurappa also urged the Centre to sanction more funds to improve Bangalores infrastructure, which is bursting at the seams under the weight of its rising traffic. (PTI)

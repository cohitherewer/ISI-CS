	Mumbai, Nov. 24: Omprakash Shukla can see the pirates cruel faces every time he closes his eyes, and clearly remembers the worst moment of his two-month ordeal.        
	As usual, all 22 crew members of the Stolt Valor were spending the day crammed in the ships 30ftx40ft bridge, allowed to the toilet only in twos together, guarded by Kalashnikov and machine gun-toting hijackers. Suddenly, ship captain Prabhat Goyal was summoned below.        
	They threatened him by firing bullets around him. We were all very shaken and cried like children, the cargo loader and pumpman told reporters today.        
	But there was no physical torture, he added. It was only a well-planned psychological torture.        
	Five of the ships 18 Indians flew into Mumbai airport at 5am today after the Somali pirates freed the entire crew on November 16, allegedly against a ransom. The remaining 13 are attending a dinner hosted by the Indian ambassador to Oman and are expected back tomorrow.        
	Shukla, from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, Naved Borundkar of Murud in Maharashtra, Santosh Patil of Mumbai, and Isidore Fernandes and Alistair Fernandes of Goa addressed a news conference after their arrival from Muscat.

	The parents of Naved, 20, had come from their seaside hometown, 250km from here, to receive their son. The cadet, on his maiden trip aboard the Stolt Valor when it was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden on September 15, couldnt wait to go home.        
	But Shukla, 38, is too traumatised to face his loved ones.        
	I am not yet going home, though my family is keen that I return immediately. I need some space, some time to get over this. My life seems so unhinged... I dont know who I am talking to and what I am saying, he said, looking dazed.        
	None of us can forget the terror and the trauma. It haunts us all the time. They were a pack of cruel animals. Every time I close my eyes, I see their faces.        
	He will spend a week with his uncle in Kalyan on Mumbais outskirts before heading home to his wife, four children and parents.        
	Shukla said he had been on the deck, making minor pump repairs, when the pirates arrived in a flash, put up a ladder and climbed on the deck.        
	It happened in minutes. First they fired an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) towards our ship but it fell about 10 to 15 metres short. Then they boarded. No one could understand what was going on. They were carrying automatic weapons, RPGs and sten guns, Shukla said.        
	There were about 30-35 of them. None spoke English. They had a negotiator  a man named Ahmed  through whom they spoke. They put us all up on the bridge and made us sit together. The last two-three days, we had to go without food.        
	The bridge is a room from which the ship can be commanded. When a ship is travelling, the captain or a senior officer is on the bridge at all times to maintain command and control.        
	Naveds father, Mohammed Borundkar, 47, said: I want to thank everybody  Allah the all-merciful, the government, the media, the sailor recruiting agency Ebony. We did not celebrate Id this year. Even our Hindu neighbours cut down on Diwali festivities. I am overwhelmed. This country needs to stay like this.        
	Naved said he was still keen to sail. Pirates are terrorists  they are everywhere in the world. Do we get scared and sit at home because of them?

	Patna, Oct. 16: A woman ran from pillar to post to get four rail policemen who had allegedly robbed her in June booked for a crime they were tasked to prevent.        
	Prashanto Devi had allegedly been threatened by the four gun-toting policemen, on duty to ensure safety of passengers, and asked to hand over the jewellery she was wearing, Rs 2,000 and other items while she was travelling home alone to Gaya from Patnas Mokameh in a local on June 2.        
	The value of the looted items is being put at Rs 70,000- 80,000, much of it being the price of the jewellery.        
	Today, the 45-year-olds persistence seemed to have paid off  the four have been suspended and cases lodged against them.        
	We have suspended the four constables and asked the police in Mokameh (where the crime was said to have occurred) to go ahead with the investigation, said superintendent of government railway police (Patna) D.N. Gupta, who took up the matter after Prashanto met him last month.        
	The woman went to lodge a complaint at Mokameh station just after the alleged robbery but was turned away by the policemen, who probably shied away from registering an incident that involved some of their colleagues.        
	When she got back home, she approached the police in Gaya, only to be told the complaint would have to be made in Mokameh since the incident had occurred there.         
	Not tired of being turned away, Prashanto met Gupta, who gave her the attention being denied all along. I immediately listened to her and began my investigation against the cops on duty that day. After I found truth in her accusations, I suspended the four, he said, adding Mokameh police then registered the case.        
	Suspecting that more passengers were being harassed and looted like Prashanto, superintendent Gupta launched a drive over the past three weeks.         
	His apprehensions proved true: 16 policemen were found misbehaving with passengers or looting them. These personnel, escorting trains on the Mokameh-Gaya and Koderma sections of the East Central Railway, have already been suspended and are being booked for the crimes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 800 militants   wait at border
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           800 militants   wait at border
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Nearly 800 trained militants are waiting to cross into India from across the border, taking advantage of the communal tension in Jammu and Kashmir and the fluid political situation.        
	In a report to the home ministry, intelligence agencies have said the Inter-Services Intelligence was keen to push in the militants at the earliest to stoke the passions over the Amarnath land row in Jammu and Srinagar.        
	Home ministry sources said the information was based on intercepts by the BSFs intelligence wing. As a follow-up, the wire fencing in border areas is being strengthened and the number of personnel guarding it increased.        
	A senior official said the report indicated that political parties were playing a dirty role in instigating protesters in Jammu and Srinagar.        
	In Jammu, the protesters are largely Hindus who have taken to the streets against the cancellation of land allotment to the Amarnath shrine board. In Srinagar, people are protesting the inability of the authorities to contain the Jammu situation as supplies to the Valley are being hit.         
	The BJP, Congress, PDP and even separatists like Yasin Malik and Hurriyat leaders have a vested interest in keeping the state on the boil. The report also said the new governor does not enjoy the confidence of the people, the home ministry official said.        
	With state elections due in October, the home ministry is monitoring the situation. On August 11, the Election Commission will decide if polls can be held on time in a meeting with home secretary Madhukar Gupta.        
	As of now, this seems a remote possibility. The report has indicated free and fair conduct of elections does not appear to be possible. Last-minute verifications need to be made in the electoral rolls and the situation is not conducive, the official said.

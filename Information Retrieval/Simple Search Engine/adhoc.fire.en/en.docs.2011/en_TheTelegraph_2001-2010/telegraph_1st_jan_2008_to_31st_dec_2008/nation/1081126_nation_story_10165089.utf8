          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Air India, Kingfisher and Jet Airways have scrapped a ticket transaction fee that was introduced last month to offset the loss of commission for travel agents.        
	The axing of the fee will help domestic passengers save Rs 350, and first class fliers on international routes as much as Rs 10,000.        
	The fee, which replaced the travel agents commission, has been dropped as the ticket sellers demanded that the 5 per cent commission be restored. But the airlines have not revived the commission, throwing a direct challenge to the agents.        
	The transaction fee was graded from Rs 350 for economy domestic fares to Rs 10,000 for first-class international fares. The fee applied to tickets purchased on the Net, too.        
	Soon after announcing the burial of the transaction fee, an airline executive said travel agents were trying to blackmail us because they used to sell 70 per cent of the tickets. However, if there is a price difference between tickets sold by us and the agents, passengers will buy directly from us.        
	Aviation sources said the remaining 30 per cent was divided between direct counter sales and Net ticketing. The sources expressed the hope that Internet-based ticket sales would keep rising, especially in the absence of the transaction fee.        
	But travel agents are livid. It is most unfair of airlines to have done this. The agents will now have to charge some kind of service fee. We will meet over the weekend to discuss our strategy, said Pradeep Lulla, the president of the Travel Agents Federation of India.         
	Officials said Air India was also planning to reduce fares by 12 per cent in line with the reduction in jet fuel rates. The cut is likely to be implemented by mid-December.        
	The price of jet fuel has come down to Rs 39,767 per kilolitre compared with Rs 41,417 last November.        
	 The government has demanded that airlines cut fares. However, most airlines, which are likely to end the financial year with combined losses of more than Rs 8,000 crore, do not wish to comply.         
	The state-run Air India has little choice as both finance minister P. Chidambaram and civil aviation minister Praful Patel have thrown their weight behind the price-cut campaign.        
	Some travel agents felt that the airlines had used the excuse of the governments call to cut fares to scrap the transaction fee.        
	The airlines can now claim that they have responded to the ministers appeal and made flights cheaper for passengers, an agent said.

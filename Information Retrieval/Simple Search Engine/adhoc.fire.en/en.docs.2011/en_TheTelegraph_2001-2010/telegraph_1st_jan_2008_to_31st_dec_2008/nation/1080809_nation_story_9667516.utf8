	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Extreme rainstorms, an anticipated impact of global warming, appear to be striking harder with greater frequency than what computer simulations of climate change have predicted, says a new study.         
	Virtually all simulations of future climate have predicted that extreme rain events will become more common on a warmer planet. Now, the study by British and US researchers suggests that the changes have been underestimated.         
	Atmospheric scientists Richard Allan at the University of Reading in the UK and Brian Soden at the University of Miami, Florida, compared satellite observations of actual rainfall in tropical regions with climate simulations between 1988 and 2004.         
	Their study, to appear in the journal Science today, establishes a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing in warm years and decreasing during relatively cooler years.         
	Qualitatively, the observations and models (simulations) both show increases in extreme rain events, said Allan. But quantitatively the models appear to be underestimating the increase, he told The Telegraph.         
	The researchers found that the frequency of the heaviest rainfall events was three times higher than what the simulations had predicted. The differences may be related to deficiencies in the satellite observations or in the models, Allan said.         
	A warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts intensity of heavy downpours, co-author Soden said. Extreme rain events are a major source of concern because of their potential to cause rapid flooding and their likely impacts on crops and cities. One example of such an event was the unprecedented rainstorm in northern Mumbai on July 26 2005.         
	Scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, who analysed rainfall patterns in India over the past 50 years had also reported  two years ago  a significant rise in the frequency and the magnitude of extreme rain events. Their study, published in Science in December 2006, had warned of a larger increase in disaster potential in India.         
	The Indian study was based on weather data between 1951 and 2000. Heavy rain events have increased steadily each decade, said M. Sukumaranair Madhusoodanan, a co-author of the IISc study now at the Nansen Environmental Research Centre, Cochin. The frequency of extreme rain events has nearly doubled, he said.

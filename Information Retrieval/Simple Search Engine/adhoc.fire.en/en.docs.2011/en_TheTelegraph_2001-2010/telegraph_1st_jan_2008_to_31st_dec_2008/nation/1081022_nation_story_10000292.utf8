          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 21: The Election Commission has sought a detailed report from the Chhattisgarh government regarding security arrangement in Maoist-hit pockets for conducting free and fair election.        
	The action came against the backdrop of the Maoist attack on CRPF jawans in Bijapur yesterday that left 12 security personnel dead and six others seriously injured. The jawans were patrolling the area as part of a security drill going on in the rebel-hit Bastar region for conducting smooth election.         
	The commission has taken a serious note on the incident as it happened on the day when the first phase of election process started with the filing of nomination papers yesterday, a senior police officer said.         
	The state government is preparing the report with reference to yesterdays incident and would send it soon to the commission, he added.         
	Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami, along with other members of the panel, is arriving here on October 24 to review the preparation, especially the security arrangements for the two-phase Assembly elections.        
	Sources said the police headquarters had made an action plan that would be presented before the commission officials for conducting peaceful election in the Maoist-hit areas.         
	For security reasons, the sources did not reveal the details of the plan.         
	Home minister Ram Vichar Netam said that the Maoist attack on the CRPF personnel was an attempt to disturb the process of election, which the rebels have called to boycott.         
	In the last election also, the Maoists tried to disturb the process, Netam said, adding that people had foiled their move and participated in the democratic process as they were aware that the rebels were not on right track.        
	The condition of six jawans, who sustained serious injuries in the attack, was reported to be stable. The officials said the jawans were out of danger.

	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Lal Krishna Advani today said giving veto power to communists was criminalisation of Indias polity.
    
	The BJP leader is known to be a bitter critic of the Left, but has possibly never gone this far before. 
    
	Everybody understands what the communists are. Even the Congress does. Indira Gandhi used them for her own political gains but never gave them veto power. This government has done that. I think it is criminalisation of Indias polity, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister told the partys national council.
    
	He argued that the Left had no constitutional role in this government and that its nationalist credentials were suspect after the support to China in the 1962 war.
    
	Sonia Gandhi was next in the line of fire. Advani said it was unfortunate that 7 Race Course (the Prime Ministers residence) had become a less important address than 10 Janpath (Sonias residence). 
    
	If some parties wish to be guided by foreign-born ideologies and foreign-born leadership, they will certainly realise the limitations of doing so, he said, attacking both the Left and the Congress. 
    
	If Advanis attack was no-holds-barred, so was his praise  of Narendra Modi. He described the Gujarat chief minister, whose administration has been accused of complicity in the 2002 riots, as secular.
    
	If a son gets fame and power, the family has reasons to be happy. Why should it be a cause for worry? he said. Modi is seen by many as bigger than the party and a threat to its central leadership. 
    
	The BJPs political resolution had given him the peg for his speech. The Prime Minister is not a factor in the countrys politics. The extra-constitutional centres of power dictate and determine the governments decisions, it said, leaving Advani to identify them.

	Washington, Sept. 10: Defence minister A.K. Antony, whose famously frugal lifestyle includes an abhorrence of shopping sprees while travelling abroad, has been different during his trip to Washington.        
	Antonys usually light baggage will be symbolically heavy when he returns home tomorrow: he is carrying with him a delivery order for 20 US-made AGM-84L Harpoon Block II missiles, another four ATM exercise variety of the same missile brand, containers, training devices, spare and repair parts and a host of support equipment for Indias defence forces.         
	Hours after US defence secretary Robert Gates  for the first time since he succeeded Donald Rumsfeld in 2006  received Antony with a full ceremonial guard of honour yesterday, the Pentagon announced that it was selling India the Harpoon missiles in a deal worth $170 million.        
	The missile purchase has been hanging fire for almost two years: conclusion of the deal was delayed largely because of procedural red tape in the US but also some squeamishness in the Manmohan Singh government on account of political sensitivities.        
	India plans to use the missiles to modernise its air forces anti-surface warfare mission capabilities and to streamline its navys operational ability with the US in the light of cooperation by the two navies in the Indian Ocean region.        
	The Pentagon yesterday described India for the first time as an important partner and linked the sale to the national security of the US in the context of the US-India strategic relationship.        
	The US Congress was yesterday notified of the agreement to sell the missiles. Antonys talks with Gates focussed primarily on the regional security situation, especially Afghanistan. At separate meetings, the director-general for acquisitions in the ministry of defence, S.K. Sharma, accompanying the minister, fielded a spate of anxious enquiries from the Americans who are keen to get the Indian order for 126 multi-role combat aircraft.        
	Antonys visit to the US has been in the works since he met Gates in Singapore in June last on his first visit abroad after becoming defence minister. But the trip was held off after the Left parties took issue with the Prime Minister over relations with the US. The impressive Pentagon ceremonies at its imposing River Parade Field provided an appropriate backdrop for a day when political activity in Washington appeared to revolve around Indo-US relations, which have been revived from intensive care following the NSG exemption for nuclear commerce with India on September 6.         
	In an indication of how important India has become on Americas radar, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, yesterday abruptly left a press conference here on energy  a critical issue for her Democratic Party in the November election  saying: I have to excuse myself as I have to meet the secretary of state. I think the subject is India... but I am sure my colleagues here will be pleased to answer any questions.        
	Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Pelosi discussed the strategy for a quick Congressional passage of the 123 Agreement required to operationalise the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	A day earlier, Rice met Howard Berman, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who set off a political storm in India on the eve of the NSG meeting by releasing details of secret correspondence between the committee and the US state department on the deal. Rice also tracked down the Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden on his campaign trail and discussed with him the modalities of handling the deal in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which Biden is the chairman. There is an air of expectation here that the nuclear deal package will be submitted by the White House to the US Congress in 24 to 48 hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muslim support, with a warning
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Muslim support, with a warning
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Bangalore, May 8: At a meeting with Muslim scholars and opinion-makers here on Tuesday, Congress leaders were asked a pointed question or two.        
	For instance, why was the party manifesto vague about its pledge to implement the Sachar report in letter and spirit?        
	What does this mean in tangible terms? Maharashtra has sanctioned Rs 500 crore for the reports implementation. Karnataka has more Muslims, so we asked for Rs 750 to Rs 1,000 crore, said Agha Sultan, general secretary of the Centre for Community Development, a trust of retired IAS and IFS officers that organised the meeting.        
	This is the last time the Muslims will give the Congress their unqualified support, the meeting warned Prithviraj Chavan, M. Veerappa Moily, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and K. Rahman Khan, the Congresss deputy chairman in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Both Khan and Sultan quote Mani Shankar Aiyarwith approval: The failure of a secular state lies not in the appeasement of Muslims but our failure over six decades to give them their rightful place in nation-building.        
	Aiyars statement touches a raw nerve because most Muslims feel that the parties they have supported  the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular)  have taken them for granted without reciprocating substantively.        
	The immediate provocation is that the Congress has handed just 17 tickets to Muslims, of which one nomination was rejected because of an open scuffle between two rivals in the returning officers presence.        
	Although the mild-mannered Khan has not rebelled like Sharief, who put in his papers after his grandson was denied a ticket and then recanted, he did express his feelings.        
	Theres no improvement. Delimitation has carved out a good number of constituencies where Muslims make up a sizeable number and can tilt the balance. Social engineering is practised for all other castes but Muslims are out of it.        
	He said Muslims made up 12.5 per cent of voters, just 0.5 per cent less than the Vokkaligas (13 per cent), who have got over 50 tickets.        
	Yet, despite the feeling of being left out of the political process and having a negative sense of security (in a Congress regime), as doctor-cum-religious activist Mohamed Taha Mateen put it, most Muslims said they would vote for the Congress. Except, perhaps, in constituencies like Bangalores Chamarajapet where the voters relate to the local do-gooder, Zameer Ahmad of the Janata Dal (Secular).        
	The Muslims believe the May 10 polls will narrow down to a straight, secular-communal fight between the Congress and the BJP in most places.

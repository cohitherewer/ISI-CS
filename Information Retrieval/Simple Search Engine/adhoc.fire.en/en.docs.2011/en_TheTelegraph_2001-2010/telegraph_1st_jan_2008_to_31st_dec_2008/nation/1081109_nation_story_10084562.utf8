          SUJAN DUTTA                          Deepak Kapoor: Iron curtain                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Army headquarters has pulled an iron shroud over itself following the arrest of a serving officer for the first time on charges of terrorism and the chief, General Deepak Kapoor, has asked for reports on the contacts of Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit.         
	The total clampdown on information is not only an indicator that the army is trying to protect its own. It is also the beginning of a counter-intelligence drive that has alerted everyone in the chain of command to mount a surveillance.        
	In the Intelligence Corps, to which the lieutenant colonel belonged, information is shared on a need-to-know basis and the impression that the officer would have much greater access is unfounded, army headquarters sources insist.         
	But even before Maharashtras anti-terrorism squad and the Intelligence Bureau have given their reports to the army, officers in the top hierarchy are squirming over the taint that the charges of religious fundamentalism can mean in their operations.         
	This (the army) is the last resort of the state, said a lieutenant general. But now we are being dragged into a game even before investigations are complete. I wonder if the police have not been indiscreet and waded into political mudslinging.         
	The officer was speaking on condition of anonymity after the Congress and the CPM alleged that RSS-sponsored elements were seeking to saffronise the army. In a statement yesterday, the CPM said Hindutva infiltration in the army had disturbing implications for national security.         
	The only public acknowledgement of the embarrassment in the army so far has come from one of its deputy chiefs, Lt Gen. S.P.S. Dhillon. But like serving and retired officers, he has dismissed it as a freak incident. Earlier, he had admitted: The Indian Armys prestige has been hurt after our officers name came up in the Malegaon blast case.        
	In army headquarters here, officers are annoyed that the ATS is leaking information on possible arrests. They refuse to confirm or deny that two or three more officers, including a major general, is under the scanner.         
	This is not the Pakistani army. We have strong secular traditions, said an officer, referring to the Islamisation of Pakistans military that began in earnest under former President General Zia-ul Haq.         
	It is unfair to say that the complete image of the army is tarnished, said General (retired) V.P. Malik, who was the army chief during the 1999 Kargil war. The army continues to be the most trusted institution in this country and I am sure that it has internal mechanisms and a counter-intelligence system that will have alerted everybody concerned. This matter should not be politicised.         
	The political charges following Purohits arrest worry the army top brass the most because they could affect operations. For example, Muslim officers would be under severe pressure if charges that Hindutva outfits are influencing the officer cadre gain ground.         
	Many of them working in sensitive positions  such as the divisional commander in Baramulla in Kashmirs insurgent Valley  have to man both the border and deal with law and order disturbances.

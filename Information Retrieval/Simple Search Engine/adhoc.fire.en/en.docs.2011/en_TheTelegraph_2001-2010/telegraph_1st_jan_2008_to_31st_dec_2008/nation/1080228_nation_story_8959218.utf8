The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fighter 126 pushed back
                                                                                                               Fighter 126 pushed back
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: India has reworked its original schedule for the 126 even as it is grappling with the deadline for the 123.        
	The defence ministry yesterday wrote to six competitors for the $10.2-billion order for 126 multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA) for the air force that it was deferring the last date for submission of bids by two months.        
	The bids were to be submitted by March 3.        
	The letters to Lockheed Martin and Boeing (US), Dassault Aviation (France), EADS (European Consortium), Gripen (Sweden) and RAC MiG come at a time Delhi is grappling with the deadline for the 123 Agreement  the India-US civilian nuclear deal.        
	The new timeline for the aircraft bids pushes back the whole process further and will require a Herculean effort for the UPA government to take a decision on the largest military order going in the world within the term of the current Parliament.         
	The new deadline for the submission of bids is April 28. Defence ministry sources said the decision was taken following requests from at least two bidders, who were invited to submit proposals, for more time.         
	In contention for the order are the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-18-E/F Superhornet, the Gripen JAS, the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Rafale and the MiG 35. The original deadline for the submission of the reinvestment proposals  or offset offers that require the vendor to plough back 50 per cent of the costs into investment in Indian defence industry  has also been pushed back by two months, from June to August.         
	The decision to rework the timelines was taken to ensure maximum possible competition till the last stage, a senior defence ministry official said.         
	Since it (the acquisition) has a long timeframe, the extension of the deadline by eight weeks will not materially affect the acquisition process. The feedback we have got is that all the competitors are happy with the new schedule, the official claimed.         
	But the same cannot be said of the Indian Air Force that is already concerned about the fall in its squadron strength. The former head of the IAF, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, had written to the government expressing worry that squadron strength level was falling. The drop raised doubts over whether India would be able to maintain its combat edge over the Pakistan Air Force in five years, he had said.         
	India has a poor record in concluding military acquisitions in time for its armed forces. The requirement for the MRCA was projected because the IAF needed to phase out its ageing frontline fighter, the MiG 21, and also because its indigenous Light Combat Aircraft programme had slipped.

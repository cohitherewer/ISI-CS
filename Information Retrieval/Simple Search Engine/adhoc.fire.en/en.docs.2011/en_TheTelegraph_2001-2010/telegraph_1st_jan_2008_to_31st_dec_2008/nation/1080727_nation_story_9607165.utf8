                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yechury on Speaker
                            
	July 26: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today strongly rebutted a report quoting him as saying that the Speakers office was involved in the alleged cash-for-vote scam.         
	This is a complete distortion of what I had said, Yechury told PTI from Bangalore.         
	A PTI report had yesterday quoted Yechury as saying in Tiruchirappalli: I learnt from the media and was directly informed that money was transferred to the MPs through the Speakers office.         
	Yechury had actually said: We understand the tapes on the allurements offered to the MPs have been sent to the Speakers office. The truth should be out and only then will the credibility of the system be restored. Investigations, if any, should be done at the earliest.

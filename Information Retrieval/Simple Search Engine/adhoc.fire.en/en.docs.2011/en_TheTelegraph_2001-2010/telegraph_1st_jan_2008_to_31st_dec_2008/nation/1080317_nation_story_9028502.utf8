                                                                                                               Orissa tells tourists to return
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: The Orissa government today invited back to the state a group of Japanese women who had alleged harassment during a visit to the Konark temple.        
	Tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra said he had spoken to the six tourists and requested them to revisit the temple, a Unesco world heritage site.        
	He promised stern action against guide Madhusudan Patra, whom the women had named in an FIR as the man who harassed them.        
	Patra allegedly forced the women to hire him as their guide during a trip to Konark on March 11.         
	He then demanded extra money although the tourists had bought tickets to see the temple.        
	When the women refused, Patra and some other tour guides allegedly threatened to stop them from entering the temple. The women left without visiting the heritage site, media reports said.        
	The women were part of a group of 40 Japanese visiting India under a programme organised by the India-Japan Friendship Club.

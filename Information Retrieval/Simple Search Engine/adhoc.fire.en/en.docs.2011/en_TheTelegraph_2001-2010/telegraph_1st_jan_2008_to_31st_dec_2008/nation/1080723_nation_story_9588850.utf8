The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sad day for Karat, relief in Bengal 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sad day for Karat, relief in Bengal 
          OUR BUREAU                          Karat                                   
	July 22: Prakash Karat spoke of a sad day for democracy after the trust vote result was out, but his Bengal colleagues didnt sound too sorry at escaping an early election.        
	The CPM general secretary claimed he had evidence, including the date, time and other records of bribe offers to MPs.        
	Attempts have been made in the past 48 hours to win over Opposition MPs, he said but declined to reveal who he thought the bribe givers were. He said that except the Left parties, all the third front allies had been offered money.        
	It is a sad day for parliamentary democracy in India when all norms are sacrificed for a nuclear deal which is against the interest of the country, Karat said. The trust vote has been accompanied by reports of bribery, intimidation and horse-trading.        
	The Bengal CPM, which had rallied behind Karat at the last central committee meeting, seemed relieved at having avoided an election so soon after the panchayat and civic poll setbacks. The massive turnout at Mamata Banerjees rally yesterday, attended by Congress heavyweight Somen Mitra, would have increased their worries.        
	Predictably, Left Front chairman Biman Bose didnt demand a general election even as he accused the government of buying votes. Whether well seek fresh polls immediately will depend on a lot of factors, he said.        
	Bose, however, threatened street protests if Delhi tried to shift the Coal India and DVC headquarters from Calcutta or transfer three Bengal districts to Jharkhand  apparently promises the UPA has made to Shibu Soren.

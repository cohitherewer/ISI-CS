          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: The mystery over the death of a 14-year-old domestic help was cracked today with the arrival of the report of the post-mortem conducted on her body.         
	The report has revealed that the murdered teenager  Sarita Kharia of Rourkela  was two months pregnant and died of a fatal fracture and injury on her neck (fractured hyoid bone), as confirmed by deputy superintendent of police Ram Kumar Panda today.         
	Sarita worked in the Civil Township residence of one Haricharan Susari. Haricharans son, Raj Kishore Susari, a lawyer, has been arrested and forwarded to court in this connection.         
	Rajkishore (35) has been sent to judicial custody on charges of rape, murder and atrocities on a tribal girl and employing child labour.         
	Police have registered a case under Sections 302 and 376 of the IPC, Section 3 (XII) of Prevention of SC/ST Atrocity Act and Section 14 (1) of the Child Labour Act against the accused. Evidence gathered during the course of investigation points to the involvement of Rajkishore, Panda added.         
	Required samples taken during the post-mortem would be sent to Calcutta for DNA tests. The accused was also medically examined at Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela yesterday. On March 20, the Susari family rushed the girl to Ispat General Hospital with severe injuries.         
	Three days on, she succumbed to her injuries. Susaris had claimed that Sarita had fainted in the bathroom.         
	Initially, the police had registered a case of unnatural death. Saritas body was sent for the post-mortem only after neighbours suspecting foul play demonstrated in front of the police station and sought an inquiry.         
	The Susaris had reportedly paid Rs 1 lakh to Saritas father as compensation.

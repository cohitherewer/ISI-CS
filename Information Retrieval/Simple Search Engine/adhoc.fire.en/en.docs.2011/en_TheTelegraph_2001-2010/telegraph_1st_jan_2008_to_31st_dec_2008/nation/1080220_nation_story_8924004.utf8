The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paddy price hike looms
                                                                                                               Paddy price hike looms

	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Centre is considering a record hike in the price of paddy it buys from farmers.        
	The plan is to fix the rate at Rs 10 a kg for common paddy and Rs 10.50 for the grade A premium variety. The current prices are in the range of Rs 8 to Rs 8.50 per kg.        
	The nudge for an increase has come from the 30 per cent increase, unusual in the grain market, in prices over the past year, forcing the government to ban rice exports.         
	Prices have soared because the demand for rice is rising a few million tonnes each year while production has been stagnant at 91-92 million tonnes over the past three years.        
	Parimal rice, the most common variety, now sells for Rs 13.80 a kg in the wholesale market. Last month, it was dearer at Rs 14.50. A year ago, it sold for Rs 9.         
	If the rate paid to farmers is increased as steeply as planned, rice will almost fetch them as much as wheat, which has enjoyed much bigger hikes in the recent past.

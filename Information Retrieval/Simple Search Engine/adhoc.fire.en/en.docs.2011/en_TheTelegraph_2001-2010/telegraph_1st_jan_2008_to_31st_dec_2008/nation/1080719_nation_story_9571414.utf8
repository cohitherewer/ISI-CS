          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 18: The CPMs weekend central committee meeting will finalise the partys anti-nuclear deal arguments, especially with an eye on the Muslim vote, but is expected to play safe on the Speaker controversy.        
	The CPM plans to hawk its anti-deal and anti-America line in minority-dominated areas but has to back it up with a convincing explanation of why it is being compelled to vote with the BJP against the government.        
	The two-day central committee meeting, which begins here tomorrow, will fine-tune the chain of explanations and justifications the party will be mouthing till the next Lok Sabha elections.        
	However, sources said the CPM was unlikely to act on the controversy involving Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who has so far resisted pressure to resign and vote against the government, till the July 22 trust vote was over.        
	The party is believed to have been weighing the option of denouncing Chatterjee on the ground that the controversy involving him was deflecting attention from the core issue of the CPMs battle against the governments anti-people moves.        
	The party line has been conveyed to the Speaker and at the same time, the general secretary (Prakash Karat) has said that the Speaker would decide for himself. The post of Speaker is a constitutional one, politburo member and Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said after a meeting with Karat.        
	The CPM is getting its campaign material printed in Urdu and readying posters showing both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush. The Delhi state committee of the party will hold a programme at Urdu Bazar, near Jama Masjid, on Sunday to explain the political situation and the CPMs compulsions.

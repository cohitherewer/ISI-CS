          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The BJP today persuaded Gopinath Munde to withdraw his resignation, placating the general secretary with concessions but also giving him a light rap on the knuckles.        
	The central leadership removed Madhu Chavan as Mumbai unit chief, told Munde the party would fight the next Maharashtra polls under his leadership, and put four of his loyalists into the core committee.        
	But the party, which felt that yielding completely to pressure might encourage state factions to blackmail it, rejected Mundes recommendation on Chavans successor and his demand for the sack to state BJP chief Nitin Gadkari.        
	The BJP, facing rebellions in Bihar and Rajasthan, was keen to send out a signal that the high command hadnt buckled before dissidence.        
	Both L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh pulled up Munde for making a public show of his grievances.        
	Sources said Munde was told to explain why he had shown such indiscretion when he knew how heavily the party had invested in him by making him national general secretary. He was also asked to express regret.        
	After meeting Advani and Rajnath, Munde told reporters he should not have gone to the media with his resignation letter. He revealed that Advani had objected to his triggering a crisis, and said he would maintain party discipline in the future.        
	In a balancing act, the party picked the neutral Gopal Shetty as Mumbai unit chief. Sources had said that Munde wanted Poonam Rao, daughter of his late brother-in-law Pramod Mahajan, in the post.        
	Munde had tried to lend a caste colour to the controversy. Chavan is a Brahmin and the party had recently brought Prakash Javadekar, another Brahmin, to the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra.        
	The party promised Munde, who was feeling sidelined after Mahajans death, an important role in the state. Gadkari himself told reporters: Munde is our leader and we will all work under his guidance.        
	The four Munde loyalists taken into the core committee are Chainsukh Sancheti, Syed Pasha Patel, Eknath Phadse and Panduram Phundkar.        
	Although it was Chavans appointment that triggered Mundes resignation, the stage had been set for a confrontation when the party denied a Rajya Sabha ticket to Mahajans wife Rekha.        
	Sources had said yesterday that the central leadership had worked out a compromise formula in discussions with state leaders such as Bal Apte, Gadkari and Ram Naik.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 24: India is set to launch a drive for universal secondary education, following up on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan that aims to bring primary education to all children.        
	The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan is expected to kick off by the end of the year with the human resource development ministry and the Planning Commission agreeing to sort out differences over funding.        
	Tomorrow, a meeting between the plan panel and the ministry is expected to clear the funds to set up 6,000 model schools  at least one in each district  a promise made by the UPA government under the 11th Five Year Plan.        
	The scheme aims at universal access to secondary education (Classes VI to X) across India by 2015, and universal retention in class  that is, zero dropouts  by 2020.        
	It was Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who had proposed the project, top government sources said. Now HRD minister Arjun Singh has asked his officials to ensure that the scheme is launched before the governments term ends, a source close to the minister said.         
	The plan panel had over the past one year raised several objections to the ministrys funding demands for the scheme, but is now said to have cleared the spending in principle.        
	A commission source, however, said the Montek Singh Ahluwalia-led panel has only struck a compromise, not backed off. Arjuns ministry has, on its part, trimmed its stated fund requirements, a ministry source said.        
	The commission has called tomorrows meeting to finalise a meeting ground with the ministry, which has pushed through seven new IITs this year, and fix the exact funding.        
	Arjun and his officials fear that the gains of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will be lost if the pupils enrolled through that scheme are left to fend for themselves after primary school. So they are keen to start a similar programme at the secondary level without delay.        
	Government figures say that Sarva Shiksha, launched in the year 2000, has led to more than 95 per cent access to primary education by April 2008. This means 19 out of every 20 Indian children today are enrolled at some stage in primary schools.        
	But the same set of figures also reveals that less than 70 per cent of these children go on to finish Class V, the last stage of primary school.        
	India, a signatory to the UNs Education for All by 2015, expects to ensure complete primary school retention by 2012, when Sarva Shiksha is scheduled to wind up.        
	The mid-may meal scheme, earlier restricted to primary schools, has already been extended to secondary schools.

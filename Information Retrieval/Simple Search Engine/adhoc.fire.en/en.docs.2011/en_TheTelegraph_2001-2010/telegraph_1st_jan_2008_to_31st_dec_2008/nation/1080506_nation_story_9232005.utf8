	Bhubaneswar, May 4 (PTI): The prime accused in the Biranchi Das murder case, Sandeep Acharya alias Raja, was arrested in Goa on Monday morning.           
	Raja, accused of masterminding the murder of the coach of child marathon runner Budhia Singh, was arrested on information given by Orissa police. The police will subject Raja to narco-analyis to ensure that he does not falsely implicate important personalities, an officer said.

	Mumbai (PTI): Carter Road in Bandra was on Monday renamed after the late music composer Naushad Ali. The initiative to rename the road, where Rajesh Khanna and Subhash Ghai live, was taken by Congress MP Priya Dutt.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to maintain status quo regarding huge tracts of land that were declared private forests, in a temporary relief to thousands of flat owners.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The law commission has accepted the argument that people seeking anticipatory bail in criminal cases should be exempt from appearing in court.        
	Amendments proposed to the three-decade-old Criminal Procedure Code make court appearance mandatory. But lawyers across the country have vehemently opposed the proposal on the ground that police could misuse it to arrest accused persons on the way to court.         
	The accused could also be arrested on the spot if their bail pleas were rejected, effectively preventing them from appealing to a higher court against the decision, the lawyers argued.        
	Now, the law commission has said the contentious clause in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, should be dispensed with.         
	When the applicant appears in court in compliance with the courts order and is subjected to the courts directions, he may be viewed as in the courts custody and this may render the relief of anticipatory bail infructuous, the commission said in a recent report.        
	The commission has, therefore, recommended deletion of sub-section (1B) of Section 438.         
	The government is expected to accept the recommendation to pave the way for notifying the act.        
	On June 23, 2005, the Centre had put off notifying the amendment and referred it to the commission after lawyers across the country went on strike.         
	The lawyers argued that the proposed changes would affect certain sections that guarantee personal liberty of citizens. Under the current law, an accused can file for bail from wherever he is. But the amendment would have allowed the public prosecutor to ask for the accused to be present in court, making it easy for the police to intercept him.         
	The law panel, backing the position, said the power to arrest should be exercised with caution and circumspection and not in a mechanical manner.         
	(The) mere fact that an anticipatory bail application is rejected is no ground for directing the applicants immediate arrest. There may be cases where an application may be rejected and yet the applicant is not put up for trial as after investigation no material is found against him, it observed.

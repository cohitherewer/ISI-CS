	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 17: Railway minister Lalu Prasad who visited Puri Jagannath Temple with his family today, had a gift for the pilgrim town.
    
	The Union minister announced a sanction of Rs 15 crore for the beautification and renovation of Puri railway station, for what he called the internationally-famed tourist destination. The station would be designed on the pattern of the 12th century Jagannath temple, he said.
    
	He assured that proper attention would be given to backward states such as Orissa for expansion of their railway network. Lalu Prasad said Rs 765 crore had been allocated in the railway budget in the current fiscal for the completion of ongoing projects and laying new lines in Orissa.
    
	Work on 22 projects with a total project cost of Rs 8,526 crore was under progress in the state. He added that Angul-Sukinda line (100km) was under construction at a cost of Rs 344 crore, while Paradip-Haridaspur line (80km) was being laid with an investment of Rs 595 crore. 
    
	Speaker Maheswar Mohanty, who heads a house committee on railway, and transport minister Jaynarayan Mishra met the minister and handed over a memorandum demanding Rs 1,330 crore more for the state in the forthcoming budget.

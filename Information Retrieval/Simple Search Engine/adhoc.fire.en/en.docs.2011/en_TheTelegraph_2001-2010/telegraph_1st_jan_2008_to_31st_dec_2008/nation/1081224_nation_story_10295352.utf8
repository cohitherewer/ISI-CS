  - Railway minister keeps busy with 15 schemes in 28 days          NALIN VERMA                          Busy bee: Lalu Prasad                                        
	Patna, Dec. 23: Lalu Prasad used his wife to rule Bihar by proxy for seven years after the court sent him behind bars in 1997.         
	Now, the railway minister has turned Rabri Devis 10 Circular Road home, behind the 1 Anne Marg residence of the chief minister, into his base to carry out activities that is being described as Lalus journey on wheels to win the coming Bihar polls.         
	Beyond 10am when government secretaries are seen heading towards the CMs house to brief Nitish, Rabri Devis house resembles a railway office with staff accompanying Lalu Prasad almost every morning to move out to the inaugurate one railway project or other.         
	Lalu has shed off the trademark winter uniform of a monkey cap and shawl and habits such as demanding khainee from helpers, while sitting around a bonfire and mouthing earthy abuses on his rivals.         
	Nowadays, Lalu comes out in smart kurta-pyjama and pullover to start the day.         
	The railway minister has laid the foundation of or inaugurated as many as 15 railway projects in Bihar within 28 days.         
	I want to make Bihar the best. We have planned to spend over Rs 65,000 crore to set up railway-related factories, improve and modernise railway services, he has stressed in all meetings.        
	Projects he recently inaugurated include the super structure of Digha-Pahleja Railway Bridge on the Ganga, a Patna-Goa Vasco dGama Express and a Bharat Wagon project at Mokamah.         
	The railway station at Chapra, a seat he represents in Lok Sabha, resembles a state-of-art station in terms of cleanliness and facility.        
	Asked to comment on Lalus increased activities, Nitish Kumar says: People should thank me for making Lalu Prasad talk of development.         
	Do you know why the man who was saying that IT kya hota hai and vikas se vote nahin milta has started talking about development? It is because our government is performing and he (Lalu) has understood that the voters, after 15 years of misrule have experienced rule of law, governance and development.         
	In comparison to Lalu Prasads inauguration spree, Nitish stays busy appearing as the janata ke durbar mein mukhya mantri (chief minister in peoples court) every Monday, doing his work from 9.30am to 6pm in what bureaucrats describe to be a professional manner.

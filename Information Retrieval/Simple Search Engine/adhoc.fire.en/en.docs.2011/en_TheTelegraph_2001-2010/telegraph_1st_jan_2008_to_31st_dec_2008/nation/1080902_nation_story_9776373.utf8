	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Punjab has withdrawn a claim seeking central university status for Panjab University, reports our special correspondent.         
	The move came after a section of the states academia accused it of trying to shun responsibility towards the varsity, the Prime Ministers alma mater.        
	The state government has written to Manmohan Singh and HRD minister Arjun Singh clarifying the withdrawal.        
	The Punjab governments decision to withdraw the claim for Panjab Universitys central status could mean it wants to restart funding. But if it doesnt, the University Grants Commission has the right to pitch for central status to the varsity on behalf of the Centre, an HRD official said.

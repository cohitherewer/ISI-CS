          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Bangladesh couldnt have handed railway minister Lalu Prasad a better gift a day before he presents his budget  a final go-ahead for the Maitreyee Express that will link Calcutta and Dhaka.        
	The pet Bengal project had been caught in a controversy over plans to build a barbed-wire corridor through the patch of no-mans land that falls on the trains route. The minister had promised Left allies a few years ago that he would steer it through.        
	Officials in the railway ministry said they had initially inserted the pledge in Lalu Prasads budget speech but later developed cold feet and took it out.         
	The officials said the passenger train service  replicating the Delhi-Lahore Samjhauta Express  would start in three months, after a gap of nearly four decades. The link was suspended after the 1965 India-Pakistan war.        
	Dhaka has agreed to Delhis proposal to construct a box-type fence along the 150-km stretch of no-mans land to ensure security and check smuggling and illegal migration, the officials said.        
	Bangladesh and India will construct a box-type temporary fencing from zero point along the railway tracks in their respective territories based on a mutually agreed design, a Rail Bhavan official said.         
	The officials said the route, too, had been slightly altered. The Maitreyee Express will now ply between Dhaka Cantonment Station, instead of Joydevpur, and Chitpur in Calcutta, instead of Sealdah.        
	The train, which can ferry 1,500 passengers at a time, will have 14 coaches, including economy-class chair cars, air-conditioned first class and air-conditioned sleeper class. It will also have a power car, a buffet car and a prayer coach.         
	Two sets of trains will ply on the route. One has been built by Indian factories and will be run by the Indian Railways. The other has been imported from Indonesia but was assembled in Bangladesh and will be run by Bangladesh Railways.        
	The train will cover about 500km in 14 hours. It is a non-stop train. Although it is only an eight-hour journey, customs and immigration clearances on both sides will take six hours, an official said.        
	The passenger train will use the same broad-gauge tracks used by goods trains that run between the two countries.        
	Talks are expected soon to finalise security and visa procedures, timings, customs clearance, ticket rates and platform availability.        
	According to a proposal, there will be three categories of fares  of Rs 322, Rs 483 and Rs 805. Dhaka will keep 78 per cent of the revenue as the length of the track in Bangladesh territory is more than that in India.        
	Several X-ray machines, scanners and metal detectors will be set up at the two stations.        
	Delhi imports products worth $400 million from Dhaka and exports products worth about $2 billion, the officials said.

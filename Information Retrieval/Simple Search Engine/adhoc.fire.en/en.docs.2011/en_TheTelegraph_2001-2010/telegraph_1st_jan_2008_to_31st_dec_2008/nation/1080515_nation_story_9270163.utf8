          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 14: Former workers of Orissa Textile Mills (OTM), squatting on a dharna for the past 31 months, have sought judicial intervention to end their crisis.         
	Eighteen former workers have died since the mill closed down and the deaths, the former workers allege, were caused by penury. Some 116 employees are still living in penury, said advocate Guru Prasad Mohanty in a high court petition seeking immediate payment of arrears.         
	The court sources today said the company affairs bench would hear the petition on May 20. The bench has deferred the finalisation of the OTM auction to June 20. The government had referred OTM for liquidation.         
	The PIL also alleges that former OTM workers were driven to suicide to escape hunger that had stalked them since the government winded up the Choudwar mill in June 2001. When the mill closed down, the state had committed to settle dues of the 3,000-odd employees. When the arrears and closure compensation dues were not paid, the staff launched a dharna, on September 1, 2005, spearheaded by OTM Workers and Employees Manch.         
	Around Rs 40 crore would be required to settle the arrears and compensation dues. Besides, retirement benefits and dues under VRS or VSS amounts to Rs 30 crore. During the closure the state had assured that the dues would be settled within 45 days.

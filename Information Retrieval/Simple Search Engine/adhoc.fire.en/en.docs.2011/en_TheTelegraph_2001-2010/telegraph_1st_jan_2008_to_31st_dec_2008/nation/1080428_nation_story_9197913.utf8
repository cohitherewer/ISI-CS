          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, April 27: About 100 Indians are living in fear in their apartment block in Kuwait, sending appeals for help to the Indian mission and the government in Delhi.        
	The 25 families say they have been asked to move out with threats, are being denied drinking water and that their phone lines have been cut and drainage blocked for the past 18 days.        
	Waste from the kitchens and toilets have now flooded their bedrooms and living rooms, says their complaint, faxed to the ministry of overseas Indian affairs four days ago.        
	Human excretions and other waste materials (are) floating around and the children and ladies (have been living) in the middle of this for days, the message adds.        
	The residents say the first threat came on April 7.        
	A Kuwaiti national came to the building and asked us to vacate the flats, where we have been living for the past eight years. He said he had bought the building and asked us to leave fast because he wanted to demolish it and build a new one, Sam George, one of the tenants, told The Telegraph over the phone.        
	Twenty-six expatriate families, including one from Sri Lanka, live in the building  168 Street No. 6, Block-4  in Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh town. They are mostly middle-class families, whose members work for private companies or the Kuwait government, many as health workers.        
	The complaint says they were threatened with all sorts of trouble.        
	The very next day (April 8), at noon, the watchman of the building went to the terrace with some of his friends and poured concrete in the drainpipes of the kitchens and toilets. This caused flooding in some of the flats on the first floor and the ground floor, the faxed message says.        
	Beds, carpets, electrical and electronic items, sofas, childrens books, uniforms, clothing and other valuable belongings were damaged or lost due to the spread of the human excretion and other waste matters.        
	The residents say they complained to local police but they did nothing. The earning members are going out to work but the rest are staying holed up in their flats.        
	We are not getting water we are living in stink, George said, adding that the families were trying to contact the original landlord.        
	Government sources said the minister for overseas Indian affairs, Vayalar Ravi, had taken the matter up with the Indian mission in Kuwait, including ambassador M. Ganapathi.        
	The minister has directed the officials to look into the issue, which includes arranging for a lawyer if the matter goes to court, a source said. Ganapathi could not be contacted.

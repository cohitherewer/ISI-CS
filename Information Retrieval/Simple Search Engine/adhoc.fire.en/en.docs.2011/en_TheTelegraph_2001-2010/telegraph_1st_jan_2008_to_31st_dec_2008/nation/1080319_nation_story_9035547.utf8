The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court sets Pakistani free
                                                                                                               Court sets Pakistani free
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Lucknow, March 18: For Sarabjit Singhs family, this could only be a scene out of their dreams.        
	Pakistani Jamal Qureshi, 26, had stepped into the witness box in an Uttar Pradesh court yesterday with his heart in his mouth.        
	Accused of spying, spreading fake currency and trying to disrupt peace in India, he was about to have his fate decided at the worst of times for cross-border prisoners.        
	Are you yearning to return home? judge Chandrabhan Singh asked.        
	Looking nervous, Jamal mumbled, Yes sir.        
	You are a free man, the judge said. You may go home.        
	As police and intelligence officials at the Shahjahanpur fast-track court, 300km west of Lucknow, looked on in disbelief, the judge added: The prosecution has failed to prove the charges. He was not involved in any anti-national activity.        
	I had given up hope of ever returning home, Jamal said.        
	The young man, arrested in October 2005 while on a trip to attend a cousins wedding, said even his Indian relatives had disowned him fearing social ostracism, and he had been living with a well-wisher after receiving bail.        
	He was caught red-handed with fake notes but the charge was not proved in court, rued prosecution lawyer J.K. Diwedi.        
	Jamal claims he was given the currency by private money changers operating near the Punjab border.        
	He was today taken to the Attari-Wagah border by intelligence agencies and the BSF.        
	He is expecting his father Walliullah Qureshi to receive him at the border, said Devendra Kumar, an intelligence official in Lucknow. Jamals family had been informed of the acquittal over the phone.        
	 Jamals release is a tribute to the Indian judicial system that does not hastily punish an innocent person, the Pakistanis lawyer, Kamaleswar Pathak, said.        
	The lawyer of Sarabjit, an Indian awaiting execution in Pakistan on terror charges, has said Delhis treatment of a Pakistani arrested as a spy in 2005  who died in an Indian hospital this month  has spoiled his clients chances of winning a pardon.        
	At a time Sarabjits case is making headlines, we have set an example by freeing an innocent young man from Pakistan, Pathak said.        
	Jamal arrived in India in October 2005 on a months visa and spent a few days with relatives in Punjab. On October 20, he travelled to maternal uncle Rahamat Alis home in Jalalnagar village, Shahjahanpur, where Rahamats daughter was getting married.        
	Four days later, he went to the state polices local intelligence unit to provide an account of his expenditures in India and show how much money he possessed  a routine Pakistani tourists have to follow.        
	The police found 20 fake 100-rupee notes on him and detained him for questioning. I was arrested the next day. An officer told me, You are involved in the fake currency racket, Jamal said.

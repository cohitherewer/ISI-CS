          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: Sweeping climate changes in the state has prompted Orissa Renewable Energy Development Agency, a state government undertaking, to collaborate with Delhi-based Institute of Climate Change and Ecology to offset effects.         
	The two agencies inked a memorandum of understanding yesterday, agreeing to jointly work towards mitigation and adaptation of climate changes in the coastal and low-lying areas.         
	The two bodies would be especially looking into the safety of vulnerable areas along the states coast.        
	Director of the Delhi body Pramode Kant, who signed the MoU on behalf of his organisation, said: Our objective would be to develop vulnerable regions through forestry and bio-energy.         
	To carry forth the activities, the body would set up a branch in Orissa, Kant added.         
	Apart from climate change mitigation and adaptation, collaborators would also conduct research and development on low carbon paths using non-conventional energy sources, conceded a senior official of the Orissa research body.         
	The Orissa Renewable Energy Development Agency, whose core activity is to produce renewable and non-conventional energy through mechanisms of carbon credits, has been declared a nodal agency for the development of small-scale, clean development mechanism projects by the Union environment and forest ministry.         
	The Orissa panel has already set up a climate change portfolio, said the official.         
	The state body will earn carbon credit, which will help in compensating the high cost involved in developing technologies for renewable and non-conventional energy, he added.

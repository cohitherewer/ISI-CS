     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 10: The Trinamul Congress today accused Ratan Tata of insulting Mamata Banerjee with his despite-Mamata car remark and threatened a political agitation.
    
	The Tata Group chairman had said in Delhi, where Tata Motors unveiled its Rs 1-lakh car Nano, that some of us said lets call it Buddho (after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, chief minister of Bengal). Others said lets call it Mamata or Despite Mamata. Finally, we settled on Nano.
    
	Mamata immediately asked party leader Partha Chatterjee to condemn the statement, Trinamul sources said. Ratan Tatas remarks were in bad taste. He not only disrespected our popular leader but also insulted the people of Bengal, Chatterjee said.
    
	Asked if Trinamul would move court against Tata, Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, said the party would not act in a hurry. First, we will launch a political movement and then think about legal action.
    
	He demanded an explanation from Tata for the derogatory comment and added that the industrialist was acting at the CPMs bidding.
    
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, missed the moment. Asked if he had watched the car being unveiled on TV, he said at Writers Buildings: No, I didnt see it but I heard about it. In fact, Reuters sent a creed.
    
	Chatterjee threatened to stall production at Singur until the 347 acres acquired forcibly are returned to the farmers. But some Trinamul leaders said production was now a fait accompli.
    
	We tried our best to force the Tatas to shift the plant; (to continue to do so) now will be an exercise in futility, a key party official said.
    
	The state Congress said people would continue to protest if attempts are made to manufacture cars at the Singur plant.
    
	We want the Tatas to return the forcibly acquired land, party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.
    
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen said the small car was a matter of pride for Bengal. Defying opposition from all quarters, the Tatas have made it possible (to buy) a car at just Rs 1 lakh, he said.
    
	He hoped the company would be able to start production on schedule. We expect cooperation from all. The factory will benefit the state and the people of Singur.
    
	The minister said todays agitation in Singur would not send unfavourable signals to industrialists.

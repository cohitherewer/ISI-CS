	New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): Two youths were briefly detained after their car intruded into the convoy of Priyanka Vadra (in picture) unknowingly.        
	Jayant and Alok, residents of Saket, intruded into the VIP convoy near AIIMS around 1pm. Priyankas husband Robert Vadra was also in the cavalcade. The duo, who are in their mid-twenties, waved at the convoy unaware of the occupants of the vehicles. Immediately, khaki-clad men and SPG personnel surrounded them.        
	The two, who were not drunk, told the cops at Tughlak Road police station that they had not realised that VIPs were in the cavalcade.        
	It was not a security breach as the youths unintentionally intruded. They were never near the vehicle in which Priyanka was travelling, joint police commissioner Ajay Kashyap said.        
	The official said the youths were released after their identities were ascertained.

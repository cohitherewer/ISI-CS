	New Delhi, April 15: India is planning to speed up work on a dam on the Jhelum to wrest the advantage from Pakistan, which recently awarded a contract for a power project on the river to a Chinese consortium.        
	The Kishenganga power project in Jammu and Kashmir is to be put on the fast track as it is of strategic importance, junior power minister Jairam Ramesh said.        
	India and Pakistan have been locked in a dispute over the dam for years. Kishenganga, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, flows across the Line of Control and is called Neelum in Pakistan.        
	Islamabads opposition to Delhis proposal to build a dam on the ground that this would impact its hydro-power project downstream has stalled the project so far.        
	But recently, Pakistan awarded the contract for a $1.5-billion power project on the river to a consortium of Chinas Gezhouba Water and Power Company and China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation. The 960MW project is to come up in eight years.        
	India now has to work with a renewed sense of urgency, the power minister said, adding he would soon seek cabinet approval for cost escalation of Rs 1,500 crore. The project was originally estimated to cost Rs 2,200 crore.        
	India plans to set up a 330MW power plant on Kishenganga. The project is of strategic importance as it is located on the border (Pakistan), and Islamabad has begun work on their side of the river and that too with Chinese help, Ramesh said.        
	Asked if Pakistan has sought clarifications on the dam design, the minister said Islamabad awarding the contract to the Chinese consortium for the project has forced Indias hand.         
	The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation has carried out design changes to minimise the threat of flooding in some Jammu and Kashmir towns, Ramesh said, ruling out any further alterations.

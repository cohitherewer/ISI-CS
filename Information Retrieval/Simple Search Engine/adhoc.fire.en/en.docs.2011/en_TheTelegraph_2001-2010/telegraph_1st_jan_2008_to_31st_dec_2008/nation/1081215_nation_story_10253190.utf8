  - Hannan plan amp; years of work help CPM in Rajasthan        JAYANTH JACOB                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee campaigns for the 2006 Assembly election. (Right) Vasundhara Raje at a poll rally in November. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The CPMs best-ever electoral show in Rajasthan came through tactics the party had employed decades ago to begin its march to power in Bengal.        
	The blueprint, worked out by central committee member and Bengal MP Hannan Mollah, featured years of preparation that saw the party join and spearhead popular movements, set up an array of booth committees in winnable seats and strengthen its frontal organisations.        
	In the end, the CPM fielded 34 candidates  six less than the initially planned 40  and won three seats: Dhod and Danta Ramgarh in Sikar district and Anupgarh in Ganganagar district. The party had never before won more than one seat in the House of 200.        
	It is not easy to replicate in north India the way we fight elections in Bengal and Kerala. But we still took a leaf out of our Bengal book and it paid off. It was systematic work for years  five years you may say, Mollah told The Telegraph.        
	In agricultural belts Sikar and Ganganagar, the CPM mobilised the farmers. These two districts had an acute water shortage and the farmers were in tears over failed crops. But the main Opposition, the Congress, was not taking up their cause, Mollah said.        
	The CPM organised farmers rallies and agitated for the release of water from the Indira Gandhi canal, with the movement at times turning violent. Then, a couple of years ago, the state government raised the tariff for electrified tube wells by 32 paise a unit.        
	We saw the farmers anger and organised many agitations. We led one lakh farmers to a dharna outside the Assembly for seven days, the MP said.        
	This was similar to the way the party had led the food movement and the protests against a one-paisa rise in tram fares in Bengal in the 1960s, which repeatedly turned violent but gave the party a high profile and a pro-poor image. The CPM saw electoral success and joined the United Front governments of 1967 and 1969.        
	The farmer movement paid dividends in Rajasthan. Other than the three seats it won, the party did well in several constituencies in Sikar and Ganganagar: it polled 28,000 in Laxman Garh, 17,500 in Sree Madhopur, 22,000 in Khandela, 22,500 in Sikar (all in Sikar district) and 23,000 in Sadul Shahar, Ganganagar.        
	The CPM farmer wing, the All India Kisan Sabha, had 40,000 members in the state five years ago; now it has two lakh.        
	The party also encouraged its youth and student wings to raise peoples issues  such as the farmers problems and price rise.        
	Also, six months before the elections, the CPM put the booth committees in place. In the seats where the party won or polled more than 20,000 votes, it had committees in up to 80 per cent of the booths.        
	These committees kept the contact with people alive, ensuring they turned out on polling day. The committees constantly did door-to-door campaigning for six months, Mollah said.        
	The party had earlier tried to use these methods in other north Indian states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, but could not make an impact because it wasnt ready to play caste politics, a source said.         
	The advantages in Rajasthan were that the state lacked caste-based parties and that there was simmering discontent among farmers to be tapped.        
	The CPM also tried a BJP tactic  rath yatras  in Rajasthans tribal belts. Party leaders criss-crossed tribal areas in red-coloured vehicles, such as tempos and small trucks, campaigning for the forest bill that would grant land rights to forest dwellers.        
	Hannan himself led the rath yatras in December 2006 and January 2007. The results from the tribal belt werent too good this time but Mollah said this was a long-term plan.        
	It was an innovate method and helped us reach out to the tribals and make the partys presence felt, the MP said. We can make inroads in at least 40 seats in the future, and thats our aim.        
	Did the CPM tell the voters it would join the government to look after them? No, we said we would be a constructive, pro-people, militant Opposition, working for the people. Thats all, Mollah said.

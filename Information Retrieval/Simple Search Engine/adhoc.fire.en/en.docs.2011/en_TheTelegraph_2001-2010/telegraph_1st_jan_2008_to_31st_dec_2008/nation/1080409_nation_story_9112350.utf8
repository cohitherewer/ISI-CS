  - SC for study to see if litigation is a waste        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, April 8: Are public interest litigations a waste of time, the Supreme Court wondered today and called for a study.        
	So much of expenses are incurred so much of energy spent. We must know whether PILs are productive or unproductive, a bench observed as it prepared to hear a raft of pending PILs.        
	PILs, a tool to help the disadvantaged and poor get justice, have recently received a barrage of bad press. Judges have been accused of intruding into the executive and legislative domains through PIL-related activism.        
	If some areas are counterproductive, we may withdraw from these areas. We too can learn from experience the information (from such a study) would be useful to all courts, the bench said as it heard a petition on the health hazards from fly ash.        
	The court does not suggest anything. It only goes by (the) opinions of experts or reports of expert bodies.        
	PILs were formally introduced in the mid-eighties by then Chief Justice P.N. Bhagwati. Anyone can now drop a few lines about the plight of some individual or group who cannot afford a legal battle, and the high courts or the apex court would take the matter up in the public interest.        
	Over the years, PILs have addressed many important problems but with mixed results. The successes include the switch to the eco-friendly CNG fuel in Delhi, and the court monitoring of the mid-day meal scheme  which lawyer Colin Gonsalves said had benefited at least 20 crore women and children.        
	But the good is not highlighted, the bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said. This was an allusion to media reports on how the court had failed to get the Yamuna cleaned up despite a decade of monitoring.        
	Today, the listed PILs ranged from industry relocation in Delhi to the functioning of the National Board for Wildlife (headed by the Prime Minister) and the monkey, dog and cattle menaces in several cities. One petition dealt with the release of mentally ill prisoners who have served out their terms but been forgotten by all.        
	Activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who was present, argued that PILs had not worked mainly when the executive had failed to carry out court orders. The court should get its orders enforced, he said, drawing attention to another pending PIL  on road safety.        
	Lawyer Sanjay Parikh praised the courts tremendous achievements and said it could sometimes have a calming effect with just a remark. He cited the recent outsider controversy in Maharashtra and the courts observation that any Indian citizen can settle and work anywhere in the country.        
	The apex court recently heard a petition on starvation deaths, prompting the Orissa government to promise to take measures. The court is now mulling over how to plug the loopholes in the public distribution system. If successful, it will help change millions of lives.

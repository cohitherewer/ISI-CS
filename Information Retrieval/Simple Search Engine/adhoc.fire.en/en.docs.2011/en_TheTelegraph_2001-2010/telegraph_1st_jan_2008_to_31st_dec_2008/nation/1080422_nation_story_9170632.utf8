          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Gopinath Munde    
	New Delhi, April 21: BJP top bosses went into a huddle today after slighted Maharashtra leader Gopinath Munde resigned as a general secretary yesterday and a majority of Bihar legislators rose in revolt against deputy chief minister Sushil Modi.        
	Sources said the shaken leadership appeared to be yielding to pressure in Maharashtra and had chosen to pacify the angry Bihar MLAs.        
	Party insiders said more than half the MLAs and district chiefs in Maharashtra had sided with Munde, who has hinted at exploring options beyond the BJP.        
	Senior leaders were tight-lipped about the deliberations at the emergency meeting. Party chief Rajnath Singh only said the issues would be discussed with Munde when he arrived in the capital late in the night.        
	The sources said the central leadership had worked out a compromise formula through discussions with state leaders like Bal Apte, Nitin Gadkari and Ram Naik and that would be put up before Munde.        
	Although an impression has been created that Munde is angry because of Madhu Chavans appointment as Mumbai BJP chief, the party leadership is aware that the issues involved relate to Mundes role in Maharashtra politics.        
	Munde, the sources said, has been feeling slighted after the death of his brother-in-law Pramod Mahajan and believes that his clout diminished even after his symbolic elevation as a national general secretary.        
	The issue of Mumbai unit chief merely fuelled the anger as the denial of a Rajya Sabha ticket to Mahajans widow Rekha had already set the stage for a confrontation. Moreover, Munde and Gadkari are hardly the best of friends and, sources said, the disgruntled leader would like to settle scores with the Maharashtra unit chief.        
	In Bihar, about 35 of the 55 party MLAs have demanded Modis ouster following a recent shuffle that saw the exit of two ministers. But the sources said the central leadership was not in a mood to disturb Modi at this juncture, though a new state unit head might be appointed as a symbolic move.

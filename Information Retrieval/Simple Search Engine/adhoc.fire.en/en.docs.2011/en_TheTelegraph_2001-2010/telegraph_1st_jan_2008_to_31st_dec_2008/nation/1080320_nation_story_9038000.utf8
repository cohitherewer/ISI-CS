                                                                                                               Stamp strike called off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 19: Execution of sale deeds, mortgage deeds and financial transactions started across Orissa on Wednesday following the withdrawal of a strike by stamp vendors.        
	Nearly 6,000 vendors, who account for the purchase of non-judicial stamps of Rs 1-crore per day, were on strike since March 4 in response to a call given by the Orissa Stamp Vendors Federation.         
	They were demanding an increase in their purchase limit. The strike was called off following assurances from revenue minister Manmohan Samal to increase purchase limit to Rs 2 lakh, said federation secretary Ramkrushna Parida, talking to The Telegraph. At present, vendors are allowed to buy stamp papers up to Rs 50,000. We were assured that the required direction to treasury offices to allow stamp vendors to purchase non-judicial stamps up to Rs 2-lakh would be given soon after receipt of concurrence from the finance department, Parida said. The vendors had demanded the raise in their purchase limit.        
	The federation secretary said the government had also assured to allow vendors to have a stake when franking machines are installed in sub-registrar offices in the future to avoid the risk of sale of fake stamps.

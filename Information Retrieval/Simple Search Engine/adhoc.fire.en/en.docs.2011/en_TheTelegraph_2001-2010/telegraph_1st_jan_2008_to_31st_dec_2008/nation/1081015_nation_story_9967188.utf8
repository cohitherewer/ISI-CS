                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Search on for Netajis soldiers
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 14: On the 112th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on January 23, 2009, the museum at his birthplace here plans an exhibition that covers people who were part of his Indian National Army (INA).        
	Museum sources said a search was already on track to collect information on people  both dead or alive  who were associated with the INA. Efforts are underway to give shape to a proposal to devote a separate gallery on them. But much depends on the outcome of the search within the next three months, before Netajis next birth anniversary, museum director Chandrabhanu Patel told The Telegraph.        
	The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Birthplace Museum at Oriya Bazaar already has eight galleries depicting different phases in Netajis life.         
	Work on three new galleries to display household articles of Netaji and his family and those found in the mansion, is on. They are expected to be ready by the end of the year.         
	If we get enough material to put on display brief description of members of the INA, we will devote one of the three new galleries to them, said J.P. Das, its curator.         
	A beginning on this line has been made with the collection of a portrait of Laxmi Panda, perhaps the youngest soldier in Netajis INA who died in New Delhi, at 83, last week. It was donated by Md Anwar, a Delhi-based artist, he said.

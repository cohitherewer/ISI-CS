The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left did not grant a simple courtesy..., they wanted me to behave as their bonded slave
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Left did not grant a simple courtesy..., they wanted me to behave as their bonded slave
										      The Prime Minister rsquo;s speech you could not hear                        Manmohan Singh arrives in Parliament on Tuesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar				                           
	Excerpts from Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs speech that could not be delivered in full in the din and was laid on the table of the Lok Sabha.              
	The leader of Opposition, Shri L.K. Advani, has chosen to use all manner of abusive adjectives to describe my performance. He has described me as the weakest Prime Minister, a nikamma PM, and of having devalued the office of PM. To fulfil his ambitions, he has made at least three attempts to topple our government. But on each occasion his astrologers have misled him.         
	This pattern, I am sure, will be repeated today. At his ripe old age, I do not expect Shri Advani to change his thinking. But for his sake and Indias sake, I urge him at least to change his astrologers so that he gets more accurate predictions of things to come.         
	As for Shri Advanis various charges, I do not wish to waste the time of the House in rebutting them. All I can say is that before levelling charges of incompetence on others, Shri Advani should do some introspection. Can our nation forgive a home minister who slept when the terrorists were knocking at the doors of our Parliament? Can our nation forgive a person who single-handedly provided the inspiration for the destruction of the Babri Masjid with all the terrible consequences that followed?         
	To atone for his sins, he suddenly decided to visit Pakistan and there he discovered new virtues in Mr Jinnah. Alas, his own party and his mentors in the RSS disowned him on this issue. Can our nation approve the conduct of a home minister who was sleeping while Gujarat was burning leading to the loss of thousands of innocent lives? Our friends in the Left Front should ponder over the company they are forced to keep because of miscalculations by their General Secretary.         
	As for my conduct, it is for this august House and the people of India to judge.        
	Our Left colleagues should tell us whether Shri L.K. Advani is acceptable to them as a prime ministerial candidate. Shri L.K. Advani should enlighten us if he will step aside as prime ministerial candidate of the Opposition in favour of the choice of UNPA. They should take the country into confidence on this important issue.        
	I say in all sincerity that this session and debate was unnecessary because I have said on several occasions that our nuclear agreement after being endorsed by the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group would be submitted to this august House for expressing its view. All I had asked our Left colleagues was: please allow us to go through the negotiating process and I will come to Parliament before operationalising the nuclear agreement.         
	This simple courtesy which is essential for orderly functioning of any government worth the name, particularly with regard to the conduct of foreign policy, they were not willing to grant me. They wanted a veto over every single step of negotiations which is not acceptable. They wanted me to behave as their bonded slave. The nuclear agreement may not have been mentioned in the common minimum programme. However, there was an explicit mention of the need to develop closer relations with the USA but without sacrificing our independent foreign policy.        
	In 1991, while presenting the budget for 1991-92, as finance minister, I had stated: No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. I had then suggested to this august House that the emergence of India as a major global power was an idea whose time had come.         
	What is the nuclear agreement about? It is all about widening our development options, promoting energy security in a manner which will not hurt our precious environment and which will not contribute to pollution and global warming.         
	We have to diversify our sources of energy supply.        
	The nuclear agreement that we wish to negotiate will end Indias nuclear isolation, nuclear apartheid and enable us to take advantage of international trade in nuclear materials, technologies and equipment. It will open up new opportunities for trade in dual-use high technologies, opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country. Given the excellent quality of our nuclear scientists and technologists, I have reason to believe that in a reasonably short period of time, India would emerge as an important exporter of nuclear technologies and equipment for civilian purposes.         
	The essence of the matter is that the agreements that we negotiate with USA, Russia, France and other nuclear countries will enable us to enter into international trade for civilian use without any interference with our strategic nuclear programme. The strategic programme will continue to be developed at an autonomous pace determined solely by our own security perceptions. We have not and we will not accept any outside interference or monitoring or supervision of our strategic programme. Our strategic autonomy will never be compromised. We are willing to look at possible amendments to our Atomic Energy Act to reinforce our solemn commitment that our strategic autonomy will never be compromised.         
	I confirm that there is nothing in these agreements which prevents us from further nuclear tests if warranted by our national security concerns. All that we are committed to is a voluntary moratorium on further testing. Thus the nuclear agreements will not in any way affect our strategic autonomy. The cooperation that the international community is now willing to extend to us for trade in nuclear materials, technologies and equipment for civilian use will be available to us without signing the NPT or the CTBT.         
	This I believe is a measure of the respect that the world at large has for India, its people and their capabilities and our prospects to emerge as a major engine of growth for the world economy. I have often said that today there are no international constraints on Indias development. The world marvels at our ability to seek our social and economic salvation in the framework of a functioning democracy committed to the rule of law and respect for fundamental human freedoms. The world wants India to succeed. The obstacles we face are at home, particularly in our processes of domestic governance.        
	Our critics falsely accuse us that in signing these agreements, we have surrendered the independence of foreign policy and made it subservient to US interests. In this context, I wish to point out that the cooperation in civil nuclear matters that we seek is not confined to the USA. Change in the NSG guidelines would be a passport to trade with 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group which includes Russia, France and many other countries.         
	We appreciate the fact that the US has taken the lead in promoting cooperation with India for nuclear energy for civilian use. Without US initiative, Indias case for approval by the IAEA or the Nuclear Suppliers Group would not have moved forward.         
	But this does not mean that there is any explicit or implicit constraint on India to pursue an independent foreign policy determined by our own perceptions of our enlightened national interest. Some people are spreading the rumours that there are some secret or hidden agreements over and above the documents made public. I wish to state categorically that there are no secret or hidden documents other than the 123 Agreement, the Separation Plan and the draft of the safeguards agreement with the IAEA.        
	It has also been alleged that the Hyde Act will affect Indias ability to pursue an independent foreign policy. The Hyde Act does exist and it provides the US administration the authorisation to enter into civil nuclear cooperation with India without insistence on full-scope safeguards and without signing of the NPT.         
	There are some prescriptive clauses but they cannot and they will not be allowed to affect in any way the conduct of our foreign policy. Our commitment is to what has been agreed in the 123 Agreement. There is nothing in this agreement which will affect our strategic autonomy or our ability to pursue an independent foreign policy. I state categorically that our foreign policy will at all times be determined by our own assessment of our national interest.        
	 This has been true in the past and will be true in future regarding our relations with big powers as well as with our neighbours in West Asia, notably Iran, Iraq, Palestine and the Gulf countries.         
	We have differed with the USA on their intervention in Iraq. I had explicitly stated at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC in July 2005 that intervention in Iraq was a big mistake. With regard to Iran, our advice has been in favour of moderation and we would like that the issues relating to Irans nuclear programme which have emerged should be resolved through dialogue and discussions in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.         
	I should also inform the House that our relations with the Arab world are very good. Two years ago, His Majesty King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was the chief guest at our Republic Day. More recently, we have played host to the President of Iran, President of Syria, the King of Jordan, the Emir of Qatar and the Emir of Kuwait. With all these countries we have historic civilisational and cultural links which we are keen to further develop to our mutual benefit. Today, we have strategic relationship with all major powers including USA, Russia, France, UK, Germany, Japan, China, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa. We are forging new partnerships with countries of East Asia, South East Asia and Africa.         
	Conclusion         
	The management and governance of the worlds largest, most diverse and most vibrant democracy is the greatest challenge any person can be entrusted with in this world. It has been my good fortune that I was entrusted with this challenge over four years ago. I thank with all sincerity the Chairperson of the UPA, the leaders of the constituent parties of the UPA and every member of my party for the faith and trust they reposed in me. I once again recall with gratitude the guidance and support I have received from Shri Jyoti Basu and Sardar Harkishen Singh Surjeet.         
	I have often said that I am a politician by accident. I have held many diverse responsibilities. I have been a teacher, I have been an official of the Government of India, I have been a member of this greatest of Parliaments, but I have never forgotten my life as a young boy in a distant village.         
	Every day that I have been Prime Minister of India, I have tried to remember that the first 10 years of my life were spent in a village with no drinking water supply, no electricity, no hospital, no roads and nothing that we today associate with modern living. I had to walk miles to school, I had to study in the dim light of a kerosene oil lamp. This nation gave me the opportunity to ensure that such would not be the life of our children in the foreseeable future.         
	Sir, my conscience is clear that on every day that I have occupied this high office, I have tried to fulfil the dream of that young boy from that distant village.         
	The greatness of democracy is that we are all birds of passage! We are here today, gone tomorrow! But in the brief time that the people of India entrust us with this responsibility, it is our duty to be honest and sincere in the discharge of these responsibilities. As it is said in our sacred texts, we are responsible for our actions and we must act without coveting the rewards of such action. Whatever I have done in this high office, I have done so with a clear conscience and the best interests of my country and our people at heart. I have no other claims to make.

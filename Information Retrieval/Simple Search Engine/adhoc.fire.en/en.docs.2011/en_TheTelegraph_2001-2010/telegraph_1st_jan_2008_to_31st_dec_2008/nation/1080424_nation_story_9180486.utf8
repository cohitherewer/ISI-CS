          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 23: Gujarat riot victims are seeing red over the appointment of a police official in the re-investigation team who was part of the initial probe which has been challenged in the Supreme Court.         
	The Jan Sangharsh Manch, which represents riot victims, has demanded the removal of deputy superintendent of police Noel Parmar from the special investigation team headed by former CBI chief R. Raghavan.         
	If he continues to be in the SIT, the entire exercise will become futile, said advocate Mukul Sinha of the Manch. Sinha had cross-examined Parmar during his deposition before the Godhra panel.         
	The officer is accused of fabricating evidence to prove that the Godhra carnage was a conspiracy, though he has not been able to establish it so far. Parmar is on his fourth extension after retirement, but was nonetheless picked for re-investigation.         
	Sinha said there are many complaints against Parmar for concocting evidence. Parmar is the one who twisted the line of investigation and brought in the terrorist angle, he said.         
	The latest controversy comes barely a fortnight after the row over the appointment of Justice (retd) Akshay Mehta to the inquiry commission headed by G.T. Nanavati. Mehta was mentioned as apna aadmi (our man) by a riot accused in a television sting operation. The judge has denied the charges.         
	Saeed Umarji, the son of alleged Godhra mastermind Maulana Umarji, has written an application to the probe team chairman, seeking Parmars removal. Saeed said he would approach the Supreme Court if the officer was not removed within a week.

	Mumbai, Feb. 15 (PTI): Bombay High Court today quashed the decision to give an extension to Maharashtra director-general of police P.S. Pasricha and city police commissioner D.N. Jadhav, saying it was not in the larger public interest.        
	Orders (granting extension) are not reasoned, rational and are also not in the larger public interest. It gave the officers three weeks to appeal.        
	Both were to retire on November 30, 2007. But the Centre gave them three months extension on the recommendation of the state government.

          OUR BUREAU                          Jaipurs Johri Bazaar after the blasts. (PTI)                                  
	May 13: Life has turned cold in the famed pink-flushed walled city which, like New York and the tag line of a foreign bank, never sleeps.         
	On any given day, the area, a medieval labyrinth of bazaars and ancient havelis, bustles with activity right through the day.         
	The walled city, which turned pink when it was tinted to impress Prince Albert during his visit to India in 1876, is a tourists paradise with its rows of colourful shops that sell anything from clothes to jewellery to utensils and hardware and even has a huge vegetable market.        
	The Hawa Mahal, resembling an overdone wedding cake and the most famous structure in the walled city, is synonymous with Jaipur. The iconic structure is just a hugely decorated faade.         
	Built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in 1799, it has over 900 small windows  facing the street  to allow women in the royal harem to watch elaborate street processions. The idea was literally to give them a window to the outside world, without them being seen from outside.         
	The street below is what experts believe is the essence of the whole Rajasthan experience with traditional crafts jostling for space with more modern facilities like ATMs.         
	Packed at all times, the tiny streets, too narrow to accommodate the barrage of cars that try and weave through cows and turbaned men, have always been representative of the composite culture that Jaipur seems to effortlessly imbibe.         
	The blasts, apart from causing human casualties, have also managed to threaten the citys legacy of accommodating one and all.         
	The blasts have struck the heart of the city, where Jaipur started from, said Faith Singh, the founder of Jaipur Virasat Festival. It is the walled city and it is unbelievable that anyone would want to target an area that represents Jaipurs integrated mixed legacy.         
	The city  a must in most tourist itineraries  is part of the golden triangle and welcomed 25.9 million domestic tourists last year. The number of foreigners that flocked to Rajasthan in 2007 was 1.4 million.         
	On a typical summer day when the scorching sun doesnt go down before 7.30pm, thousands of city residents prefer to venture out in these areas on a shopping spree or to grab a spicy bite from the various eateries selling traditional Rajasthani food like onion kachori, mirchi vada, ghevar, phirni and thandai. The small kiosks selling golgappa are a favourite haunt.        
	Among the main markets sprinkled all around the walled city of seven gates are the Maniharon ka Rasta (jewellers road), Johri Bazaar and Tripolia Bazaar.         
	Johri Bazaar, near which one of the blasts took place, is a shoppers delight with rows of shops offering colourful bandhej, an art of tie and dye, and glittering gemstone jewellery.         
	The small, narrow bylanes accommodate the original jewellers workstations  or gaddis  inhabited by these craftsmen for centuries.         
	Jyotsna Bhandari, a resident of Johri Bazaar, said: This has never happened in the walled city before. The areas may be congested but we have been staying here for decades and have never felt insecure or faced any kind of problems. The blasts have not only shocked us but shaken us up as well. It will never be the same here again.         
	A number of craftsmen, who specialise in jewellery work from Bengal, also reside and work in these areas. Badi Chaupar (big square)  situated on the crossing of Johri Bazaar in the south, Ramganj, a Muslim dominated locality in the east, and the Tripolia Bazaar in the west  is a meeting point and often a place of protests.         
	Tripolia Bazaar, located between Manak Chowk in Badi Chaupar and Chhoti Chaupar, has shops selling fabrics, brassware, carpets, ironware, textiles, furniture and utensils.

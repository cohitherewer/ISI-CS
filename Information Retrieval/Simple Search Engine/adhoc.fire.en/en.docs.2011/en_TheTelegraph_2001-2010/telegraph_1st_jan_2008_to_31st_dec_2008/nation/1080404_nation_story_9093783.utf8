                                                                                                               Turf war over chief dismissal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 3: Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah and the principal secretary of the panchayati raj, Pancham Lal, are warring over the dismissal of zila parishad chief Shobha Sinha.        
	The two senior bureaucrats have annulled each others orders, thereby putting the state government in a quandary.         
	The turf war began when Rammaiah removed the zila parishad chief, Shobha Sinha, from her post by exercising judicial powers vested in him by Section 70(5) of the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act.        
	Afterwards, panchayati raj secretary Pancham Lal, through an office order passed on April 2, 2008, overturned Rammaiahs decision.         
	On Thursday, April 3, Rammaiah passed yet another order trashing Lals.         
	As an explanation, Lal has said that he had set aside Rammaiahs ruling because the latter did not have the power to sack the parishad chief, as the Panchayati Raj Act was amended on the day when the divisional commissioner had issued the order.         
	The new Act also took away power from the commissioner and gave it to the Bihar government.         
	On his part, Rammaiah retorted that the Act was not amended with retrospective effect and the case against the parishad chief was instituted before the new law came into effect.         
	He was, Rammaih has argued, legally armed to remove Shobha Sinha.         
	Both officials, in their orders, have quoted Supreme Court rulings to buttress their stand.         
	Meanwhile, Shobha Devi, the deposed and then reinstated chief, occupied her office chamber on Thursday.         
	Whatever may be the final outcome of this war, observers state that the episode reflects poorly on the functioning of the government machinery and invites ridicule.         
	The divisional commissioner, on Thursday, convened a news-meet to challenge the jurisdiction of the principal secretary in quasi-judicial matters.

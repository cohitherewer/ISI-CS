          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, Oct. 30: When Harish reached school this morning, bombs hadnt bloodied his city yet.        
	Hours later, they nearly shut him in.        
	The principal said no student should go out of the school, the Class XI student of Don Bosco, who till then hadnt heard of the blasts, recalled.        
	We were told we would be allowed to go home only with our parents.        
	Harish (name changed) was lucky. His mother arrived to pick him up at 1.30pm sharp, when the administration imposed a four-hour curfew on the ravaged city.        
	Not all parents learnt of the blasts early enough to beat the curfew. It meant students were stuck in schools for hours.        
	One woman had to walk 2km to her sons school because buses had gone off the roads by the time her husband called to tell her about the explosions.         
	We didnt want to take the risk of allowing students to go out on their own. It is our responsibility that our students reach home safe in such a situation, a Don Bosco official said.        
	Juri Sharma heard of the blasts from a relative in Ganeshguri.         
	I called my husband immediately and we both rushed to St Marys School to collect my daughter, a second standard student, Sharma said.        
	At the school, it was total chaos, with impatient parents waiting to collect their kids. The authorities waited about 15 minutes before opening the gates at 1pm.        
	Kalpana Goswami, a teacher at Hindustani Kendriya Vidyalaya, said the school authorities at first didnt know what to do because most of the students took the school bus. We were totally at a loss, she said.        
	The school finally got permission from the administration to run the buses and the last student to be dropped reached home around 4.30, nearly an hour and a half late.

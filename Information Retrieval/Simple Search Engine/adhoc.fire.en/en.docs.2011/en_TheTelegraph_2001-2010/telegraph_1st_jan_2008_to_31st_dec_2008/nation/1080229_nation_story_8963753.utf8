The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Killer, but not murderer 
                                                                                                               Killer, but not murderer 
          AMIT ROY                               Liam Kilroe and (below) Tony Singh. Telegraph pictures				                                 
	London, Feb. 28: Indian shopkeeper Tony Singh will not be charged with murder, as he had initially feared, following the death of a career criminal.        
	Liam Kilroe sustained a fatal wound from his own knife, which Tony had managed to grab during their tussle.         
	Singh said he was relieved on learning of the decision yesterday to clear him but practised a bit of Gandhigiri by condoling with the family of the man who had tried to kill him. I extend my sympathy to the Kilroe family who, after all, have lost a son, he said.         
	Under English law, which many think is too soft on criminals, a victim is permitted to use only reasonable force to ward off an attack. But what is reasonable is often not clear.         
	It was Kilroe, a 25-year-old with a long history of violent crime, who had attacked Singh after the 34-year-old shopkeeper had got into his car to drive home.         
	But if Kilroe thought Singh would be just another meek and mild Asian ready for the picking, he was badly mistaken. Singh fought back and, in the ensuing scuffle, the shopkeeper was wounded in the neck and back, but it was Kilroe who died from a stab wound to the chest.         
	The suggestion that it was Singh  he runs the Lifestyle Express store in Birleywood Road, Skelmersdale, a town in west Lancashire  who would now face punishment outraged newspapers.         
	The authorities realised they would have to take on the entire British media if Singh was charged.         
	The Sun, for example, showed where its sympathies lay with the whole tenor of its reporting following the incident at 9pm on February 17.        
	A hero shopkeeper who struggled with a robber was nicked on suspicion of murder after the thug was killed with his own knife. Brave Tony Singh fought back when hooded Liam Kilroe, 25, ambushed him as he was about to drive home after a 13-hour day. The career villain pulled a knife on his petrified victim  but was impaled on it as he grappled with the terrified convenience store boss. Kilroe, who has a history of violent armed robberies on shops, tried to flee the raid but collapsed and died in a pool of blood. Police called to the scene in Skelmersdale, Lancs, found shocked Mr Singh, 34, nursing knife wounds to his back and neck.         
	The newspaper then highlighted the injustice of the alleged police attitude: But despite his injuries, officers arrested the shaken have-a-go-hero and quizzed him on suspicion of murder. It added: Locals rallied around Mr Singh.         
	Singh was too emotional to speak to reporters yesterday but his solicitor, Nick Archer, read out a statement on his clients behalf: I would like to say how relieved I am at the decision that I am not going to be prosecuted. I tried to get away from the attacker but was left with no option but to defend myself. In the course of the attack I was stabbed to my head causing what could have been a life-threatening injury and also suffered repeated stab wounds to my back. In the struggle with my attacker I understand he suffered an injury but I do not know how the injury was caused. I do not want to be seen as a hero. I did no more or less than try to save my life. He added: I have been traumatised by this event and my family have been deeply distressed by the incident and I am desperate to return to normality. I would like to thank everyone for their support.         
	Singh also thanked the Crown Prosecution Service and the senior investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire police, for the speed and thoroughness of their investigation and their decision making.

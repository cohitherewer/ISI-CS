	Islamabad/ Chandigarh March 20: An Indian fisherman arrested in February 2006 for trespassing on Pakistans waters died today in police custody in Karachi as Delhi tried to ascertain how a Pakistani prisoner died in custody in Gurgaon.        
	IG (prisons) Yameen Khan said Laksman Kanji, 40, who was lodged in Karachis Landhi Jail, was admitted to a police hospital nine days ago after he complained of stomach pain.        
	We are yet to ascertain the cause of Kanjis death. A post-mortem will be carried out, Khan said. But a PTI report, quoting the Dawn channel in Pakistan, said the jails medical officer claimed Kanji died of cardiac arrest.        
	On the other side of the border, Delhi has asked Haryana to look into the circumstances that led to the death of Pakistani national Khalid Mehmood in Gurgaons Bhondsi jail on February 12.

  - Scientists want a debate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A demonstration against the nuclear deal in Mumbai on Tuesday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, June 24: The Centre must debate International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on Indian reactors with scientific experts and within the UPA-Left committee on the Indo-US nuclear deal before signing on them, senior atomic energy scientists today demanded.         
	A day before a meeting of the UPA-Left committee, the scientists, who once led Indias nuclear programme, also expressed concerns that the deal with the US might jeopardise Indias indigenous atomic energy strategy.         
	The government needs to sign the safeguards pact specific to India before the nuclear deal can be taken to its next stage of approval from the Nuclear Suppliers Group that supplies reactor fuel.         
	We are strongly of the opinion that the government should not proceed to seek the IAEA board approval for the current draft safeguards agreement until its implications are debated more fully within the country, or at least within the UPA-Left committee, a joint statement of the scientists said.         
	The statement is signed by P.K. Iyengar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, A. Gopalakrishnan, former head of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, and A.N. Prasad, former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.         
	Iyengar questioned the governments hurry to approach the IAEA Board of Governors for inking the safeguards agreement, and its inability to share the text of the agreement with scientists or the Left.         
	This is a crucial international agreement. The safeguards are in perpetuity. It is crucial that they are studied in detail. The full text of the agreement must be made available to nuclear experts, who must be consulted before signing on it, Iyengar said over phone from Mumbai.         
	Indian scientists have indigenously built our nuclear programme over half a century. Should everything be surrendered in such a hurry, without full discussions? he asked.         
	Mulford meet        
	US ambassador David Mulford today met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan to discuss the nuclear deal and issues before the G8 summit which both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are attending in Japan from July 7 to 9, sources said.         
	The meeting comes on a day when US state department deputy spokesperson said time is running out for the deal. Every day that goes by is one less day on the legislative calendar for us to be able to have congressional action take place. So it certainly gets harder every day that this is delayed, Tom Casey said in Washington today.

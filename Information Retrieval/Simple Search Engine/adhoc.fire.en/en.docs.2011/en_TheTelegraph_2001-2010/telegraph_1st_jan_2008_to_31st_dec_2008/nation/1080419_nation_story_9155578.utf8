                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Red targets Gaya petrol pump
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 18: Shortly before midnight yesterday 40-odd armed Naxalites raided Rocky Automobiles, a petrol station located on the Grand Trunk Road, and blew up the pump premises.         
	The petrol pump is located near Kahu Dagh village under the Barachatti police station of the district.         
	Rebels also abducted six employees of the pump. While two were subsequently released, a kilometre from the pump, four employees remained traceless till Friday afternoon. Rebels reportedly used dynamite sticks for their job. Two motorcycles parked on the premises were badly damaged.         
	Bindi Yadav, the controversial former chief of zila parishad, owns the petrol pump. Confirming the incident Raj Vansh Singh, spokesperson of district police, added that the Sherghati deputy superintendent of police and Barachatti officer in charge was camping in the area for investigation.         
	Bindi Yadav is said to have earned the wrath of the rebels for his alleged support of a rival Naxalite group that opposes the CPI(M).         
	Police sources believe that the rebels also wished to challenge Gaya police through their act. The local police had been on a defensive mode following a rebel-police crossfire in a Gaya village last week.         
	Barachatti area is regarded as a Naxalite stronghold and rebels claim that the area is a liberated zone meaning that the red writ, and not the state machinery, runs the area. The event has led to the police worrying about the safety of the Grand Trunk Road and the golden quadrilateral four-lane project that would serve as a vital link with the rest of the country.

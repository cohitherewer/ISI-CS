The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar fears empty booths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Omar fears empty booths
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Ganderbal, Nov. 3: Stones are raining on his rival but Omar Abdullahs worry is whether votes will rain on him.        
	In 2002, family turf Ganderbal had handed the National Conference chief a shock defeat, shattering his dreams of becoming the states youngest chief minister and banishing his party to the fringes of Jammu and Kashmir politics.        
	Now he is back to avenge the humiliation but the town, brimming with separatist passions, appears not to want an election at all.        
	Omar was greeted by a shutdown today as he reached the constituency amid heavy security to file his nomination papers.        
	Some 1,000 party supporters shouted slogans and waved the red party flag. But the tension in the air spoke of the partys fallen fortunes in the constituency that had for years sent Omars grandfather Sheikh Abdullah and father Farooq Abdullah to the Assembly.        
	The good news for Omar is that his rival, Qazi Afzal of the Peoples Democratic Party, a little-known politician in 2002 who rose to become forest minister, is deeply unpopular.        
	Afzal was instrumental in allotting land at Baltal to the Amarnath shrine board, triggering the chain of events that led to the current separatist upswing.

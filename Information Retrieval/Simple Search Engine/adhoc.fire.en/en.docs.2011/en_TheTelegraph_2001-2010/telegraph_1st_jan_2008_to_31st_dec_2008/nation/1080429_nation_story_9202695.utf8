                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Besu reminder on govt funds 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 28: The Centre is yet to release funds it had promised for upgrading the Bengal Engineering and Science University though the Shibpur-Besu has the tag of an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology.         
	Ahead of its first academic session as an IIEST  labelled an Institute of National Importance (INI)  Besu has, in a firm letter, now asked the Centre to put its money where its mouth is.         
	Besu vice-chancellor N.R. Bannerjea has written to the HRD ministry complaining that the institute is still to receive a third of the promised funds, senior officials have told The Telegraph. The letter was received today.         
	In a separate letter to the University Grants Commission, Bannerjea has urged for urgent disbursal of the funds, sources said.         
	Of the Rs 15 crore sanctioned for Besus upgrade to an IIEST  an institute which will aim to compete with the Indian Institutes of Technology  the university has received only Rs 10 crore.         
	Bannerjea and a senior faculty member from the institutes architecture department are expected in Delhi tomorrow to discuss Besus case for funds with the HRD ministry, sources said.         
	In December 2007, the ministry had officially bestowed the tag of an IIEST on the 151-year-old Besu, Asias oldest engineering institute.         
	Starting from the 2008-09 academic session, Besu will be known as an IIEST, the ministry had informed university authorities. In his letter to the ministry, Bannerjea has also hinted at concerns other than the release of funds.         
	Till last year (2007-08), Besu admitted students on the basis of the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination. For several years now, Besu has itself been the nodal agency in charge of conducting the WBJEE. Bannerjea himself has been the chief of the WBJEE Board.         
	This year, however, Besu was to admit students on the basis of the centrally conducted All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE). The exam was held yesterday.         
	While students to all other courses are being admitted through the AIEEE this year, admissions to the Besu B.Arch programme (bachelor in architecture) are through the WBJEE.         
	The WBJEE question papers were leaked this year, putting a question mark on the admissions to a course run by an INI, sources said.         
	We want to discuss the possibility of admitting students to the B.Arch programme through the AIEEE. That is why the architecture faculty member is accompanying the VC. We are not too hopeful though, a Besu official said.         
	The ministry may have a question of its own, when Bannerjea comes visiting, HRD officials said. Though it is no longer supposed to admit students through the WBJEE, Besu continues to manage the state exam. Besu may be asked to explain, a source said.

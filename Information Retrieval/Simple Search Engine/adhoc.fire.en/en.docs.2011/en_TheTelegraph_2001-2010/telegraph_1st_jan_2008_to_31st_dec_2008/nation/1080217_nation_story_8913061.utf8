The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Friendship boom in Delhi arms bazaar

	New Delhi, Feb. 16: India today made proclamations of friendship from the arms bazaar.         
	Howitzers that pack new lethal firepower for the army, flying machines that perform incredible feats to vanquish the adversary from the sky and visual devices that will allow warships to sight the enemy across the horizon could not keep defence minister A.K. Antony from presenting a benign face of the might that India is seeking to acquire with gusto.         
	I think all the important countries are represented here, Antony said after opening Defexpo 2008, the largest arms trade fair to be held here. We are friendly to everybody. We have to be prepared at all times.         
	India is in the market to buy at least $30 billion of weapons in 10 years. Over the next five years, for which deals are being currently struck, India will spend about $4 billion (about Rs 15,500 crore).         
	Of more than 450 exhibitors, 273 companies from 30 countries have flocked to Defexpo to grab as much of that pie as each can. About 90 new launches of military products  radars, network packages, torpedoes, spy planes and combat wear among them  are likely in the four days of the fair.         
	Industry association CIIs defence committee chief Atul Kirloskar has termed this Indian abrasiveness in the arms bazaar a second opening, the first being the economic reforms of Manmohan Singh in 1991.         
	Pakistan was not invited. China was but it has refused, probably in the belief that it has nothing to sell India because it is a supplier to Pakistan. The Russian presence is somewhat scaled down; the American presence enlarged, filling nearly all of Pragati Maidans sprawling hall number 14 with Lockheed Martin in the centre; Israels Elbit Systems has put up a laser show that simulates real-life net-centric battles.         
	I dont think you should read too much into all this, said Antony. We want good relations with all. The fact is, in the past there was hesitation from some countries. Now that is not there. But obviously there are things that I cannot reveal. I will not reveal.         
	He also said that as India picks its way through the arms bazaar, it will not be biased but choose what it needs to counter the threats it faces. There will be no favouritism, no negativism, he said.         
	Even as he was speaking, the Indian Air Force was flying Chetak helicopters from Hyderabad to scour Orissas outbacks in search of the rebels who raided the police and fled with arms.         
	Last nights events in Orissa emphasise that Indias threat perceptions, which have made it host this arms bazaar, are closer home than many of the sellers here can imagine.

	Jamshedpur, Dec. 31: Brace for a chilly New Year. 
    
	The Meteorological department has warned that several parts of the state would witness a cold wave, which is likely to stay for the next 48 hours. 
    
	Today, Jamshedpur was at 5 Celsius  the lowest the city has witnessed in the past three years. On December 24, 2004, the mercury had dipped to 4.8 Celsius. Officials of the Met department said that the fall in the mercury level was due to the cold wave. 
    
	Jharkhand is in the grip of a cold wave blowing from northern India. The situation will remain the same for the next 48hours. This would result in a further drop of the mercury level in the next few days, G.C. Debnath, the director of Alipore Met Office, Calcutta, told The Telegraph over the phone.
    
	Debnath explained that high pressure is prevailing over Jharkhand due to the impact of cold and dry winds of north India. He ruled out any possibility of rainfall, though. 
    
	There is no possibility of the formation of a low pressure belt. Neither there are signs of any western disturbance hitting the state, he said. The Patna Meteorological Office has predicted a cold wave in several parts of the state. 
    
	Districts in Singhbhum-Kolhan region, Koderma, Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Palamau and Godda are in the grip of a cold wave. In all such places the minimum temperature is hovering between five and seven degrees Celsius, said T.N. Jha, the director of the Patna Met Office.

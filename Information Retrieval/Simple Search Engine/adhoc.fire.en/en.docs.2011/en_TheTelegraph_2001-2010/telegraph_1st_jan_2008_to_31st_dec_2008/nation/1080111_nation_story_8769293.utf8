	Singur/Calcutta, Jan. 10: About 250-odd security guards engaged as temps at the Tata small car factory site in Singur today marched in and stopped work at the vendor park, where the ancillary units are coming up.
    
	A police team, led by officer-in-charge Priyabrata Bakshi of the local police station, chased them away and work resumed at 2pm  five hours after the protest had begun. 
    
	We have lost our land and come to the factory with the job of guarding the project site on three shifts. We were assured that we will be absorbed at the Tata Motors factory. But we have learnt that we will all be sacked as they dont require so many guards, said Golok Santra, one of the protesters.
    
	The local CPM leadership had through the three local gram panchayats selected about 650 villagers last February, who were then engaged by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) as temporary guards. 
    
	The guards, who were paid Rs 70 a day, were to keep vigil while the boundary wall came up. The wall was completed last summer. 
    
	Balai Sabui, a Hooghly district secretariat member of the CPM, said the guards were hired by WBIDC for two months. But they are now working for a year. They would have been jobless before the Pujas but we requested the WBIDC not to sack them in the festive season, he said.
    
	CPM leaders in Singur, who rushed to the site to pacify the protesters, took a softer line. We asked the agitators not to worry. We told them they will continue to guard the project until an alternative was arranged, said Ranjit Mondal, head of the Singur panchayat samiti.
    
	He went to the spot to troubleshoot along with Srikanta Chatterjee, the president of the CPM peasants wing in Singur block. 
    
	WBIDC managing director M.V. Rao said: We have to find livelihood for all, including these people.
    
	The CPM has its own reasons to find them alternative work. If we dont back them now in their time of trouble, they will turn against us and we might face problems in the panchayat polls in Singur in May, said Prabhash Ghosh, CPM pradhan of Beraberi gram panchayat.
    
	Sabui blamed the protest  which coincided with the Nano launch  on instigation from Opposition parties.
    
	The Trinamul Congress-backed Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee burnt the replica of a Nano at Singur bazar this afternoon. We will not allow the car to roll out of the factory. We will attack a Nano whenever we see one, said Becharam Manna, the convener.

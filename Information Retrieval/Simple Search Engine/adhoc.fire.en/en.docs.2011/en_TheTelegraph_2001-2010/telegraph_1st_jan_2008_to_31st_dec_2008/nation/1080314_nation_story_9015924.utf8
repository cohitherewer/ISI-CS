The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MPs assault slur on brother-in-law
                                                                                                               MPs assault slur on brother-in-law
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, March 13: Gaya MP Rajesh Manjhi lodged a complaint today with Bodh Gaya police accusing the brother of his estranged wife, Sanjay Manjhi, of forcibly entering his house at Pachhati in Bodh Gaya and trying to assault him.         
	The police registered a criminal case against Sanjay under Sections 447, 323 and 341 of the IPC. Though the sections are bailable, police sent Sanjay to jail on charges of criminal trespass and physical assault.         
	Though Rajeshs estranged wife Pramila Kumari reached the police station to bail her brother out, her pleas were unheard as papers were ready to send Sanjay to the jail.         
	Dismissing allegations that the police succumbed to the MPs pressure and promptly jailed Sanjay Manjhi despite alleged offences being of a minor nature, Gaya superintendent of police Amit Jain said his force was merely following the rulebook. Had the police been partisan, non-bailable sections would have been applied, Jain added.         
	According to Parliament records, a year ago Pramila lodged a complaint against her husband alleging that he took a woman on official tours using facilities meant for spouses only.         
	A Lok Sabha committee found Rajesh guilty and he was debarred from attending 30 sittings of the Parliament and his travel facility meant for an MP and his or her spouse was also withdrawn.         
	Rajesh Manjhi subsequently filed a divorce petition in the Gaya family court on the plea that Pramila Kumari was not his wife and was a live-in partner for more than a decade. Rajesh reportedly fathered two children with Pramila.        
	Rajesh also alleged that his wife had an illicit relationship and her second child was not his.

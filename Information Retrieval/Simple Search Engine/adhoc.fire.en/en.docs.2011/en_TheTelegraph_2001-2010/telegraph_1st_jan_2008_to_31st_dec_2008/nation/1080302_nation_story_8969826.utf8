                                                                                                               Mob attacks cops to snatch rapist
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 1: A 1,000-strong mob of angry villagers today attacked the Haldipada police outpost under Balasore Sadar pol- ice station following the alleged rape and death of a minor girl.         
	The irate mob set fire to the police outpost as the policemen on duty refused to hand over the rape accused to them.        
	Three police and fire vehicles were vandalised and 22 personnel belonging to the police and fire services department, were injured in the mob attack. Fifty villagers also sustained injuries in the police action.        
	According to sources, one Karunakar Das allegedly lured a seven-year-old girl with chocolate. The girl had been taken to a village fair by her father last night. The accused allegedly took the minor girl to a nearby field before raping and killing her.        
	The girls body was found near Naharpatna village this morning. Thereafter, the angry mob caught hold of Das and thrashed him.         
	On being apprised, police from the nearby Haldipada outpost reached the spot and took him into custody.        
	Soon after, a 1,000-strong mob barged into the outpost and demanded Das be turned in to them for them to mete out appropriate punishment to him. They wanted to lynch or execute him, said Balasore superintendent of police Y.K. Jethwa.        
	As the policemen on duty did not agree to that, the mob attempted to break open the police lock-up and set fire to a portion of the outpost, he said.        
	We tried to pacify the mob which went on a rampage. But as they did not relent and tried to snatch away the accused, we had to burst teargas shells. Finally, we used lathis to chase them away, said Jethwa.        
	Villagers claimed that more than 50 persons were injured in the lathicharge. On the other hand, Jethwa said 22 policemen and fire service personnel were hurt in the mob attack.        
	A case has been registered against the mob and three persons involved in the violence have been detained, added Jethwa.        
	The rape accused was produced in court, which remanded him to judicial custody, police sources said.         
	As tension prevailed in the area, three platoons of armed police forces were deployed and patrolling intensified in and around the locality, said Jethwa.        
	The villagers demanded exemplary punishment for the accused as he had earlier been accused of committing other crimes, including murder.        
	Jethwa assured that the criminal antecedents of the accused would be investigated into and if found true, the prosecution would seek more stern punishment to him.

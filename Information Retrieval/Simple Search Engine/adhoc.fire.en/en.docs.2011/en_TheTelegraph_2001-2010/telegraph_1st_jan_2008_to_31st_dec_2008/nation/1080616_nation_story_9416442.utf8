          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Anita Durrani arrives home in Noida on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: Dentist Nupur Talwar, whose daughter Aarushi and household help Hemraj were found murdered on the night of May 15, has been put through a lie-detector test.        
	The CBI said she took the test three days ago.        
	Nupur and her husband Rajesh, who is in custody as a suspect in the double murder, claim they slept through the killings in their Noida home.        
	Nupur was made to take the lie test because she was present at the crime scene. Also, the CBI wanted to crosscheck the statements of Rajesh, a dentist like his wife, and his compounder Krishna, who has also been arrested.        
	Aarushis mother is not being treated as a suspect yet, the CBI added.         
	CBI joint director Arun Kumar, who is in charge of the case and had led a search of the Talwar residence yesterday, tried to figure out the timing of the crime. He went from Krishnas L-14 residence to the Talwars L-32 through the terrace. Guards, security supervisors and a garbage collector were questioned.         
	The investigators also visited the Sector 53 residence of Anita and Praful Durrani, close friends and partners of the Talwars at their clinic, for a few minutes to inspect the servants room. The Durranis help, Rajkumar, has also been questioned in the double murder.        
	Nupur and Rajesh Talwars brother visited the arrested dentist at Dasna Jail today.

	Cuttack, Feb. 8: Entire Choudwar area here wore a deserted look in the second-half of the day today as Orissa Textile Mills Bachao Sangathan activists observed a bandh in the area.        
	Even as no untoward incident was reported, the traffic on NH-42 was disrupted for some time as the Sangathan activists squatted on the road demanding revival of the mill.        
	Initially the bandh received a lukewarm response. Around mid-day shop owners and business establishments pulled down shutters as the Sangathan activists marched through the streets raising slogans against the governments apathy in reviving the mills.        
	Sangathan president Jagannath Nayak said: The bandh received a near total response. Markets, trade, institutions and offices remained closed for the day. Government institutions remained open, but the attendance was thin.         
	The administration deployed three platoons of police to ward off any violence and collector Sujata Kartikeyan monitored the situation throughout the day.        
	Mill workers have been on a dharna for the past 28 months demanding settlement of dues and revival of the mill.         
	When the mill closed down in 2003, the state government had committed to settle the dues of 3,739 employees either under the voluntary retirement scheme or under voluntary separation scheme. But, the promise has not been fulfilled till today.

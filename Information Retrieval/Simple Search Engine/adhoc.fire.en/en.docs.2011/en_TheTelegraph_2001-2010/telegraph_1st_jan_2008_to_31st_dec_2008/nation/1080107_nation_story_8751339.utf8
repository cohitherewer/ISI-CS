	Patna, Jan. 6 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday accused the Centre and former RJD government for the power scarcity in the state.
    
	The acute shortage of electricity that Bihar is facing right now is because of the Centres failure to cater to our requirements. Against the daily requirement of 1,150MW, the Centre supplies about 700-750MW, he said. At present, Bihar purchases power from central sectors, including 959MW from NTPC.
    
	Bihars per capita consumption is just 60KWH per year, as compared to the national average of 354.75KWH per year. We have made significant moves in revenue generation and checking pilferage, rampant during the RJD days. But, it is not enough, Kumar added. Sources said, Bihars electricity board is in a dire financial crunch. 
    
	The board purchases power worth Rs 118 crore every month, but collects only Rs 75 crore as revenue. It has costs of Rs 51.71 crore per month and suffers a deficit of Rs 107 crore.

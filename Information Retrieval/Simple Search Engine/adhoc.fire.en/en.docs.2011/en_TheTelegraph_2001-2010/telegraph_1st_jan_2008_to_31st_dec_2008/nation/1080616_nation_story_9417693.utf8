          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, June 15: Teachers are on the warpath in Andhra Pradesh against a recent decision to introduce English as the medium of instruction in government schools.        
	Led by prominent academic and member of legislative council (MLC) Chukka Ramaiah, the teachers began a relay hunger strike on June 12.        
	Teachers associations say the government has caused confusion by introducing the CBSE curriculum in 6,500 schools without adequate recruitment of English teachers.        
	We dont have English teachers in half the government schools. How can English as a medium of instruction be introduced in all classes without proper textbooks and teachers? Ramaiah said.        
	He said an English-medium school had been launched in Warangal district where an intermediate student was appointed English teacher, leading to utter chaos.        
	He also questioned the logic of introducing the CBSE course when students have to appear for intermediate examinations and entrance tests for professional courses on the basis of the state syllabus. If you want to strengthen English skills, better enrol students for crash courses in Jawahar knowledge centres, he said.        
	English as a medium of instruction has been launched in 6,500 schools as part of a Rs 10,000-crore centrally funded programme called Success. Opponents of the move say the state school education ministry hastily selected the schools without assessing the faculty and the students.        
	School education minister D. Rajanarasimha defended the decision, saying it would place boys and girls from rural areas on a par with students from urban schools.        
	The minister said the shortage of teachers and textbooks would be resolved in a few days. We have announced re-employment of retired teachers for two more years, and textbooks are on their way from NCERT depots.        
	Sources said the governments move was aimed at generating more students for the mushrooming engineering colleges, where over 35 per cent seats were left vacant last year for lack of candidates.        
	Andhra has some 350 professional colleges with 2.5 lakh engineering and 20,000 medical seats.

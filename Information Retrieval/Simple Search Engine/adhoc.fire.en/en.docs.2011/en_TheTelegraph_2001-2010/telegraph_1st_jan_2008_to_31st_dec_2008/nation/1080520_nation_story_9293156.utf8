                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leslie slams media
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 19: First Raja Acharya bothered her. Now Oriya actress Leslie Tripathy is irked with the Oriya media.         
	A few of them out there are sabotaging my reputation and my career airing mindless rumours just for the sake of TRP, said the actress today.         
	Leslie reached the State Human Rights Commission today to lodge a complaint against an Oriya channel that aired a programme yesterday on her friendship with Raja Acharya and how it proved disastrous for her and Bidusmita.        
	Last evening, the actress lodged a complaint against an Oriya newspaper that carried an item alleging that the album actresses was into pornographic films.         
	My fault is that I dared to speak against a gangster who was intimidating my friends. How can the media play with my reputation just for the sake of money? she argued.        
	Earlier, too, the actress had approached the womens commission objecting to the way her story was being tackled by the media. At that time a notice was served on a media house, asking it to air programmes after verifying facts with the starlet. But they never did that. And the same allegations are all over the paper. I feel disgusted, she added.         
	Though the actress seems distraught, no single activist or woman approached the starlet to help her with a word of encouragement. Leslie approached the police and they arrested those responsible. There is nothing more to do. Moreover, she hasnt approached us for help, said Tapasi Praharaj, a noted activist.         
	How is this (circumstance) my fault? Was it because I dared to stand up and speak up against a gangster who was threatening me? Leslie asked.         
	The actress also complained that the controversy was affecting her professional career. Not a single industry person has called me since the controversy. No director and no producers are calling up. Offers have stopped coming, she said.

             Sarkozy: R-Day agony
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Nicolas Sarkozy will watch the Russian-origin Smerch rocket launchers, Tungushka missiles and T-90 tanks roll down Rajpath during the Republic Day parade and wonder what might have been with a $650-million helicopter order that Delhi held out tantalisingly for Paris.
    
	The European consortium led by French and German firms led the race for the order to sell 197 helicopters to the Indian Army but the defence ministry cancelled the tender in November because of suspected extra-legal means used to tweak the specifications. 
    
	The move irked France which thought it had pipped the US Bell Textron for the order. Paris also sought an explanation but India has moved quickly to issue a global order again. 
    
	Were it not for the cancellation, the contract for the order might have been signed during the French Presidents trip and would have lent his visit more substance than the absence of Carla Bruni. 
    
	But France, one of Indias smaller but traditional military suppliers, will still look to win a multi-billion dollar contract from the Indian Air Force, cashing in on Pariss diplomatic support for Delhi after the 1998 nuclear tests.
    
	France has offered to upgrade the IAFs Mirage aircraft  which was originally sourced from Dassault Aviation  for 1.5 billion euros. The French firm Thales is optimistic that the order will be awarded during Sarkozys visit. French companies are facing stiff competition from Israeli firms.
    
	Two years ago, an exasperated France decided that it had waited too long for further orders for the Mirage aircraft and said it was winding up its assembly line. 
    
	Although a favourite with Indian fighter pilots, the Mirage-200-V was seen to be too expensive and, last year, India finally issued a global tender to six makers to buy 126 multi-role combat aircraft.
    
	Earlier, France lost out to the UK in the race to sell 66 advanced jet trainers to India.
    
	In 2006, the Indian Navy contracted six Scorpene submarines for about $3 billion.
    
	France is hoping that its Rafale fighter will be seriously considered in the race but it stands only an outside chance after the US Superhornet and F-16, the Swedish Gripen and the Russian MiG-35. An IAF source said the Rafale has also not yet been sold outside France.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 23: Mamata Jena, an undertrial prisoner lodged in Jharpada special jail, is undergoing treatment for her burn injuries at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.        
	Mamata attempted suicide yesterday by setting herself on fire. With more than 80 per cent injuries, chances of her survival are little, said hospital doctors.        
	The 35-year-old lodged in jail since September 2006 on charges of murdering her daughter, had poured kerosene on herself from a lantern provided to prisoners and set herself on fire inside a bathroom. The jail authorities today revealed that the inmate had attempted to kill herself in the past, too.         
	A few months ago, the suicide of a 55-year-old in the Jharpada special jail had raised demands of psychiatric units in prisons. For now, the state has four psychiatrists for 13,000 prisoners.         
	Of the total inmates of prisons, some 400 of them lodged in 70 jails in the state have been diagnosed with psychological disorders. Such inmates are often suicide-prone.         
	However, the dearth of psychiatrists in the state has rendered the prison administration helpless to tackle the situation.        
	Doctors generally do not wish to work with jail inmates. The reason for this is money, said inspector-general of prisons V. Thygarajan, adding that the police and the administration were working towards a solution. While only 19 jails of the state have a doctor, others have been managing with a pharmacist. Currently, 3,783 prisoners are lodged in 70 state jails that include four circle jails, nine district jails, two special jails and six special sub-jails.         
	The four psychiatrists have been placed at four major circle jails at Baripada, Berhampur, Choudwar and Sambalpur. Jharpada special jail currently has no doctor and manages with a part-time specialist.

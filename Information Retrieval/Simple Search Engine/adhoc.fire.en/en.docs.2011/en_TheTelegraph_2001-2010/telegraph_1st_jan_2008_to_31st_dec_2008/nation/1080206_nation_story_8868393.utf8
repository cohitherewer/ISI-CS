          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: A BPO boss found guilty of failing to provide security to an employee who was raped and murdered on her way home has requested the Supreme Court for a fresh hearing days after it cleared his prosecution.        
	The lawyers of Som Mittal, the current Nasscom chief, have argued that there were differences of opinion between the judges, H.K. Sema and Markandey Katju, who handed the ruling on January 29.        
	Pratibha Shrikant Murthy, an HP GlobalSoft employee in Bangalore, was raped and murdered around 2am on October 13, 2005. A case was lodged against Mittal, then the firms managing director, for failing to provide the security required for women on night shifts. Punishments in such cases involve no jail term, only a fine. Before the apex court, Mittal had appealed in the high court. Both had ruled in favour of prosecution.        
	Mittals lawyers have seized on Justice Katjus remarks that there were differences between the two judges on the powers to quash FIRs under Section 482 of the CrPC.        
	This isnt the first time Katju has invited controversy. In December, he, along with Justice A.K. Mathur, had delivered the judicial overreach verdict that suggested courts were encroaching on the powers of the executive.        
	That judgment created confusion among judges about the kind of public interest cases they could take up, prompting some in high courts to stop hearing such suits.        
	The confusion ended only after Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan clarified that nothing would come in the courts way in defending the rights and liberties of citizens.        
	In Mittals case, Sema was said to be of the view that the powers to quash FIRs must be used only in the rarest of rare cases. Katju appeared to favour a more active role for courts.        
	Some states such as Uttar Pradesh, Katju said, dont have provisions for anticipatory bail. This means a person can be arrested immediately after an FIR is filed. Katju believes courts should intervene to prevent such arbitrary arrests.         
	Sema referred the matter to the chief justice. Today, the bench headed by Balakrishnan considered whether to hear the case again or deal with the powers to quash FIRs first.        
	Balakrishnans three-judge bench is in a bind. A larger bench can only set aside a two-judge bench decision if it is not unanimous. It cannot dismiss a concurring decision. Mittals lawyers have latched on to the differences among the judges to press for a fresh hearing.        
	Legally, the court cannot hear the case again, but if it doesnt, Mittals lawyers could cry foul. If it does, it could set a wrong precedent. The chief justices bench reserved its verdict.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: BJP leader L.K. Advani has told the Prime Minister that Jammu could not be victimised anymore because the Valley has a psyche, insisting that the only solution was restoration of the land transfer to the Amarnath Shrine Board.        
	The focus on the alleged discrimination against Jammu signals a tactical shift as the BJP has so far concentrated its firepower on the special treatment for Kashmir. The demand that the special treatment be scrapped was seen as the BJPs perceived anti-minority agenda.        
	The party hopes the new thrust on the alleged victimisation on Jammu would resonate deeper and wider in the country against the backdrop of Amarnath land controversy and it comes amid suggestions by some fringe groups that the state be bifurcated.        
	In a seven age letter sent yesterday to the Prime Minister, Advani has also warned the government against surrendering to separatist forces by underestimating the nationalist feelings of Jammu.        
	Let it be clearly understood. The problem in J amp;K today is not Hindu versus Muslim; nor is it even Jammu region versus the Valley. It is essentially nationalists versus separatists, Advani said.         
	The letter devotes several paragraphs to the discrimination. The people of Jammu have suffered from a gross discrimination in matters relating to the governance of the state. The census is not fairly and regularly done. The delimitation is deferred; there is discrimination in the matter of public employment, disbursal of funds and development of the region.         
	The letter added: Jammu is told on each occasion that the Kashmir Valley has a psyche and, therefore, the government is to submit to that psyche and if fairness is shown to the people of Jammu, the psyche of the Valley will be hurt. Recent events have shown that the people of Jammu are now determined to assert in order to claim their fair share.         
	The leader of Opposition said: There is a huge sense of hurt and injury in Indian public opinion which has resulted in the nationalist opinion being alienated because the separatists have to be pleased. Can the group of nationalists who raise slogans in support of their motherland even when they protest be equated to separatists who foment trouble in our country?        
	Advanis letter suggests that the BJP is in no mood to dilute its belligerence and the efforts of the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to persuade them to see the larger national cause have drawn a blank.

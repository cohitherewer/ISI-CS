	Srinagar, April 9: Police have arrested a suspected Hindu militant of the Lashkar-e-Toiba from Ramban district in Jammu.        
	Several Hindu militants have been either killed or arrested in recent years but most of them belonged to the Hizb-ul Mujahideen. It is perhaps the first case where a Hindu with links to Lashkar has been arrested, Jammu police chief K. Rajendra said.        
	The police said Rashpal Singh, a PCO owner in Ramban, was arrested during a raid last evening and a grenade was recovered from him.         
	He is an overground worker of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. We are questioning him to ascertain how he joined the militant group and what was his motivation, Rajendra said.         
	Police sources said Singh got the grenade from another Lashkar militant, Fareed.

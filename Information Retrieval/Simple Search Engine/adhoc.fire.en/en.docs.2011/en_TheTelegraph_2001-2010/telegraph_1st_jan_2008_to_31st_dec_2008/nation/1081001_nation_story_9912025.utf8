          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 30: With the state government deciding to explore and develop the Tangarpada mines under a joint venture between the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation of Orissa Limited (Idcol) and Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC), the fate of chromite reserves in Dhenkanal is back to square one after 22 years.        
	Though fresh tenders were accepted from Jindal Strips Limited, Visa Industries and Tisco for a joint project following a Supreme Court order in February this year, the state government has now decided not to involve private players in the venture.        
	The decision was taken, sources said, on the basis of the recommendation of the high-level committee after looking into the technical and financial bids of the three private companies. The panel had recommended for allowing Idcol to retain the mines and go for exploration and subsequent value addition in view of its improved financial position, official sources said.         
	Exploration and development of Tangarpada chromite reserves have not been possible for the past 22 years apparently due to the laggard attitude of Idcol and legal wrangle since 2003 over leasing out 500 acres of land for a joint venture. Initially, Idcol was granted lease of Tangarapada mines in 1986. But it failed to sow anything there.         
	In 2002-03 the government, through the corporation, floated a global tender and awarded Jindal Strips Limited the lease for a joint venture project envisaging exploration, extraction and value addition to ore at Tangarapada. The project, however, made no headway as the high court clamped an interim injunction till disposal of writ petitions filed by VISA Industries and Tisco challenging the governments decision. Leasing out of the Tangarpada mines courted controversy when the high court in November, 2004 indicted the state government of granting approval for the joint venture project with Jindal Strips Limited. The officials of the industrial corporation had not considered the effect of incentives and exemptions claimed by Jindal Strips on the state exchequer, the high court had remarked. If exemption is granted to Jindal Strips for 20 years in respect of sales tax and entry tax, the government would lose revenue to the extent of Rs 20,000 crore over 20 years, the high court had further observed while quashing the deal.

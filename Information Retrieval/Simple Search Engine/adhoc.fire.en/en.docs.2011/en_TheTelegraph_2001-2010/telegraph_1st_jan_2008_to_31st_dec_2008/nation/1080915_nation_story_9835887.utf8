          SANJAY K. JHA                                             
	Bangalore, Sept. 14: The BJP national executive today decided to hold conventions for first-time voters in every constituency to target the youth between 18 and 20.         
	The party has asked all its frontal organisations to get cracking on the project.         
	The idea struck the partys prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, when a leader from Andhra Pradesh, Indrasen Reddy, was making a presentation on such a convention he held in an Assembly segment in his state. Around 8,000 boys and girls had come to the meet and appeared happy at being noticed by a national political party.         
	Advani grabbed the idea. He immediately made an unscheduled intervention to stress the importance of this project. He asked the party apparatus at the district levels to reach out to the young voters and convince them that the BJP needed their support to make India strong.         
	The Yuva Morcha and the Mahila Morcha (youth and womens wings) were asked to take up the assignment with urgency. The conventions will be called Pratham Matdata Samman Abhiyan (Felicitation campaign of first-time voters).         
	The womens wing was asked to hunt for talented girls and persuade them to begin an association with the party. All party wings were advised to establish contact with apolitical organisations.         
	One of the decisions that the election management committee took at the executive was to aggressively sell the lotus symbol in different forms and do everything to highlight Advanis political persona. His long stint of 60 years, his contributions to modern-day politics, his commitments, his qualities will be highlighted. And then we will ask if the rival (party) has anyone to match him, senior leader Venkaiah Naidu said.         
	The partys central office will print literature on the achievements of various BJP governments and the failures of the Congress. These will be distributed to BJP workers at the district and block level.         
	The workers have also been asked to go on an aggressive fund-collection drive in all constituencies. An in-charge for every Lok Sabha constituency, other than the candidate, will be announced shortly.

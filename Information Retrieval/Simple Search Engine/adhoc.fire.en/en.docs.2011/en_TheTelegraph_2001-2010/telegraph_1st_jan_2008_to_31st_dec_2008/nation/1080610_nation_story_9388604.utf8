          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi. June 9: The mother of murdered Noida schoolgirl Aarushi Talwar (in picture) today approached Indias apex child rights commission to stop television soap-maker Ekta Kapoor from dramatising the events leading up to Aarushis death.         
	Nupur Talwar asked the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to help prevent any screen depiction of the controversial case in which her husband and Aarushis father, Rajesh, is the prime accused.         
	Aarushi, 14, was murdered on May 15. Reports have suggested that Kapoor plans to introduce the case in one of her serials, Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki. Neither Kapoor nor any official from Balaji Telefilms, her production house, has confirmed the reports.         
	NCPCR member Sandhya Bajaj said the commission planned to take action against any television serial producer or film maker who tries to use Aarushis murder for commercial interests.         
	Filmmakers and producers appear to be in a real hurry to cash in on this case, which is fresh in the publics mind. Any television serial or film on the dead girl at present would comprise a violation of child rights in our opinion, Bajaj said.         
	NCPCR sources said the commission is likely to issue a notice to Balaji Telefilms tomorrow.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 26: BJPs Karnatak success has emboldened Bihar party rebels to step up their campaign against deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi.         
	The (Kanataka) success will help the high command to take strong action based our demand, remarked a rebel leader. About 12 dissidents had dinner at the home of the dropped minister, Chandramohan Rais, home last night where the oust Modi strategy was chalked out.         
	Some six rebels left for New Delhi last night itself, while the rest left for the national capital today.         
	Sources in the dissident group revealed that the rebels are likely to talk to 30-35 BJP MLAs out of the 55 gathering in New Delhi and meet senior leaders such as L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jetlie to remind them of their promises.         
	The rebels state that the high command had asked them to stay quiet till the Karnatak polls were over and the rebels did just so far.         
	We have apprised the high command that we would not settle on anything less than a replacement of Modi in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls due within a year now, said a dissident leader, adding: We need a stronger leader to spearhead our partys poll campaign.         
	Rebellion broke out in the BJP soon after chief minister Nitish Kumar reshuffled his council of ministers on April 13 dropping Chandramohan Rai and others from his ministry. The ministers held Modi responsible and embarked on oust Modi campaign.               
	The pivot of the rebellion is said to be the new health minister and BJP leader Nandkishore Yadav who wishes to replace Modi, as the legislature party leader in Bihar. Prior to the reshuffle, Nandkishore was the road construction minister.

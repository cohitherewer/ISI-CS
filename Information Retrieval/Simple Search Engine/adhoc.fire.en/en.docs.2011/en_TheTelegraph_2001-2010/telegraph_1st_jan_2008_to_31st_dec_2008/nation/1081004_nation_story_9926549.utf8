	Mumbai, Oct. 3: Nationalist Congress Party minister Chhagan Bhujbal today withdrew an 11-year-old defamation case against his former mentor Bal Thackeray, ostensibly because of the Shiv Sena chiefs frailty and old age.        
	Accompanied by Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, Bhujbal today walked into a Bandra court to withdraw the case he had filed after a Saamna editorial alleged he had a hand in the desecration of an Ambedkar statue.                    
	Bhujbal, who quit the Sena and joined Sharad Pawars NCP over 15 years ago, said he had received a letter from the executive editor of Saamna requesting him to withdraw the case. Bal Thackeray is editor-in-chief of the Sena mouthpiece.        
	The case, filed in a Nashik court, was transferred to Mumbai on Bhujbals request and was to come up for hearing soon. Ten residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar, a Dalit pocket in suburban Ghatkopar, had been killed in violence that erupted after the statue was damaged in 1997.        
	My decision has nothing to do with politics. I have withdrawn the case keeping in mind the Sena chiefs age and failing health. I am very happy in the NCP and there is no question of leaving the party, Bhujbal said.        
	His move has, however, created a flutter in political circles. Over the past two years, there have been persistent rumours that Bhujbal is not in a good way in the NCP and would quit if things got worse.        
	Once a trusted aide of Thackeray, Bhujbals relations with the Sena chief soured after Manohar Joshi was given priority over him. He defected from the Sena in 1991 and joined the Congress, subsequently moving to the NCP.        
	When the first Congress-NCP government came to power in 1999, Bhujbal was crowned chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs deputy and given charge of the home ministry.        
	He was then repeatedly targeted by the Sena-BJP for alleged links with fake stamps kingpin, Abdul Karim Telgi. Although Bhujbal denied any such thing, the oppositions campaign led to his removal from both posts in January 2004.        
	His political humiliation continued when the Congress-NCP alliance returned to power in October 2004. While Bhujbals junior, R.R. Patil, was made deputy chief minister, he was given charge of the public works department.        
	Bhujbals battle with the Sena has been an ongoing one. Soon after he quit that party, he had to go underground for fear of attacks by Sena workers. In 1996, he made murder allegations against Raj Thackeray. In 2000, he ordered Bal Thackerays arrest over a provocative editorial he had written during the 1993 riots.        
	He, however, began reviving his relationship with Bal Thackeray after he got sidelined in the NCP. He would visit the Sena chief on his birthdays and make gestures to endear himself to the Thackeray family.        
	NCP state chief Arun Gujarati dismissed speculation that Bhujbal could rejoin the Sena. Its just a personal gesture from him. The NCP is busy making preparations for Bhujbals 61st birthday.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nehru amp;   a rapist? Change   his name
                                        
	New Delhi, June 11: Jawaharlal Nehru may have to change his name.        
	What?        
	Yes, thats a possibility. But before you explode in indignation, its not the countrys first Prime Minister we are talking about, but a rape convict who happens to share his name with the late icon.        
	Nehru, the convict, today left the Supreme Court, his ears stinging, after the outraged bench said such criminals had no right to share their name with exalted national leaders.        
	You have committed a rape and share the name with Jawaharlal Nehru? the bench thundered. It is a disgrace to the national ethos.        
	Judges Arijit Pasayat and P.P. Naolekar reserved their judgment but said it was high time something was done to change the names of criminals named after national icons.        
	We think it is time we should do something on this issue, the court said.        
	The bench also voiced displeasure over lapses in a medical report submitted by a doctor.        
	We feel the government should proceed departmentally against the doctor for giving such a report, the judges said.        
	Earlier, Shishir Pinaki, the court appointed amicus curiae, or friend of the court, had filed a report seeking Nehrus acquittal on the ground that there were discrepancies in the prosecutions theory.        
	He said there were inaccuracies in the FIR and there was no medical evidence to corroborate the rape charge.        
	Pinaki also said the victim and her mother had implicated Nehru as he had refused to buy firewood from them.        
	The prosecution claims that Nehru had raped the woman in 1988, then a 16-year-old, in Rajendra Nand Gaon in Chhattisgarh, then part of Madhya Pradesh.        
	A sessions court jailed Nehru for seven years but the high court reduced the sentence to five years in 2001.        
	Nehru then moved the Supreme Court.                    WRITTEN WITH PTI REPORTS

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Plan: Battling cyclone                                   
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 22: Orissa, which has faced natural disasters 125 times during the past 107 years, will formulate a long-term action plan of Rs 16,000 crore for mitigation of such calamities, including tsunamis.        
	According to the disaster management department, Orissa has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 17,385 crore during 1994-2007 because of devastation caused by floods, super cyclones and other storms that hit the state, especially in the coastal districts.        
	Against this backdrop, the need for formulating a long-term action plan by the government was felt by the Assembly committee on natural calamity. The committee, which met here yesterday, decided to submit a memorandum to the Prime Minister seeking central assistance to the tune of Rs 16,000 for mitigation of impacts of various natural disasters, said a member of the committee.        
	The memorandum will include proposals for a cyclone risk mitigation project (Rs 609 crore), coastal protection (Rs 361 crore), Mahanadi basin development (Rs 3,491 crore), construction of multipurpose shelters in flood-prone areas (Rs 500 crore), discharge of flood waters (Rs 1,243 crore), desiltation of river mouths (Rs 623 crore) and Subernarekha renovation project (Rs 794 crore).        
	The Centre would be requested to provide 90 per cent of the costs, while the state government would bear 10 per cent of the burden. The funds requirement was estimated for spending during the periods 2010-11 and 2014-15.        
	 A sub-committee was constituted under the chairmanship of former minister Damodar Rout to study the proposals prepared by the disaster management department and incorporate suitable new proposals. The committee also criticised the functioning of the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority. While Opposition lambasted the failure of the authority in disaster preparedness and response, ruling party members shifted the blame on the Centres apathy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hike in air damages 
                            
	New Delhi, April 30: The Lok Sabha today passed by voice vote a bill that will raise the compensation paid to victims of air accidents or for damage to baggage or cargo.        
	The compensation for death or injury will be increased to $140,000 from the existing $20,000 once the bill becomes law, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.        
	Compensation for damage to checked baggage will increase from $20 a kg to $1,400 per passenger. For cargo, the compensation will be increased from $20 a kg to $24 a kg.         
	The choice of jurisdiction is to be expanded to include the place of domicile of passengers, if the airline has a presence there. This will mean an Indian will be able to file a claim in India for a journey undertaken abroad.        
	The Carriage by Air (Amendment) Bill, tabled last year, was adopted after Patel said the legislation would enable payment of better compensation to air travellers and bring it on a par with global levels.

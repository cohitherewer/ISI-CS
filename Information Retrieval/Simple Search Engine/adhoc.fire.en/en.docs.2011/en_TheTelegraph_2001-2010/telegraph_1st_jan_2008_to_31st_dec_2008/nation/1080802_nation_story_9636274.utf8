	Excerpts from Speaker Somnath Chatterjees first official statement after he was expelled from the CPM:              
	Saddest day        
	23 July, 2008, has been one of the saddest days of my life, when I was informed through the media of the summary expulsion from my membership of the CPI(M) for seriously compromising the position of the Party. The expulsion has meant cessation of my long association with the Party for nearly 40 years. I recall the day when soon after my election in 1971 to Lok Sabha as an Independent Candidate with the support of the Party, Com. Pramode Dasgupta, one of the builders of the Party, who was the inspiration for all members, asked me to become a Member, which I could not possibly refuse. Then I felt very happy that I had become a Member of the Party.        
	Duty first        
	The Speaker of Lok Sabha, like Speakers of other elected Assemblies, while acting as such does not and cannot represent any political party and in the discharge of his or her duties and functions, the Speaker did not and does not owe allegiance to any political party and does not support any Party and consistent with that position, I have scrupulously kept myself away from all political activities whatsoever.        
	First hint        
	On 6 July 2008 when the General Secretary of the Party met me to explain generally the Partys stand on the issue of the Nuclear Deal, I was informed that the Party had not even discussed any matter concerning me. On the morning of 9 July, 2008, the General Secretary telephonically conveyed that a section of the Party felt that my continuance as Speaker may be untenable, however, it was stated that the final decision would be taken by me.        
	List surprise        
	On 9 July 2008, I was surprised to learn from the media that my name was mentioned in the communication to the Honble Rashtrapatiji, without any intimation to or discussion with me. Till today, I have not seen nor has been shown any copy of the communication sent by the Party to the Rashtrapatiji. Significantly, after the leaders of different Left Parties met the Honble Rashtrapatiji, at the press conference that was held, the General Secretary of CPI(M) categorically reiterated that it was for the Speaker himself to decide his course of action.        
	On Speakers role        
	In the computation of the strength of either the ruling party or its allies or of the Opposition, no responsible person or authority can treat the Speaker as belonging to or extending support either to the Government or its allies or to the Opposition. Thus the question of the Speaker withdrawing support to the Government can never arise. It is only the House as a whole which can decide whether the Speaker should continue to remain as such or not, apart from his / her own decision to relinquish, if there is any such occasion.        
	Leaders stand        
	On several occasions since 9 July, 2008, the General Secretary and other important members of the Party reiterated that as Speaker it was for me alone to decide on my stand in the matter. It is important to recall in this connection the press statement issued by the General Secretary of the CPI(M) on 14 July, 2008 in which he stated that:        
	A lot of speculation is going on in the media regarding the position of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Comrade Somnath Chatterjee. I have already stated that any decision will be taken by the Speaker himself. This has been reiterated by the Speaker through a statement by his office on July 10, 2008. We do not want the office of the Speaker being dragged into any unnecessary controversy.        
	In spite of repeated and clearest announcements by the General Secretary of the CPI(M) that it was wholly left to me as Speaker to decide my course of action, unfortunately there were continuing speculations about my possible resignation from the Office of Speaker.        
	Verbal order        
	In the afternoon of 20 July, 2008, for the first time I was verbally told by a member of the Politburo that it was the decision of the Party that I should resign and vote against the Motion and when I refused, subsequently it was suggested that I should resign as Speaker and may not attend the House to cast my vote. I informed him of my inability to accept such decision or to act upon the same, as it will seriously compromise the constitutional position of the Speaker. The Party should have appreciated that as Speaker I did not represent it nor could it at all give any direction to me with regard to the discharge of my functions as Speaker. I reiterate this with all the emphasis at my command.        
	During my nearly 4 decades in Parliament, I have tried my best to discharge my functions true to our Parliamentary traditions. With that experience and opportunity to serve the country as a Member of Parliament, which is the highest Constitutional Forum chosen by the people for the purposes enshrined in our Constitution, I could not and cannot in my conscience accept a position which would totally compromise the sanctity of the most important legislative office in the country. After weighing the pros and cons, I have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the Constitution of India at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti-party.        
	Canard        
	It is a canard to allege that I have done so to help any party or parties or on some other personal considerations. I strongly and categorically deny these wholly baseless allegations.        
	Long before the present controversy had arisen, I had declared openly my intention not to contest any further election and to devote the remaining period of my life in the service of the people.        
	Temporary exit        
	In view of the controversies that are now being raised based on a Partys contention that while as Speaker, a Member of Parliament should continue to be under the direction and control of the Party, a convention should start now that during his/her tenure as Speaker, a Member should temporarily resign from the membership of the Party and not face a situation which compromises the position of the Speaker vis-a-vis his or her Party.        
	Big support         
	I wish to express my sincere thanks and gratitude for the overwhelming support from the people from different parts of the country and abroad, who have sent messages supporting the stand taken by me based on the Constitutional position. Such responses, which I find unprecedented, emphasize the peoples desire that Parliament should function properly and discharge its role in serious and responsible manner and give me renewed strength to continue to fulfil my obligations and responsibilities as the Speaker during my tenure.

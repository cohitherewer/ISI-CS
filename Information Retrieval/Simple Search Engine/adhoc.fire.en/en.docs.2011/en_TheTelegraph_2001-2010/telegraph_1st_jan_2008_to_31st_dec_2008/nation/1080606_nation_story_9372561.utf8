The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM cycles, colleagues fall by wayside
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CM cycles, colleagues fall by wayside
                              Chauhan (waving) cycles to Vallabh Bhavan in Bhopal on Thursday. Picture by Saeed Faruqui                                   
	The chief minister thought the best way to attack was to hit the streets. It turned out to be a trial of strength for his cabinet.        
	The smokers huffed and puffed. Those more spiritual cursed their fondness for long liquid sessions during evenings.        
	By the time the protest was halfway through, some of the cycle warriors had called it quits.        
	Led by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, almost the entire BJP cabinet in Madhya Pradesh had hit the streets this afternoon against the Centres decision to hike oil prices.        
	But the states rulers had probably not reckoned with the steep gradients on the two-and-a-half-kilometre stretch between the chief ministers 6 Shyamla Hills residence and state secretariat Vallabh Bhavan. To be fair, the temperature was around 42Cwhen the bicycle protest started around 3.30.         
	Chauhan, 48, a vegetarian and non-smoker, and ministers Jagdish Deora, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Kamal Patel, Rustam Singh and Gopal Bhargava had little trouble covering the distance. But the rest struggled.        
	A closer look revealed something else: their bodyguards struggled more as they jogged behind their masters.        
	Ministers who trailed behind their colleagues or pulled out midway blamed their cycles. The new bicycles, said one, had not been properly oiled. The more ingenious ones rued the absence of bells. They said they had called off their protest for the sake of road safety.        
	Vijayvargiya, who is in charge of the public works department, said it was his second protest of the day.         
	The minister was earlier in hometown Indore in the company of party veteran M. Venkaiah Naidu. While Naidu had climbed on to a bullock cart, Vijayvargiya had his cycle.        
	A good outing to mark World Environment Day, too, he said.        
	At the busy Roshanpura roundabout, the ministerial contingent ran into a crowd of enthusiastic boys and girls.        
	The youngsters initially thought the chief minister and his men had come to join them in saving the environment. It didnt take them long to find out that Earth was the last thing on the ministers minds today.

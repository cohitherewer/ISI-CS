          CITHARA PAUL                           A poster of the Incredible India campaign                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The tourism ministrys Incredible India campaign is set to get a makeover after the Mumbai attacks that killed around 20 foreigners.        
	Countries such as the US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, from where a large number of tourists visit India, have issued travel advisories to citizens warning against the terror threat here.         
	With so many countries expressing fears about the safety of tourists in India, we thought it unwise to carry on with the current Incredible India campaign, a tourism ministry official said.         
	The new campaign, according to sources, would focus on security and have foreigners in the lead. We want to tell the world India is a safe destination for tourists. We are planning to use foreign tourists themselves to convey this message. We hope it will help us regain the confidence of the tourists, a source in the ministry said.         
	The official said the new campaign would include footage of comments by foreigners now visiting the country. The fact that there are many foreign nationals who have braved all rumours and visited India even after the Mumbai terror attack would convey the right message, said the official.        
	The idea is to convey the message that all locations in India are safe. The ministry will also conduct separate programmes through the 16 sub-centres in different parts of the world to convey the same message.         
	Foreign companies in India are also reassessing their security to cope with changing threats, risk consultants said.        
	India was seen as a relatively safe place to do business until last week despite a slew of bomb attacks in 2008, they said.         
	But the assault on two five-star hotels, usually seen as among the most secure places to stay, has thrown the security equation into disarray, analysts said.        
	These attacks have dumbfounded everyone, said Steven Dunn, director of Dynamiq, an Australian-owned security and risk firm.        
	Foreign companies are hastily upgrading security, with measures ranging from hiring more security personnel, beefing up surveillance and moving employees to lower-profile locations.

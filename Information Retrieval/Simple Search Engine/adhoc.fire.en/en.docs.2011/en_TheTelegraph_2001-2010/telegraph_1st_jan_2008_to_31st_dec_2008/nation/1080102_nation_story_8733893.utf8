 run riot 
 in Kochi 

                    
	Kochi, Jan. 1 (PTI): Foreign tourists were allegedly harassed by revellers during New Year festivities on a Kochi beach.
    
	Many of them made a hurried exit from Fort Kochi beach last night after being virtually driven to tears by the revellers.
    
	Some youngsters allegedly misbehaved with the teenage daughter of a Swedish tourist, Christon, who had come to Kochi to celebrate the New Year with his family, police said.
    
	We respect Indian women and expect the same from Indian men towards our ladies, an angry Christon said, adding that such behaviour would only harm the states interests.
    
	Another woman, who was part of a group of foreign tourists, was also allegedly molested, the police said.
    
	A posse of police personnel posted at the venue failed to control the molesters.
    
	Although the tourists have not lodged any complaint, the police have registered a case, city commissioner Manoj Abraham said.
    
	A minor has been arrested.
    
	A huge Santa Claus image was burnt at the beach as part of the festivities last night.

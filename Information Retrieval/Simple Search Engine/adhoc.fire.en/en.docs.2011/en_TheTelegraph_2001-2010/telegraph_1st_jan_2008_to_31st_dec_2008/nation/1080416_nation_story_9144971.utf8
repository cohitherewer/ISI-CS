          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, April 15: Pramod Kode, who sentenced Sanjay Dutt to six years in jail last year, was today promoted as the principal judge, sessions court, casting a cloud over Abu Salems trial in the 1993 serial blasts case scheduled to begin tomorrow.         
	Kode, presiding over the special anti-terror (Tada) court since March 29, 1996, will replace A.P. Bhangale, who has been elevated as Bombay High Court judge.         
	However, it remains unclear if Kode will continue to preside over the Tada court.         
	Sources said Kode would begin the Salem trial as scheduled. It is certain that Kode will be present in the Tada court tomorrow morning to start the Abu Salem trial. We have not received any orders indicating that another judge will be appointed, a court official said.         
	According to legal sources, it is possible for Kode to continue to preside over the trial even after his promotion.         
	Salem was extradited from Portugal on November 11, 2005, on the basis of eight cases pending against him in various Indian courts. Of these, three  the 1993 blasts case and the murders of builder Pradeep Jain and actress Manisha Koiralas secretary Ajit Dewani  had been registered by Mumbai police.        
	The underworld don had appealed to Kode to include him while trying Dutt and 122 other accused in the Bombay blasts. But the judge turned him down saying that would further delay the trial.         
	Kode ruled that Salems trial would start after the Bombay Blasts Case-1 was over. As a result, Salem has been languishing in Arthur Road jail for over two years.         
	The CBI today submitted a list of 15 witnesses. The first name is of an immigration officer who was posted at Mumbai airport when Salem landed from Lisbon, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said. He will be cross-examined by defence advocate Farhana Shah tomorrow.         
	The trial is likely to be conducted on a daily basis.        
	The charges against Salem include Section 3(3) (aiding and abetting a terrorist act) of Tada, Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Arms Act and Explosives Substances Act, Nikam said.         
	Along with Salem, his associates Abdul Qayyum and Riyaz Siddiqui, both part of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, will face trial.         
	Kode will also start a separate trial for the last of the blasts accused, Mustafa Dossa alias Mustafa Majnu, the brother of absconding prime accused Mohammed Dossa, from April 22.         
	Soon after his extradition from Portugal, Salem had, in a 16-page confession, admitted to delivering three AK-56 rifles, 250 rounds of ammunition and hand grenades to Sanjays bungalow in Bandra on January 15, 1993. He was allegedly accompanied by co-accused Hanif Kadawala and Samir Hingora, owners of Magnum video.         
	The CBI had filed a supplementary chargesheet against Siddiqui and Qayyum, saying they were also present when the arms were taken to Sanjays home.

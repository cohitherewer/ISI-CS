          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Centre has announced a new promotion policy for officers in the armed forces that is aimed at reducing bias after a choke in the hierarchy has forced thousands of disputes to end up in civilian courts.         
	The policy, which defence minister A.K. Antony signed today, will be implemented from January 1, 2009.         
	We have introduced changes to remove subjectivity in the selection of officers of all ranks. In the new system, 95 per cent of the weightage will be given to the performance of an officer and 5 per cent will depend on the value judgement by the selection board, said ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar.         
	Ministry sources said the 95-5 formula has been in the works for two years but, in effect, an older policy of giving 80 per cent weightage to performance and 20 per cent to the discretionary powers of selection boards was being persisted with.        
	At the core of the new system is the allocation of marks for the duties that an officer performs. It quantifies the number of points that an officer will be granted for each medal, honour, award and battle performance.         
	For example, a Param Vir Chakra will get two marks and a Param Vishisht Seva Medal 1.25.         
	I would like the proceedings of the promotion board to be more transparent and objective. Each case of relaxation and supersession should have sufficient justification which must be clearly brought out, objective norms for the promotion and conduct of board proceedings should be laid down. This would not only check arbitrariness and ensure objectivity in assessment but also avoid criticism and litigation, Antony wrote on a file in December 2006 after the case of a disgruntled general was referred to him.         
	There are about 11,500 officers in the air force, 40,000 in the army and about 5,500 in the navy. There are vacancies for 11,000-odd officers in the army.         
	The sharp pyramid at the top of the military hierarchy means that most officers, from the ranks of brigadier upwards, have to retire if they are not found eligible for promotion.         
	The spokesperson said the new policy also specifies the conditions in which officers will not be promoted despite their standing in the merit list.         
	Among these are cases involving moral turpitude, gross negligence, acts of cowardice, un-officer-like behaviour and poor performance in combat and operational situations.         
	Officers will be rated and given points on a scale on the basis of their annual confidential reports (initiated by the immediate boss and reviewed by two superiors that will also include a self-assessment), courses attended, observations in battle performance reports, degree of difficulty in which a candidate has worked and employability in higher ranks among other criteria.                           
	Although the government moved to initiate a new promotion policy, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to work out guidelines in 2005 that will reduce the number of disputes because officers overlooked or superceded for promotion often went to court. There are more than 9,000 such disputes pending in the courts. The 80-20 formula greatly distorted a system that military headquarters claim is based on merit.         
	Among the worst of such cases was in September last year when Major General V.K. Jain, who was additional director-general (movements, operations and logistics) in army headquarters, refused to vacate his office despite being superannuated.         
	His lawyer contested that Jain was cleared for promotion as lieutenant general but was being discriminated against.         
	The army, navy, air force and the coast guard will formulate their service-linked criteria for the 5 per cent that the promotion boards will consider.

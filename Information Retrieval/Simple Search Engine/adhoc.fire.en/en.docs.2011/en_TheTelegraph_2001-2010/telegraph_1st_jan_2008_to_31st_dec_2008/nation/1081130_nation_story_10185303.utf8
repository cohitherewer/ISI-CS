	Bangalore, Nov. 29: Eleven persons were today sentenced to death and 12 to life in the 2000 church blasts.        
	Suspected members of the banned Deendar Anjuman had bombed three churches in Bangalore, Wadi and Hubli.         
	They were carrying explosives in a Maruti Omni to attack another Bangalore church when they accidentally went off. It led to the arrest of some persons who blew the lid off the conspiracy.        
	Karnataka polices Corps of Detectives took over the probe and nailed the Deendar Anjuman. The sleuths traced the men who had brought the explosives to Hyderabad.

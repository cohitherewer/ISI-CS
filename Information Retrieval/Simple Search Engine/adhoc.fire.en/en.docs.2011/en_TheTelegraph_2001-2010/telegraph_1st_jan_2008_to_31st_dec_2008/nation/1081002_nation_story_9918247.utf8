	New Delhi, Oct. 1 (PTI): The Centre today faced several tough questions from Delhi High Court for justifying the retention of penal provisions against homosexuality.        
	What is that compelling state interest to continue with such a provision like Section 377? a bench of Chief Justice A.P. Shah and Justice S. Muralidhar asked. Such people suffer from indignity and discrimination in society.        
	The court was hearing a PIL filed by gay rights activists seeking a directive to amend Section 377 of the IPC by decriminalising gay sex among consenting adults.         
	According to the section, a homosexual act is a criminal offence that invites punishment of up to life imprisonment.        
	The bench said because of the penal provision, homosexuals were not coming out in the open for treatment of HIV. Eight per cent of Indian homosexual men are HIV-infected.         
	If there is a stringent law prescribing punishment of up to life imprisonment, do you expect MSMs (man having sex with man) to come forward for treatment of HIV? the bench asked. People are living under constant fear of being prosecuted.        
	But the government contended that the problem could be tackled by educating homosexuals.         
	Demand for legalising such acts is not the answer. People indulging in such acts do not come forward because of shyness but blame the government, additional solicitor general P.P. Malhotra said.        
	The argument drew a sharp response from the judges.         
	Why dont you educate those people who go to prostitutes to prevent spread of HIV? How are you educating people to co-exist with people who are not like them? Are you telling them to view these people as doing things which are against the order of nature? the bench asked.

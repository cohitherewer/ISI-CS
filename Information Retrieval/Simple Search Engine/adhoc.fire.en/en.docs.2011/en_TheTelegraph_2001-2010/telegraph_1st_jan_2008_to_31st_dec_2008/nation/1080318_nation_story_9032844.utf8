                                                                                                               DMK scare blows over, flutter in Jaya camp
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, March 17: The scare that a slighted ally would force a contest in the Tamil Nadu Rajya Sabha elections blew over today with the PMK leaving the seat to the CPM.        
	PMK chief S. Ramadoss had wagged his finger at the ruling DMK after his party was denied a nomination. But he gave in to cajoling from the Congresss P. Chidambaram and senior Left leaders as well as chief minister M. Karunanidhi.        
	The central leaders urged Ramadoss not to rock the coalition boat as Jayalalithaa, the chief of the rival ADMK, was certain to extract political mileage from a contest between allies.        
	Ramadoss is believed to have relented as he is keen to nurture his partys ties with the Congress at the Centre. His son Anbumani Ramadoss is the Union health minister.        
	Had he played hardball, it might have been the start of a realignment of forces in the DMK-led alliance whose huge win in the 2004 general elections helped the Congress install a coalition at the Centre.        
	The DMK and its allies will field five candidates and the ADMK one. There are six seats and six valid nominations in all, which means all candidates in the fray will be elected unopposed.        
	Of them, the Congresss Jayanti Natrajan is set to make the upper House for the fourth time. The other Congress candidate is G.K. Vasan, junior minister for statistics and programme implementation.        
	The DMK candidates are A. Jinnah and Vasanthi Stanley. The CPM nominee is central committee member T.K. Rengarajan. The ADMK candidate is N. Balaganga.        
	There was a flutter over the ADMK choice with Jayalalithaa refusing to re-nominate outgoing member N. Jyothi. He is her personal lawyer and has been representing her in practically all cases, including assets and tax cases.        
	Jyothi walked out of one of Jayalalithaas case hearings in the Supreme Court after getting to know he had not been re-nominated. Later, he quit the party and dropped as many as 113 cases he was fighting for ADMK clients, including Jayalalithaa.

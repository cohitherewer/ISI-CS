                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Death data alarm for Bihar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 8: The government has issued fresh instructions to jail administration and police to take better care of prisoners, especially those displaying signs of depression.        
	Recent figures released by National Crime Records Bureau have revealed that Bihar, with its 191 custodial death cases, is next only to Uttar Pradesh (UP), which registered 173 custodial deaths in 2006. Bihar that registered the highest number of custodial deaths in 2005 with 198 deaths in 2005, just managed to get rid of the dubious distinction for the second year in a row.        
	The report stated that most custodial deaths amounted to human rights violation.         
	Thus they put a question mark on policing under the Nitish Kumar dispensation that has often boasted of good governance and depleting crime figures.        
	Beur jail sources admitted before The Telegraph that despite best efforts by jail administration, many prisoners serving life terms displayed signs of depression. In 2007, at least six custodial deaths took place inside the particular jail.         
	Bhagalpur central jail also reports 10-20 cases of custodial deaths every year. Chief minister Nitish Kumar who holds the home portfolio has not commented on the prison death figures as yet.        
	An officer of the rank of a deputy inspector-general conceded: Health services and food qualities need to be improved in Bihar jails. Overcrowding is also another constrains that makes prison life difficult.

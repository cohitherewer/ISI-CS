The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP plays to pounce on price, not pact 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP plays to pounce on price, not pact

	New Delhi, July 8: The formal divorce between the Congress and the communists has delighted the BJP leadership but it is not desperate to see the collapse of the Manmohan Singh government.        
	Instead, the BJP wants the government to push the deal further only after winning the confidence vote in the Lok Sabha.        
	Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani said this evening: Once a government is reduced to a minority, it does not have either the political or moral legitimacy to go ahead with a major international agreement, especially when the cause of the government losing its majority is the difference over the international deal. Must it not first prove its majority to regain the political legitimacy? Yes, it must.         
	Advanis argument suggests the BJP still does not want the government to abandon the deal and study the matter afresh after the next election. He only wants the government to prove its majority before moving further and thats the logical course the Prime Minister is planning to pursue.        
	Advani, who did not go into the merits of the nuclear pact, lamented: I must mention that the government held no consultations with the BJP to build a national consensus prior to finalising the main features of the deal.        
	The core committee of the BJP, which met at Advanis residence in the evening, stressed on the need for a special session of Parliament to decide the majority question.        
	The party issued a statement asking the Prime Minister to proceed only after seeking a trust vote but it also chose to underline that the nuclear deal was not the only issue. The party referred to a host of other issues like price rise, agrarian crisis, terrorism and the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir to dilute the primacy of the nuclear deal.        
	Public posturing apart, sources said the BJP would like the government to continue till the nuclear deal reached its logical conclusion. This might sound ironical as the party had emphatically opposed the deal and vowed to renegotiate it after coming to power but there is a powerful group that does not want this to be the dominant issue in the next election.        
	This school of thought is acutely aware of the negative fallout of a deal-centric election and hence wants the political discourse to return to bread-and-butter issues like price rise and the governments multiple failures.        
	Why should we be desperate to pull down the government? We were clear from the very beginning that we wont play a proactive role by bringing a no-confidence motion. We, as the main Opposition, are under compulsions to vote against the government in a trust vote. But in our hearts, we want the government to be done with the nuclear deal and face the election on peoples miseries which are multiplying by the day, a BJP leader said.        
	Several other leaders echoed him, saying the BJP would like a normal election on real issues  mainly price rise  that affect the common people.

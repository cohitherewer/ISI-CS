  - Six policemen hurt,   one reporter injured        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Patna, June 6: Six policemen and a reporter sustained injuries this morning when a mob pelted stones at Saryani police station under Sheohar, about 150km from here, demanding exclusion of names of two sons of a local village head from a murder case.         
	Police said around 800 people of Saryani-Chapra panchayat invaded the police station after allegedly receiving instructions from Naxalites operating in and around Tirhut range. The protest continued till 3pm.        
	The trouble started around 9am when the supporters of Saryani-Chapra panchayat head Akhilesh Devi started demonstrating in front of the police station against officer in charge R.N. Singh and the district police.         
	After a few hours of sloganeering, a section of the crowd pelted stones at the policemen, injuring seven.         
	A local reporter was also hurt. Three sleuths and the reporter were admitted to the primary health centre at Narwana.        
	Sushil Kumar, a villager, said Akhilesh Devis sons Mantu Singh (40) and Akhilesh Singh (32) were named in an FIR filed in connection with the murder case eight days ago.         
	Naxalites owned up the murders later through pamphlets that also stated that they had killed the wrong people and that they regretted their action. The police, however, termed it as a digression tactics by Naxalites to save their sympathisers.        
	Sheohar superintendent of police Ajay Mishra told The Telegraph: We cannot say if some Naxalites had participated in the demonstration. But its sure that the villagers, mostly Scheduled Castes, enjoy the support of Naxalites.        
	Mishra said Sadar deputy superintendent of police Vinod Kumar and Sadar sub-divisional officer Noor-E-Alam had reached the spot to control situation. He added: We are investigating if the demonstration was planned earlier. We will question the villagers to find out if they have link with the rebels.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           The Bhubaneswar station. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 25: The Orissa government and Indian Railways today agreed to set up joint fast-track committee to sort out problems relating to ongoing and new railway projects.         
	A proposal to this effect was put forth by the Railway Board chairman, K.C. Jena, at a meeting with chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the secretariat today.         
	Railway Board chief Jena told reporters after the meeting that the chief minister had agreed to most of their demands.         
	The fast-track committee would be headed by state chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy and would comprise six department secretaries of housing and urban development, industries, steel and mines, general administration, revenue and commerce and transport and two representatives from the Indian Railway.         
	The meeting also reviewed the status of present projects pending due to non-acquisition of land or due to legal problems.        
	Jena also stressed early implementation of greenfield projects that would be of tremendous importance to Orissas development.         
	The chairman added that land acquisition was a major problem being confronted in execution of projects.         
	Citing instance of Haridaspur-Paradip rail line, Jena said despite the Indian Railways depositing the compensation amount with the government on time, there has been little progress, as displaced residents were not willing to settle for the amount.         
	He sought the intervention of the chief minister to sort out the matter, to which Naveen Patnaik agreed.        
	The railway and government officials agreed to work out a joint mechanism so that significant projects such as the world class station in Bhubaneswar, connectivity of ports and development of sidings for loading iron ore from plants were sped up.         
	During his interaction with the reporters, the Railway Board chairman revealed that the Chinese experts team that had visited Bhubaneswar recently had rejected the proposed site near Barang, some 15km from Bhubaneswar, for the world class station as it lacked basic infrastructure and a canal.         
	The railway team, on the other hand, suggested ways today to upgrade the existing station at Bhubaneswar into a world class one.         
	The team is now targeting an area of 100 acres for a world class hotel along the Mancheswar and Lingaraj Road stations. They have requested for additional land from the chief minister. High rises and hotels would be constructed in the available area.

	New Delhi, April 21 (PTI): The Supreme Court today allowed Mayavati to go ahead with construction at the Ambedkar Park in Lucknow, lifting curbs imposed by Allahabad High Court.        
	The apex court observed that the orders passed by the judiciary on the subject falling under the domain of legislature and executive should be ignored and should be treated in nullity and courts should not exceed their limits.        
	How can the high court pass an interim order on the issue relating to the master plan which is not in the domain of the judiciary? a bench of Justices H.K. Sema and Markandey Katju asked while staying the April 4 interim order of the high court.        
	The Supreme Court refused to pass any order for contempt action against the government for allegedly installing a permanent structure in the park to commemorate the birth centenary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar on April 14.        
	The Mayavati government had recently triggered controversy by launching many projects, including renovation of 35 acres in the Bhim Rao Ambedkar Park and construction of the Kanshi Ram Research Institute in the green area in the city.        
	Residents moved the high court, which directed the state to maintain status quo on construction.        
	The Parliament and legislature have power to amend law. How can a court say dont make a law? The judiciary should work within its limits, Katju said.        
	The bench also issued notices to the Gomati Nagar Jan Kalyan Maha Samiti and other petitioners on the plea of the state government seeking transfer of all related cases to the apex court.

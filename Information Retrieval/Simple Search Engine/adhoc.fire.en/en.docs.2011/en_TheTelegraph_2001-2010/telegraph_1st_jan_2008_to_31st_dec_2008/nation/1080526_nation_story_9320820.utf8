          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          BJP chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa being felicitated by MP Ananth Kumar (right) at the party office in Bangalore on Sunday. (Bangalore News Photo)                                  
	Bangalore, May 25: Last October, after the Janata Dal (Secular) refused to hand over power to him, B.S. Yediyurappa took pen and paper and did a little bit of engineering.        
	He lopped off the i and inserted a second d in his name.        
	The tinkering did little to make Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa pronounceable for non-Kannadigas but it certainly turned around the 65-year-old widowers fortunes, just as a numerologist had said it would.        
	Within a month he had become chief minister though only for a week. Now, he has the real thing  a five-year term  in his grasp and has made history by leading the BJP to victory south of the Vindhyas.        
	The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man has always been a firm believer in God and fate, and heli-hopped between temples even this morning.        
	Yeddyurappa, a Lingayat leader known for his short temper, likes to call himself a farmer leader and is more comfortable speaking Kannada than English.        
	He joined politics straightaway after graduating in arts, and rose through the ranks  from a Shimoga town councillor to MLA, finance minister, deputy chief minister and chief minister. He has twice been state party chief.        
	Born in Mandya district, he made Shikaripura, where he grew up, his political base. He shot into the limelight in the 1970s by championing the landless and was jailed during the Emergency. This is his fifth win from Shikaripura since 1983 in six attempts.        
	Unlike many Karnataka politicians, he has no dynastic leanings: none of his three daughters and two sons is in politics.        
	As finance minister in the JD(S)-BJP government, Yeddyurappa did several things right, boosting his popularity with two pro-farmer budgets and, perhaps, his move to increase funds for minorities.        
	A complete ban on all forms of lottery and outlawing the manufacture and sale of arrack endeared him to women voters.        
	His immediate challenge will be the simmering Baba Budangiri issue, seen as the potential Babri Masjid of the south. Hindutva activists have long claimed the Sufi shrine in Chikmagalur as theirs.        
	Another test will come in coastal Karnataka, where a Bajrang Dal campaign against cow slaughter led to clashes and a curfew in Mangalore two years ago.        
	But the man who has taken the BJP from a handful of MLAs in the 1980s to 110 now, emulating in Karnataka what L.K. Advani did in Delhi in the 1990s, is not known for stridency. Unlike Advanis divisive temple campaign in the heartland, the BJPs Karnataka strategy has been to cobble a many-hued coalition.        
	Yeddyurappa had promised to take a Muslim in his cabinet if the BJP came to power. The party has no Muslim MLA, so he would have to appoint a Muslim minister and get him or her elected in six months.        
	The chief minister elect says his priority is good governance. He knows that the Hindutva agenda must be on the backburner, at least till the general election. Thats the date for his first big test, when the performance of the BJPs first southern government will come under the scanner.

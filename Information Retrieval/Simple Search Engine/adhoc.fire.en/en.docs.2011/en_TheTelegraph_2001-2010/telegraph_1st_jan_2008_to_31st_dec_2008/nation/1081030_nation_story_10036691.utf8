          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Indias premier schools for information technology may soon have to give up their individual administrative mechanisms, including fee and course structures, under an umbrella governing organ being planned by the Centre.        
	The human resource development ministry is seeking to herd all Indian Institutes of Information Technology under a single administrative body called the IIIT Council that will set policies for the schools, government officials said.        
	Each of the existing IIITs has an independent administrative structure not linked to that of any other IIIT. The independence allows the institutes to set their own fee structures, decide on the courses they want to offer and the policies they want to follow.         
	India has eight IIITs at present. A ninth institute, which calls itself IITM, is in Gwalior and also offers management courses. Two other institutes offer design courses apart from IT and are called IIITDs.         
	The common mechanism will be made mandatory for 20 new IIITs promised under the 11th Five-Year Plan, a senior ministry source said. They are to be built using the public-private partnership mode.         
	The existing institutes will be given the option of subscribing to the common mechanism or forfeiting the IIIT tag, the source said.         
	The plan  a copy of it is with The Telegraph  says the common administrative structure will not hurt the individual identities of the existing IIITs.         
	But the plan might be difficult to implement. Many of the IIITs were started by state governments that continue to maintain significant control over them. The states, HRD officials conceded, are unlikely to easily relinquish their hold.        
	The different administrative mechanisms lead to confusion and make managing the IIITs extremely difficult, a senior technical education official said.         
	For instance, while IIIT Allahabad has an IIT- or IIM-style board of governors as the apex decision-making body, the Bhubaneswar and Bangalore schools have governing bodies with a different structure.         
	The ministry had studied the administrative models followed by the IITs, IIMs and the National Institutes of Technology to devise a suitable governing structure for the IIITs, the official said, adding: We arrived at the conclusion that the IIT model is the best.

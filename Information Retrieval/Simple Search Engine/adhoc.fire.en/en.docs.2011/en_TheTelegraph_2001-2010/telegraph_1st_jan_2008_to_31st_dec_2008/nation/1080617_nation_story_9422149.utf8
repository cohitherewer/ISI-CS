  - CBI says no plans as of now to arrest Aarushi mom, slams police for missing clues        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CBI sleuths working on the Aarushi murder case in Noida on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, June 16: The CBI today said there were no plans as of now to arrest Nupur Talwar, murdered Noida schoolgirl Aarushis mother who took a lie test yesterday.        
	Agency joint director Arun Kumar, heading the probe, described as speculative reports of Nupurs imminent arrest. These reports have no basis as of now.         
	The agency pointed out that she had been put through a lie-detector test and a psychological examination earlier because of inconsistencies in her statements.        
	Today, a polygraph test was run on Rajkumar, the domestic help of Anita and Praful Durrani, friends and partners of the Talwars at their clinic. His cellphone was seized.        
	Vijay Mandal, a help of the Talwars neighbour, was also detained on the ground that he might have some information on the murders of Aarushi and household help Hemraj.        
	The agency said it had received preliminary reports from Hyderabads Central Forensic Science Laboratory on Aarushis digital camera, from which most photographs were erased. It did not disclose the findings.                  Aarushi Talwar		      
	On a day speculation about Nupurs arrest swirled, the CBI criticised Noida police for having failed to examine the crime scene properly, saying several vital clues available for many days had been overlooked.        
	Every time the CBI team visited the crime scene, new evidences were coming up. Sometimes a liquor bottle, sometimes a blood-soaked pillow and sometimes other evidence. The fact is that the scene was not inspected properly, special director M.L. Sharma said, adding 90 per cent of the evidence could have been wiped out.        
	He said it was difficult to set a timeframe for the probe but added the investigations were on the right track.        
	Sharma was inaugurating a course on evidence recovery, preservation and exploitation, conducted by the CBI and US probe agency FBI. He said the Indian police were yet to learn the art of crime scene management.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The Centre is considering delaying Parliaments monsoon session by a few weeks, hoping to get its act together after coming out trumps in the trust vote.        
	Government sources said the main reasons for considering a deferment were:        
	The Centre needs time to gauge the Oppositions mood and see how conciliatory or uncooperative the NDA will be. Sources said there would be fresh trouble if it moved a no-confidence motion against the government. Such uncertainty is the last thing the government wants as it races to meet the nuclear deal deadline        
	The governments trouble-shooters believe a delay could take the heat off the UPA over the recent blasts and the cash-for-votes scandal. They would like the Speakers panel probing the sting operation, allegedly showing MPs being bribed, to finish the job before Parliament meets. The panels report is due on August 11, the day the House was originally scheduled to sit.        
	The cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs was to have discussed the date rejig today but the meeting was put off because two members, Sharad Pawar and Ram Vilas Paswan, were out of Delhi.        
	The panel can now meet only after August 2, when Pranab Mukherjee, its convener, returns from Tehran.         
	Our allies want the session to be delayed. They are asking whats the need to have another session so soon after the recent one? But we will hold the monsoon session. Theres no question of putting it off indefinitely, a Congress minister said.        
	The BJP has smelt a rat, though, and declared it would oppose any postponement. The nuclear deal will have to debated in the Rajya Sabha and a host of other issues have to be raised in the Lok Sabha, the party said.        
	Having got the Left out of the way, the government is keen to fast-track bills on pension funds, banking and forward contracts.         
	It hopes to persuade the BJP to support their passage so it can argue there is a broad consensus on reforms and the Lefts opposition was purely ideological.        
	More crucially, the governments numbers in the Rajya Sabha  116 in a 245-member House, seven short of a majority  increase its dependence on the NDA. The governments managers arent sure if they can pull off the numbers, so they want the support of a big party like the BJP.        
	The monsoon session, an extension of the July 21-22 trust-vote sitting, was to have started on August 11. It is an extension because the two-day sitting was not deemed special by the Lok Sabha secretariat.         
	That meant the government didnt have to go through the motion of requesting the President to issue a notification summoning the next session. Since the House was adjourned sine die, not prorogued, the monsoon session  the 14th session of the 14th Lok Sabha  will resume after a break. Had the House been prorogued, the next sitting would be called after six months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat drives the   knife in deep
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karat drives the   knife in deep
          JAYANTH JACOB                               Singh, Karat: American battle                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: As compliments go, this one was as left-handed as it gets.         
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat chose the momentous events of the American stage to extend his favourite sub-plot today and battle on with his pet villains. He got Barack Obamas historic victory quickly out of the way with a clipped significant event label and dwelt with relish on its implications for George Bush and Manmohan Singh.         
	I wonder where this will leave our Prime Minister because he has expressed his profound love for George Bush this election has shown how deeply unpopular George Bush is after eight years.         
	Karat appeared to have chosen his words to drive the knife deep  deeply unpopular was, after all, a play on Prime Minister Singh telling President Bush that the people of India deeply loved him.         
	While many in the foreign policy establishment and in the hall of experts have hailed Bush for taking Indo-US relations to a new high, the Left has been deeply critical not only of his presidency but also of the Bush-Manmohan compact.         
	The CPM boss kept his judgement on Obama suspended  what the Obama presidency will do, what policy directions it will take, we will have to wait, watch and see. Changes have been promised but we will have to see what kind of change  but he may actually be ruing the prospect of Bush exiting the scene.         
	Bush in the White House afforded the Left a daily turkey shoot. Alas, hes turned lame duck now. And Obama will take time and effort to paint into a villain symbolic of the evil empire. The President-elect has, after all, been accused of being a socialist and a capital re-distributionist.         
	Karats party colleague and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appeared happy enough though. For the first time, a black President with his black family members will enter the White House, he said as soon as he came on stage at the opening of an exhibition in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CMC off hook, IOC in dock
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CMC off hook, IOC in dock
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Orissa High Court                                  
	Cuttack, July 22: With Orissa High Court giving a clean chit to Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) in the multi-crore scandal involving use of inferior quality mosquito larvicide oil, the civic body is out of the pest control muddle for now.         
	It has been revealed that CMC did not use adulterated larvicide oil, but the sub-standard oil was manufactured and supplied to the civic body, the high court observed, while issuing a notice to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) that supplied the oil last week.         
	The anomaly had surfaced earlier this year when a PIL filed in the high court alleged that mosquito eradication drives had failed due to the use of poor quality oil. CMC had then complained that the larvicide oil they procured from IOC for Rs 7.5 crore between 2000 and 2007 was sub-standard. Subsequently, the state vigilance wing was asked by the high court to probe into the case. Accordingly, the team submitted a report stating that the oil purchased was of very low quality and was able to destroy only 20 per cent of the larvae.         
	The report indicated involvement of Visakhapatnam IOC, from where the oil was procured over the years.         
	The case was disrupted by alleged non co-operation by IOC officers and taking note of it, the high court issued notices to chairman-cum-managing director of IOC to explain the reasons of non co-operation. He is scheduled to appear in the court tomorrow.

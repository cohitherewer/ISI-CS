             Madhu Koda: Testing times
                 
	Ranchi, Jan. 7: With the Congresss perform or perish deadline drawing to a close next week, chief minister Madhu Koda and the grand old party of India are busy assessing each other.
    
	The state Congress leaders are making assessment of report cards of the Koda government received from the 212 blocks and 81 Assembly constituencies. The chief minister, on the other hand, has asked the secretaries of various departments to be ready with the performance report before January 15. 
    
	Congresss Jharkhand in-charge Ajay Maken had handed over Koda a 19-point charter of tasks on November 15 with two months deadline. Over the past few days, Koda undertook several surprise checks. He even released a communiqu claiming that he created a history of sorts by working without sleep for 24 hours.
    
	But the delayed efforts of Koda have invited more criticism than appreciation. How can I term complete darkness a morning? said Congress MP Rameshwar Oraon, who addressed two meetings in Gumla and Lohardaga against the state government. 
    
	There are reports from the grassroots suggesting that the Congress should go alone even if it takes 25 years to come to power, said Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey, adding that the chief minister was creating confusion among the central Congress leaders. 
    
	But the options are open for the Congress to either go for the leadership change or precipitate the political crisis by telling the Speaker to decide the fate of at least six MLAs under the anti-defection law, said a Congress leader. 
    
	We should wait till January 11, when Maken and other central leaders will be in Dhanbad to address a party rally, to find what is in store, said Oraon.

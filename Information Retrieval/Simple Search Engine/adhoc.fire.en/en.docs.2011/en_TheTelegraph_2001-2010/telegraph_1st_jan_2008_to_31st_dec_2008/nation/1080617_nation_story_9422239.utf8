The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fertiliser riot, now in Andhra
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fertiliser riot, now in Andhra
  - Police firing injures 20 farmers incensed at no stock sign         OUR BUREAU                                    
	June 16: The simmering discontent in the agrarian belt spread to Andhra Pradesh today, with farmers hitting the streets in protest against shortage of fertilisers and seeds ahead of the kharif season.        
	At least 20 farmers in Nizamabad were injured in police firing.        
	The farmers had stormed the residence of a seed and fertilisers dealer in the Telengana town, incensed by the no stock sign in front of his outlet.         
	They burnt two police jeeps and a motorcycle when the force was sent to quell the violence.        
	The flare-up comes days after police firing in Karnataka killed three farmers protesting a shortage of fertilisers.         
	The farmers are angry at the shortage of the fertiliser di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), a vital nutrient applied as basal dressing during sowing time.        
	The Centre has promised an additional 1.4 lakh tonnes of the fertiliser for Karnataka later this month. This is 20,000 tonnes more than the states estimated requirement.        
	In the current kharif season, the projected requirement of the fertiliser is anywhere between 40 and 48 lakh tonnes, with domestic production estimated at 19-20 lakh tonnes.        
	The balance is met by imports, and contracts have been awarded for about 29 lakh tonnes.        
	Officials in Delhi said there was no fertiliser shortage in the country and, if required, more would be provided. But sources said the reality was different.        
	An agricultural economist said the shortage had hit farming in both the southern states where kharif operations have begun.        
	Andhra has around 64 lakh acres under kharif cultivation with a target of producing 130 lakh tonnes of foodgrain.         
	The seed requirement is pegged at 10 lakh tonnes.        
	Andhra Pradesh Marketing Federation chairman P. Prabhakar said: There is no shortage.        
	But he admitted that the state had stocks of just about two lakh tonnes of fertilisers.        
	Amid the tension, the hunt for a scapegoat is on. Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has suggested that the responsibility for smooth movement of fertilisers lies with the states.         
	Bottlenecks and shortages that show up here and there are largely local bottlenecks, which should be cleared by the local government, he had said while reacting to the Karnataka violence.        
	But others held New Delhi responsible.        
	R.S. Deshpande, an economist at the Institute for Social and Economic Change in Bangalore, said the Centre was to blame for the fertiliser shortage since it had failed to plan according to the agriculture seasons.         
	At a meeting in Vigyan Bhavan five months ago, some economists, including myself, voiced concern that a fertiliser crisis was looming because production had slowed down. The government failed to anticipate the required demand and instead encouraged exports, Deshpande said.        
	He said that if the fertiliser ministry had then taken care to ensure that production met the domestic demand, the crisis would not have arisen.        
	Exporting fertilisers gives the industry larger margins, and so manufacturers prefer to export, Deshpande argued.        
	The Centre should have whipped up production in March instead of doing it now after the violence, he said.        
	The fact that the kharif season has come early this time really does not matter; everything should have been in place by early June. Even the rains were on time this season.        
	The Centre has now decided to allow the states to directly import fertilisers, a move Deshpande said was foolish because it would cost them three times more.        
	Basically, they (the ministry) took it easy in the last few months and have suddenly woken up. I am sure the shortage will be in control within the next 15-20 days. The only remedy for this is early planning, Deshpande said.

	New Delhi, April 22: An Indian travelling by car in Herat province in south-west Afghanistan was abducted by suspected Taliban militants last night, days after two others were killed in a suicide strike.        
	Sarang Mohammed Naeem of Mangalore was kidnapped along with a Nepali citizen while they were heading to Adraskan. Reports said their driver was also abducted but he was freed later.        
	Foreign ministry sources said Naeem worked in the logistics department of Dubai-based firm HED International, which is sub-contracted to US company EOD Technology Inc that is helping form a new Afghan police force in the area.        
	Adraskan is close to the Iran border and is located off a highway where the Taliban are known to be active. The abducted officials may not have followed the security protocol, a source said.        
	The abduction comes 10 days after two Border Roads Organisation personnel were killed in a suicide blast at a road construction site in the south-western Nimroz province.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today held a meeting with senior officials to review the matter. Afghan authorities have assured the Indian mission in Kabul that efforts were on to track the missing men.        
	We have received with concern reports that an Indian national, Mr Sarang Mohammad Naeem, working with a private company in Afghanistan, was abducted in Herat province last night, a foreign ministry statement said.        
	The Afghan government authorities are investigating the matter but he remains untraced till now. We are keeping a close watch on further developments concerning this incident.        
	Four Indians have been killed and at least four injured by Taliban militants since 2005.        
	The Taliban have been demanding that Indians leave the country. But New Delhi has been firm that it will not succumb to threats and will continue development work in Afghanistan.

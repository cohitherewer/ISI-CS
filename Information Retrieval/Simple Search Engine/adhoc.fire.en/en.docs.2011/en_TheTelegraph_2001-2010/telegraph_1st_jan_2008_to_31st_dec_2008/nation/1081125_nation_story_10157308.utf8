          SHEENA K.                          Voters in Chhattisgarh on November 14                                  
	Raipur, Nov. 24: In the Maoist bastion of Rajnandgaon, election officials did what voters were supposed to do.        
	Fearing Maoist attacks, members of two polling parties in the Mohla Maanpur Assembly segment did not go to the booths in the rebel pockets but returned with successful polling.        
	Preliminary investigation by the state election office suggests that the members cast fake votes and returned to the district headquarters without going to the booths. After receiving the complaint, state chief election officer Alok Shukla yesterday reached the two villages  Muchar and Dorde  where polling booths were set up.         
	Shukla himself had to travel on a motorcycle for 20km with senior district officials for security reasons to reach the villages. The election officials were stunned when villagers said the polling parties had not reached the village on November 14 when the constituency went to the polls in the first phase.         
	The team could not find a single villager who had the sign of indelible ink on his finger, Shukla said after returning from both the villages this morning. Repolling would be held there tomorrow.        
	Shukla said the teams returned mid-way and submitted the electronic voting machines that had votes cast with the official reports that polling had been successfully completed.         
	The commission will probe the matter in detail and also fix the accountability on the security personnel also who were supposed to accompany the teams, Shukla said, adding that action could also be taken against senior district officials.        
	The Rajnandgaon police have arrested eight members of both the polling parties for committing serious negligence in discharging election duty. After the local court rejected their bail pleas, all of them were sent to jail. Sources said three members of the team were absconding and a search was on to arrest them.

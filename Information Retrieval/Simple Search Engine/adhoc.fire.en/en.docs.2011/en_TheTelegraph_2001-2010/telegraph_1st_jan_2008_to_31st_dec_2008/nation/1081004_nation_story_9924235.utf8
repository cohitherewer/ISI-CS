	Patna, Oct. 3: Bihars political triumvirate  Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan  have been spending more time in flood relief camps during this festive season with the same message: Away from celebrations at our homes, we are here to support you in your battle for existence.        
	But behind this gesture, lies a tough competition among them to win the hearts of the marooned millions living at the camps. The prime political rivals are stiffly vying with one another to keep their minority as well as poor vote bank intact and swelling in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls which is round the corner, said a political observer here on condition of anonymity.        
	His plea seems to have logic. Muslim and Yadavs  the main support base of railway minister Lalu Prasad  dominate the five flood-affected north Bihar districts. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has been consistently working hard to corner the Muslim votes away from Lalu Prasad ever since he got the reigns of the state in December 2005.        
	Nitish, who had been in the habit of throwing lavish Iftaar parties during the previous years, made it a point not to organise such ceremonies at his 1 Anne Marg residence this year. Instead, accompanied by principal secretary (home) Afzal Amannullah, Nitish visited the relief camps yesterday distributing sewayee (flour threads boiled in milk) among Muslims to mark Id.        
	Paswan soon followed him with sewayee containers to give the stuff to Muslim relief seekers. A synonym to populist politics, Lalu Prasad took his special train loaded with sweats and other delicacies to have Iftaar at relief camps a fortnight ago.        
	The unprecedented flood displacing 35 lakh people in the Kosi belt on the Indo-Nepal and Bihar-Bengal border is believed to have brought the warring Paswan and Lalu Prasad closer. Deft players of power politics, the duo sensed that the marooned people would eventually hold the government in Patna responsible for their misery.        
	Both Lalu Prasad and Paswan are apparently trying to add fuel to the marooned peoples fire. The Kosi breached its embankment because of inefficiency of the Nitish government. The state government wants to keep this flood-ravaged area neglected. Both Lalu Prasad and Paswan are dishing out these words to the marooned people with sewayee and sweets. And Nitish too spending most of the time in these camps saying: You are my family. I will not leave you. I will rebuild your houses and schools. I am here with food for you.         
	The grapevine has it that these leaders would celebrate Durga Puja too with the flood victims at the relief camps.

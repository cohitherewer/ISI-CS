	Panaji, March 30 (PTI): The mother of Scarlett Keeling, the British girl raped and murdered in Goa, today said she would seek the help of Scotland Yard in the probe.         
	I will be asking for Scotland Yard help, said Fiona Mackeown on the eve of her departure to London to bury her 15-year-old daughter.         
	In its preliminary report, the National Commission for Women has called Goa polices probe completely misleading. Police are trying to hide the facts of the case and close it, a member said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 23: The Left parties today accused the government of failing on many counts and warned it would have to face the wrath of the people suffering because of price rise.         
	The four Left parties, which discussed the four years of the UPA government, also came down heavily on the Planning Commission, terming it a super cabinet under deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.         
	The government should change the policies, else face the wrath of the people, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said after the 90-minute meeting.        
	Price rise, agrarian crisis, unemployment and loss of livelihood were listed as the governments failures.         
	The Left blamed the privatisation policies in airport, stress on public-private partnerships and the opening up of the mining sector on the Planning Commission. Under the guidance of the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, this body is behaving like a super cabinet, it said.        
	It also accused the plan panel of delaying the modernisation of Calcutta airport.        
	Fuel price        
	The Left said it was against any fuel price hike but would not meet the Prime Minister on the issue. There will not be any meetings. Everyone knows our position, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.

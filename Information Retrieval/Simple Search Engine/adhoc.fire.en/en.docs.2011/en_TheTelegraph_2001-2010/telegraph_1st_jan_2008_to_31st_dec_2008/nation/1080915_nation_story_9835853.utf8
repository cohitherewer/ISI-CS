	New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): A major general was dismissed from service by an army court that found him guilty of molesting a woman officer under his command in the first such case in the armed forces.        
	Presided by the armys 10 Corps commander Lt Gen. R.S. Sujalana, the general court martial delivered its verdict against Major General A.K. Lal yesterday at Bhatinda.        
	Lal was serving as the 3 Infantry Division general officer commanding in Leh last year when the woman officer, Captain Neha Rawat, in a written complaint against the two-star general alleged sexual misconduct under the pretext of conducting meditation classes at his residence.        
	Lal will lose his pension and ex-serviceman benefits, if the verdict is confirmed by army chief General Deepak Kapoor.        
	The general court martial had tried Lal on four charges, including molestation under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 69 (civil offences) of the Army Act. He was also charged with two other offences, one of them being his attempt to influence two officers who were witnesses in the case.        
	The court found him guilty on all four counts.

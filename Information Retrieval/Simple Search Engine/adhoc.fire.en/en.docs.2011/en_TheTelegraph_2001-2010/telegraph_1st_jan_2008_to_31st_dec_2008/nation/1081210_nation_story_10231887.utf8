          AMY TEIBEL                          Sandra Samuel with Moshe Holtzberg in Israel. (AP)                                  
	Midgal Ha-emek, Israel, Dec. 9 (AP): Moshe, the 2-year-old who survived the massacre at the Jewish centre in Mumbai, and his rescuer Sandra Samuel are for the time being living in the small northern Israeli town of Midgal Ha-emek.        
	The two are staying at the house of Moshes great uncle, chief Rabbi Yitzhak David Grossman, who used his influence to get Samuel a one-year passport and a three-month tourist visa to Israel so the boy would have a familiar face to see in the midst of the trauma.        
	In the Israeli town, both literally and figuratively a world away from the sprawling, high-intensity Mumbai, the 44-year-old, soft-spoken Samuel is the sole link between Moshe and the life he had with his parents in India  the only life he knew.        
	At the Grossman house, the boy has the run of a garden and a spacious patio, and a tranquillity he would not find in the homes of his mourning grandparents. On Monday, the smiling toddler cheerfully touched and identified in English the animal statues that rim the patio garden. But he sought out Samuel repeatedly, smiling when he nestled in her arms.        
	At the beginning, he would burst out crying, but thats tapered off, Grossman said. But he clings to Sandra.        
	Still, Samuel said, he is a baby. He wants to know why his ima (mommy) is not coming, why is abba (daddy) not coming, using the Hebrew terms.        
	Moshes Israeli parents Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his wife, Rivkah  died in the attack on the Mumbai headquarters of the Orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch movement.        
	Samuel, a recent widow and a Christian, has given up her life in India and left her two sons, aged 18 and 25, to move to Israel, where she says she will stay as long as my baby needs me.        
	For five years and four months, Samuel worked for the Holtzberg family. It was to have been a temporary job, but she says she was so captivated by the giving, courageous couple that she stayed on  until their death at the hands of at least two gunmen who struck on a murderous late-November night.        
	Samuel had ignored the crackle of the gunfire and the explosion of the grenades that rocked the building, charged up the stairs and whisked the boy away from the motionless body of his mother to safety.        
	She said Moshe had five finger-shaped bruises on his back. A spokesman for Chabad in Israel, Menachem Brod, has said the family did not think the boy had been abused.

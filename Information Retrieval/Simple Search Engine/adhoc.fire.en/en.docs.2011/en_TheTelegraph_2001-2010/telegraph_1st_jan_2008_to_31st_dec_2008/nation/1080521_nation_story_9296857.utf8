  - Orissa varsity to seek patent          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, May 20: Researchers in Orissa University of Agriculture Technology have come up with a way to provide fruits and vegetables an extended shelf life and keep them fresh.         
	The technology, called dehumidified air dryer method, has been invented by a team of researchers led by scientist Mohammed Khalid of the College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology.         
	The present practice of preserving fruits and vegetables involves keeping them in freezing conditions, however, that tends to freeze the liquid inside, bringing a visible cringing on the outer surface. After a while, frozen commodities get a shrunk look that mars their appearance.         
	The new technology, however, preserves the commodity at a reduced temperature with added humidity that helps keep fruits fresh for a longer period.         
	Again the same technology can be used for drying fruits, vegetables, spices, condiments, medicinal and aromatic plants and other high-value commodities rightly, said Baburam Singh, the in charge of the university Intellectual Property Right Cell, that has been approached by the researchers for a patent.         
	Unlike normal freezing, this application uses low temperature combined with humidity and prevents commodities from losing their original shape, Singh said. We are in the process of filing an application for a patent, he added.        
	Apart from preservation, the Orissa university has been carrying out researches on several post-harvest technologies including processing of aloe vera and Mohua flowers, besides seed and packaging techniques to improve their shelf life.

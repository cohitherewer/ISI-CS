	New Delhi, May 19 (PTI): India has fared better in providing social security to its people than China and Malaysia, according to an index brought out by the Asian Development Bank.        
	In a list of 31 Asia-Pacific countries, India ranked 10th, above China and Malaysia, but below Uzbekistan, Mongolia, South Korea and Japan, which topped the social protection index.        
	Among the other countries ranked below India were Philippines, Nepal, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Pakistan was at the bottom of the index, better only than Papua New Guinea.         
	The bank, in the new index, has established that providing social protection is not subject to the wealth of a nation. Even poor countries like India can afford to provide social cover like health insurance, labour market, child protection and education, among other things, if there is government will.        
	On a scale between zero and one, India has scored 0.46 points and Japan topped with 0.96.

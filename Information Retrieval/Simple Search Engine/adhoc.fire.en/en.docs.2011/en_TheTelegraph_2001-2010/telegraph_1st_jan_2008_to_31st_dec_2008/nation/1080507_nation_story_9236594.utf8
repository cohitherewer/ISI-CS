	Kochi, May 6 (PTI): The election of a CPM MLA was declared null and void by Kerala High Court, which found that his election campaign material had indulged in character assassination of his rival.        
	Narayanan, a voter of the Piravom Assembly constituency in Ernakulam, had filed a petition against M.J. Jacob, who had defeated UDF candidate T.M. Jacob by 5,150 votes in 2006.        
	The allegation against him was that pamphlets circulated by the Left Democratic Youth Front during his campaign amounted to character assassination of the rival candidate.         
	M.J. Jacob filed an interlocutory application for staying the order to enable him to file an appeal before the Supreme Court, which was rejected. The high court held that the statements in the pamphlets were reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of T.M. Jacob in the election.

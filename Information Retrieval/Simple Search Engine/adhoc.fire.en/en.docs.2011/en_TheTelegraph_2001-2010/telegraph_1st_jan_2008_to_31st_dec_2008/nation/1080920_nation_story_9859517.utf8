	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 19: Malati Bariha is a mother of three girls. This tribal widow of Kudumuha village in Sundergarh district has never seen a single government employee in her area. Neither she gets old age and widow pension nor she has any Antyodaya or BPL card.        
	My girls are growing up and we do not have a place to stay, she says. Malati earns a living by going for daily wage labour that is grossly insufficient to feed her and her family. Her community sometimes helps her out with a meal or two and there have been days she and her daughters go to bed hungry. Yet hers is not a case of starvation so far the government definition goes.         
	Scores of similar stories relating to hunger and malnutrition were heard at the Peoples Tribunal on Hunger and Public Policy in Orissa here today.         
	The government either takes refuge in the narrow definition of starvation death and argues that most deaths occurred due to disease and not starvation. In some cases, the victim is blamed for superstition or ignorance for consuming inedible roots, tubers or mango kernels, the tribunal observed.        
	This insistence on death as a proof of starvation should be given up. Continuance of a distress situation is enough proof that a person is starving, said N.C. Saxena, the commissioner of Right to Food.         
	Starvation is also rarely an isolated instance, but reflects instead prolonged denials of adequate nutrition to households, communities, or social categories, he observed.        
	Long-term unaddressed malnutrition and endemic prolonged phases of hunger must be recognised as situations of starvation, and the duty of the state to prevent deaths of persons who are living with starvation, said Harsh Mander, special commissioner of Right to Food.        
	The Supreme Court Commissioners Office, in collaboration with various organisations in Orissa, conducted a rapid survey of government food, work and social security schemes in April-June 2008.         
	The survey  done by 40-odd organisations  covered 62 gram panchayats of 48 blocks in 13 districts.

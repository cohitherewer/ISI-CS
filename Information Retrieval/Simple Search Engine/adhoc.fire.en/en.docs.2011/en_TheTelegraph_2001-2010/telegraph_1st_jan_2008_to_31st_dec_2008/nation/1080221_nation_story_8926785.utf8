          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 20: The Bihar State Health Services Association, comprising over 3,000 doctors, withdrew its indefinite strike call  slated to start from tomorrow  after the Bihar government agreed to fulfil its demands.        
	The association members had gone on a token 48-hour strike from February 7 to February 9, which had affected health delivery system in the state.         
	Bihar health minister Chandramohan Roy said the government took a lenient view of doctors demands of time-bound promotion and central pay scale parity. Once the demands are met, a doctor would get salary hike of Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000.        
	Roy said: We had been considering the demands. But they could not be fulfilled because of financial constraints. We are preparing modalities to effect the benefits at the earliest.        
	All doctors working at 25 district hospitals, 70 referral hospitals, 23 sub-divisional hospitals, 533 primary health centres and 1,259 additional primary health centres under the medical association had threatened to halt emergency and post-mortem services.         
	Only those at the Patna Medical College and Hospital had abstained from the strike, but had lend moral support.         
	The association spokesperson Ranjit Kumar said: There was a Patna High Court directive in place directing the state government to meet our demands on December 27 last. We are happy our pleas were finally listened to after series of meetings and strike calls.

     CHARU SUDAN KASTURI
                     
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today gave the go-ahead to a massive action plan to boost minority education, setting the stage for a concerted approach to tackle the problem of low levels of learning among Muslims.
    
	Human resource development minister Arjun Singh presented the plan to Manmohan on a day the Prime Minister also met some of his other colleagues to discuss ways to speed up schemes for Muslims.
    
	Sources said the action plan was based on recommendations of a committee the HRD ministry had set up under junior education minister M.A.A. Fatmi to evaluate the report of the Sachar committee, which looked into the status of minorities in the country. 
    
	Once the HRD ministry accepted the plan, the sources said it was keen on getting Manmohans nod  seen as a key indicator of the governments political mood on minority education in a pre-election year.
    
	The sources said the government planned to launch a nation-wide study to understand the reasons behind the decreasing percentage of Muslims among college students. The Sachar report said less than 4 per cent Muslims were graduates against a national average of 7 per cent.
    
	The National University of Education Planning and Administration will conduct the study and has been advised by the HRD ministry to set up a Centre for Study of Minority Education.
    
	The centre will conduct regular research on how minorities  Muslims, in particular  are faring in education compared with students of other communities.
    
	The sources said Aligarh Muslim University might soon have several campuses in Muslim-dominated districts, while the Hyderabad-based Maulana Azad National Urdu University will diversify under the plan.
    
	During the Eleventh Plan, the university will be funded to set up colleges to teach unani medicine, pharmacy and nursing.
    
	Officials said the HRD ministry planned to use a diversity index to identify areas it needed to focus on.
    
	The index is being developed by the minority affairs ministry to measure how far Muslims trail other communities in education and health.
    
	One problem now is that we have no concrete measure of the difference between Muslims and the others in terms of how far development has reached that community, an official said.
    
	Under the action plan, the government will also offer incentives to states to set up a college of excellence in each minority-dominated district. The Centre will bear one-third of the cost and Rs 182 crore have been set aside for the task under the eleventh plan.
    
	Within the next few months, the University Grants Commission is likely to be ready with a mechanism under which central varsities will accept degrees and certificates offered by madarsas.
    
	Hostels for girls will be built on an unprecedented scale. We found that girls were extremely keen to study. But Muslim-dominated areas dont have schools specifically for girls, and parents will not let them go to a co-ed school, a member of the Sachar committee said.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

   
	Coming up next, a serial on Net
 
	Want to watch a soap? Switch off the TV and go online. For, the first Internet serial is coming at a PC near you. 
 
	The serial should be launched by the middle of next year. It will be a revolution in the online medium, says Puneet Johar, managing director, Tangerine Digital Entertainment, the brain behind the bright idea.
 
	The cast and crew will be selected through an online talent hunt. The Tangerine staff will train the lucky few who make it past the scanner. 
 
	We have launched the talent hunt on our social networking site Campus 18, which offers a wide choice for todays youth to interact, make friends and showcase their talents, says Johar. 
 
	While critics scoff that an online serial is a far-fetched idea as only a few people in India have access to the Net, Johar is not worried. Social networking sites are a hit among youngsters, the Tangerine MD points put. 
 
	The concept has found a backer in one TV star. Rakhi Sawant, a familiar face on reality shows, says we should wait and watch instead of writing it off in a rush. 
 
	The Net serial might make it big if there is a good team working behind it, she says. 
  
	Jaya in a mood to sting
 
	Guess who has jumped on to the sting bandwagon? Jayalalithaa, who is pleased as punch with her new-found weapon to torment Karunanidhi. 
 
	The lady, who once sent cops to the DMK veterans house at midnight when she was chief minister, has struck again with a camera.
 
	Jaya TV caught Karunanidhis son and DMK heir, M.K. Stalin, apparently enjoying a leisurely holiday with his family at a five-star resort in Kerala while a deluge put residents of northern and central Tamil Nadu neck-deep in trouble.
 
	Jayalalithaa, speaking at an ADMK meeting, said it was only after her channel beamed the expose did Stalin rush back to tour the flood-hit districts.
 
	The ADMK boss wasnt done though. She chuckled that the ruling party seemed to have as many as 35 power centres, who were unfortunately working at cross-purposes. Its unlikely the DMK will be able to turn the tables on this one. If in doubt, look up Poes Garden.
 
	Bazaar goes mall way
 
	Yet another old-timers favourite is set to change with the times. 
 
	Palika Bazaar is in makeover mode. It will turn into a hi-tech and sanitised shopping arcade that some in Delhis municipal offices are calling a mall. 
 
	Although not a mall in the conventional sense, Palika mdash; as it is referred to by most Delhi residents mdash; will certainly look different.
 
	Four escalators will adorn the entrance and the central hall of the bazaar, while a new security system, complete with X-ray machines, will be in place. 
 
	Water dripping from cracked roofs will be a thing of the past, too, according to the revamp plan of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation.
 
	Palika Bazaar is a viewed by many as a one-stop destination for cheap electronic goods, clothes, CDs and virtually anything under the sun.
  
	Birthday gift
 
	On his birthday this year, Sharad Pawar reversed the roles a bit mdash; he decided to give a gift to his city.
 
	The Nationalist Congress Party chief has launched a drive to make Mumbai healthy. And as the first step, he will drive anaemia out of the metro. 
 
	One of the more common blood disorders, anaemia occurs when the level of healthy red blood cells in the body becomes too low.
 
	The campaign, led by Pawars MP daughter Supriya Sule, was launched on December 12 before the NCP boss cut his birthday cake. 
 
	Our target is to make one lakh women in the state free of anaemia, Dilip Ghule, who heads the partys doctors cell, said. 
 
	Delhi: The Grand InterContinential is hosting a beauty exhibition from January 18 to 19, where cosmetics, beauty treatments, hair treatments and therapeutic products and services will be on show. The five-star venue is on Barakhamba Avenue in Connaught Place. Call 44447777 for details.

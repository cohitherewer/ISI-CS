	Lucknow, Aug. 16: Mufti Abu Basheer was hardly five when Abu Salem, prime accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts, left hometown Sarai Mir to join the Mumbai underworld.        
	Today, the shy 22-year-old madarsa teacher from Binapara, on Sarai Mirs outskirts, is being accused of heading the shadowy organisation that has claimed responsibility for many of the recent terror attacks in the country.        
	To his neighbours in Binapara, 250km east of Lucknow, Basheer is an unlikely terror mastermind. The farmers son who got married last year is soft-spoken and so shy that he never comes out to socialise, said Maulana Tauqeer Ali. He cannot be involved in the gruesome killings.        
	Basheer, though, comes from a tough neighbourhood. Not only has Sarai Mir produced Salem, the district  Azamgarh  is famous as a recruiting ground for the Mumbai underworld, which has flooded the region with hawala money.        
	Police sources said Basheer used to be an activist of the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) and was close to Safdar Nagori and Shahid Badre, former general secretary and president of the outfit. Basheer headed the Simis hardline group. It claimed it was the core of the outfit and dropped the two outer letters from Simi. Left with IM, it began calling itself the Indian Mujahideen, a source said.        
	Binapara residents say Basheer, eldest son of marginal farmer Abu Baqar who is now bed-ridden with paralysis, does not have a criminal background.        
	He has never been involved in any illegal activity. The police made a huge mistake, said one of Basheers brothers, Abujam, who works in a Delhi factory. Another of Basheers five brothers lives in Mumbai while the youngest three are in primary school.        
	Basheer studied at Islah Uloom, a small madarsa in Sarai Mir. He later graduated as a mufti (Islamic scholar) from the Darul Uloom in Deoband.        
	In March 2007, he moved to Hyderabad to teach at a madarsa. Two months later, the city was rocked by blasts. Basheer is believed to have regularly travelled to Ahmedabad through 2007 and 2008.        
	He returned to Binapara on vacation a month ago and was picked up from his home on August 13, residents said.        
	The nine others arrested are Shamsuddin Sheikh, Yunus Mansuri, Arif Qaadri, Zahid Sheikh and Gayasuddin (Ahmedabad); Imran Sheikh, Usman Agarbattiwala and Iqbad Sheikh (Vadodara) and Sajid Mansuri (Surat).

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 7: Even as Orissa High Court gets ready to finalise the highest-bidder for Orissa Textile Mills (OTM) tomorrow, the workers, on a dharna for the past 28 months, intensified their agitation and called a Choudwar bandh.        
	We will not allow an inch of OTM land be used for any purpose other than mill revival, said Deepak Behera, spokesperson of the OTM Workers and Employees Manch.        
	The state during the closure (2003) had assured due clearance to 3,739 employees, to be settled under voluntary retirement scheme or voluntary separation scheme within 45 days. When the dues were not paid, the staff launched the dharna on September 1, 2005.

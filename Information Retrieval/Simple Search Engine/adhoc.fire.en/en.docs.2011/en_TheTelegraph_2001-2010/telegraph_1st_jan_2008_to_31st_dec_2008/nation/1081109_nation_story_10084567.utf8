                Rich pickings for garden angels    
	These tax breaks could leave rivals green with envy.    
	A new plan offers industrial houses, schools and charitable trusts juicy tax sops if they adopt and maintain gardens in Mumbai, whose green cover has shrunk rapidly.    
	The scheme, a brainchild of the Maharashtra governments urban development department, aims to reverse the loss of trees and gardens in a city whose unchecked expansion has swallowed its green open spaces.    
	The proposal has been included in a draft prepared by the department that has suggested amendments to the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. It was placed before the Civic Tree Authority recently. The tax breaks will be in proportion to the amount spent on the upkeep of gardens.    
	The department, overseen by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, has also proposed including the planting of saplings in town planning to ensure enough space is reserved for green zones while laying new roads. Another proposal says the tree census, conducted every five years, should be held once in 10 years.                  
	B-school plans tech cradle    
	One of the countrys top B-schools isnt content with fostering knowledge. It will now nurture a knowledge park.    
	The Indian School of Business in Hyderabad is planning to enter into an agreement with an Andhra government company to set up the park under the public-private partnership model.    
	The ISB will allot 30 acres from its sprawling 200-acre campus to a special purpose vehicle  a company floated for a specific task  it intends to put in place with the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation.     
	The state government has approved the project and asked officials of the corporation to identify a developer. The 30 acres will be leased 25 years, after which it will return, along with the infrastructure and buildings, to the business school.              
	Quake shield for hospitals    
	Trust Delhi hospitals to hold their ground when the earth shakes.    
	Some hospitals are being retrofitted with the help of GeoHazards International, an American NGO that specialises in installing quake-resistant devices around the world.    
	The aim of retrofitting is to keep a structure from being displaced from its concrete foundation, common during quakes.    
	A senior official of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority said the plan to retrofit healthcare institutions had been approved and surveys were on. To begin with, one hospital from each of the nine zones will be retrofitted to secure them from natural calamities.    
	The funds will be released once the surveys are over.     
	Retrofitting hospitals will prevent them from collapsing, saving the lives of the patients inside, and ensuring healthcare facilities dont collapse in times of calamities that leave behind countless in need of treatment.    
	The plan will cover the rest of Delhis 30 major hospitals later. (PTI).                  
	Swept to jail    
	After the mess, the clean-up, with the culprits swept all the way to jail.    
	Thirteen Municipal Corporation of Delhi engineers recently landed behind bars after a court remanded them in judicial custody over shoddy road work.    
	Many in the group have been accused of irregularities in construction work, most of them related to road jobs. The FIRs registered against them by the anti-corruption branch mentioned failure to carry out repairs and drain desilting properly during 2003-06. (PTI)

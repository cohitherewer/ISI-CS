	Ahmedabad, Aug. 1: Mohammad Israr, 7, has become the fifth child to die in the Ahmedabad blasts.        
	The boy was crossing the road holding his mothers hand when shrapnel hit him in the head on Saturday.         
	Isrars mother Shugra Bibi, 32, does not know her child is dead. We did not have the heart to tell her, said Kadarbhai, a social worker and friend of the boys father, Mohammed Jalil.        
	Shugra, who also suffered head injuries, has been crying and demanding to meet her son ever since the two were brought to VS Hospital.         
	Jalil, 35, had been hoping for a miracle after doctors told him there was little hope. The doctor decided to take him off the ventilator last night, said the father.        
	Without telling his wife, the barber took his childs body after post-mortem this morning for the last rites. Israr was buried after Friday prayers at Danilimada graveyard, where over 300 people had gathered.        
	Israr had gone to his maternal uncles place in Vatva with Shugra on Saturday. On their way back, the mother and son were crossing Narol circle to catch a rickshaw home to Ramol-Janatanagar when the bomb went off.         
	Bleeding profusely as the pellets hit his head, Israr fell unconscious. Local samaritans took the two to the municipal-corporation-run hospital. With the childs death, the toll in the serial blasts has gone up to 55.

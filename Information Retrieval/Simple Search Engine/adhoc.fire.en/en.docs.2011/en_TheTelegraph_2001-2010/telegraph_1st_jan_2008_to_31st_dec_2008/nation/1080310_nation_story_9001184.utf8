	Girl takes test, just after crash     
	A 16-year-old girl who suffered a bad knee injury on the way to her exam still wrote her Class X CBSE paper recently, with paramedics on standby. Shalinis father was driving his daughter to the centre when the two were suddenly thrown off their two-wheeler by a car hit.    
	The girl was taken to the Apollo emergency centre. Doctors said Shalini had a bad injury in her knee and she could neither move nor walk. But despite the searing pain, Shalini insisted that she be allowed to sit for her Tamil paper. She felt it was a crucial exam and didnt want to lose a year by missing it, said a family member.    
	A special centre close to the hospital was arranged quickly. Armed with painkillers, the student of Asan Memorial Higher Secondary School was taken in an ambulance to the centre and wrote the paper lying on a bed. Later, she needed the help of a writer as the pain increased. The exam over, she was brought back to the hospital.           
	Quack busters on wheels  
	Delhi might have found a cure for quacks  mobile dispensaries.    
	The state government announced last week that it was considering such on-the-move dispensaries for the benefit of people in congested colonies and far-flung localities and to contain the menace of quacks.     
	These (medicine vans) will help curb quacks, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after inaugurating a thyroid clinic at a homeopathic college at Nanakpura, in the citys south-west. Hospital dispensaries will be given state-of-the-art diagnostic facilities to cope with the rush of patients.    
	The chief minister, whose government recently cleared a plan to upgrade the hospitals under its control, said Delhi needed modern healthcare facilities not only for its own people but also for the growing number of patients from other states who came here for treatment.      
	Naidu charm in Telengana  
	A recent survey stunned advocates of a separate Telengana by suggesting that N. Chandrababu Naidu, who wants a unified Andhra, was ahead of statehood spearhead K. Chandrasekhar Rao in the popularity sweepstakes.    
	The survey, done by a local channel to pick the future chief minister, claimed Naidu had an edge over incumbent Y.S.R. Reddy, who was ahead only in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. Forty-four per cent of those polled gave Naidu the thumbs-up. Only 39 per cent backed Reddy.    
	Rao, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief who leads the movement for a separate state, had to share 17 per cent of the votes with actor-politicians Chiranjeevi and Balakrishna.    
	What appeared to have swayed the respondents was Naidus record of development in his nine years as chief minister, though rural distress had wiped away much of the good work and led to his partys drubbing in the 2004 polls.    
	The survey, in 270 of the states 294 Assembly seats, covered 55,000 voters late last year, when speculation was rife about a Lok Sabha poll over the nuke deal dispute.          
	Power push  
	The capital can expect non-stop electricity in two years thanks to the Commonwealth Games. The government has urged officials to build the planned power plants quickly, in time for the 2010 showpiece sports event.     
	Power minister A.K. Walia reviewed the progress of all projects with senior officials and stressed the need to complete the units on time. The foundation stone of the 1,500MW plant in Bawana, to start generation in February 2010, will be laid soon, he said.

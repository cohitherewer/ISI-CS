          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 7: Two snags in the same Air India aircraft kept over 50 passengers stranded for many hours today.        
	First, the Mumbai-Calcutta flight that was to land at 9am touched down at 12.45pm.        
	From Calcutta, the plane was to go to Guwahati, then back and again to Bagdogra. But as Bagdogra has sunset restrictions, the plane flew there first. On returning, it had another snag and got delayed for its Guwahati leg. The plane that had to fly at 9.50am took off at 7.45pm. Till then 56 passengers had to wait.

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 21: A tourist bus carrying 67 pilgrims, most of them elderly, from Madhya Pradesh caught fire while on way back from Gangasagar Mela and Jagannath temple in Puri. 
    
	Three of the tourists died, while 25 others were injured.
    
	The dhoti-clad pilgrims, mostly poor farmers, had come from the villages of Hinotia, Laxmanpura, Jirapur and Dundahed in Rajgad district. While 27 of them hailed from Hinotia, 34 were from Laxmanpura, four from Jirapur and two from Dundahed. 
    
	The mishap took place around 9am when the ill-fated bus was passing through the busy Museum Square. I saw fire leaping out of the front seats. In a few seconds, smoke started billowing out. I broke one of the windowpanes and jumped out in panic, said Giriraj, a farmer who was sitting towards the middle.
    
	The cause of the fire could not be ascertained, additional police commissioner Y.B. Khurania, said.
    
	Viram Singh and Ratan Lal, both belonging to Hinotia village in Rajgarh district, were declared brought dead at Capital Hospital, while an unidentified woman later succumbed to her burn injuries at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. 
    
	Five others  Hazarilal, Babulal, Kapil Sharma, Kailash Chandra, Vinod  were battling for their lives at SCB Medical College and Hospital. Three of them sustained 99 per cent burn injuries and one 75 per cent burns. Nineteen others were admitted to Capital Hospital. Twelve of them were still in the hospital, while seven were discharged after first-aid.
    
	A pall of gloom descended upon Capital Hospital, where the victims bodies were kept for post-mortem. Rodi Bai, mother of Ratan Lal, was hysterical. She fell unconscious after crying for about an hour. Devi Lal, 70, could hardly comprehend the tragedy that had befallen the pilgrims. 
    
	We had visited Prayag and Gangasagar Mela before arriving at Puri on Saturday evening. We rounded up our pilgrimage with our darshan of Sakshigopal this morning. But look what happened, he wept.
    
	Official sources said the state motor vehicles department was probing into the accident.
    
	A minister from Madhya Pradesh, Laxmikanta Sharma flew here to meet the accident victims.

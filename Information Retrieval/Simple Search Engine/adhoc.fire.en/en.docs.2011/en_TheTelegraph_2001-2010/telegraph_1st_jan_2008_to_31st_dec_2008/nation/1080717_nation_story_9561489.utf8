	New regime shows in road makeover    
	If a new government comes to power, it tells on the roads.    
	Many commuters in Bangalore cant seem to believe where their pot-holed streets have disappeared over the past month.    
	A fresh coat of tar is being laid on several of the Garden Citys thoroughfares. The work began weeks after the BJP government headed by B.S. Yeddyurappa was sworn in.    
	The change should not be entirely unexpected, though: the party had said in its election manifesto that it would change the face of Bangalore if it formed the government.    
	True to its pledge, the new powers-that-be sent an army of workers along with tar-laying machines and rollers. Overnight, some roads started wearing an asphalt cover, giving drivers used to dodging craters one of the best cruises they might have had in several years.    
	Yeddyurappas party had also promised a variety of other things. These included a fixed mayoral term of five years  instead of the present practice of having councillors elect them every year  launch of several infrastructure projects and steps to manage traffic better.        
	Squeeze on juice vendors    
	The capitals disease busters will launch a war on the sprouting illegal water trolleys and sugarcane juice vendors.    
	The government drive is part of a larger initiative aimed at fending off vector-borne diseases during the monsoon.    
	The decision to launch the drive was taken at a recent meeting headed by Delhi health minister Yoganand Shastri. He directed officials to take all possible measures to check dengue and malaria in the city.    
	Shastri told reporters that NGOs will be engaged in the battle against malaria and dengue and to spread awareness. He told officials to send legal notices and challans to the owners of buildings where mosquito swarms were still found because of waterlogging and filth. Chlorine tablets, meant to purify water, are being distributed in several areas, the health department said.    
	New hub hits a century    
	The City of Nizams new airport has totted up a century.    
	The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad completed 100 days of operations early this month.    
	The new hub went past some milestones since it was commissioned on March 23: it has handled 1.9 million passengers, domestic and international, as well as 15,209 tonnes of cargo. The cargo was 8 per cent higher than the volume at the old airport in the same period of last year.    
	Two international carriers commenced services from Hyderabad. These were Gulf Air, which has started a daily service, on an Airbus 320, to Bahrain. Air India Express has already launched its daily flight to Dubai.    
	We are happy with these milestones and our continuous focus on safety, security and passengers is showing results, said Viswanath Attaluri, chief commercial officer of GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited, which built and now maintains the hub.    
	Other facilities include free buggy services within the terminal and a large car park.

	Robbers in Mumbai are striking on streets, spiriting away cash at the busiest of points. In one such audacious case, a businessman was robbed of Rs 26 lakh at gunpoint at a Malad crossing one afternoon last month.     
	Three arrests have been made but only Rs 3 lakh was recovered from them. Another two accused are still missing but police also suspect the hand of an insider given the way B. Parmar, the businessman, was robbed of his cash.

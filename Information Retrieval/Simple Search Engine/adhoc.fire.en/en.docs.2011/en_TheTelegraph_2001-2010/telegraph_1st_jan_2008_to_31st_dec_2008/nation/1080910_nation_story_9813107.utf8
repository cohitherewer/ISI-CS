                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Boy found dead outside dorm
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 9: An 11-year-old student was found stripped and burnt to death outside the senior boys dormitory in a residential school today, sparking a rampage by outraged parents and classmates.        
	The boy, a Class VII student of New Priyadarshini High School in Nizamabad, 170km from here, had spoken to his parents over phone after dinner last night, school sources said. He was seen going to the kitchen around 2am to drink water.        
	Police said the body, discovered around 6am, appeared to have been doused with petrol and set on fire, but were clueless how a boy could be burnt alive in a hostel that had nearly 200 students.        
	It appears the boy was either taken out of the hostel building and killed or even sexually abused before he was doused with petrol and burnt alive, a Nizamabad police officer said.        
	School authorities said they were baffled how such a gruesome murder could have taken place on the premises. They said they had no inkling of the murder till it was reported to them around 8am.        
	We have two watchmen who guard the school buildings and two more patrol the hostels at night, a spokesperson for the school management said.        
	As news of the death spread, furious parents stormed the school, smashing furniture, damaging blackboards and destroying property in the classrooms and hostels.        
	The protesters also swooped on the hostel mess and threw out all the food cooked for the students. Scores of utensils were flung into the compound.        
	None of the students was injured as classes had not begun at that time.

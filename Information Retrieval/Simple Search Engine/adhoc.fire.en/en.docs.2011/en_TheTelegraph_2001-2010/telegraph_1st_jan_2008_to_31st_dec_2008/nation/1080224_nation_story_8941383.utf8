                                                                                                               Father sets up sons kidnap for cash
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shaad with his father. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, Feb. 23: A former Congress legislators son was arrested today for plotting his own childs kidnap to extort money from his father, who had been blaming the ruling BSP for the abduction and planning an agitation.        
	Police said they found 13-year-old Shaad Siddique in a guesthouse on the citys outskirts after surveillance on ransom calls received by the boys father aroused their suspicion.        
	Lucknow inspector general A.K. Jain said Fasi Siddique, former MLA Rafiq Ahmad Siddiques son, wanted to start a business of his own for which he needed money.        
	He has been asking his father Rafiq Ahmad for money. But the former MLA was not ready to part with any. So his son staged a fake abduction drama of his own son, Jain said in the Uttar Pradesh capital.        
	The arrest has left Rafiq Ahmad, 72, who had been blaming chief minister Mayavatis BSP for the abduction of his grandson, red-faced.        
	If my son is involved, it is most confusing. All I can say is that I am happy that my grandson has come back home, the former MLA, a businessman himself, said.        
	Police sources said Shaad, a student of Class VII, did not return home after going for prayers at a mosque yesterday. Soon, his father started getting ransom calls from strangers demanding Rs 75 lakh.        
	The lead came after the police put Fasis phone number under surveillance. The boy was found this morning in a guesthouse on Barabanki Road, 23km from Lucknow.        
	The plan was to keep Shaad in the guesthouse until the ransom was paid.        
	The police said Fasi, 42, arrested around 3.30 this afternoon, had admitted to plotting the abduction drama.        
	The boys mother was kept in the dark.        
	Jain said the police had also arrested the wife of Rafiq Ahmads driver and another accomplice. The former MLAs driver, Nur Alam, is missing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM seeks Jalashva probe
                                                                                                               CPM seeks Jalashva probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 15: The CPM today urged the government to order a probe into the dubious purchase of INS Jalashva which the Comptroller and Auditor General said was done without proper assessment.        
	The partys politburo said in a statement that the country would like to know why the government is going in for such defence deals with the United States. It said the Centre should come up with a statement in Parliament and assure that such dubious defence purchases will not be resorted to in the future.         
	The CAG, in a report tabled in Parliament, had censured the navy for buying the 36-year-old warship USS Trenton, now INS Jalashva, without a proper physical assessment.         
	The CPM said the report had raised several disturbing issues like why the ship of 1971 vintage was bought when the US Navy itself had concluded in 2003 that it was not suitable for modernisation.        
	The report had not named the Jalashva, but only this vessel fits the description.        
	The CAG also questioned why the $50m deal was finalised after only a visual inspection and why the restrictions on offensive deployment were accepted and permission given to the US to conduct an inspection and inventory of articles transferred under the End-Use monitoring clause.

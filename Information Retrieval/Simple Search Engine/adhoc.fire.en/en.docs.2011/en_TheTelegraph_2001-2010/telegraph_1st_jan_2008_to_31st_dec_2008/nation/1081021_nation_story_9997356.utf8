	Srinagar, Oct. 20: Shakeel Ahmad is thrilled: he cannot believe he is one of the lucky dozen picked for the historic journey tomorrow.        
	As trade resumes between the two Kashmirs six decades after Partition, Ahmad will be behind the wheel when 12 trucks loaded with apples, walnuts, rajma and spices trundle across the Line of Control along the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road.        
	I have been decorating my truck for the last two days after I learnt that I had been selected for the journey, gushed the truck driver from Binner village in Baramulla.        
	I have never moved out of my state but I am among the first few to go to the other Kashmir to resume trade.        
	Although the decision to resume limited trade was taken last month as a confidence-building measure, the actual process is coincidentally set to roll two days after elections were announced in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The decision to create the soft border was sparked by the Amarnath agitation and the subsequent economic blockade of Kashmir. Hundreds of Kashmiris had then come out on the streets demanding the Berlin Wall between the two sides be pulled down and trade resumed.        
	The 12 trucks will tomorrow head for Chakoti in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir along the 170km Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road. The all-weather road was Kashmirs main link with the world before Partition but has been closed to trade since.        
	Our trucks have already left for Salamabad, 110km from Srinagar. They will leave early tomorrow for Chakoti, Ghulam Rasool Bhat, the spokesperson for the Fruit Growers Association said.        
	The trucks, each with a 1.5-tonne load or 100 boxes of fruit, will roll tomorrow. The goods will be auctioned in PoK like we do in Delhi mandis.        
	Pawan Kotwal, the director of industries, said trade would initially be restricted to two days a week. Once the goods reach Chakoti, traders will take them to markets across Pakistan.        
	Mubeen Shah, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, estimated the initial quan- tum of trade at Rs 1,000-2,000 crore.        
	This will go a long way in building trade ties between the two countries. We hope we will be allowed to use Karachi port to export goods to other countries in the next round.        
	Shah said the business community was hoping trade would be re-opened with central Asian countries in the long run.        
	Hundreds of people today joined celebrations as the first batch of trucks headed for Salamabad.        
	The trade is a good beginning but our ultimate goal is to remove the line dividing the two Kashmirs, said Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq.        
	A peace bus connecting Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was launched in 2005. But not many opt to travel on it because of restrictions.

	Cuttack, April 3: Cuttacks tradition to raise pigeons as pets may have waned a little, but, even today the sight of these birds remains common in the winding, narrow lanes of the old town.         
	Golia Jethi, a resident of Chandni Chowk, is an expert who owns some 40-odd birds. The man in his late-forties has spent untold hours watching and caring for his pigeons.        
	Ive grown up with my birds. Before me, my parents were obsessed and now my children are interested, he adds.        
	He assures that once people start raising pigeons, they are hooked for life.         
	A resident of Chandni Chowk, Golia trains his birds to fly and come back  only when the weather is conducive that is wind up to 30-50m and not more. The flying is an exercise that strengthens breathing, but they are light creatures who cant travel in strong wind, he offers as an explanation.        
	Like him, 50-year-old Jeevan Mohanty of Bangali Sahi who has more than 150 pigeons at his farmhouse declares himself a fan.         
	But, one would be mistake if they consider raising pigeon as a middle-age passion, as 12-year-old Trinath Das would tell you. When I release my birds, I never go anywhere even if Im called, till they are back, says the boy, who has raised some six pigeons till date.        
	My friends like to drop in just to see them. While we talk, our eyes are always searching the sky and looking for the birds, admits this Class VIII student and a resident of Sutahat.         
	The experts both young and old when quizzed about their passion would provide several reasons for their fascination  some like 45-year-old Sagar Nayak of Haripur would tell you that the friendly birds have simply the best plumage.         
	Some would say that raising pigeons is so easy and they require less space than other pets and give back as much as any other.         
	The pigeons are kept in sheds that need to be kept dry and clean either in a passageway, courtyard or on rooftops which are well ventilated but safe from predators such as cats and vermin, too.         
	They need wheat or cereals along with a regular supply of fresh water, said Durga Madhav Mishra (47), who had once brought seven pigeons from Kendrapada. Now, the brood has increased to 12 and with the rise in number he has  like many other aficionados before him  declared himself as addicted to the passion.

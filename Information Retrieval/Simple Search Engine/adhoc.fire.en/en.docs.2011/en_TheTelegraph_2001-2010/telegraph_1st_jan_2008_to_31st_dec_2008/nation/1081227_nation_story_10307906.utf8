The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul plea on engineer at odds with ally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahul plea on engineer at odds with ally
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mulayam Singh Yadav (left) and Amar Singh in New Delhi on Friday. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: Rahul Gandhi has appealed to parties not to politicise a PWD engineers killing allegedly by a BSP MLA collecting funds for Mayavatis birthday, possibly sowing the seeds of discord between Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Congress.        
	The Congress also flinched at the Samajwadi Partys proposal to observe Mayavatis 53rd birthday as thu thu diwas (spitting day), saying the party attacked policies, not individuals.        
	An Uttar Pradesh MP said: The Congress doesnt use such language. How Mayavati celebrates her birthday is her business. If she uses government machinery to abuse the celebrations, we will flay that.        
	Spelling out Rahuls line, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: Rahulji said no party should take political mileage because M.K. Guptas family should not feel it is being exploited by politicians. The effort should be to track down the guilty and punish them fast.        
	Sources said Rahul wanted to distinguish between using Guptas killing as a political event and as a political weapon. That was why he asked junior minister Jitin Prasada to visit Guptas family on Thursday instead of going himself and converting the visit into a political jamboree.        
	Had he gone there, other leaders would have descended and turned the tragedy into a show of strength, a source said.        
	Rahul is also believed to be queasy about the Samajwadi Partys rough-hewn tactics like laying siege on offices.        
	Congress sources said that though party workers had backed the Samajwadi bandh against the murder, Rahul was unhappy with the violent turn it took.        
	Our workers went around, hands folded, asking people to shut shop. The Samajwadi people burnt b uses and set police stations afire. There lies the difference between us. We cannot stoop to Mulayam Singhs level, a source said.        
	Samajwadi sources claimed the Congress had hardly registered its presence in the protests. Was Salman Khursheed around in Farukkhabad (once his Lok Sabha constituency)? Or their present MPs? Our workers took Mayavatis lathis and golis (blows and bullets), a source said.        
	Asked if the Congress was trying to distance itself from the Samajwadis even before the poll tie-up was cemented, a source said Mulayam would not be allowed to call the shots after the Congresss 3-2 victory in the Assembly polls.        
	At a news conference, however, Mulayam and aide Amar Singh said they had sought time from the Congress to seal the pact as early as today or tomorrow.        
	They also said Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, would not be part of the talks.         
	Mulayam and Amar said they would deal with a four-member team comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul, Ahmed Patel and Pranab Mukherjee.         
	NSA on killer        
	Police have invoked the National Security Act and the Gangster Act against BSP MLA Shekhar Tiwari in the Gupta murder case. This might deny him bail for a prolonged period.        
	Ikaramul Haq, the SP of Auraiya where Gupta was killed, has been shunted out and Nachiketa Jha put in his place.

          AMIT ROY                                     
	London, Oct. 30: A call centre worker in India has been accused of taking revenge on an Abbey customer in Bristol by getting into the latters bank account and changing his identity from a 23-year-old English carpenter to a 33-year-old Ugandan man with a divorced marital status.         
	George Bates, from Horfield, in Bristol, who has never been married let alone divorced, said he believed he was the victim of an act of retaliation by the disgruntled worker about whom he had given a bad review.         
	The man had demanded maximum marks of seven on eight counts in an automated questionnaire but Bates had given him only ones and twos.         
	Abbey refused to disclose the results of its investigation into the alleged act of pettiness by the Indian worker but offered an apology and compensation of 200 to Bates. It also paid fines totalling 60 Bates had incurred because he had missed some debit payments.         
	An Abbey spokesperson said: An error occurred on Mr Bates account. We apologise for this and have returned his account to the correct position and compensated him for the inconvenience.         
	Bates originally telephoned the Abbeys call centre number in Britain to arrange an extra overdraft to cover a couple of unexpected payments. When he called back later to ask for a little more than originally agreed he was told that the bank had a policy of not extending an overdraft twice in one day.         
	According to Bates, the adviser had an Indian accent and the line was so bad that he could hardly understand what he was saying. He claimed that the man was arrogant and rude.         
	Bates said: The phone operator has obviously seen that Ive given him bad feedback and decided to change all my details in revenge.

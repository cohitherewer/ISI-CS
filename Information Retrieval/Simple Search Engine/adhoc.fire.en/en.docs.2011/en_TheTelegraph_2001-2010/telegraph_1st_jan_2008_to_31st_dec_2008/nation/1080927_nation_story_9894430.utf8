          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 26: The Centre has refused to fund college science teachers for a global meet on the human genome to be hosted by India this month, despite a plea from the countrys top research body.         
	The UGC has said it will not foot the bill for teachers attending the conference, as proposed by Samir K. Brahmachari, the chief of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).         
	Documents available with The Telegraph show that the UGC has asked individual universities to finance the trips for the teachers if they want to send faculty to the 13th Human Genome Meeting in Hyderabad from September 27-30.         
	The UGC decision contrasts with statements made by the Prime Minister over the past two years, suggesting that India wants to increase funding to upgrade research to compete with China and Korea.         
	UGC officials, however, claimed they were not discouraging science teachers and that each university had been allocated funds for sending faculty to conferences.         
	These funds, however, are meant almost exclusively to send research scholars and senior faculty  not college teachers  to conferences, UGC sources admitted.         
	Brahmachari, the CSIR chief, wrote to human resource development ministry secretary R.P. Agrawal on August 27, requesting for support to the college teachers for the conference, organised by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO).         
	The topics (to be) covered in the HUGO meetings are generally not covered by college teachers, he said in the letter, before suggesting that 50 teachers be provided the opportunity to attend the meeting.         
	The genome project, started in 1988, is aimed at decoding mans gene sequence, believed to be a key to unravelling the mysteries of evolution.         
	Brahmachari detailed the expenses too  it would cost around Rs 20,000 for each teacher, including travel and stay, working out to a bill of Rs 10 lakh for 50 teachers.         
	The letter was forwarded on August 28 to the UGC, with notes from the secretary indicating broad approval for the proposal, top government sources said.         
	But on September 16, the UGC issued an office memorandum, saying it did not want any financial liability because of the proposal. The memorandum said universities should be asked to send their teachers from the colleges affiliated to them without any financial liability on the UGC.         
	In 2007, Manmohan Singh had aired his concerns over India lagging behind other Asian powers in scientific and technological research and development  ironically, from a CSIR platform.         
	We have a long way to go to catch up with other newly industrialising countries, especially China and the Republic of Korea,Singh said.

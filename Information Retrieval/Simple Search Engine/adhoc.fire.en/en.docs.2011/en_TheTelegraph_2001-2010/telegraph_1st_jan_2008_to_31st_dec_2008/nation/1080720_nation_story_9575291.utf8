	Card hope to end hospital travails    
	A card is all that it might take to take the problems in Karnataka government hospitals to those empowered to fix them.    
	The cards will essentially be pre-paid post cards, which will be kept in all healthcare units, from the village health centres to city hospitals. Patients will be free to write about their grievances against doctors, nurses, hospital staff and facilities. The novel initiative is part of a larger plan to improve health services for people.    
	On the cards, patients will also be free to give suggestions for improvement, their views on the quality of service, cleanliness in hospitals and anything they feel will improve the state of affairs in the healthcare system.    
	The pre-paid post cards will be made available within a month, health and family welfare secretary M. Gopal said last week. A separate cell will be created to respond to complaints and suggestions with the health minister himself taking interest in the initiative, Gopal said. NGOs will also set up help desks in key hospitals. (PTI)          
	Loyalists in pesticide test  
	Few stay loyal in politics these days. Fewer still can drink pesticide after learning their leader is on the way out.    
	But thats what happened in Chennai recently, when a Congress worker downed an insect-killing liquid out of despair the partys state chief was about to be replaced.    
	Mani hadnt received information from party colleagues that the Congresss state chief, Krishnaswamy, would be given marching orders. He had only read about the possibility in some news reports.    
	Luckily for Mani and the party, the 49-year-old was rushed to hospital in time, given a stomach wash and saved. Krishnaswamy chided Mani in hospital for taking such a step. Even if I am changed, that is not the end of life for me or you, he was quoted as telling his loyalist.      
	HIV focus on mens groups  
	he good news first: infections have fallen in AIDS-stalked Andhra. The bad news: more gays, especially men, are affected.    
	The HIV incidence came down from 2 per cent (of all cases in the country) in 2004 to 0.88 per cent in 2007, according to the National AIDS Control Organisation. However, 15.5 per cent of the cases were among men in 2007, up from 10.5 per cent in 2006 and 6.5 per cent in 2005. Naco said 10 per cent of the 5.1 million estimated cases in India are in Andhra, including 45,500 men from the state.    
	The findings have shattered old notions that the disease is transmitted mainly through pregnant women, patients of sexually-transmitted diseases, female sex workers and intravenous drug users. Men, as carriers of the virus, have emerged the new challenge.    
	A state AIDS control society official said the spotlight will be turned to men. Its easy to identify pregnant women, female sex workers and drug users. But with unnatural sex a punishable offence, gay mens groups arent easy to spot.           
	In full flow  
	The trickle in Mumbai taps could soon turn into a flow, thanks to the recent rain that filled up the nearby lakes.    
	Civic officials, who have enforced a 15 per cent water cut since July 1, hope the curbs will be lifted soon.    
	he Modak Sagar, Tansa, Vehar, Tulsi, Upper Vaitarna and Bhatsa lakes have swelled over the past week. The water cut is expected to be withdrawn once the water levels in the lakes hit the overflow level, the officials said. (UNI)

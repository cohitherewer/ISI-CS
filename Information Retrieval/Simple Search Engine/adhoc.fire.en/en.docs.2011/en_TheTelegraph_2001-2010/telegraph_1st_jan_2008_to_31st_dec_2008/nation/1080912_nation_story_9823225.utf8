	New Delhi, Sept. 11: India and the US will collaborate to deploy an array of 46 unmanned ocean-atmosphere observation platforms across the Indian Ocean to gather data that could improve weather and monsoon forecasts.         
	The Research Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis (RAMA) will use floating data-collection platforms to monitor ocean salt levels, sea temperatures, air and wind conditions and other ocean and atmosphere data.         
	The Indian Ocean is one of the most poorly sampled regions in the world, said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US ocean and weather agency.         
	Scientists hope to combine the data from these platforms with satellite observations to gain a better understanding of how the ocean influences the atmosphere and thus the weather. The US had earlier collaborated with Japan to set up a similar array in the Pacific Ocean and with France and Brazil to cover the Atlantic Ocean.

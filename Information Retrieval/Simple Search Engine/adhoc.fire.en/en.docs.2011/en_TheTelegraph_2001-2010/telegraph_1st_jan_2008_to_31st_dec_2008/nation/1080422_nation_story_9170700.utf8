	 Mumbai, April 21 (PTI): The All India Cabin Crew Association (AICCA) today said it was opposed to the draft guidelines on flight duty time limitation (FDTL) and would soon file its objections.          
	We believe that the draft rules are neither in the interests of passengers nor the cabin crew. We are studying the draft and will soon file our objections with the DGCA, AICCA general secretary Sanjay Lazar said.           
	FDTL has been defined as the total time from reporting at the airport for the purpose of operating a flight and ending a minimum 30-minutes after termination of a flight or a series of flights. The flight time, according to the draft, would be the total time from the moment an aircraft moves for take-off till it comes to rest at the end of the flight.

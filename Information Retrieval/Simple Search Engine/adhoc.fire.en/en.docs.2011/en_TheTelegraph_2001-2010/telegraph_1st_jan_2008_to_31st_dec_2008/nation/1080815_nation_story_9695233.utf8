	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 14: The nine persons, including the prime suspect Ramachandra Tripathy, accused of murdering computer science student Pritam Priyadarshi Das (20) were arrested today.         
	The deceased was the lover of Ramchandras daughter. Ramchandra had initially agreed to marry off his daughter with Pritam, but he backed out later. Pritam, who was keen about the girl, used an MMS clipping and photos to pressurise the girls family to agree. Police suspect that the girls father hired goons to get the youth out of the way.

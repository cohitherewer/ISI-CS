                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun gets Sonia ear
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 1: Arjun Singh was the penultimate speaker at the Congress Working Committee marathon on Saturday night. At the end of four hours, several members admitted they had had enough and were waiting to catch some IPL semi-final moments. But Sonia Gandhi was not.        
	When the HRD minister, whose relations with the Congress president have been on a roller-coaster ride, raised his hand, Sonia said: Now, Arjun Singhji will speak.         
	He made two points: inflation is a reality the Congress would have to factor in its electoral calculations, and there is no reason for the nations Grand Old Party to despair at the poll reverses. It will pull out, but after a long haul.        
	Sources said while a lot of speakers asked for a structured institutional mechanism to introspect the losses and come up with a roadmap for the next state elections and 2009s big one, Singh proposed a committee with a specific mandate.         
	He also spoke of continued connectivity with the workers and not depending on last-minute campaigns to get the votes. His views and suggestion were included in the CWCs resolution.        
	Singhs mention of inflation was a response to the Karnataka contingents attempt to downplay its role in the Congresss defeat in the state election. Karnataka was represented by six CWC members, most of whom are regarded heavyweights: Margaret Alva, M. Veerappa Moily, B.K. Hari Prasad, Oscar Fernandes, G. Parameswara and C.K. Jaffer Sharief.         
	Sources said those among them who spoke maintained that price rise, terrorism and Hindutva played no role in the election.        
	Singhs take was that in an election it was hard to quantify the causes of the outcome and put a figure on what was more important and what was less.         
	Those leaders who had their reservations about Singh felt he went over the top while making a sales pitch for Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister. They were privately delighted when he was snubbed by the high command, but have now veered to the view that with the organisation in the doldrums, every leader had a role to play, irrespective of the baggage he or she carries.         
	But given Singhs penchant to strike at susceptible moments, some felt his moves were worth watching closely.        
	His tete-a-tete with M. Karunanidhi on a recent visit to Chennai was the subject of speculation in the Congress.         
	Typically, Singh said it was a courtesy call. The fact they share an OBC bonding did not escape the partys attention.        
	The point of interest for the Congress is whether Singh will find a place on the committee he ideated on. If he does, it means he cannot be written off, a source said.

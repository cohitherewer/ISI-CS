                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Dalai sets up Sarkozy date
          JAYANTH JACOB                                                    Lama, Sarkozy      
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Dalai Lama is expected to meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Poland on December 6 despite Chinese opposition.        
	Both leaders will be in the east European country early next month for the 25th anniversary celebrations of Polish leader Lech Walesa winning the Nobel peace prize. They will have discussions after the formal ceremony, an official at the Tibetan spiritual leaders office in Dharamsala said.        
	The French President will meet the Dalai Lama on December 6, the official said.        
	Recently, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang had re-affirmed Beijings opposition to any contact between the Dalai Lama and foreign heads of government after Sarkozy praised the Buddhist monk and hinted at a meeting.        
	The Dalai Lama had tried to meet Sarkozy, the current chairman of the European Union council, during his Paris trip in August but it didnt happen. The 73-year-old monk, however, met French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner and first lady Carla Bruni.        
	Relations between France and China have hit rough weather since April following protests by Tibetans during the Olympic torchs passage through Paris. Sarkozy, however, attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.        
	China, which has branded the Dalai Lama a secessionist, has criticised several foreign governments over their alleged support for the Tibetan leader.        
	According to an agreement between New Delhi and Beijing, India will not allow the Tibetan leader to use its soil for any political activity. India, though, does not restrict the monks foreign travel and is not responsible for what he does abroad.        
	However, Beijing had criticised New Delhi for allowing the US House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to meet the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in March. During the meeting, Pelosi had slammed Chinas rights record.

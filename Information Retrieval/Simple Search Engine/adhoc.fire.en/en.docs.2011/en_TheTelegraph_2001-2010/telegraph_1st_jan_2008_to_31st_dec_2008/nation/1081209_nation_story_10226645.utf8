          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Chauhan in Bhopal. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, Dec. 8: The Madhya Pradesh verdict has established Shivraj Singh Chauhans son-of-the-soil image while nudging Uma Bharti and Suresh Pachauri to pack their bags.        
	Uma was untraceable today after a humiliating defeat in hometown Tikamgarh. Through the campaign, the breakaway BJP leader had declared: I will retire to Kedarnath in the Himalayas if the BJP wins in Madhya Pradesh.         
	Chauhan, most of his cabinet colleagues and BJP leaders in Bhopal drew comfort from the fact that the lingering Uma factor in Madhya Pradesh politics had finally come to an end.         
	Sources said Umas repeated description of Chauhan as bachcha chor (child snatcher)  a reference that he was heading a government formed after the Uma-led BJP victory in the 2003 polls  hurt the chief minister a lot.        
	State Congress chief Pachauri offered to quit, but it was unclear if Sonia Gandhi would accept his resignation since the Lok Sabha polls were only a few months away. He was appointed in February this year, but factionalism and erratic campaign marked much of his term.        
	Pachauri and his team appeared more preoccupied countering the supporters of Digvijay Singh, Arjun Singh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiradtiya Scindia. Instead of targeting the Chauhan regime on the bijli sadak paani plank or on corruption, the Congress leaders had been projecting themselves as chief ministerial candidates.         
	In the Mahakaushal region, for instance, each time Kamal Nath stepped out to campaign, he was greeted with the slogan, MP ka mukhya mantra kaisa ho, Kamal Nath jaisa ho. Nath did nothing to discourage his supporters.        
	Scindia, Union minister of state for communications, was greeted with pamphlets and posters that proclaimed him as future chief minister. He appeared to do little to silence the cacophony.         
	Former chief minister Digvijay Singhs supporters also appeared to be straining at the leash, claiming the general secretarys experience would be rewarded if the party won  little remembering that the Congress had been reduced in 2003 to 38 seats in the 230-member Assembly.        
	Unlike the Congress leaders, Chauhan led the BJP from the front. There was hardly any candidate who was considered to be from the chief ministers camp.         
	The chief minister campaigned across the state, drawing a crowd of around 5,000 in most of the rallies. His speeches were silent on national issues, including the BJPs pet theme that the UPA was soft on terror. Chauhan largely spoke of the daily problems faced by farmers, housewives and workers, citing specific schemes he had launched for each of these groups. Congress leaders now concede that Chauhans communication skills had struck a chord in voters.         
	Chauhan is said to have won many supporters in village headmen, forest guards, women and young girls who had benefited from the Ladli Lakshmi (girl child insurance) and Kanyadaan schemes. Under the Kanyadaan scheme, each couple was given a cash grant of Rs 5,000, irrespective of economic status.

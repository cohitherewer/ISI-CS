          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Naveen worried       
	Bhubaneswar, June 26: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today sought personal intervention of Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde for early release of funds under Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana.         
	In a letter to Shinde, Naveen pointed out that Orissa has 17,895 un-electrified villages, 40,706 un-electrified habitations and more than 31.85 lakh BPL households that are in the dark.         
	Despite the fact that detailed project reports for all the 30 districts were submitted to the Union power ministry, only four districts were sanctioned funds in the Tenth Five Year Plan. The remaining 26 districts were accommodated in the Eleventh Five Year Plan, but funds are yet to arrive.         
	I am constrained to say that funds amounting to Rs 97.38 crore were released only for three districts, Naveen stated in the letter.         
	Orissa has received Rs 239.78 crore out of the total sanctioned amount of Rs 3,582.19 crore for seven districts out of the 30 in the state under the Tenth and Eleventh Five Year Plan, he further said. All Orissa projects are being executed through three central public sector undertakings, but the scheme has not made much headway, Naveen admitted.         
	Informing that notices for tenders have been floated for the remaining 23 districts, Patnaik said: Unless the process is expeditiously completed and first instalment of the sanctioned amount is released, the activity cannot be started.         
	He urged the power minister to personally intervene and ensure release of funds for 23 districts.

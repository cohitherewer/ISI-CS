          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: A Sangh parivar outfit clamouring for the arrest of Swami Laxmanandas killers has decided to defy Naveen Patnaik and go ahead with its proposed Orissa bandh on Christmas.        
	The Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Shraddhanjali Samiti today announced it would stage a peaceful bandh as the seers killers had not been arrested by the December 15 deadline it had set for police.        
	Come what may, we will go ahead with our decision to observe an Orissa bandh on December 25 as the government has failed to fulfil our demands within the deadline, samiti president Ratnakar Chaini said.        
	No government action will deter us from going ahead with our plan as there is tremendous popular support for the bandh call.        
	Chief minister Patnaik had yesterday told the Assembly no bandh would be permitted on Christmas and warned that the government would crack down on anyone trying to spark violence.        
	Let not the shocking incidents of communal violence that took place last December and this August be repeated again, Patnaik had said while replying to a debate on the Kandhamal violence.        
	Samiti secretary Laxmikanta Dash alleged Patnaik was sacrificing the self-respect of the state under pressure from foreign countries and the Centre. He is desperate to protect his chair.        
	The samiti leaders said they had the support of the Sangh parivar for the bandh.               
	But the BJP, a partner in the Patnaik-led coalition government, declined comment.        
	A month ago, the samiti had announced it would hold the bandh if its deadline for arrest of the seers killers was not met. The police claimed they had arrested four accused on Sunday, but the samiti termed them an eyewash.        
	We dont believe they are the real culprits. The police might have shown the arrest just to meet our deadline, said samiti president Chaini.        
	But he clarified that the bandh would be a peaceful one and no Christian would be restrained from celebrating Christmas. Shops will, however, remain closed and traffic kept off roads during the dawn-to-dusk bandh.        
	For 10 minutes from 5.30pm, people across the state will blow conch shell, beat gongs and ring bells awaken the government from deep slumber, he said.        
	This will be a warning bell for the Naveen Patnaik government, said VHP state secretary Gouri Prasad Rath.        
	Earlier, Christian organisations fearing violence during the Christmas bandh had urged Patnaik and a team of central ministers not to allow it.        
	During the Orissa bandh on August 25 after the killing of Swami Laxmananda, a nun was raped and an inmate of a missionary-run orphanage was burnt to death. There was also communal violence in Kandhamal during Christmas last year.

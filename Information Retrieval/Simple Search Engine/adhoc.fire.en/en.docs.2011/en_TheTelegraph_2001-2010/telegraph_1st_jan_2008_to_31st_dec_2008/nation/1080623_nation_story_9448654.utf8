	New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): Trustees of the Employees Provident Fund will press for a hike in its rate from 8.5 per cent to 12 per cent to offset the impact of rising inflation.        
	The demand will be discussed at the July 5 meeting of the board of trustees of the EPF, which has over four crore depositors. We will demand a rate of around 12 per cent for 2008-09, Citu secretary W.R. Varadarajan, one of the funds trustees, said.        
	The rate being sought was in force in 2000, when inflation was 4 per cent. It jumped to 11.05 per cent for the week ended June 7. If the rate is not increased, it will mean an erosion of the investors hard-earned money.        
	The Centre had reduced the EPF rate to 11 per cent in July 2000 and to 9 per cent in April 2001, citing lower inflation, Varadarajan said. Now, when prices are high and are likely to stay so, the 12 per cent rate should be restored.        
	Some banks have raised FD rates to over 9 per cent and could increase them further.        
	Economists said inflation, also seen as the rate at which the rupees real value erodes, is now much higher than the maximum interest on any bank deposit or any government saving scheme, including the provident fund.        
	The real rate of interest is the deposit rate minus the rate of inflation. For those living off their earnings from deposits, such as pensioners, the real interest rate on short-term deposits has been negative since inflation surged past 7 per cent on March 22.

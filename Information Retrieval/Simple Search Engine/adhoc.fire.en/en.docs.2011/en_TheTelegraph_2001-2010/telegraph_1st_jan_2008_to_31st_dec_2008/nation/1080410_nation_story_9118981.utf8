          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 9: The Congress believes that Mayavatis attacks on Rahul Gandhi are proof that his Uttar Pradesh forays are beginning to make an impact. And that the fear of losing her Dalit base is robbing the chief minister of good sense.        
	Mayavati has alleged that every time the Amethi MP visits a Dalits home, he purifies himself with a special soap and incense.        
	Her remarks amount to a criminal offence under the SC/ST act (which she is prone to invoke against others) and are defamatory, Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said. But he added that the party did not plan to move court.        
	Instead, on April 11, the Congress will observe a sadhbuddhi divas before Gandhi statues at all the district headquarters in the state, with a prayer that the Mahatma endow Mayavati with good sense.        
	When the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) first came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 1993, its then leader Kanshi Ram and his protg Mayavati had trashed Gandhi as a Dalit betrayer and adversary.        
	A Congress source said Mayavati could have criticised Rahul on a political or ideological plank. But he cant be accused of being elitist or casteist.        
	Those who tracked Rahuls Uttar Pradesh road show in the 2007 elections noticed that he had tossed aside security protocol, stepped into peoples homes and not thought twice before eating and drinking what was offered, including water. He was never seen carrying bottled water.        
	A state Congress official recalled that in 1999, when Sonia Gandhi began her first election campaign in Rae Bareli, she, Rahul and Priyanka Vadra first visited a Dalit hamlet.        
	Unselfconsciously, they sat on a charpoy outside a home. I remember a woman was washing a goat. Without cleaning her hands, she mixed a sherbet for them. They drank it.        
	Many in the Congress accept that such gestures would become the norm in an era of Dalit and backward class empowerment.        
	Everybody, including Sonia and Rahul, will have to eat out of leaf plates and drink from khullars (earthen cups), but the point is that the Nehru-Gandhis have never made a production of such things. They are matter-of-fact, a source said. So, Rahuls forays into Dalit hamlets are not tokenism.        
	Some party sources, however, believe that the main cause of Mayavatis anger is not Rahuls courting of Dalits but the sight of the Congress cosying up to her arch-rival, Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	The BSP disagrees. Rahuls up to his gimmicks. But how dare he trespass into our territory to enact them? We want to expose him, said Sudhir Goel, a former Uttar Pradesh minister.        
	Gandhi Azad, BSP Rajya Sabha member, insisted that Mayavati didnt have to prove her pro-Dalit credentials to anyone, least of all to Rahul.        
	Behenji was born a Dalit. Pandit Rahul Gandhi forces himself to visit Dalit homes but the air of superiority he has will not disappear with such tricks, he said.

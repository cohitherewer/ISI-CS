          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 13: A special Jodhpur court today cleared senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh of the charges of having served opium at a feast in his ancestral home in Rajasthan.        
	The narcotics drug and psychotropic substance court rejected the evidence produced by Om Prakash Bishnoi, a Jodhpur social worker who had filed the complaint in November last year.        
	The court clean chit followed a June 18 final report from Balotra police station in Barmer, where the complaint was lodged against Jaswant and nine other BJP leaders, clearing his name.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SRKs India wish
                                                                                                               SRKs India wish
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Sourav Ganguly with Shah Rukhs wife Gauri at the teams Mumbai launch. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, March 13: If Shah Rukh Khan has his wish, many Mumbaikars will be cheering his Knight Riders on when they play away against Sachin Tendulkars IPL team.        
	If he has his way, the Rani Mukerjis and Bipasha Basus could be among them.        
	Rise above religion and petty regionalism. That is what I have to say to todays youth. The Kolkata team is a multicultural entity with players from different corners of the world and the country. I hope (it) will have fans across the country, the actor said here today.        
	Sources said the actor spoke with sound economic reason: Calcuttas passion for cricket alone will not garner enough eyeballs.        
	The IPLs success will be measured by television TRPs and not just ticket sales. Besides, a city team plays only a certain number of matches on home turf. So a greater fan base alone can keep the finances rolling, said a senior official at Reebok, one of the Calcutta teams chief sponsors.        
	A source in Calcutta-based Wadhawan Group, which owns HDIL, the title sponsors of Kolkata Knight Riders, agreed.        
	There will be a vast majority that we hope to reach through television. That is the prime target group. To get them hooked it is necessary to rise above regionalism.        
	I will request some of my actress friends, and many of them are from Bengal, to join me in cheering the team from time to time, SRK said  a move that may not count as rising above regionalism but is certain to raise the TRPs.        
	One of his teams spearheads, Ishant Sharma, will be hoping for more. Asked about his admiration for Katrina Kaif, Ishant said: I hope Shah Rukh will help me meet her.        
	The Knight Riders are supported by the ABP Group, the publishers of The Telegraph.

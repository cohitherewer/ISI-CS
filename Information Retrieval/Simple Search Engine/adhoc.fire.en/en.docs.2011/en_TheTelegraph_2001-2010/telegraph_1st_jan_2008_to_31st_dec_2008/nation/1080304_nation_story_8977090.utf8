	Bhubaneswar, March 3: Thirteen-year-old Ranjit Sahoo hates going to school these days.
    
	Even three weeks ago his twin, Rakesh, would race him to Jharpani UGME School in Rourkela. Now Rakesh can barely walk. We studied and sat together in class. We would race to school. It was fun, says Ranjit. 
    
	The Sahoo familys luck changed when young Rakesh felt a sudden pain in his abdomen some three weeks ago. Vomiting and blood in the urine followed. 
    
	The local doctor referred his case to the Ispat General Hospital, from where he was taken to the SCB Medical College (Cuttack). 
    
	Without immediate treatment Rakesh may die in days or weeks, believes nephrology surgeon P.K. Sahu of the SCB Medical College, who has asked Ranjits parents to take their teenaged son to Vellore as soon as possible for a kidney transplant. 
    
	The teenager is now bedridden and his hands and legs have swollen. He can barely move on his own. Both his kidneys have failed and he needs immediate transplant, said a family friend. 
    
	Rakeshs mother Shantilata, who works as a home guard, is the only earning member in the family. Shantilatas husband, Ramakant Sahoo, is not too fit either. 
    
	The frail mother is willing to donate one of her kidneys to save her son but that would not be enough. We have no money for the operation, says Shantilata. 
    
	The family needs Rs 3 lakh for the transplant. We sought help, but in vain, says the mother, who seems at her wits end. 
    
	Shantilata has knocked on all doors for help, from the local MLA to the district collector. There are some promises of help, but we are running out of time, she says.

	Gangster nabbed, in piracy haven
  
	The Emraan Hashmi-starrer Gangster may have belly-flopped at the ticket counter but it is a best-seller underground. 
  
	Delhi police officers recently found hundreds of pirated MP3 discs, VCDs and DVDs of the film in separate raids. Police say the movie is hit among the piracywallas.
  
	The film is a favourite among the piracywallas. Even before these raids, during previous searches, we found many CDs of the film. But the raids have revealed a big demand for the film, at least underground, an officer said. 
  
	After Gangster, the other hits in the pirated CD market appear to be Partner, Apna Sapna Money Money and eternal favourites Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and Dil to Pagal Hai. 
  
	The raids were conducted following a tip-off from the Indian Music Industry, a consortium of over a hundred music companies battling piracy. The industry is suffering huge losses because of piracy. Such raids are crucial, said Vijay Lazarus, president of the association.
  
	Hopes ride on new SEZ
  
	After infotech and pharmaceuticals, a planned special economic zone for marine products is creating ripples in Andhra.
  
	The 260-acre enclave at Kara Agraharam village, near Machilipatnam, in Krishna district will be home to 30 to 40 processing units with an estimated 10,000 jobs.
  
	The SEZ, to be developed by the Marine Products Export Development Authority, will boast infrastructure for processing of tuna, shells and other marine products. Much of its output will be exported to Southeast Asia.
  
	The marine SEZ is being seen as a boon for the state, along with the proposed Machilipatnam container harbour port and a 2,000MW power plant in the Krishna district. 
  
	The state government has appointed ILFS a consultant to the project. A high-level committee, comprising export authority chairman Mohan Kumar, state fisheries commissioner Arvind Kumar and Krishna district collector Navin Mittal, is working to speed up the plan.
  
	Critic flips on Karunanidhi
  
	Critics dont mellow easily but M. Karunanidhi might consider himself lucky.
  
	Tamil playwright-cum-political-analyst Cho Ramaswamy, who has rarely had a kind word for the DMK boss in his several years as a commentator and an activist, recently showered encomiums on the octogenarian.
  
	Known for his sparkling wit and biting political satire, Cho praised the chief minister as a workaholic whom few could keep pace with even at this age.
  
	But the praise came along with some advice, too, at the event, a bash celebrating the 38th anniversary of his weekly Thuglak. Cho felt Karunanidhi should formalise his son M.K. Stalins coronation as the new party leader soon since the scion had almost been finalised for the job. 
  
	Cho believed the DMK boss could face problems in elevating Stalin from Kanimozhi, whom Karunanidhi has often held up as his literary heir, not the political successor.
  
	Among those who witnessed the apparent change of heart was Narendra Modi, a special invitee to programme. Cho thanked the chief minister for personally overseeing the Gujarat chief ministers security.
    
	Flu-proof
  
	Bird flu is nowhere near Delhi and feel free to eat chicken the way you have been all this time, the government assured the residents of the capital last week. There is no need to panic. Delhi is safe. We dont get chickens from Bengal, health minister Yoganand Shastri said.
  
	Poultry from neighbouring states is being scanned and allowed in only after clinical checks, he said. Nine rapid-response teams are keeping an eye on the disease and hospitals alerted to tackle any situation.
  
	Delhi: This Friday, watch Tim Supples production A Midsummer Nights Dream at Kamani Auditorium, Copernicus Marg, Mandi House. Organised by the British Council, the play begins at 7pm. Tickets, for Rs 800, Rs 500 and Rs 300, available at the council office on 17 Kasturba Gandhi Marg.

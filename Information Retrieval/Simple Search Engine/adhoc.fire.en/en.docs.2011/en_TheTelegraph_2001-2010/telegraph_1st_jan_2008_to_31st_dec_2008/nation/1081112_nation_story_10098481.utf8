                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Minister jailed for abusing officer
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Puar at the court on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, Nov. 11: Madhya Pradesh tourism minister Tukajirao Puar today found himself in 14 days judicial custody for allegedly abusing a woman election official and throwing poll papers back at her.        
	Puar, 44, who once had a late-night run-in with bartenders, remained defiant and declined to seek bail. It means he will stay behind bars for the better part of the campaign for the November 27 elections.        
	Puar was arrested today in hometown Dewas, 150km from Bhopal, for his behaviour with returning officer Sanjana Jain on November 7.        
	The minister had walked into Jains office with BJP nominee Phool Chand Verma and insisted that Congress candidate Sajjan Singhs papers were not in order and that his nomination must be cancelled, police said.        
	Jain told him she had reviewed the objections against Sajjan and found his papers valid. Puar then allegedly flung the papers at her table and used abusive language.        
	A complaint has been sent to the Election Commission along with video footage of the incident, and an FIR and a case have been lodged.        
	The charges have been filed under the Indian Penal Codes Section 186 (preventing a public servant from discharging his duties), Section 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from doing his duty) and Section 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace). If convicted, the minister could be jailed for two years.        
	The BJP has said it would move Jabalpur High Court to get the case quashed on the ground that the assault charge was unwarranted. The Congress has demanded Puar be sacked. The poll panel has transferred Navneet Mohan Kothari, deputy electoral officer of Dewas, for dereliction of duty. Kothari has been charged with failing to inform the commission and the states chief electoral officer about the ministers conduct with Jain.        
	A few months ago, the BJP was left red-faced when bartenders, waiters and other staff at the state-owned Palash Hotel lodged a written complaint against Puar.        
	They alleged the tourism minister had arrived after the bar and kitchen had closed, asked customers to stay back and ordered staff to serve them food and drinks. Refused, he allegedly let loose a volley of threats and invectives.        
	A couple of years ago, Puar, then higher education minister, had annoyed governor Balram Jakhar by skipping a meeting of state vice-chancellors. Jakhar had told the audience the ministers absence reflected the sorry state of affairs in his department.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Union ministers Murli Deora, Prithviraj Chavan, T. Subbirami Reddy, G.K. Vasan and Suresh Pachauri must be re-elected to the Rajya Sabha by April 2 to keep their jobs.        
	Congress sources said Deora, the petroleum and natural gas minister, and Chavan, a deputy minister in the Prime Ministers Office, were certain to get their seats back because of an understanding with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Vasan, too, should have no problems because of an arrangement with the DMK. But the fates of Reddy and Pachauri are less certain.        
	Deora and Chavan were elected from Maharashtra, where the Congress has a coalition government with the NCP. There are four vacancies from the UPAs quota in the state. Sources said NCP chief Sharad Pawar had agreed to divide the seats evenly with the Congress.        
	That would still leave the partners with surplus votes to get a fifth consensus candidate through.        
	Reddy, the minister of state for mines, had won from Andhra Pradesh but this time several aspirants, including a Hyderabad media baron said to be close to the Congress, are eyeing the five seats from the state.        
	Sources said Pachauri, elected from Madhya Pradesh, does not seem to have much of a chance in the BJP-ruled state.        
	They said the minister of state for personnel and parliamentary affairs might have looked for a safe state like Haryana but his appointment as Madhya Pradesh Congress chief closed that door.        
	Madhya Pradesh is going to the polls in November. If the state president gets elected from outside, it will send a bad signal, a source said.        
	The elections to 56 Rajya Sabha seats in 17 states will be held on March 26.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rebuff to US cheers Congress
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rebuff to US cheers Congress
          OUR BUREAU                          Ahmadinejad: Welcome                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: A sigh of relief rustled through Congress ranks today as it welcomed the governments tough response to Washingtons advice on dealings with Iran even as central ally Left called for summoning the US envoy.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said his party appreciated the Centres rebuff yesterday after US state department spokesman Tom Casey said America expected India to tell Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to suspend his countrys uranium enrichment programme when the Iranian President visits Delhi next week.        
	But the government must summon the US ambassador over the interference from the self-appointed world policeman, he said.        
	A day after the foreign ministry spokesman said neither Iran nor India needed any guidance on bilateral ties, another stern response boomed out from minister Pranab Mukherjee this afternoon.        
	We tell the US, do not take on yourself the responsibility of deciding whether Iran was manufacturing (nuclear) weapons or not, the Congress veteran said. Leave it to (atomic watchdog) IAEA, the designated authority.        
	For the Congress, never enthused by the nuclear deal and discomfited by the Centres decision to vote with the US-led West on Irans nuclear plans in September 2005, the snub to Washington yesterday couldnt have been more welcome.        
	It meant the Centre, party sources said, was trying to correct the impression that Indias foreign policy had become hostage to the US.        
	We think India and Iran are two mature states and can discuss things among themselves, said Shakeel Ahmed, the deputy home minister and Congress spokesman.        
	Ahmed welcomed Ahmadinejads visit and said it would strengthen the centuries-old relations between the two countries.         
	Asked if Ahmadinejad would call on party chief Sonia Gandhi, he said: So far, we have information only of his official engagements with the President and the Prime Minister.        
	In Parliament, the CPM slammed Casey for his audacious and arrogant comment. The US is trying to pressurise India to move on its strategic directions. We would want the UPA government to take cognisance of this reality, Yechury said.        
	Mukherjee offered a sweetener to the Left days before the scheduled May 6 meeting of the joint panel on the civilian nuclear deal. He assured the ally that the government would seek the sense of Parliament before the deal is put to vote in the US Congress. And if Parliament refused to move the legislation, the deal was as good as dead.        
	The minister didnt specify what the legislation was, but most probably he was referring to changes that have to be made in the Atomic Energy Act to allow private players in nuclear power generation, possibly in collaboration with foreign companies.        
	Before we go for its ratification in the American parliament, we will come to Parliament to take the sense of the House though there is no provision in the Constitution that stands in our way, he said.

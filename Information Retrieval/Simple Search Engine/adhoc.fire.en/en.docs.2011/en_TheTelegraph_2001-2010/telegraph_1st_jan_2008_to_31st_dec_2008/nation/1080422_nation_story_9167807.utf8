          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 21: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today assured that the state government had no problem in recommending the Akash kidnapping case to the CBI.        
	Akashs family took the matter afresh with the chief minister today after it received a letter, purportedly written by the kidnappers, demanding Rs 10-lakh ransom.         
	Akash, alias Anshu (14), a resident of Raza Bazaar in Shastri Nagar was a student of Class VII. He was kidnapped on August 10, 2007, on his way to school.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, Akashs father Yogendra Pandey, a lab assistant posted at Sasaram, said: When I was collecting my newspaper yesterday, I saw a hand written note on a small piece of paper that said my son was in the custody of some Tiger. And a demand of Rs 10 lakh as ransom was also made.         
	We are overwhelmed by the media support and hope that my son comes back home someday. The Pandeys also have two school-going daughters.        
	If handing over the case means that it would may get solved, then I have no problem handing it over to the CBI today, said Nitish Kumar.

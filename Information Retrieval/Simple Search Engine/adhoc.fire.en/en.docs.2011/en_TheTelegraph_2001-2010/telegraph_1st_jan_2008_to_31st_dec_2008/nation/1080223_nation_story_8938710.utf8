The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP shutters on Jodhaa
                                                                                                               MP shutters on Jodhaa
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          A Bhopal cinema screening Jodhaa Akbar wears a deserted look on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhopal, Feb. 22: The Madhya Pradesh government today banned the screening of Jodhaa Akbar, saying it was a threat to peace.        
	BJP insiders, however, said the move was political  with polls later this year, the ruling party does not want to antagonise the 43 Rajput MLAs, most of them from the BJP, in the 230-member Assembly.        
	The Ashutosh Gowariker film has faced flak from Rajputs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, who say Jodhabai was the wife of Jehangir, not Akbar. However, Madhya Pradesh is the first state to slap a ban on the film, starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Bachchan.        
	The order comes barely two months after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans offer to Taslima Nasreen to settle in Bhopal. He had promised the Bangladeshi author freedom to pursue creativity.        
	But caution seems to have got the better of creativity in the case of Jodhaa Akbar. Our government has suspended the screening of the movie in view of protests at cinema halls, which have posed a threat to maintenance of peace, Chauhan said today.        
	There have been sporadic but peaceful protests against the film in Gwalior, Indore and Ujjain.        
	According to sources, the chief minister had consulted BJP president Rajnath Singh and state party chief Narendra Singh Tomar before taking the decision.        
	Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya general secretary Surendra Singh Tomar had met Rajnath, Narendra and Chauhan two days ago, warning them that the protests could turn violent if our forefathers continue to be insulted.        
	State commerce and industry minister Babulal Gaur, whose department has ordered the ban under the Madhya Pradesh Cinema (Regulation) Act, 1952, said the government did not want to hurt the sentiments of the Rajput community.        
	Sometimes, we have to be considerate to sentiments even in fictional accounts. Suppose someone shows Lord Ram wearing pants and shirt, there are bound to be protests, said the former chief minister, who is known to be a movie buff.        
	Gaur, however, has seen the film in a Bhopal theatre. It is a touching movie and I frankly loved it.                  
	The films distributor, Aditya Chouksay, said he would move court if the government did not lift the ban by tomorrow.         
	It is absolutely dictatorial. Why doesnt the Centre disband the censor board if each state government has to sit and decide what people should watch? Chouksay, who claims to be a BJP sympathiser, asked.        
	Jitendra Jain, the secretary of the Central Circuit Cine Association, called the ban bizarre. He threatened that his association, which covers Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtras Vidharbha region, would call for the closure of all theatres.        
	Director Gowariker was more restrained in his response. If we have a Rajput lobby that has reservations about the name, I empathise with them because I went through the same thing. At the start of the film, I have given a disclaimer which says that there are several names, but I am using Jodhaa because it is the most popular, he told a TV channel.        
	Gowariker said the confusion had arisen from history books. The more the number of history books, the more the number of names attributed to Raja Bharmals daughter. There are several names. When I started my research, I was quite taken aback that historians dont see eye to eye because each has his own interpretation and analysis.        
	In Betul district, the BJP unit has given an unusual twist to the controversy  it claims Jodhabai wasnt a Rajput, but a Christian.         
	The film is trying to malign Rajputs. Jodhabai was a Christian and buried in a cemetery, party leader Raja Thakur said.

 line

     OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Supreme Court has said economic and policy matters should be best left to the legislature and the executive as these have to be decided with great care after consulting specialists. 
    
	it will be highly unwise for the court to encroach into the domain of the executive or legislature and try to enforce its own views and perceptions, a two-judge bench said while upholding Section 47A of the Indian Stamp Act struck down by Andhra Pradesh High Court. 
    
	The court should refrain from issuing any such order as it lacks (the) expertise essential in the age of specialisation when policies have to be laid down with great care after consulting specialists in the field. 
    
	The amendment, being an economic measure seeking to plug loopholes and secure speedy realisation of stamp duty, cannot be held unconstitutional, the apex court said. 
    
	As regards economic and other regulatory legislation, judicial restraint must be observed by the court and greater latitude must be given to the legislature while adjudging the constitutionality of the statute because the court does not consist of economic or administrative experts. 
    
	The bench of Justices H.K. Sema and Markandey Katju, however, said courts should be activist in defending civil liberties and fundamental rights. This is necessary because though ordinarily the legislature represents the will of the people and works for their welfare, there can be exceptional situations where the legislature may violate the civil liberties and rights of the people.
    
	The bench made it clear that as guardians of the rights and liberties of the citizens, they would be failing in their responsibility if they abdicated this solemn duty towards the citizens. 
    
	For this, they may sometimes have to declare an act of the executive or the legislature unconstitutional, the court said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 24: It is known that the state is going through an era of liberal economy but that progress seems to have come at a cost.         
	While government and industries are debating the single-window clearance system that grants acres to units in a matter of months, one tribal family has been waiting for 60-decimal land for the past 15 years. My father Badha Paraja received a patta for 60-decimal of land some 15 years ago, but we are yet to see it  let alone use it, said Arjun Paraja, a tribal hailing from Paikphulbeda village in Koraput.        
	Arjun was attending a two-day consultation programme on Access to land by poor in Orissa that concluded in the state capital here today. The programme scrutinises the much-hyped Mo jomi mo diha government campaign launched in August 2007.         
	The above government campaign aims to identify and distribute land through land fairs or melas to be organised by tehsildars. However, it seems that very few villagers, including those belonging to the Paikphiulbeda gram panchayat, have actually heard of such fairs.         
	Recently, some officers from the forest department came to our village and began a nursery on my land. When we tried to protest they burnt my house and attacked my brother and his three-year-old daughter. Then, they asked us to vacate the land, said Sada Golari of Benyamaliguda village of Koraput, who attended the conference. His experience is an example of violation of Section 4(5) of Forest Rights Act that debars eviction of a forest dwelling person from his or her land till verification of rights.

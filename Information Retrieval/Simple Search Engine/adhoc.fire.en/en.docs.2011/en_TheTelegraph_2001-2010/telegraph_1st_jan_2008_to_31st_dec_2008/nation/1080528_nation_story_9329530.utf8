          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 27: The World Bank report praising the state government for significant fiscal turnaround in the past seven years has triggered a verbal duel between the ruling dispensation and the Opposition.        
	Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik on Sunday dismissed the report as misleading and confusing, while finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei today dubbed Patnaiks contentions as politically motivated.        
	Referring to the report that claimed poverty had reduced rapidly in the past seven years in the state, Patnaik sought to know why the government was fighting for inclusion of 10 lakh families in the BPL list if they were in a comfortable position now.        
	He quoted a report released by the Union finance ministry that stated the per capita (daily) income of 57 per cent of rural Orissa was Rs 12. If that is the case, then how true is the World Bank report? he wondered.         
	He termed the government commissioned report to be a pre-poll exercise.         
	Countering the Oppositions allegation, Ghadei clarified that the government had no role in the World Bank study.        
	He said the study relied on data and statistics, which showed Orissa had achieved an average 11.22 per cent growth of Gross State Domestic Product during 2003-04 and 2005-06.        
	While Patnaik trashed the growth claim, Ghadei argued that the average share of industries to the GSDP during 2002-03 to 2006-07 was 20.65 per cent. The finance minister added that 49 companies had signed MoUs with the government for investing Rs 1.98 lakh crore and produce 75.66MT steel per annum.         
	Ghadei clarified that the government has approved the creation and filling up of more than 1.21-lakh posts since 2001-02. The minister also claimed that the revenue and plan expenditure had increased substantially in the past seven years, which indicates a robust growth.         
	The capital outlay has gone up from Rs 799 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs 2807.47 crore in 2007-08, he said.

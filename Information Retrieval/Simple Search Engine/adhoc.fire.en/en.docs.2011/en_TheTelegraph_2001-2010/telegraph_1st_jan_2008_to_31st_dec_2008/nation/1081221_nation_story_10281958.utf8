          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The government is working on the details of a statement it is expected to make in Parliament next week on Union minister A.R. Antulays comment on the killing of Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karkare.        
	Given the serious political ramifications of the minority affairs ministers remarks, within and outside India, the ruling Congress was still undecided on who should make the statement: it could be a mea culpa from Antulay, as railway minister Lalu Prasad suggested.         
	Antulay could be asked to stress Pakistans role in Karkares death and de-link it from the Malegaon blasts probe the ATS chief was carrying out, involving RSS activists.         
	The statement could also be a clarification from a senior cabinet minister.         
	Sources suggested an expression of admission from Antulay was more expedient as it would serve the purpose of distancing the government from the controversy he created. The sources also hoped that an articulation from Antulay would better placate the Opposition.        
	A clarification in the conventional parliamentary sense could throw up more questions than answer them, a minister said.         
	If we support Antulay, we end up alienating large sections of opinion-makers and weaken our case vis-a-vis Pakistan. If we oppose him, he will have to go, the minister said.        
	The Congress core committee, which met at the Prime Ministers residence, mulled over the merits and de-merits of each option but couldnt zero in on one.        
	A suggestion that Antulays reported resignation offer be accepted instantly was rejected because the leaders were concerned about how it would go down with Muslims.         
	Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, sources said, were flooded with messages from Muslims across the country, endorsing Antulays comments.         
	Antulay has done whatever damage he needed to. Why should we exacerbate it by throwing him out? asked a leader.        
	Some felt the Congress should not allow the Mumbai massacre to dominate its agenda.         
	We dropped three ministers to make the government seem accountable. Surely, we cant empty out the cabinet in deference to the so-called public sentiment, a source said.        
	There was a proposal that once Parliament met on Monday, the UPA should target BJP leader Jaswant Singhs TV interview. Singh, who was external affairs minister in the NDA government when terrorists had hijacked a civilian aircraft, was heard saying that if the Kandahar episode was to repeat itself, his response would also be the same: give Pakistani terrorists safe passage in lieu of saving the passengers on board.         
	We will demand that Singh should step down as the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, a minister said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 31: Nandan Kanan promises a triple treat for visitors tomorrow, as three of its special residents turn four.         
	Rishi, Sitesh and Prachi  all tiger cubs  are set to celebrate their birthday in style.         
	When they were young the three shared a cage with Shailaja, but as the boys grew they got a separate enclosure, while sister Prachi was left behind to share her enclosure with her mother. Interestingly, when they were separated, the three stopped taking their food simultaneously. It was as if they had gone in for a hunger strike to protest, remembers A.K. Pattnaik, the director of the zoological park.        
	The three won and authorities reunited Prachi with her two brothers.         
	The three have been living together in a special enclosure that has a wet moat, a small pond, a dining area, trees and a grassy carpet.         
	But on Friday Prachi would be celebrating her birthday in the enclosure 33A while Rishi and Sitesh would celebrate their birthdays at Enclosure no 20. The birthday bash will be a part of the zoos education programme, Pattnaik explained. The objective of this programme is to generate awareness about the status of the tiger in the wild and about its conservation needs, he added.         
	L.A.K. Singh, an eminent tiger expert would try to demystify some of the tiger truths in his tiger talk.         
	The three cubs would be presented zoo furniture as birthday gifts. Also the birthday boys would be groomed with a special refreshing bath by the keepers.        
	Because no birthday celebration is complete without a cake, an especially-made cake would be cut in presence of schoolchildren and visitors tomorrow at the bash.

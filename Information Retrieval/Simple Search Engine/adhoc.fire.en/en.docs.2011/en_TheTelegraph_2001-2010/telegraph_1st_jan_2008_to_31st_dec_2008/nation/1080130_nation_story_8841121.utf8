	New Delhi, Jan. 29: When she became the first woman to become President of India, Pratibha Patil was said to have broken through the glass ceiling. 
    
	But today, in the centre of New Delhis Vijay Chowk, the President asked for a special glass enclosure to insulate her against the cold as she watched the Beating the Retreat ceremony. 
    
	Two blowers were also placed inside the enclosure to keep the lady warm. 
    
	Even at the venue  the foot of Raisina Hill  visitors and dignitaries wondered why the President was sitting behind a three-panelled glass wall when other VIPs such as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi were exposed to the elements. 
    
	At first, it was assumed that the enclosure was bulletproof. But the acrylic glass panels put up by the central public works department cannot stop bullets. Organisers of the annual event  the Delhi area command of the army  confirmed that the request for the protection was made at the last minute. 
    
	They believed that the 73-year-old Patil was probably not keeping too well. There was no confirmation of this from officials of Rashtrapati Bhavan. They did say, however, that the temperature inside the presidential palace was maintained at a comfortable 23C. The mercury touched a maximum of 16.4C today  six degrees below normal  and a minimum of 5.2C, three degrees below. 
    
	The glass enclosure was of some concern to the security personnel. In their drill, they have to evacuate the VIPs first in the event of a threat or a militant attack. An enclosure of the sort put up today would be an obstacle in a situation where even a split-seconds delay matters. 
    
	All Presidents before her have witnessed the ceremony from where Patil was seated today. The organisers  and there is nary a departure from the usual  could not recall A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, K.R. Narayanan or even Shankar Dayal Sharma having made such a request. 
    
	None of them, of course, had to ensure that their pallus were blown off by strong winds. Patil had also donned a long coat and gloves for warmth. 
    
	She is known to be fastidious about her public image. The release of the official portrait of the President  that adorns most government offices  was delayed because she was not happy with the first batch of photographs. 
    
	Patils immediate predecessor as the supreme commander of the armed forces, Kalam, even visited Siachen and flew in a Sukhoi 30 Mki.
    
	Beating the Retreat traditionally brings the curtain down on Republic Day celebrations. It owes its origin to ancient times when buglers called an end to the battle of the day so that the warring sides could retrieve their dead and wounded. Now the ceremony is more of an exhibition of martial music against the stunning visual backdrop of Raisina Hill in the setting sun.

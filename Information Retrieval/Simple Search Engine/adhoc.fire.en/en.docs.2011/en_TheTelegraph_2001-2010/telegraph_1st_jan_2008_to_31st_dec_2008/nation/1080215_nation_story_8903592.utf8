The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stubbing out smoke from campuses
                                                                                                               Stubbing out smoke from campuses
  - Students support cause          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Killing the kick                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 14: Smoking and related ailments account for 20 per cent of deaths among men and 5 per cent of deaths among women in a 30-69 age bracket, states a recently released report by the New England Journal of Medicine.        
	Another report predicts that 1 million people are slated to succumb to tobacco smoking related ailments in India by 2010.         
	As more in the world embrace the cancer stick, in Orissa the trends is moving in an opposite direction - thanks to proactive students here, who have pledged to stub out the habit from the campus.         
	After smoke-free hotels, its time for smoke-free education campuses and government offices.         
	Representatives of 15 educational institutes, including Utkal University, have joined hands to come up with task forces to ensure no smoking zones on college and institute campuses.         
	Joining the move are BJB College, Capital Law College, Maharshi College of Natural Law, Biju Pattnaik College of Social Work and Social Sciences, Institute of Media Studies and Vivekananda College.        
	Student members of the union recently met and decided to douse the stick and the suparis - laced with tobacco.         
	The smoking trend is on a rise. Women are no exception when it comes to tobacco consumption. In a preliminary survey, we found that women chewed more tobacco than men in form of gutka and flavoured supari.         
	Students get into the habit even before they realise its ill-effects, said Kavita Dash, of Voluntary Health Association of India-Aparajita, an organisation that works in this sector.        
	Youngsters tend to start smoking when their peers do. Since its peer pressure that creates the trend, peer pressure can be used to stub out the smoke, said Prachi Mishra, a commerce student of BJB College.        
	The Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation OF Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act prohibits sale of tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutes. It also directs the administration to put up boards clearly reading no smoking outside all institute.         
	Despite rules, the practise is very much prevalent everywhere.        
	The students are not alone. Commissioner of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, Binay Behera, has assured them police support. Our force will do everything to support the anti-tobacco brigade anytime it comes up. Action, according to law, will be taken against violators, but it will be easier if the state government issues a notification first.        
	The state health department is currently considering the notification. Meanwhile the extension of the secretariat, Rajiv Bhavan, has also become a smoke free zone. This is a positive initiative taken up by the authorities. We believe the move is a step towards combating tobacco menace in the city, said Dash.

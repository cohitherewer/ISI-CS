The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | South actors in US visa fraud
                                                                                                               South actors in US visa fraud
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chennai, March 12: The arrest of a small-time actress has taken the lid off a US visa racket involving the south Indian film industry.        
	The American consulate general in Chennai today announced that nearly 200 people, including actors and directors, face a lifetime ban on travelling to the US.        
	The consulates fraud prevention unit uncovered the racket in which film actors or directors used their positions to lend credibility to a second unqualified applicant, the consulate said in a statement.         
	The applicants had paid up to Rs 5 lakh to visa consultants and the actor or director they had accompanied.        
	The racket came to light after a team from the Royapettah police station, acting on a complaint from the US consulate, arrested Flora Shiny, a 29-year-old actress, Srilatha, a Hyderabad resident, and Venkat Reddy, a travel agent from Hyderabad.         
	A.G. Mourya, the deputy commissioner of police (Mylapore), said the three had tried to get a US visa for Srilatha by presenting fabricated documents.         
	Inquiries revealed that Venkat had taken a few lakhs from Srilatha on the promise of a job abroad. Shiny was trying to take her along by making her pose as her make-up assistant. The actress claimed that a Telugu organisation in the US had invited her to a cultural show.        
	Srilatha told the police that she agreed to present the false credentials as she thought it would help get her visa papers processed smoothly.         
	The three have been remanded in judicial custody.         
	Immigration records show that most of the people who got visas through the racket are illegally present in the United States, the consulate statement said.         
	The consulate does not want to go public with the names of the offenders and said their identities have been passed on to US law enforcement authorities.        
	The consulate welcomes all legitimate travellers, but actors, directors and their companions who use fraudulent documents have received a lifetime bar on ever travelling to the United States, the statement added.         
	However, US consul general David Hopper clarified that the consulates action should not be viewed as a condemnation of the south Indian film industry.         
	He acknowledged the artistic and commercial successes that have made this industry known and admired around the world.        
	However, Hopper added, it is unfortunate that some people in the industry have misused the well-earned reputation and stature of the Indian film industry.

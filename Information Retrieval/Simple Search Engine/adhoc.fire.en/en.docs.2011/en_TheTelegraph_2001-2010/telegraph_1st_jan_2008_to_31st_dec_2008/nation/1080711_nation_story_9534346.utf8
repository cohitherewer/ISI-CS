	New Delhi, July 10 (PTI): India might deploy the armys special forces to secure its missions.        
	Army chief General Deepak Kapoor said Mondays suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul was well-planned, pre-meditated and pre-planned by forces that do not like Indias presence in Afghanistan. But he did not identify these forces.        
	Obviously, there are elements that are inimical to Indias interests in Kabul who will be involved. I would not like to deny it, he told reporters when asked to comment on Afghanistans suspicion that an intelligence agency active in the region was behind the terror strike.        
	While Afghanistan had clearly pointed a finger at Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence, General Kapoor did not name the agency.        
	He merely said we all should be able to make out who would be inimical to our interest in Kabul and to the Indian embassy in Kabul.        
	Kapoor added: We are deliberating on certain additional measures to be taken to ensure security of (embassy) personnel not only in Kabul but also elsewhere.        
	The army chief did not rule out the possibility of deploying special forces of the army for security of the missions.        
	If the need arises, we can certainly think of deploying special forces in addition to the ITBP (Indo-Tibetan Border Police) men already there, Kapoor said.

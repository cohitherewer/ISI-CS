	Ragging crusade, with music video    
	A Delhi NGO working with a Supreme Court anti-ragging panel has released the countrys first known music video on the subject, and its strains can be heard across campuses.     
	CURE  Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education  has been assisting the committee, headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan in keeping track of alleged ragging incidents over the past year. This video hopes to capture the pain and trauma faced by the victims, and we believe, it must be seen by one and all, said Harsh Agarwal, who is one of CUREs founding members.     
	The video has been sent to several Delhi University colleges. The lyrics talk of the difficulties faced by the victims in getting complaints registered with police, or in convincing teachers to support them. The videos protagonist, stripped and humiliated, talks of how he felt like a slave.    
	et, during the ragging season at the start of an academic session, the victim says: Revenge I could seek, and gain; But customs have to change, Coz I... feel the pain.         
	Drive right, get free milk    
	Many Hyderabad roads turned into a milky way recently.    
	Drivers sticking to the straight and narrow were rewarded  with milk pouches under a unique initiative of sorts between Hyderabad traffic police and the Andhra Pradesh Dairy Development Co-operative Federation.    
	Milk products, and not just milk, were handed over to diligent drivers at junctions on a day observed as violation-free day after verifying their compliance with rules, additional police commissioner (traffic) V.S.K. Kaumudi said. The focus was on lane discipline, proper parking, pedestrian safety and pollution control.    
	Kaumudi said education officers had been urged to sensitise school authorities and children on the importance of road safety and traffic regulations. Adhar Sinha, the dairy federations boss, said such violation-free days were held on the first working day of every month.    
	HC heat on dust devils    
	Tamil Nadus stone-crushing units have long raised a lot of dust. Now, Madras High Court has turned the heat on them.    
	The judges last week asked the government to explain what action it intended to take against the units operating without consent from the pollution control board.    
	A division bench of Justices S.J. Mukhopadhaya and V. Dhanapalan observed that the boards report didnt specify whether the units required a licence under the factories act. They asked the government to clarify this in an affidavit. The units will also have to file their own affidavits.    
	The matter came up during the hearing of a public interest petition that has alleged many of the units were working within 500 metres of residential areas, causing hardships to people and leaving behind a harmful cloud of dust.    
	The court had asked the pollution watchdog to file a report on the number of such units near residential areas. The board told the court that 75 units had been operating in such zones and others had applied for clearance. (PTI)        
	BMC terror alert    
	The terror alarm has gone off at Mumbais civic body.    
	The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently decided to recruit more guards for its offices and facilities.    
	Municipal commissioner Jairaj Phatak said around 700 guards were required for its offices and other installations. In the focus are water pipelines, given greater security as they have long been vulnerable to encroachments. Phatak denied the possibility of a poison attack on the pipelines but said vigil had to be stepped up.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
             MS University: Stand-off continues
                 
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 1: MS University authorities yesterday asked Shivaji Panikkar, the suspended dean of the fine arts department, to appear before a disciplinary committee on January 11.
    
	Another professor, Iftikhar Ahmed, was handed a chargesheet accusing him of instigating students to hold an illegal assembly after Panikkar was suspended last May.
    
	Ahmed, who teaches history, has to respond to the chargesheet within five days.
    
	The notice and the chargesheet came on a day the Gujarat governor, in his capacity as visitor to the university, received a report recommending that Panikkar be reinstated. 
    
	On May 9 last year, Right-wing activists led by a BJP member had vandalised an art exhibition at the university, targeting paintings of gods and goddesses they said were obscene.
    
	Fine arts student Chandra Mohan, whose works had been targeted, was arrested and Panikkar suspended for refusing to close the exhibition.
    
	Fine arts students organised a protest that was called off only when governor Nawal Kishore Sharma ordered the inquiry by a three-member committee that submitted its report yesterday.
    
	The committee, headed by former Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor Y.K. Alagh, also recommended that Chandra Mohan be taken back and judged for his work that was part of the examination. 
    
	The recommendations were based on the panels conclusion that it was an internal examination that was disrupted on May 9, and not a public exhibition as alleged by the VHP activists who stormed the fine arts department and misbehaved with students. 
    
	In its report, the committee has held university authorities responsible for their failure to prevent hooligans from disrupting an internal examination. 
    
	Panikkar described the report as an elaborate democratic exercise and expressed satisfaction at the recommendations. He was optimistic about his suspension being revoked following the unbiased report and said he would appear before the disciplinary committee.
    
	MSU vice-chancellor Manoj Soni, known to be close to the Sangh parivar, refused to comment.
    
	Fine arts students gathered in front of the faculty office and burnt copies of the university committees inquiry report on the basis of which Ahmed was issued the chargesheet. If he fails to reply in five days, the university will proceed against him.
    
	I.I. Pandya, the president of the Vadodara University Teachers Association, described the universitys action as unfortunate. Certain elements in the university have become emboldened after the BJPs election win, he said. 
    
	Sources said the university authorities were about to sack Panikkar on the basis of a report submitted on August 23 by a four-member committee. The panel, headed by senate member Prakash Shah who is associated with the BJP, was set up by the vice-chancellor.

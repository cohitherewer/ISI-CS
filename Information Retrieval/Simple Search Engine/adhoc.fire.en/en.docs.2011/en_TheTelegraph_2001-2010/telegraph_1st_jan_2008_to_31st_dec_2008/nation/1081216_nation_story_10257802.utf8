          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The subject of live-in relationships agitated the Rajya Sabha today, with members anxiously asking if some state governments planned to make them legal.        
	Law minister Hansraj Bhardwaj reassured them saying the Centre had not received any proposal from any state asking for sanction to legalise such relationships.        
	BJP member Prabhat Jha had raised the matter during question hour. Is it a fact that some states have passed laws relating to live-in relationships or passed the same for the central governments approval? he asked.        
	Bhardwaj was quick to retort that Jhas party always spoke of the ancient times, the Vedic periods and Indias great civilisations and claimed that none of these mentioned live-in relationships.        
	BJP member Maya Singh rose to her partys defence, saying this was precisely the reason the question had been asked  in consternation rather than anticipation  since Indian culture was against such relationships.        
	But had not Maharashtra sent a proposal to the Centre to allow it to legalise live-in relationships, some still-doubtful members asked.        
	Bhardwaj denied this but added: If the Maharashtra government has sent such a proposal, then it seems it is quite advanced in its thinking, as live-in relations are not prevalent in India.        
	He added that although the domestic violence act protected women in live-in relationships too, it did not mean the government had legalised such relationships.        
	He said laws were made on the demands of society and that the majority of Indians were yet to accept live-in relationships.        
	There should be no controversy over the issue. As of now there is no such law on live-in relationships. When the time comes, a decision will be taken on it, the minister said.        
	As of now, only the law on domestic violence exists. There is a difference between a law and a proposal. It is a hypothetical question because as of now, no such proposal on live-in relationships has been received by the Centre, even though some state governments may have passed such a law.

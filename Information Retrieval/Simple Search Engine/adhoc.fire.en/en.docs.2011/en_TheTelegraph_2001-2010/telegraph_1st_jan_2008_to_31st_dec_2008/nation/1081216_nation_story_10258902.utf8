                              Ratan Tata: Taking no chances                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 15 (PTI) Ratan Tata today said the Tata Group would take steps to protect its assets and staff.        
	Criticising the manner in which the Mumbai terror attacks had been handled, Tata said: There should be leadership in knowing what to do. The fire department didnt know what to do, the commandos came too late, police were not equipped to engage, Tata said in a discussion organised by news channel CNBC TV18.        
	He said the group had decided to look at anti-terrorism or protection of assets and our people ourselves.        
	Tata, however, said the group was not trying to create heroes who will engage in the enemies, but to try and find as many invisible forms of deterring this (attacks), containing them or thwarting their efforts.

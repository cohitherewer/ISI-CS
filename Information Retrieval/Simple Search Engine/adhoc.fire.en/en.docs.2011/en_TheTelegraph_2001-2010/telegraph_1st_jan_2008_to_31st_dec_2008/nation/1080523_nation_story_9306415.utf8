          OUR CORRESPONDENT                Water worries?
    
	Cuttack, May 22: With Cuttack Municipal Corporation still stuck with excavating silt from the surface water channels and renovation work still on in main and tertiary drains, the city is far from being ready for the rains.        
	In 2007, more than 2 lakh people were trapped in their homes and 1 lakh were rendered homeless for over two days, as rainwater flowed 4-5ft on the roads in most parts of the silver city.         
	The civic body was expected to make the city ready for the showers by last week of May or first week of June with all silt-load removed and roads repaired.         
	According to civic records, the operation is expected to cover a kilometre of the drainage system comprising two main drains stretching (up to 25km), a network of (29km) branch drains and (72km) tertiary drains with surface water channels measuring up to 660km.        
	As things stand today, less than 70 per cent of the drain and roadwork has been completed, making waterlogging in parts of the city inevitable.        
	What makes it (waterlogging) predictable is that the main and branch drains at most areas prone to waterlogging are yet to be cleared, said Subash Singh, the president of CPMs Cuttack unit.         
	Stretches of main and branch drains near Jobra, College Square, High Court Square, Chandni Chowk, Mehendipur, Mahidas Bazaar, Sutahat, Alamchand Bazaar, Jagannath Ballav, Killkhanna near Barabati Stadium, Bhaktamadhu Vidyapith and Khatbin Sahi are areas where clearance had reportedly not been taken up.        
	Mayor Nivedita Pradhan, however, asserts that things would not be the same like last year. This time silt from almost all the major surface channels would be cleared within the scheduled time. Besides, widening and deepening of tertiary drains, relocation, reconstruction and renovation of culverts had been undertaken in parts of the city to resolve the problem, she asserted.        
	The CPM leader, on the other hand, expressed doubts. Inundation can not be ruled out where silt clearance has already been completed because the process has been restricted to just 1-2ft, he alleged.         
	At a meeting on rains on Tuesday, the Mayor has issued orders to ensure that all 117 pumps of the CMC are functional by June 5 for deployment in low lying areas of the city.

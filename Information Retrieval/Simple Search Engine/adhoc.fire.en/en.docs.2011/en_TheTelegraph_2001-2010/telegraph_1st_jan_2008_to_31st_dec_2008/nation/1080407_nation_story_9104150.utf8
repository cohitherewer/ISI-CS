          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, April 6: Todays cabinet expansion had many Congress leaders in election-bound Madhya Pradesh knitting their brows.        
	That a restless Jyotiraditya Scindia has been inducted in the council of ministers is no surprise. But the state party unit is anxious about AICC general secretary in charge of the state V. Narayanaswamy and secretary Jitin Prasada joining the Manmohan Singh government.        
	With Assembly elections scheduled in November, the question doing the rounds is whether the Narayanaswamy-Prasada duo would continue to do their organisational work in addition to being central ministers. And if they are divested of party work, would the new set of point men get enough time to oversee the Congresss poll preparations?        
	Local Congress leaders are now questioning why Prasada had been drafted for party work in September 2007 when his services were to be requisitioned in the government in six months.        
	If Narayanaswamy-Prasada continue to hold dual charges, it will signal that party chief Sonia Gandhi has given a quiet burial to the one-man, one-post norm in the Congress.         
	Prithviraj Chavan, Shakeel Ahmed, Ajay Maken, Jairam Ramesh, Oscar Fernandes, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Saifuddin Soz are some senior party leaders working both in the government and the party.        
	The one-man, one-post convention has always been controversial, leading to many a titanic battle within the party.         
	The last time the Congress witnessed a major row over the issue was during Narasimha Raos regime when a motley group led by Arjun Singh had unsuccessfully tried to get the one-man, one-post principle implemented on the then Prime Minister, who was also the Congress president.         
	The news of Jyotiradityas induction has enthused a handful of party leaders in Gwalior, who were seen distributing laddoos and bursting firecrackers. But the celebrations lack popular flavour. An important reason for this is that another Scindia, the BJPs Yashodhara Raje, represents Gwalior in the Lok Sabha.        
	Jyotiradityas induction in the government comes two months after fellow Madhya Pradesh leader Suresh Pachauris appointment as state Congress chief.

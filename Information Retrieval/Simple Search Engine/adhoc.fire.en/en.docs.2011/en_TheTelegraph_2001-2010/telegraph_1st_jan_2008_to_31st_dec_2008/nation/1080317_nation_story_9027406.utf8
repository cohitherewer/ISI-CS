          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: Former state health minister Bijoyshree Routray, named as the recipient of Rs 5 lakh bribe in a World Bank- funded project, has sent a pleader notice to chief secretary Ajit Tripathy intimating his move to file a Rs 1-crore damages and defamation suit.         
	Talking to reporters here today, Routray said he has been advised by his advocate to initiate proper legal action before taking up the matter in court.         
	I have begun procedures by giving a due notice to the chief secretary under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure for defamation and damage to the tune of Rs 1 crore, he said.         
	The minister also circulated copies of the notice sent by his advocate Budhadev Routray to Tripathy on March 11.         
	On January 24, chief secretary had told the media that a World Bank team had informed the state that a former health minister, in office during July 2005, had received a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from a particular company through an agent.        
	At that point of time, Routray was holding the health portfolio, Tripathy had added.         
	The statement was not only false, but also maliciously fabricated to tarnish my image, said Routray.         
	He pointed out that the state administration had overlooked an important condition in the World Bank statement that stated their report could not be used for purposes of any investigation or inquiry as the report was not an investigative one. It was based on certain allegations and hearsay only.         
	Routray said he had written a letter to the chief secretary on February 2 asking him to retract his damaging statement and tender an unconditional public apology. Instead of doing so, he replied evasively on the issue on February 16, said Routray.        
	I was not satisfied and asked my lawyer to send notice, he said, adding that he would file the suit after a stipulated period of 60 days.         
	Routray also reiterated his previous demand for a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the World Bank-funded Orissa Health System Development Project for the entire period.

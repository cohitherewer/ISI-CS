	Mumbai, Jan. 18: Deccan is handing out a one-way ticket to those flying six times and two to those making 10 journeys between January 15 and March 31, reports our correspondent. 
    
	Only the passenger service fee of Rs 225 will have to be paid on the complimentary tickets, part of the airlines plan to lure frequent fliers.
    
	The move comes after the December 19 merger of the no-frills carrier with Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines. The two carriers will operate as a single entity from April 1. 
    
	Taking over the management of Deccan, Mallya had asserted that there was no such concept as low-cost airlines and said it was impossible to keep air fares low or make free offers. Deccan Aviation has run up accumulated losses of around Rs 800 crore.

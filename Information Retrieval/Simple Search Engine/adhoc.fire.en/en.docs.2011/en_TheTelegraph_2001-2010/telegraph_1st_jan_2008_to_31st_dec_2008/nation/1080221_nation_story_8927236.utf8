The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red debate rocks House, legislators suspended
                                                                                                               Red debate rocks House, legislators suspended
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Raipur, Feb. 20: Nineteen Congress legislators, including the Leader of the Opposition, were suspended from the Assembly today after they stormed into the well to protest against the alleged failure of the government in dealing with Naxalism in the state.         
	The Congress legislators and Opposition leader Mahendra Karma were suspended under the Section 250(1) of the rules of procedure and conduct of business for Chhattisgarh Vidhan Sabha. As per the rule, members who enter the well be deemed suspended (suo moto) for the period decided by the Speaker.         
	The ruckus inside the House started soon after the question hour started. The Congress MLAs moved an adjournment motion over the irregularities in jails alleging that the state governments lapse resulted in the Dantewada jailbreak in December 2007.         
	State home minister Ramvichar Netam denied the Congresss charges and stressed that the government was committed to rooting out rebels from Chhattisgarh.         
	Unconvinced, the Congress members started shouting alleging that the state government was not serious in their efforts to tackle the Maoist menace.         
	They also demanded immediate resignation of Netam and started raising slogans against the state government. Thereafter, they trooped into the well.        
	The pandemonium compelled Deputy Speaker Badridhar Diwan (on the chair) to adjourn the House for a brief period.         
	When the House reassembled, the Congress members continued with their uproar. Diwan later announced that 19 Congress members, including Karma, have been suspended and asked them to leave the House immediately.        
	On February 12, Karma, who is in the Maoists hit list with chief minister Raman Singh, miraculously escaped three attempts on his life, thanks to alert security personnel.         
	The rebels tried to ambush him while he was visiting the Dantewada district.

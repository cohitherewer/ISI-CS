          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Dec. 25: A human rights activist has petitioned the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against the police brutality and atrocities inflicted on Akshay Kumar Mohanty, an officer in the soil conservation department.         
	The official was stripped and beaten up while in police custody at Athagarh on Tuesday night.         
	Prabir Kumar Das, also a practising advocate of the Orissa High Court Bar, has sought the rights panels intervention for and has been demanding Rs 1 lakh for the victim, proper inquiry and action against erring officers.         
	The alleged act by the police militates against the canons of human rights and the solemn guarantee of fundamental right to life, personal liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution, stated the petition, a copy of which was made available to The Telegraph today.         
	Reportedly, on December 23 IC of Athagarh P.K. Jena got into a heated argument with Akshay Kumar Mohanty, section officer at the local soil conservation department office, while looking for one Grade-IV employee, Kirtan Nayak.         
	Kirtan was allegedly wanted in connection with an FIR lodged with the police.         
	The petition states that the Jena got infuriated with the official for refusing to accompany the two officers to the watchmans quarters, and thus the IC forcibly took him to the police station.         
	There the section officer was tortured both physically and mentally by the said IC. He was disrobed and beaten mercilessly by the police.         
	Photographs in newspapers of Akshay Kumar Mohanty inside the police lock up without any clothes attests to the brutality, atrocity and inhumanity of the police, the petition said.        
	It is a matter of grave concern that Akshays brother, Arun Mohanty (who is a practising advocate and member of the local Bar) was also brought to the police station on the night of December 23.         
	Meanwhile, the local Bar has demanded action against the police officers.         
	Cuttack (rural) superintendent of police Rajat Mishra told The Telegraph: Inspector Pradipta Kumar Jena was placed under suspension yesterday, while ASI Niranjan Sabar was also withdrawn from the station.

          JANE PERLEZ                          Musharraf and Bush at a joint news conference in Islamabad in 2006                                   
	Islamabad, Aug. 18: A commando at heart, and a man of often impetuous decisions, Pervez Musharraf reversed position after 9/11 and joined the US, becoming one of Washingtons most crucial allies in the campaign against terrorism.        
	It was a bold stroke that boosted the Bush administration in its immediate war against al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan, and allowed the US to work with Pakistani intelligence to arrest senior Qaida operatives inside Pakistan. Musharraf also gave Washington permission to strike at Qaida targets in his nations lawless tribal areas.        
	But the assurances turned out to be less than promised, and though Musharraf forged a personal bond with President George W. Bush, the Pakistani general proved to be a tough, frustrating customer for the US. Pakistans powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency never severed ties with the Taliban.        
	Nine years later, the Taliban are putting up a ferocious fight against the US in Afghanistan, and are providing shelter to al Qaida in the tribal areas. The rejuvenated Taliban now virtually control Pakistans tribal region bordering Afghanistan, and are pressing into the rest of the country, threatening the stability of the nuclear-armed nation of 165 million people.        
	Musharraf continued to provide cover to the Taliban, but still managed to convince the Americans for many years that it was not a double game, said Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani expert on the Taliban and the author of Descent into Chaos, a book that details the relationship between Musharraf and Washington. It was a remarkable feat of balancing on the tightrope.        
	The feat was so skillful that Musharraf won more than $10 billion in American military assistance for his army, as well as unannounced covert aid. About half the military aid was supposed to be spent on bolstering the counter-insurgency skills of the army.        
	Much of that money never reached the military and was allocated instead to Pakistans general budget, but the Bush administration was so anxious to keep Musharraf as an ally it chose not to complain, according to a congressional investigation this year.        
	Washington finally lost patience last month. In a diplomatic showdown, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency confronted the new Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, with evidence that the Pakistani intelligence service helped plan the July 7 terror attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul.        
	But by that time, Musharrafs power was eclipsed, and the Bush administration acknowledged that Musharrafs usefulness was past.        
	In the end, his failure to manage his double game of keeping the Americans on his side and allowing the religious extremists to thrive may have proved his undoing, and left Pakistan in a more precarious position, Rashid said.

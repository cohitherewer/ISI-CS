     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Beijing, Jan. 13: India will ask for a political push to take forward talks on the boundary dispute with China.
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his team could broach the topic when they meet their Chinese counterparts tomorrow. But the issue would most definitely come up when the special representatives of the two countries  national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and his Chinese counterpart Dai Bingquo  meet on Tuesday.
    
	Singh and Premier Wen Jiabao today decided to focus on other issues  notably commerce and civilian nuclear cooperation  but agreed that their talks should cover the entire gamut of issues, a highly placed source said.
    
	Narayanan and Dai will also consider an exchange of maps on the disputed western and eastern sectors of the border.
    
	The source said India would not hesitate to bring up the border issue and would like an initiative to resolve the dispute included in a joint statement the two sides are likely to come out with tomorrow.
    
	Asked about the status of the talks, the source said: We have a framework and they have a framework, there are points of convergence and there are points of divergence, now we have to evolve a common framework.
    
	He explained that this would bring up the issue of settled populations, meaning whether the countries could agree to redraw a border through populated areas that would necessitate an exchange of peoples.
    
	India is not in favour of such a proposal that has in the past been mildly suggested by the Chinese.
    
	Singh is also likely to visit Arunachal Pradesh at the end of this month. China formally lays claim to all of that state.

     BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: All chief ministers have been warned to avoid risks and stick to security norms following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
    
	A note from the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, last week told chief ministers and state police chiefs that militants could use new-wave tactics to kill targets. It said other high-profile political leaders, too, were under threat.
    
	The advisory did not explain what the new-wave tactics might be but referred to militants use of sophisticated technology.
    
	A home ministry official suggested these tactics could include the use of laser-guided weapons with perfect accuracy. Or, women and children spies.
    
	There are intelligence inputs that women may be used to get close to the target to gather information about his habits and routine, the official said.
    
	Narayanans advisory said: They (militants) are now engaged in a great deal of planning before carrying out an attack. This includes studying the habits and attitudes and day-to-day activities of their targets, their areas of vulnerability and the weaknesses in the security system around them. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a classic example of how this technique can and has been employed.
    
	He added that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil had asked for security to be tightened across the board, with special emphasis on the security of chief ministers and other key political leaders.
    
	They (the security measures) should be further strengthened wherever necessary; weakness in the security system should be identified and properly plugged where necessary. Leaders should be persuaded not to take unnecessary or uncalled-for risks and urged to adhere to norms to establish foolproof security, the note added.
    
	Intelligence sources said the Union home ministry was reviewing security. The process had gained momentum following a request by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati for Special Protection Group (SPG) cover.
    
	In the case of Mayavati, she already has the maximum, Z-plus, security. According to the last threat assessment by the Intelligence Bureau, she could have done with even somewhat reduced security, an official said.
    
	But with this advisory from the NSA, we cannot take any chances. The question of downgrading security does not arise. The best we can do is maintain status quo.

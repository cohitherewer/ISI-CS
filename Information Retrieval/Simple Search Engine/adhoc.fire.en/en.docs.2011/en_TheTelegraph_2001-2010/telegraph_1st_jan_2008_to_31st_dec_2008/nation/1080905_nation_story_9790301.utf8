	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Two employees of a food-retail chain were arrested today for allegedly being part of a ring that stole credit card details to make Internet purchases.         
	The duo, who worked at Food Bazaar on Burdwan Road in Alipore, are suspected have ripped off more than a dozen cardholders over the past month with the help of an associate in Delhi.        
	The accused have been identified as Mrityunjay Mishra, an MBA student, and Amit Mishra. We have contacted our counterparts in Delhi and our sleuths will go to the capital soon to arrest a person named Amren, their associate and possibly the kingpin, an officer from the Alipore police station said.        
	Preliminary investigations showed that Mrityunjay and Amit had collected the card details of shoppers at Food Bazar on the sly and sent the information to Delhi, where Amren was said to have used it to make high-value purchases on the Internet.        
	The two would note down the 11-digit card number and the three-digit security code, above the magnetic strip on the reverse, as they billed the Food Bazar transactions.        
	One of the victims recently received a credit card bill of Rs 1.18 lakh for purchases he hadnt made. Shocked, he informed officials of Standard Chartered, which had issued the card.         
	The officials first conducted an internal inquiry. Later, regional manager (east) Barius Pamboli lodged a complaint at Alipore police station, on the basis of which an investigation was started and the duo were arrested.        
	Mrityunjay and Amit are being interrogated about their criminal antecedents, how they distributed the booty among themselves and for more information about Amren.

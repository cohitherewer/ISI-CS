	Srinagar, Nov. 16: Five labourers died when a newly constructed bridge over the Jhelum in Uri collapsed during testing today.          20 labourers were working on the Parampila bridge, 106km from Srinagar. A rescue operation is on, but officials said the chances of survival for those trapped was little.                   
	Lucknow: A crude bomb stashed in a small metal container exploded on Sunday when a child rag-picker foraging in a garbage dump hurled the tin on the ground after failing to open it. The blast, in the minority-dominated Aishbagh area of western Lucknow, is the third in three days in the city and has set off fears that it could be a prelude to a bigger terror strike.                  
	Meerut (PTI): A newborn child was injured in Meerut on Saturday after his incubator caught fire. The tube light in the incubator had exploded causing the blast. Doctors said the baby was born unconscious.

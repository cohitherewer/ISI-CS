          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 22: The Opposition managed to stall House proceedings for the day demanding the resignation of deputy Speaker Prahalad Dora, who is facing dowry and abuse charges.         
	No business was transacted during the day, as the Opposition stormed the Well and created a scene right from the question hour, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House twice for more than an hour and then finally for the day.         
	As soon as the Assembly met in the morning, Opposition whip Satya Bhusan Sahu drew the Houses attention to the charges brought by Doras daughter-in-law. Sahu alleged that since there is a case against Dora, the deputy Speaker is an accused and not fit to occupy the deputy Speakers chair.         
	The Opposition whip also demanded that the House be adjourned, till Dora resigns. On the other hand, BJP member Mahesh Sahu accused Congress leaders of instigating Doras daughter-in-law, sparking off protests from the Opposition bench. Congress members rushed to the well, while deputy leader of the Opposition Narasingha Mishra described the remarks as unfortunate. He dared Sahu to substantiate the allegations, or tender an apology. The Speaker said he would allow discussions on the matter only after the question answer session. He stated that he would convene an all-party meeting after the question hour to sort out the issue. However, the determined Opposition insisted on Doras resignation.         
	Obliquely referring to the case of former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty, who had resigned following sexual harassment charges in March, deputy leader of the Opposition said there should not be double standards in the House proceedings.         
	As the Speaker did not listen to their plea, angry Opposition members trooped into the Well, while Tara Prasad Bahinipati dragged Assembly secretarys chair towards the Speakers podium, stood on it and started shouting slogans.         
	The Opposition members shouted: BJD-BJP stop the torture of women. Bahinipati snatched away the Speakers microphone. The Speaker adjourned the House for 46 minutes and again for 30 minutes. Finally, he adjourned it till Monday, after expunging the remarks made by BJP member Mahesh Sahu from the Assembly proceedings.

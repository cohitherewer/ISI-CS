	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Congress raced from internal squabbles and pessimism to its third consecutive victory in Delhi today, in a late sprint party sources say was won almost at the tape.         
	Poll surveys as late as September suggested the Opposition BJP had an edge over the 10-year-old government of Sheila Dikshit, an assessment even Congress leaders accept they shared. The BJP had trounced the Congress in last years municipal elections.        
	But with the grand old aunty of Delhi politics  as Dikshit is known here  as its mascot, the Congress not only caught up but with 42 seats, also neared its 2003 tally of 47. In 1998, it had won 38 of the 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly.         
	I congratulate the people of Delhi and many thanks to them for their support and affection for the Congress, the 70-year-old Dikshit said at her residence as jubilant party supporters danced to drumbeats and burst firecrackers.        
	Officially, the Congress is yet to announce its chief minister, and Dikshit avoided any commitment on the issue, but her chances appear almost secure, party leaders said. As results came in, murmurs of dissent within the state BJP over the choice of senior leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra, 77, as chief ministerial candidate grew louder.         
	A younger leader could have challenged Dikshit better than the BJPs Lok Sabha deputy leader, one senior Delhi BJP leader said. When you fail to dislodge a government after 10 years, it means the voter doesnt think you represent an adequate alternative. He wants change. We gave slogans, but only offered more of the same, the leader said.         
	Congress sources accepted the Mumbai terror attacks just three days ahead of the capitals polls on November 29 had given them a few anxious moments in Delhi.         
	If the terror attacks had to have an effect on any of elections, Delhi being a metro like Mumbai was best suited, one Delhi Congress leader said.         
	Asked about the prominent place terror found in the BJPs campaign, Dikshit today said: Nobody should play politics over terror attacks and all parties should join hands in defeating terrorism.         
	What possibly worked for the Congress was a combination of Dikshits persona, largely untarnished even after 10 years, and specific initiatives, leaders from both the Congress and the BJP said.         
	She successfully navigated the treacherous Bus Rapid Transport corridor, joked one Congress leader, referring to the dedicated bus corridors on existing roads that were unpopular with private vehicle owners because they reduced space and led to longer travel time for them.        
	The expansion of the popular Delhi Metro helped, the leader said.         
	But while Dikshits image among voters helped, key initiatives taken over the last few months gave the Congress the push it needed to catch up with and overtake the BJP, leaders from both parties said. Many of these were taken by the Centre, some after Dikshits nudge.         
	The Sixth Pay Commission that raised salaries of lakhs of central government employees  the largest chunk of these employees resides in Delhi  played a key role in creating a feel-good mood for the Congress, sources said.        
	The Union urban development ministry, pushed by the state Congress, regularised more unauthorised colonies over the past six months than in the past four years.        
	The unauthorised colonies were epicentres of anti-government protests two years ago when a new master plan for the capital led to Supreme Court-driven sealing of illegal premises.        
	Egged on by the Prime Ministers Office, the Union human resource development ministry offered a one-time financial grant to the capitals minority educational institutions struggling for funds.         
	From open revolts to quiet conspiracies, Dikshit has witnessed opposition from several senior party leaders from Delhi over the past five years. But she is widely understood to have the support of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, and as the partys face in the capital, is tipped for a third term.        
	This victory is being seen by many as Sheila Dikshits victory. It is hard for her to be denied the CMs post, said a senior party leader who in the past has participated in attempts to dethrone Dikshit.

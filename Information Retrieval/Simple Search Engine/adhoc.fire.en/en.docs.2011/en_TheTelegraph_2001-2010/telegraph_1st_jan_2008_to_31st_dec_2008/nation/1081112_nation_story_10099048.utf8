          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The PMO may have sent back for a rethink the names of three high court judges forwarded for elevation to the Supreme Court, but if the Chief Justice insists on them a second time, the law ministry will have to go along.        
	According to the norms, the government can only suggest that the Supreme Court collegium that recommends the names rethink its choice. The final decision is up to the collegium, made up of the courts seniormost judges. If it persists with its choice, the government has no further say.        
	The collegium had on October 18 recommended that A.K. Ganguly, R.M. Lodha and H.L. Dattu  the Chief Justices of Madras, Patna and Kerala High Courts  be elevated to the Supreme Court. In the process, A.P. Shah, A.K. Patnaik and V.K. Gupta  the Chief Justices of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand High Courts  were bypassed.         
	The Prime Ministers Office is believed to have sent the names back to the law ministry for reconsideration, asking why seniority was ignored.        
	According to a 1993 Supreme Court judgment, intended to safeguard judicial appointments from executive interference, the Chief Justice of India initiates the proposals for appointment of judges. The collegium confirms these and sends them to the law ministry for vetting, with any dissenting notes from members.         
	The ministry runs a background security check on the candidates and sends the list to the PMO for its recommendations. The files are then forwarded to the President for his or her assent.         
	Instances of the government urging the collegium to reconsider are unusual but not rare, but instances of the court changing its mind are few and far between.         
	Last year, President Pratibha Patil elevated controversial judge Jagdish Bhalla as Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh a whole year after her predecessor A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had refused to elevate him as Kerala Chief Justice.         
	Kalam had said he acted on complaints of misconduct and impropriety against Bhalla, then an Allahabad High Court judge, levelled by lawyers and judges. But the Supreme Court insisted on his name being cleared for the post, and Patil had no choice.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Centre has threatened to withdraw funds sanctioned to 12 states and Union territories for implementing the domestic violence prevention act because they have not followed a key provision of the 2006 law.         
	In a letter to the states and UTs, the women and child development ministry has sought an explanation for not appointing dedicated protection officers, government officials said.         
	Protection officers are the nodal officials a domestic violence victim is required to complain to. The officer counsels the victim, tries to resolve differences with her partner, and is responsible for helping file legal charges if attempts at an amicable resolution fail.         
	The law, which came into existence in October 2006, required each state and UT to appoint at least one dedicated protection officer in every district within 100 days. Twelve  Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Nagaland, Tripura and Mizoram among them  are yet to do so.        
	The letter, written by ministry secretary Anil Kumar, was issued on August 25 after a health ministry survey found that in some states, the majority of women suffer domestic violence. Bihar was the worst, with six out of 10 women reporting violence. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh came next, at 46 per cent. The national average was 37 per cent. Rajasthan, too, has no dedicated officers.         
	The social welfare officer has been handed the additional task of working as protection officer. He is already burdened, and invariably neglects his job as protection officer, the ministry official said.

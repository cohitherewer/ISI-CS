	New Delhi, Oct. 27: The onus lies on Mumbai police to prove that Rahul Raj represented an imminent threat to the life of his co-passengers to justify the shots that killed him, serving and retired officers have said.        
	The police rulebook does not authorise any officer to shoot to kill. A police officer, like any other citizen, enjoys the right to defend his life and property  no more, no less, the officers added.         
	However, as the custodian of the life and property of members of the public, a police officer has the right to use reasonable force to neutralise any threat from any person  armed or unarmed  to any member of the public, Neeraj Kumar, Delhi police joint commissioner, said.         
	Usually, a warning should be given to any armed person who represents a threat. The person should be asked to surrender, if there is time for negotiations, a CRPF officer said. If such efforts fail, attempts should be made to overpower or disable the person by shooting without any intention to kill, he said.         
	However, if the law-enforcer on the spot perceives irretrievable loss of life and property if immediate action is not pursued, a decision can be taken on the use of force or firearms.        
	Whether its lathicharge, tear-gassing, use of water-cannons or firing, the command and control lies with the police (in normal circumstances), Kumar said.         
	The senior-most officer is expected to take a call on whether to open fire with intention to kill in the absence of a magistrate. But even a constable can authorise firing in the absence of high-ranking officials if the threat perception is high, the officers said.         
	It all depends on the threat perception of the officer present on the spot, a veteran said. But every time a police officer uses more than reasonable force, the onus is on him to justify its use.        
	However, the reputation of the police in India is such that their version is often taken with a pinch of salt, others pointed out.        
	 Retaliatory fire or escaping from custody has always been an excuse conjured up by police officers each time they use excess force, Ashok Arora, a lawyer, said. Its illegal to shoot down persons in cold blood without first exhausting other means.        
	The UNs basic principles state that whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, officers shall exercise restraint, minimise damage and injury and respect and preserve human life.        
	The UN rules mandate that persons affected by the use of force and firearms or their legal representatives shall have access to an independent process, including a judicial process, for redress. In the event of the death of such persons, this provision shall apply to their dependants accordingly.        
	In India, an inquiry is not the norm  such an exercise is undertaken only under public or political pressure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Giridih cries for missing sailor
                                                                                                               Giridih cries for missing sailor
          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, Feb. 28: The family of engineer Alok Kumar, who went missing along with 25 Indian crew in Black Sea, has sought help from the state and central governments to trace them.        
	Kumar, a resident of Deo Nagar, Giridih, and a marine engineer, was sailing on the cargo ship MV Rezzak bound for Turkey when his vessel went missing in Black Sea between February 18 and 25.        
	The vessel, manned by Mumbai-based Pelican Marine, was carrying steel billets in bundles from Russia to Bartin Port in Turkey, when it lost all contact with the tracking centres. The 24-year-old son of a schoolteacher, Rameshwar Mandal, was a bright student and had begun his professional career just one-and-a-half years ago. The student of H.E. High School, Kumar had clinched 86 per cent in his matriculation examination in 1999 and had topped in undivided Bihar. The then education minister Jai Prakash Yadav had awarded him at a function in Patna.        
	Thereafter, Kumar passed his Plus-Two from St. Xaviers School, Ranchi, with 76 per cent marks. He passed out from the maritime academy in Chennai. In August 2006, he had joined Pelican Marine. Alok is the elder of two brothers and has two sisters. Though hailing from a lower middle background, father Rameshwar ensured that all his children received good education.         
	Kumars younger brother Arvind is pursuing engineering in electronic and communication, while a sister, Kanchan Kumari, has completed her post-graduation in history and the other, Sapna Bharti, pursuing her post-graduation in political science.        
	Kumar was a brilliant student throughout his career and his professional life had just begun. A day before the incident I spoke to him, said the grieving father.        
	We used to strongly believe that he must be safe wherever he is. Both the central and state governments should take concrete steps to trace out the ship crew, he added.         
	We strongly believe that our brother is safe as god cannot be so cruel, Kanchan told The Telegraph.        
	Deputy commissioner Birendra Ram said: We have not received any information regarding this, but we would certainly try to trace out Kumar.         
	Meanwhile, PTI reports from Mumbai that a fresh search operation by the Turkish authorities to trace any possible survivors of the Panamanian registered ship with the Indian crew on board is yet to yield any result.        
	India cannot send a rescue team to Black Sea because the missing vessel has been registered in Panama, a top shipping official said.         
	However we are sending one person to be part of a joint investigation that would be carried out by Panama authority, he said.        
	India had asked Turkey on Tuesday to continue with the search and rescue operation three days after it was abandoned as no wreckage of the ship was found.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wife dies in hammer attack, Indian in cuffs
          AMIT ROY                           Chitradevi Chandran                                  
	London, Aug. 7: A highly educated Indian husband with two degrees, one in theology and the other in engineering, has been charged with a horrific claw hammer attack on his wife, who has died, and his mother-in-law, who remains seriously injured in hospital.         
	Evidence from neighbours passed to The Telegraph suggests it was a domestic dispute, which got out of hand.         
	Anburaj Arjunan, 31, has appeared at Cambridge Crown Court, charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Chitradevi Chandran, who was also 31.         
	He was also charged with attempted murder of Chitradevis 56-year-old mother, who remains in a stable condition in Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, after undergoing major surgery for head injuries.         
	Since the incident on Saturday morning, when neighbours heard screams just before 6am from 43, Midland Road, Peterborough, police have issued a series of bulletins.         
	In the first, the police merely said: A man has been arrested after two women were discovered with head injuries at a property in Peterborough. Officers were called to a house in Midland Road at 6.30am this morning and discovered the two injured women. A 31-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident at the house and is currently in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station. The two women, one of whom is aged 31, were taken to Peterborough District Hospital and later transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, where they are described as critical.         
	It quoted detective chief inspector Tony Ixer as saying: We believe this is an isolated incident and we are not looking for anyone else.         
	The second bulletin said: The 31-year-old woman who was injured in the assault has died. A post-mortem examination is due to take place at Addenbrookes Hospital.         
	The third issued a statement on behalf of Chitradevis family: Chitra will be sadly missed by her family and friends after being taken from them in unforeseen circumstances. We would like to thank all of those people and friends who have offered and given their help and support during this tragic time.         
	The next said Anburaj Arjunan, aged 31, of Midland Road, Peterborough, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder.         
	Chitradevi, who worked as an occupational therapist in nearby Huntingdon, came from a Hindu family in Tamil Nadu but had apparently converted to Christianity. She had been in Britain for barely three months. Her mother, who shared the house with her daughter and son-in-law, spoke little English.         
	By interviewing a neighbour, Gul Nawaz, a councillor and deputy mayor on the Peterborough Council, who lives only two doors away at 39, Midland Road, The Telegraph has been able to piece together the sequence of events on Saturday morning.         
	I had met the man, said Nawaz, who owns other properties in the area. He said he was looking for a house. I took him in my car. He seemed very educated, a very well spoken young man. He did not like the house I showed him. I sometimes said Hello to his wife and mother-in-law.         
	Nawaz disclosed there had been no previous indication of domestic disharmony. On Saturday morning, I was woken up by screaming from next door. I said to my Mrs, Is it Pat and Tony?  our neighbours at number 41. Later we heard Pat and Tony at first thought it was coming from our house.         
	Nawaz went back to sleep only to be woken by the sound of a car engine outside. I thought my son, who is a taxi driver, had come back from work. I looked out of the window and saw a police car and then more police and then an ambulance. Then I saw the mother coming out, blood streaming from her head, then the man brought out handcuffed. Everyone is upset by the news, we are all in shock.        
	In England, you dont take the law into your hand in a domestic dispute, Nawaz said. If you dont get on with your wife, you can always go to a solicitor.         
	Immediate next door neighbour Patricia Toseland, 65, said: They had only been living in the house for about three months, and it is so sad to hear that she has died. She was such a lovely, kind and caring lady. She was so pretty.         
	She added: Although you hear about these incidents on the news, you never expect something like this to happen on your doorstep. It is shocking to think she is about the same age as my daughter.         
	Chitradevis colleagues have paid tribute to her. The head of childrens services at Cambridgeshire Community Services, Janet Dullaghan, said: We are shocked and saddened by Chitradevis tragic death. Chitradevis passing is a loss to our service. She was a very kind, warm and cheerful member of staff. Chitradevi will be greatly missed by her team and colleagues.

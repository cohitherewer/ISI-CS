	Cuttack, Feb. 7: The battle between the state and the farmers over the culling of healthy birds in Orissas poultry farms has reached the courts.        
	Farmers today moved Cuttack High Court for the issue. The union of farmers consisting of All Orissa Poultry Farmers Association, All Orissa Layers Farmers Association and All Orissa Broiler and Integrator Association has asked the court to not allow the government to cull healthy birds within 5km radius of the Bengal border.        
	The Union government on February 1 directed the state to cull all birds up to 5km near the Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand and Orissa borders. The states poultry farmers had since then been protesting the Centres directive.        
	Though the states animal husbandry and veterinary services department had initially shown its unwillingness to cull healthy chickens, they, on Monday, decided to take no risk and abide by the order.

	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Mayavati today accused the Congress of plotting to kill her and warned that she might withdraw support to the Centre, but delayed the decision in what analysts said was a ploy to leave room for rapprochement.
    
	I am the biggest political hurdle in the Congress path and hence it wants me eliminated, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister told a crowded news conference here today.
    
	The Bahujan Samaj Party leader, whose Dalit-Brahmin axis has posed a threat to the Congress in several states, added that if something untoward happened to her, the Congress would be responsible.
    
	Mayavati said intelligence agencies, at the Centre as well as in Uttar Pradesh, were aware of the plot to kill her. The government of Uttar Pradesh wrote to the Centre about this and sought SPG cover for myself. But the Centre didnt agree. This also makes the Congress partys intention suspect. It smacks of a conspiracy to eliminate me.
    
	The allegation hasnt been taken seriously by the capitals political class, but it underlined the collapse of the fragile understanding between the two parties.
    
	The BSP leader said party workers were busy preparing for her birthday on January 15 but, after that, she would call a meeting to decide whether to withdraw support to the Congress-led central coalition.
    
	Observers said the weeks delay was a tactical move to leave scope for reconciliation. If the Congress bowed to her muscle-flexing and helped her shake off tax cases filed against her, she could, they said, make a turnaround.
    
	Mayavati claimed that Allahabad don Ateek Ahmed, absconding in a murder case, had been given shelter by some Congress leaders in Delhi. Ateek wants to kill me and he has been given protection by Congress leaders, she said.
    
	Asked why she wasnt naming the leaders, Mayavati said she would when the time comes.
    
	Asked if she believed Sonia Gandhi was part of the alleged conspiracy, the BSP leader said those speaking against her held high positions in the Congress but she had nothing against the Congress chief. She has been ailing for some time. I myself called up to enquire about her health.
    
	Three factors appear to have prompted Mayavati to go ballistic. First, the Congress leadership indicated it wasnt happy with the income-tax tribunals verdict on assets cases against the chief minister.
    
	Second, the Centre turned down her request that the elite Special Protection Group, reserved for providing cover to the Prime Minister and former Prime Ministers, handle her personal security.
    
	Third, the Congress had attacked her over the recent terrorist strikes in Uttar Pradesh.

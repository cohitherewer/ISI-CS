     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, March 3: Hard to buy, but true. The Bihar government has granted a Pakistan national a ration card. He has a voter identity card, too. 
    
	The person in question exceeded his stay in India. But instead of being pulled he was awarded with a ration card as a Phulwarisharif resident in 2005. And subsequently he made his way to the voters roll. 
    
	The fact came to light only after Mahboob Imam (52) wrote to the Union home ministry in 2007 applying for Indian citizenship. 
    
	The home ministry found fault with his application and asked the Bihar government to look into the matter. He had earlier applied for Indian citizenship in 1983. 
    
	Home ministry demanded Imams name be immediately struck off from the ration card and voters list. 
    
	Imam has been staying with his family here and ekes out a living running petty businesses. 
    
	In his letter to the home ministry, Imam had written that he was born in Phulwarisharif and had moved to Pakistan in 1963 leaving behind his family here. 
    
	He had been coming to Bihar at regular intervals as a Pakistan citizen before he finally started living at Phulwarisharif since 2002. 
    
	Imam had settled in Karachi and became a Pakistan citizen. He had come to Phulwarisharif in 2002, too. 
    
	But his passport (D-849167) became invalid in 2004. Unaware, the local police took no action to send him back to Pakistan. He has been staying here in India ever since 2002. 
    
	The state election commission, in a letter dated January 20, 2008, asked district office of the commission in Patna to take adequate action. Patna office wrote to the block development officer to seek details on Imam and submit a report. 
    
	Phulwarisharif police station in charge Sabbir Ahmed told The Telegraph: We have been asked intermittently about the case. We have given our report to Patna superintendent of police, who has been co-ordinating with the passport office. 
    
	Ahmed, however, refused to divulge details of his report. 
    
	An officer said: Imam has been living in Ishopur and has procured a ration card and voter card based on his Ishopur address. 
    
	Imam could not be contacted for his version.

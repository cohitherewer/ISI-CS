The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security lapse row
                                                                                                               Security lapse row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 13: Rahul Gandhi took up half of Zero Hour, without speaking a word.        
	Biju Janata Dal (BJD) members, egged on by the BJP, held the Lok Sabha to ransom for 30 minutes over what they described as security violation by the Congress MP.        
	On a trip to Naxalite-infested Koraput in Orissa last week, Rahul had gone to an undisclosed destination for four hours without telling police.        
	Today, the BJDs Braj Kishore Tripathi went on and on about how Rahul had ignored security restrictions and SPG personnel assigned to him had misbehaved with the local police.         
	Zero Hour is the time when MPs can raise issues of urgent concern. Each speaker is expected to limit themselves to 3 minutes. Since they usually dont, the Rajya Sabha yesterday used technology to switch off microphones as soon as three minutes were clocked.         
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee would have wished he had access to the technology today. His repeated pleas to Tripathi to wrap up had no impact, and soon the Congress and the BJD MPs were trying to shout down each other. Rahul sat with a deadpan expression.        
	Rahul told reporters outside the House: I dont need the permission of SPG or SP to meet people.

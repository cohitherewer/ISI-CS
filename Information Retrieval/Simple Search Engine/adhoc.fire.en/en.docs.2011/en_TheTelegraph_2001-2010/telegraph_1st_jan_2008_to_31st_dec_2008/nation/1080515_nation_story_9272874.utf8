	Patna, May 14: Six Maoists were killed and four policemen injured in an encounter in Nawada on the Bihar-Jharkhand border today.        
	Nawada superintendent of police Vinod Kumar rushed to the spot, 200km from here, where the encounter was on till last reports came in.         
	Officials in the SPs office said hundreds of armed rebels in olive green outfits had gathered at Mahari village to plan an operation in the area.        
	The police received a tip-off about the meeting and rushed to the village.        
	Seeing the force, the rebels opened fire, triggering a gun battle.        
	The police have seized three assault rifles, one carbine, hundreds of live cartridges and eight can bombs from the spot so far.        
	Four jawans were injured and six rebels were killed, said a senior police officer at police headquarters here.        
	We are not in a position to furnish further details as yet for Kumar and all other senior officers are in the thick of things there still, the officer added.        
	Sources at the headquarters also said the Bihar-Jharkhand border near Nawada had been sealed.

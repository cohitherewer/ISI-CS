The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RS poll race gains speed
                                                                                                               RS poll race gains speed
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 9: He has been at war with the BJP for over one-and-a-half decades over the Babri mosque incident, however, prominent Muslim leader Syeed Shahabuddin has joined the race for a Rajya Sabha seat, seeking his entry into the upper House as a JD(U)-backed nominee  a party that constitutes the NDA with the BJP.        
	The battle for sabha seats has gathered momentum in Bihar, with the Election Commission notifying the polls yesterday. The biennial polls are slated for March 26.        
	The mainline parties are yet to officially announce candidates. The last date for filing nomination papers is March 15. Aspirants now seem busy with lobbying.        
	There are five regular vacancies in the Rajya Sabha from Bihar. Besides, one more seat stands vacant after the demise of RJD MP Motiur Rahman.         
	This sixth seat is valid only for two years, as Rahman died two years prior to his term completion.         
	The NDA with 143 members  88 JD(U) and 55 BJP  is in a position to send three of its candidates, while keeping some votes to spare.         
	It takes only 40 MLAs to elect a Rajya Sabha member  thus, if the NDA works out with smaller parties and Independents, it can snatch the sixth seat from the RJD, which is not in a position to send more than one member.         
	Sources in the ruling establishment revealed that chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had a long meeting with JD(U) president Sharad Yadav yesterday, has made up his mind to send a Muslim candidate to the Rajya Sabha.        
	But there are two claimants to the single seat before Nitish  Shahabuddin and Ejaj Ali, a prominent leader in the state.        
	In fact, Ali has been one of the brains behind Nitishs success in swaying Muslims votes to his partys favour. His (Ejaj Alis) input played a pivotal role in getting votes, revealed a source in the party.        
	Ali also campaigned for the JD(U) nominee in Bikramganj seat and is thus, most likely to be the favoured one.        
	However, Syed Shahabuddin, who met the Bihar chief minister personally a few months ago is learnt to have been repeating his request to Nitish to send him to the Rajya Sabha.         
	Nitish Kumar is in the quandary, for he can ill-afford to antagonise a leader of Shahabuddins stature in his efforts to woo in the Muslims.        
	However, Nitish is likely to face opposition from a section of the BJP that would not like to see Shahabuddin, known for his strong views on the Muslim personnel law, in the NDA ranks.        
	At the same time, Kumar may find it politically incorrect to sideline Ejaj Ali  a strong protagonist.

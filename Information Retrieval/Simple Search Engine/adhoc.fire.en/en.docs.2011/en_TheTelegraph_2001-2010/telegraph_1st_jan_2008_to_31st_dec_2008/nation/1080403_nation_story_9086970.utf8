	Bhubaneswar April 2: Fresh agitation by the women leaders of the Opposition parties outside the Assembly today reflected their firm stand on the alleged sleaze slur on the former Speaker.         
	Members of Opposition parties today staged a dharna outside the Assembly pressing for the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik and a public apology from him. The protesters included members of Congress, CPM, NCP and Lok Janshakti Party.         
	The activists of the parties alleged that the BJD had disrespected all women in the state when its members took out a rally carrying placards that contained defamatory and vulgar remarks about Gayatri Panda, the lady assistant marshal who has levelled harassment charges on former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty.         
	How can a party stoop so much and tarnish the image of a single, defenceless woman just to prove their tainted member right? asked Asima Mahanand, the president of the state unit of the Mahila Congress. She went on to say that the chief minister should tender his resignation as he had failed to protect his people.        
	The demonstrators carrying placards and shouting slogans also criticised the chief ministers decision for referring the case to the State Human Rights Commission. The probe should be conducted by the CBI and we will continue our stir till the government does that, said Pushpa Dash, the state secretary of All India Democratic Womens Association.         
	CBI probe demand        
	The Opposition today reiterated its demand for a CBI probe into the sexual harassment slur on former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty saying that there was no scope for investigation by the State Human Rights Commission into the case.        
	Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik said the chief minister and the ruling BJD-BJP seemed afraid of the CBI.         
	Addressing a news conference this afternoon, Patnaik said the government might have requested the rights panel to probe into the charges, but it was doubtful if the panel would agree to conduct the probe.         
	Quoting relevant legal provisions, Patnaik said the panel could take up investigation only if an affected individual or a group files complaint of human rights violation. But in the present case the victim has not lodged any complaint before the panel, he pointed out. Besides, its not clear whose human rights was violated in this case  the victims, or the Speakers or the dismissed ministers, added the leader.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 21: Peoples Democratic Party leader Mufti Muhammad Sayeed today called for scrapping a cabinet order that diverted forest land to build shelters for Amarnath pilgrims, setting the stage for a showdown with coalition ally Congress.        
	Sources said the U-turn on the order, which had the backing of party leader and forest minister Qazi Afzal, followed fears of a public backlash during the coming state polls and opposition from separatists.        
	Mufti said the controversy over the transfer of 40 hectares of forest land in Baltal had led to a dangerous polarisation over a matter of faith and pilgrimage.        
	The state government should cancel the order diverting land for use by the Amarnath shrine board, the former Kashmir chief minister said, barely two days after deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Beig said the decision had been taken in public interest.        
	The PDP patrons call could trigger hostilities between his party and the Congress as chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has publicly backed the land allotment.        
	Shrine board officials couldnt be reached for comment.        
	The PDP has been under pressure from the separatist Hurriyat Conference, as both hardline and moderate factions of the outfit have joined hands in opposing the transfer. The situation became all the more difficult after the opposition National Conference (NC), too, demanded revocation of the order.        
	Mufti even questioned the need for a separate shrine board for Amarnath pilgrims. The legislature should re-look into the legislation that led to the creation of the board in 2000. From the beginning, I have advised the board not to make this holy pilgrimage look like part of any agenda.        
	The idea of having an isolated exclusive institution for the conduct of the yatra was, from the beginning, fraught with exploitable components, he said, in an apparent dig at the NC, which had created the body.

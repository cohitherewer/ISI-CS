	New Delhi, Jan 24 (PTI): Former President K.R. Narayanans widow Usha, who carved a niche for herself as a champion of social and womens issues, died today in a city hospital. She had been ailing for some time.

	She was rushed to the hospital on December 31 for blood transfusion following a severe drop in haemoglobin level.
    
	K.R. Narayananan served as President from July 25, 1997, to July 25, 2002. He died on November 9, 2005.

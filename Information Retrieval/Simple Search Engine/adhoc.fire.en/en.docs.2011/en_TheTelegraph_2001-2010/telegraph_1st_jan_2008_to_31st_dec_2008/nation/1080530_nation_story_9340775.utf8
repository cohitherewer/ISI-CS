                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani goes youth hunting
          SANJAY K. JHA                                  Rahul, Advani: Present versus past                                
	New Delhi, May 29: The BJP is drawing up a policy to court Young India to counter the Congresss propaganda that the next political battle will be between the youth and the old.        
	The partys pitch, being firmed up ahead of the general elections due next year, will be that an effective youth policy means much more than a young leadership.         
	Congress leaders have long harped on the theme of present versus past, suggesting the choice was between the 38-year-old Rahul Gandhi and 80-year-old L.K. Advani.        
	The BJPs strategists know politics is not a game of body and brawn. But they feel that the party must adequately respond to the young-versus-old propaganda since the generation-change theory could sway impressionable minds.        
	We are working on a youth policy. Inputs have been sought from leaders and experts. The stress will be on tackling the problems of Young India, issues like employment, vocational training, cultural grooming and nationalism, a member of Advanis core group said.        
	The core group is handling the youth drive, which has taken on a sense of urgency because around 10 crore young voters will join the electoral rolls next year.        
	The party apparatus is not involved with the policy.        
	BJP sources said the party realises it must counter the Congresss impressive array of young leaders, though it believes most of them are not the product of political movements but have come into prominence because of their family backgrounds.        
	Still, the Congress has succeeded in creating a hype around them and projecting them as its future leadership.        
	Led by Rahul Gandhi, the line-up includes Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Jitin Prasada, Priya Dutt, Sandeep Dikshit, D. Purandeswari, Milind Deora and others.        
	The BJP, in contrast, has kept Varun Gandhi on the sidelines.        
	The sons of Jaswant Singh and Vasundhara Raje Scindia, both MPs, havent caught peoples attention.         
	To overcome this disadvantage, the party has decided to field popular young faces.        
	Apart from Varun, it has Navjot Singh Sidhu, Smriti Irani, Poonam Mahajan and Shaina NC. But moves are on to woo other celebrities as well from the sports and glamour worlds.        
	Flamboyant batsman Virender Sehwag and pacer Irfan Pathan are on the partys radar. But no senior leader is willing to say anything definite at this juncture.

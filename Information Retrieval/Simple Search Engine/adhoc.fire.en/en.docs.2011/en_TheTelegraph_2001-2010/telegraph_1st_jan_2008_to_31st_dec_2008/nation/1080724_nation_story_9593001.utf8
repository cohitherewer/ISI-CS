          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Advani with Manmohan Singh in Parliament on Bal Gangadhar Tilaks birth anniversary. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 23: The BJP leadership thinks it has found another Bofors to beat the government with.        
	L.K. Advani, the partys candidate for Prime Minister, today compared with the Bofors case the allegations of BJP MPs in Parliament yesterday that they had been offered crores to abstain from voting.        
	Rajiv Gandhi had lost despite having a historic majority because of Bofors. Now again this corruption issue, which involves purchase of MPs, will become a big election issue, he told a news conference.        
	Inflation was already a big issue... but now this will become a decisive issue.        
	Advani described the development as an even more shocking scandal than the payoffs case that rocked the country in the eighties.         
	But turning this issue into a Bofors will not be easy for the party, which could be asked why it chose not to act on the corruption case in the six years it was in power.        
	Today, Advani was defensive when asked why BJP members invariably dominated the list of culprits, whether it was the cash-for-questions scandal or human trafficking. It is cause for concern. It saddens me, he said.        
	The leader looked uncomfortable when asked if his was the most corrupt party, as 10 per cent of its MPs have been caught in scandals. Yesterday, the most defections  eight  were from the BJP. They were expelled from the party today.

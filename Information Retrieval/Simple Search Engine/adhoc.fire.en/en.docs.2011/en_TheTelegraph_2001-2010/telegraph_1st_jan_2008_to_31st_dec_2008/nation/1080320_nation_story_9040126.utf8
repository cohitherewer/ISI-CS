	McLeodganj, March 19: The Dalai Lama today appealed to Tibetan independence protesters to stop their march back to their homeland, a day after China claimed his clique was behind the turbulence sweeping Lhasa.        
	Sources said the leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile urged representatives of the five protesting organisations to call off the march but made it clear force would not be used as they lived in a democratic society.        
	In a 20-minute meeting at his residence, he asked the protesters to concentrate on happenings in Tibet and try to uncover the truth behind Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaos claim that the Dalai clique had incited violence in Lhasa last week.        
	He is being given a bad name, so we were also requested to investigate Chinese accusations against him and bring out the truth, a representative who attended the meeting said.        
	Tibet-watchers said the Dalai Lama could be trying to divert the protesters energies under pressure from Beijing that is trickling down to New Delhi.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha India would not allow any political activity on its soil that would affect friendly ties with another country.        
	He said the Dalai Lama and his followers were advised not to indulge in political activities that can jeopardise our relationship with any friendly country.        
	This morning, the representatives of the five organisations  the Tibetan Youth Congress, Tibetan Womens Association, National Democratic Party of Tibet (NDPT), Guchusum Movement of Tibet and Students for Free Tibet  appeared overwhelmed after meeting the Dalai Lama.        
	What could we speak in front of His Holiness? I am confused and tired. I cannot comment until tomorrow, NDPT president Chime Youngdung said.        
	Colleagues Tsewang Rigzin of the youth congress and B. Tsering of the womens association said they had nothing to say.        
	Later, the marchers representatives held a marathon round of talks but were unable to thrash out a consensus on stopping the march.        
	Tsering said the organisations would meet the central committee of the Tibetan government-in-exile tomorrow before meeting again on Thursday afternoon.        
	The Dalai Lamas stop-march appeal comes days after Beijing patted its friend India for its mature handling of the Tibet issue. Delhi has been giving measured responses that are in line with its one-China policy.        
	Asked if there had been any pressure on the Dalai Lama to stop the marchers, an official of the government-in-exile said: India would obviously act in its best interests.        
	The Tibet protests could acquire a global dimension with Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, landing in Delhi today on a five-day visit. She will visit Dharamsala on Friday and hold talks with the Dalai Lama, his secretary Tenzin Takhla said.        
	Tibetan officials, however, played down the visit that has been frowned on by China.         
	It was in October when His Holiness received the Congressional gold medal that he invited Nancy Pelosi to Dharamsala. It is only a coincidence that she is arriving now, a senior official of the government-in-exile said.        
	Brown-Wen talks        
	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said today Chinese Premier Wen had confirmed in a telephone conversation that he was prepared to resume discussions on Tibet with the Dalai Lama.        
	Brown said he spoke with Wen to call for restraint following violent protests in Tibet  the biggest challenge to Chinese rule there in almost two decades.        
	Earlier, Chinese officials blasted the Dalai Lama as a wolf in monks robes and said the Tibetan protest had sparked a life-and-death struggle between China and followers of the Dalai Lama.

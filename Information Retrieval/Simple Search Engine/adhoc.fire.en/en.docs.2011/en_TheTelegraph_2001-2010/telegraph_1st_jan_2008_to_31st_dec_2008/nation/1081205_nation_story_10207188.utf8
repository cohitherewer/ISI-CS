          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Patna, Dec. 4: Security has been beefed up along the 714km open India-Nepal border, suspected to be used as a conduit by terrorists trying to escape from India after carrying out operations.         
	A reinforcement of the Seema Suraksha Bal has been sent after the Mumbai terror attacks. The regions superintendents of police and deputy inspector-generals have been directed to monitor the movement of the people round-the-clock, said additional director-general (headquarters) of police Anil Sinha.         
	Sinha also said that the forces have been asked to step up the patrolling along the border area.        
	Earlier this year, the anti-terror squad of the Mumbai police had arrested two persons suspected to having terrorist links who belonged to north Bihars Madhubani district.        
	The Seema Suraksha Bal is already in the process to deploy a battalion comprising women personnel on the borders, as the forces feel that the outlawed invariably use the women as carriers of illegal goods, arms and ammunition.         
	S. K. Sarangi, the staff officer of the Suraksha Bals Patna office, said the training of women sepoys at Sami in Himanchal Pradesh was nearly complete.         
	They are on their way to Bihar and we will deploy them as soon as they reach the state from Sami, he said.         
	According to sources, nine SSB battalions are at present deployed to guard the 700km open border that the nation shares with its neighbour  Nepal.

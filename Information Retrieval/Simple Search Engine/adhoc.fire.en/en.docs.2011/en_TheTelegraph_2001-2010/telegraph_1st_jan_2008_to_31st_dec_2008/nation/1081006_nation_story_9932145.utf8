          UTTAM DUTTA                                          Sushama Panja      
	Singur, Oct. 5: When Manab Panja came seeking chanda yesterday, Krishna Kolay did something she had never done before. She slammed the door in his face.        
	Why should I have given him the money? He is a Trinamul Congress supporter and because of them the Tatas have left, Krishna, 37, whose family gave up one-and-a-half bighas voluntarily, was still fuming today.        
	Since the Tata pullout, the residents of Sahanapara at Singurs Gopalnagar have been eyeing one another with suspicion. The willing-unwilling divide was evident at the Yuva Sangha pandal, where the villagers had gathered for Sashthi like any other year for the past five decades.        
	Amitabha Das, 28, Pappu Bangal, 18, and Bikash Patia, 28  all former casual workers at the Nano plant  sat at a tea stall opposite the pandal, seething in anger.        
	Its villagers like (Save Farmland Committee convener) Becharam Manna and Manab Panja who are to blame for the pullout. If we see them at the pandal we might not be able to hold ourselves back, Amitabha said.        
	Manabs wife Sushama, a Trinamul member of Singur panchayat samity, has decided to stay away from the pandal.        
	Till last year, we all celebrated Puja together. But this year, a feeling of bitterness has crept between the willing and the unwilling, particularly after Ratan Tata announced his pullout. So our family will not go to the pandal though my husband is one of the participants, she said.        
	Manabs sister Manju said they feared being jeered at by members of syndicates that supplied construction material to the Tata project. Whenever we have passed by the mandap in the past 24 hours, they have shouted abuses at us, she said.        
	Few among the unwilling landlosers or their family members were seen at the pandal today. Some of the elders among the willing landlosers, however, felt some concession should be made during the pujas.        
	After all, it is Durga Puja and everyone should come. Well tell the young people not to lose their head even if some villager from the opposite camp comes to the pandal to pray to Ma Durga, said Shaila Sahana, 45, a syndi- cate member and a Puja organiser.        
	The Puja itself has suffered because of the rift. The organisers had fixed a budget of Rs 40,000 like last year but have been able to collect only about Rs 12,000.        
	The Tata announcement changed everything. We had hoped to collect chanda door-to-door yesterday and today but many are refusing to donate a single paisa, said Debaprasad Das, 45, a syndicate member who gave up seven bighas voluntarily.        
	Like Krishna, 50-year-old Radhakanta Panja, who had given up two bighas, turned the collectors away. My only son Tarun had got a job as a casual worker at an ancillary unit. I wont give any money for the Puja, he said.        
	Krishna, who has received training in sewing, said she had hoped to get a job stitching aprons and gloves for the Nano workers.        
	I am very depressed this Puja. I have decided not to wear a new sari or go pandal-hopping, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ally rift in UPAs clean-sweep state
                                                                                                               Ally rift in UPAs clean-sweep state
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Karunanidhi, Ramadoss				                                 
	Chennai, March 6: Domestic trouble has broken out between two UPA allies in Tamil Nadu, where the alliance had bagged all seats last time, just when elections are back in the air.         
	The DMK and the PMK could be slugging it out at the coming Rajya Sabha polls if a truce is not worked out within the next nine days.        
	The S. Ramadoss-led PMK today demanded a share of the six seats at stake in Tamil Nadu after chief minister M. Karunanidhi last night announced that his DMK, the Congress and the CPM would divide the seats among them.        
	The DMK chief said the three allies could comfortably win five of the six seats with their combined strength of 165 MLAs in the 234-member House. Rejecting the PMKs claims for a seat as unreasonable, Karunanidhi allotted two each to his party and the Congress while the CPM was given one.        
	The main Opposition, Jayalalithaas ADMK, is sure to win the remaining seat.        
	A seething PMK  which has six Lok Sabha MPs and two ministers in the Union council  met for an emergency session where Ramadoss was authorised to take any action he deemed fit to uphold the partys self-respect and reaffirm its political rights.        
	Ramadoss served an ultimatum to Karunanidhi, saying the DMK should redress the injustice done to his party by March 15, when filing of nominations begins for the March 26 polls.        
	He said he had no objections to the Congress and the CPM being accommodated, but the raw deal for the PMK was unacceptable.        
	If the PMK, part of the DMK-led alliance in the state, did not get its share by March 15, Ramadoss said his party could put up its own candidate or boycott the elections.        
	Sources said a contest between the allies could see the PMK hobnobbing with the ADMK  a trigger for a possible realignment of political forces in Tamil Nadu in the run-up to the 2009 general elections.        
	The DMK alliances sweep in 2004  it won all 39 seats in the state  was one of the main factors that helped the UPA assume power at the Centre. Such a feat is next to impossible to accomplish a second time, more so because the alliance will also be fighting the ant-incumbency factor.        
	Alliances hold considerable sway in Tamil Nadu politics and even seemingly small parties sometimes help turn the tide against the ruling party and give a decisive push to the challenger.

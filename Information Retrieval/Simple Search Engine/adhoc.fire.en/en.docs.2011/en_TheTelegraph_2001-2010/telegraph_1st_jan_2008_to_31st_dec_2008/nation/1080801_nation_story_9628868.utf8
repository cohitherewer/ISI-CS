	Bhubaneswar, July 31: Ahead of the forthcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today shuffled the top echelon of state administration by transferring seven senior IAS officers in the rank of principal secretaries.         
	Principal secretary Madhur Sarangi was shifted to fisheries and animal resources department and was appointed as the head of the department in place of H.K. Panda.         
	Panda was posted as the full-time chairman-cum-managing director of Orissa Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (Omfed). Principal secretary of science and technology department N.C. Vasudevan was appointed as the head of textile and handloom department, while principal secretary of agriculture department was given the additional charge of co-operation department.         
	Information technology secretary P.K. Mohapatra was entrusted with the additional responsibility of science and technology. Revenue divisional commissioner (RDC) (northern division) M.S. Padhi was appointed as the principal secretary of higher education department, the post that was lying vacant since the retirement of R.B. Nayak.        
	Former Dhenkanal collector Jalil Ahmed Khan was promoted to super-time scale and posted as the RDC, northern division in Padhis place.         
	Political circles believe that chief minister Naveen Patnaik effected the bureaucratic reshuffle to streamline the administration in the Secretariat ahead of polls.         
	Earlier, on July 19, there was a reshuffle among six district collectors.         
	On June 7, as many as 19 senior IPS officers including seven superintendents were transferred.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nargis spares TN food
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nargis spares TN food

	Chennai, May 23: Had Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar a couple of days earlier, Tamil Nadus poor may have been hit in the stomach.        
	The cyclone that ravaged Myanmar on May 2-3 killed and maimed thousands and left many more homeless and hungry. But just days before, Myanmarese farmers had completed harvesting their lentil crop.        
	A part of that crop will be crucial in the coming months to keep Tamil Nadus public distribution system as well as its school midday-meal scheme going. It will also help keep lentil prices down in the states markets at a time of spiralling inflation.        
	The state will for the first time be directly importing lentils from Myanmar, the worlds second-largest exporter of pulses after Canada, said K. Phanindra Reddy, managing director of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation.        
	The state government had taken the decision to keep the PDS running at current prices, thus pressuring private traders to slash their prices, too. For instance, the PDS shops sell tur dal at Rs 32 a kg while the open-market price is around Rs 44 a kg.        
	But Nargis could have put paid to the plans by destroying Myanmars lentil crop.        
	Reddy, who was part of an official team that visited Myanmar on May 1 to scout for pulses, said: It was raining heavily there a day before Nargis struck. But fortunately, the harvest (of lentils) was over and the crop had been moved to warehouses just in time.        
	Tamil Nadu will now go ahead and float global tenders for lentil imports in the next few days. The first shipments  mainly of tur and urad  are expected to reach Chennai and Tuticorin in the next two months.        
	The Myanmarese pulses are the best suited to our state, both in quantity and quality, Reddy said.        
	Tamil Nadu needs about 6,000 tonnes of tur a month to supply to its ration shops and another 2,500 tonnes for the midday-meal programme that feeds about 86 lakh schoolchildren daily. In addition, it needs about 2,000 tonnes of urad a month.        
	Private traders and central undertakings  such as the trading company MMTC, State Trading Corporation and Nafed  already import pulses from Myanmar, Reddy said. But Tamil Nadu decided on direct import to cut costs.        
	The state is comfortably placed on the rice front this year with the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation having procured a record 11.14 lakh tonnes.

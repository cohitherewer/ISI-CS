	Gilani, who lists Aishwarya and Shah Rukh Khan as his favourite film stars, said he got a pleasant surprise when he unwrapped the box and found it full of DVDs of films starring the actress.        
	Gilani said the foreign ministers aides might have found out about his favourite heroine from his book Chah-e-Yousuf Say Sada, in which he wrote about watching her movies on his laptop during his imprisonment from 2001 to 2006 by the Musharraf regime.        
	Mukherjee was in Islamabad during May 20-21 to resume the composite dialogue process with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi.        
	He also met Gilani and President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Appearing on a morning show on AryOneWorld news channel, Gilani also said he was not opposed to the screening of Indian films in cinemas in Pakistan.         
	Good music always helped lift his mood, Gilani said. He liked to listen to Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar and Nayyara Noor, a Pakistani ghazal singer born in Assam.        
	On Pervez Musharrafs comment that governing Pakistan was one of the most difficult jobs in the world, Gilani said: Yes, I agree with it.        
	He also said Musharrafs straightforwardness was one of the things he liked best about the President.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 29: A retired army major and his associate arrested last night in connection with the Malegaon blasts will be put through brain-mapping, polygraph and narco tests.        
	A Nashik court, where former major Ramesh Upadhyay, 57, and Sameer Kulkarni, 34, were produced today, accepted the anti-terror squads plea to conduct the tests before remanding them in police custody till November 10.        
	The court had earlier allowed such tests on Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, the most high-profile suspect arrested in the case that has highlighted the alleged participation of Hindu hawks in terror attacks. Upadhyay is the working president of pro-Hindu organisation Abhinav Bharat. Kulkarni is also involved with it.        
	Public prosecutor Ajay Misar argued that the police required their custody to find out how the RDX had been acquired, transported and used in the September 29 Malegaon explosion that killed five persons and injured 132.        
	Misar claimed the duo had been in touch with the sadhvi Pragya on a few occasions. Sources said the two had met her on September 16 at Nashiks Bhonsala Military School, where the blast conspiracy was allegedly hatched.         
	The military school was formed to inculcate military culture in the Bharatiya youth, according to Abhinav Bharats website, and the Bajrang Dal had organised a training camp at the school earlier this year.        
	Upadhyay denied he was involved in the strike but admitted to having met the sadhvi once. I shared the dais with the sadhvi only once and havent communicated with her for a long time, he said in court. The ex-major, who took voluntary retirement, said he would never be involved in anti-national activities.        
	ATS additional commissioner Sukhwinder Singh, however, said Upadhyay and Kulkarni had played a major role in the Malegaon blast.

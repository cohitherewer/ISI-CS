	Mumbai, July 10 (Agencies): Police have arrested a BPO employee and two associates who apparently walked into an apartment, trussed up the owner and helped themselves to over Rs 1 crore in cash but left a large amount behind because they could not find enough carry bags.        
	The three youths and a woman who allegedly thought up the heist have been charged with robbing a foreign car importers residence last year.        
	The robbery was committed to rustle up Rs 50,000 to start a garment business but the three youths splurged a large part of the loot on wine and women in Goa, the police said.        
	The four have been identified as Allan Merchant (21), Valentine Jessinto (20), Suraj Hadavale (20) and Varsha Kodekar (28) from a northwest suburb. The police are on the lookout for two sisters who were also involved, joint commissioner Rakesh Maria said.        
	Car importer Ajay Bajaj had registered a case of robbery, saying R 5 lakh in cash was stolen by three unidentified men who forcibly entered his fifth-floor apartment in Khar in October last year.        
	Varsha had worked as a domestic help in the house and was on the lookout for a gang to carry out the heist, the police said. Suraj, a barman in a suburban pub, and his girlfriend Sabina wanted Rs 50,000 to start the business and approached Varshas husband for help.        
	The husband used to work for Air-India and used to give personal loans. However, he could help the couple as they could not furnish any surety. Varsha then approached Suraj and told him about the Bajaj residence, Maria said.        
	Suraj sought the help of his colleague Allan who brought along his friend Valentine, a BPO employ. Varsha had told the trio that Bajaj owes her husband Rs 20 lakh but is not paying. She told them where the cash would be kept in the house, Maria said.        
	The trio rang the house bell, tied up a help and Bajaj. When they opened the cupboard, they were stunned to see that it was packed with cash. They had not carried any bag and managed to find seven plastic bags in the house which could fit only Rs 1.10 crore in cash. They had to leave behind a large amount, Maria said.        
	After committing the robbery, the gang went to Sabinas house in Bandra where the cash was split. Varsha was given Rs 40 lakh, Suraj took Rs 14 lakh, Valentine and Allan Rs 18 lakh each and the rest went to Sabina and her sister.        
	All the boys went to Goa by telling their parents that they had secured a job there. They stayed in luxury hotels and spent money on prostitutes from Russia and the Philippines, Maria said. Sabina and her sister Delilie, who are yet to braced, have started a car rental agency.

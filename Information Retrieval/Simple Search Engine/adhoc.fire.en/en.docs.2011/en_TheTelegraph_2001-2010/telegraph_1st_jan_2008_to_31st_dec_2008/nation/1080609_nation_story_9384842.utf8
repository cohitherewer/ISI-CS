	London, June 8 (PTI): British authorities have barred an Indian doctor from practising for a year and threatened to cancel his licence after a woman patient accused him of behaving indecently during a breast examination.        
	Subhas Pattar worked as a consultant physician and gastro-enterologist in the state-run National Health Service (NHS). He had migrated to Britain in 1980.        
	At the general medical council hearing in Manchester, it was ruled that Pattars fitness to practise had been impaired. A 12-month suspension was imposed on his registration with the medical council.        
	Before the panel meeting, Pattar, who graduated from Karnataka University in Dharwad in 1974, claimed he had done no wrong and that the case was fabricated. The doctor, in his 60s, said he was considering returning to India.        
	The case against Pattar related to an allegation that at the Wythenshaw Hospital in Lancashire in September 2005, he had acted inappropriately during a breast examination on a female patient.        
	Pattar allegedly did not stop when the patient asked him to stop the examina- tion, which was carried out without any explanation of why it was necessary or what it involved.        
	This panel is of the view that you should not be permitted to return to unrestricted practice unless you are able to demonstrate that this panels deep concerns about your medical knowledge, clinical practice and relationships with patients and staff have been successfully addressed, the medical council said.        
	It is alleged that Dr Pattars actions and omissions in respect of the breast examination were unprofessional and inappropriate. It is also alleged that the trust employing Dr Pattar through a locum agency terminated its contract for his services amid concerns regarding his treatment of patients, the council said.        
	It ruled that Pattars suspension adequately, appropriately and proportionately addresses its duty to protect public interest.

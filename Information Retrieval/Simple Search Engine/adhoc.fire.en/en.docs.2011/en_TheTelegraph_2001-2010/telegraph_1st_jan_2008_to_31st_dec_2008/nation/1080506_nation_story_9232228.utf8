                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aamir hurts himself again
                          Aamir Khan                    
	Mumbai, May 5 (PTI): Actor Aamir Khan injured his hamstring muscle again while shooting for Ghajini in Hyderabad yesterday afternoon.        
	About a fortnight ago, the actor had injured his hamstring during an action sequence following which he rested for a couple of days before getting back to work.        
	According to sources close to the actor, Aamir did not want the shooting of Ghajini to suffer because of his injury.        
	Everyone on the sets was against the actor pushing himself, but Aamir was insistent that we should shoot close-ups. He spoke to the director, A.R. Murgadoss, and decided to shoot the close-up sequences which wouldnt aggravate his injury, a source said.         
	However, it was a bad idea as his muscle got further strained.        
	It was a chase sequence and Aamirs leg was in an awkward position and now his hamstring muscle is torn. After the shot was okayed, for almost 40 minutes he could not get up. Initially, everyone on the sets thought Aamir was joking, but then he started screaming in pain, the source said.        
	The physiotherapist was on the sets and he requested for a specialist to be called in. Aamir had to be carried to a local hospital.        
	He has been advised complete rest for three weeks. The shooting has been cancelled. The source said: He will be coming to Mumbai in a day or two once the doctors allow him to travel after which he will rest at his Bandra residence.         
	On his blog, Aamir said: Just when I thought I had recovered, I have injured myself again. And this time its worse than the last.

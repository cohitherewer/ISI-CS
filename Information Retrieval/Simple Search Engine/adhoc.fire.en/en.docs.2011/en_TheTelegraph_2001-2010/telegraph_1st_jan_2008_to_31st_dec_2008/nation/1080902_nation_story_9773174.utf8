          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ravenshaw University: Peace in pieces                                  
	Cuttack, Sept. 1: The decision to do away with the students union elections at Ravenshaw University is all set to snowball into a controversy with its alumni favouring the polls.        
	While students union elections at colleges and universities across Orissa are due this month, the university has decided to put an end to the polls as the selection process for the formation of the union and adopt the nomination system from this year.        
	But distinguished Ravenshawvians, including former Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray, former member of Parliament Trilochan Kanungo, Utkal Sahitya Samaj president Annada Prasad Ray, former state health minister Mustafiz Ahmed and others, have strongly pitched for students union elections.        
	Participating at a mass convention here yesterday, they unanimously dubbed the unprecedented decision as undemocratic. There is no rationale behind the decision to replace election with nomination to create a better environment on the campus, said one of the former students opposing the decision taken by the university.         
	AIDSO organised the mass convention as part of an ongoing agitation against the move. AIDSOs Ravenshaw committee has been spearheading an agitation for over a week now demanding a rollback in the decision. Students on Saturday boycotted classes demanding the union elections. They also locked up the main gate of the university.         
	But the university officials have refused to budge so far.         
	The syndicate had passed a resolution recommending formation of students council on the basis of nomination of meritorious students by putting an end to the practice of students union elections for creation of better environment on the campus. We are only implementing it, said Satyakam Mishra, the registrar of the university.

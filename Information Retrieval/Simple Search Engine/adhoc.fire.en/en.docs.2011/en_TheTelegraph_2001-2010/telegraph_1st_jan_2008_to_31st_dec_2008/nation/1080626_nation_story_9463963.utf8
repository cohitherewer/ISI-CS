	New Delhi, June 25: The Samajwadi Party, whose 39 MPs could prop up the Centre if the Left withdraws support, is waiting for the Congress to make the first move.        
	So far, little other than informal meetings has taken place between the Samajwadi leaders and the Congress, leaving Mulayam Singh Yadav wondering whether Sonia Gandhis party will do more to forge a friendship.        
	Beyond Delhi, both parties need each other in Uttar Pradesh  where the Congress has only nine MPs  to take on Mayavati in the general elections due next year. It is entirely up to the Congress to warm up to us, said a Samajwadi leader, betraying the wait-and-watch attitude.        
	Ram Gopal Yadav, who leads the Samajwadis in the Lok Sabha, said the partys position on the nuclear deal would be finalised at the July 3 meeting of the United National Progressive Alliance, of which it is a part. Days back, Amar Singh had also spoken of a joint UNPA stance.        
	But according to sources, the party wouldnt mind if the Congress discussed the India-specific safeguards with the IAEA. The Left is trying to show it is the only party that is nationalistic while others are anti-India, said a party MP.         
	Karat called on Mulayam before todays UPA session to soothe feathers ruffled by the Lefts remarks that the Samajwadi Party would lose Muslim votes if it backed the nuclear deal.        
	For now, the Samajwadis official position is that the Congress needs to take them into confidence if it wants to go ahead with the agreement.        
	There are people in the US who were not in favour of the nuke deal initially but changed their minds after in-camera meetings. We would like to know what they were told, the leader said.         
	The Samajwadis realise the nuclear deal cannot be sold as an achievement to voters but point out that support to the Congress will be on the basis of national interest.         
	For the Congress, which lost the support of Mayavatis 17 MPs last week, an alliance with Mulayam could help it raise its tally of Lok Sabha members from Uttar Pradesh to at least double digits in the general elections.

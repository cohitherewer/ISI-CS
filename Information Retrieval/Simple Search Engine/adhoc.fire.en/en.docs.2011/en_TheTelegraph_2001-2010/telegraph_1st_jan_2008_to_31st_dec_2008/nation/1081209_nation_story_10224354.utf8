                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Attack on MLA stalls Assembly
  - Revenge slur on aides   of minister in sex row        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 8: Angry Opposition members today moved a privilege notice against chief minister Naveen Patnaik and revenue minister Manmohan Samal forcing adjournment of the Assembly over the alleged attack by Samals supporters on the residence of state Congress president Jaydev Jena.        
	Normalcy was restored in the House in the afternoon after Naveen condemned the alleged attack and assured full protection to the members.         
	I strongly disapprove of any attack on any member of the House and assure that full protection will be given to them for freedom of debate. Any act of intimidation against them will not be tolerated, Naveen said.        
	A case has been registered in Capital police station under Sections 147, 148, 294, 506, 336 and 149 of the IPC and investigation was on, Naveen told the House.        
	Earlier this morning, moving the privilege notice, deputy leader of Opposition, Narasingha Mishra said the Opposition had raised certain issues in the House last week involving the alleged sexual escapades of Samal and demanded his resignation. Yesterday, a group of Samals supporters ransacked the official residence of Jena, hurled abusive languages and threatened him with dire consequences. The attackers were raising slogans in favour of Samal and BJP, he alleged, stating that this act amounted to the breach of privilege of the Assembly and its members.        
	The group also attacked the residence of Congress MLA Padmalochan Panda nearby and pelted stones at it, added Mishra.        
	Alleging that the attack was made at the behest of Samal with tacit support of chief minister, Nishra said: It seems they dont like to spare the Opposition and give a message not to raise issues against the government at the Assembly.        
	Jena, also an MLA, alleged that he had been targeted by the ruling party because he had first raised the issue relating to Samals sexual escapade. Several senior Opposition members, including Opposition whip, Satya Bhusan Sahu, shared Jenas concern and urged the Speaker to adjourn the House and convene an all-party meeting to discuss the serious and sensitive matter involving privilege of members.

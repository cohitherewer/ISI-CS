     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 31: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today decried the Centres decision to stick to the 2002 BPL list, thereby depriving 10-lakh families in Orissa and announced a low-cost housing scheme to cover the deprived families.
    
	I am surprised that the Centre refused benefits to 10 lakh families by insisting on the 2002-BPL list, said Naveen, while talking to reporters today. We had approached the Centre time and again to accept the 1997-BPL list. But the Centre refused to accept it, thereby depriving 10-lakh families included in the 1997-BPL list, he said. This shows how insensitive they are to the poor people of this backward state, remarked the chief minister.
    
	There were 44.94-lakh BPL families according to the 1997-survey. However, the Planning Commission asked the state to revise the number of BPL families to 34.63 lakh according to the 2002 survey. Thus 10-lakh families would be dropped from the new list.

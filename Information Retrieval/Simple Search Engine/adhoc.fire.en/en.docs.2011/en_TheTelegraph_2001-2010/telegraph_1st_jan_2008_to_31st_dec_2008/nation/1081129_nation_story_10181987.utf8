	Burwan (Murshidabad), Nov. 28: He had left for Mumbai 22 days ago. Today, Asfar Ali was back home  in a coffin.        
	The 21-year-old employee of a parcel-handling firm was waiting to unload consignments at platform 14 of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, earlier called VT station, on Wednesday night when terrorists opened fire. He died, hit by bullets in his chest, stomach and right leg.        
	The son of a farm labourer from Murshidabads Bodua village might have survived if he had jumped on the tracks and ducked the hail of bullets, like colleague Amit.        
	Amit jumped on the tracks below. But Asfar looked bewildered and continued to stand on the platform and soon fell in a pool of blood after being hit by the bullets, said Jabbar, Asfars uncle who rushed to the station from Dadar after getting a call from Amit about the attack.        
	This evening, after Asfars body reached Bodua from Dum Dum airport, father Allarakha Sheikh was shattered. I was poor and could not provide for my sons education. Asfar managed a job at CST station. He was paid Rs4,800 a month and sent us Rs1,000 every month.        
	Asfars mother was inconsolable, fainting every now and then. Close to 1,000 villagers gathered in front of the family home when the truck carrying Asfars body reached Bodua, around 250km from Calcutta.        
	Uncle Jabbar said it took him an hour to reach CST from Dadar after Amits call. I rushed to the station and found my nephews body kept near a railway office along with that of others (victims of the terror strike). Asfar died in 15 minutes, before he could be moved to hospital.        
	For a while after he took the bullets, Asfar was conscious enough to pull out his mobile and ask Amit to call Jabbar.         
	Amit climbed on to the platform and saw Asfar writhing in pain. Asfar took out his mobile and asked him to call me, said Jabbar, who later informed Asmar, Asfars 19-year-old brother who is a tailor in Dadar. Asfars elder brother Asgar, 24, is a cook in a Saudi hotel. The youngest sibling, 13-year-old Azahar who cant see from one eye, is in Class VIII of the local Kuli High School. Like Asfar, Asmar and Asgar are dropouts.        
	Asfar wanted to stay on till Id-uz-Zoha on December 9 but was forced to return to Mumbai because of work, Azahar said. He loved me very much. But now I wont be able to see him anymore. Asfar was buried late this evening.        
	Taj waiter from Nadia        
	A waiter at the Taj who last called his home in Nadias Ranaghat when terrorists stormed the hotel on Wednesday night has not been able to get back to his parents, raising fears that he might have been taken hostage.        
	Moidul Sheikh, 25, had called at 10.30pm, saying there was gunfire all around him, his father Samar said today.        
	Moidul told me he was very scared. He also told us they were not being allowed to go out.         
	But it wasnt clear whether he was held hostage. He disconnected, telling me that he would call up later. Since then, the phone is switched off. We are very worried, said Samar.

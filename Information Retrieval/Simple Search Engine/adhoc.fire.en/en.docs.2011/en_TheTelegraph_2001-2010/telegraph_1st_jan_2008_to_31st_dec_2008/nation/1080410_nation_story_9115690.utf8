	Cuttack, April 9: Over 100 villagers gheraoed a primary school at Naraj near Cuttack for more than eight hours and held five officials of Tata Power hostage yesterday.         
	The latest incident is one among the several protests against the region over a proposed Tata Power plant in the area.         
	The Tata officials had gone to Siddheswar Nodal Upper Primary School to distribute schoolbags among children. Police arrived by mid-morning and had to wait till afternoon to release the hostages. All officials were finally released early in the evening.         
	In September 2006, the Tata Power had signed a MoU with the Orissa government to set up a 1000MW thermal power project at Naraj-Marthapur.         
	But a local committee, Siddheswar Anchalik Surakhsa Samiti, has been opposing the project along with Lok Shakti Abhiyan and have been trying to prepare people for a battle against it, which they feel would pose a threat to the environment. The Samiti has decided not to allow any development work in the area by Tata Power without prior discussions regarding the plant.

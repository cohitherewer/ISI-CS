          OUR BUREAU                          People react in terror after the serial blasts in Jaipur on Tuesday evening. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, May 13: The serial blasts in Jaipur have caught the Centre completely unawares.        
	Jaipur was not on the radar of the security and intelligence agencies that were focusing on the metros and prominent places of worship.        
	Following the first-ever terror attack in Jaipur, the Union home ministry issued an advisory to all states, asking them to step up vigil and strengthen security at historical monuments and crowded places.        
	The Centre also rushed a team of explosives experts from the National Security Guards (NSG) to Jaipur to help with the investigations.        
	President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and home Minister Shivraj Patil condemned the blasts.        
	The Prime Minister appealed for calm at this difficult moment, assuring support to the Rajasthan government and assistance to the affected families. Singh spoke to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Sonia called the attacks a crime against humanity.        
	Minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal said that according to reports coming from Jaipur, the extremists appeared to have used RDX.        
	Jaiswal said a foreign hand cannot be denied in the serial bomb blasts. I can say about a foreign hand, but cannot identify any country, he said.        
	In hindsight, officials said they should have seen it coming. Jaipur is a bustling tourist hub, especially popular with foreign tourists. What better way to spread terror and get international attention than by attacking Jaipur, an official said.        
	We had information that terrorists had made inroads into Rajasthan following the blast at the Ajmer dargah in October last. However, Jaipur was still considered safe. That is why perhaps the terrorists found it a soft target, said an intelligence official.        
	Sources said the blasts appeared to be the handiwork of a well-organised group since the attacks were meticulously planned and executed.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government had been asked to be on a high alert with Agra being another popular tourist destination. In Delhi, security had been tightened around the Jama Masjid, and the Akshardham and Iskcon temples.        
	Home minister Patil was on a visit to the Northeast during the blasts. A team is being rushed to Jaipur but we are still ascertaining the facts of the incidents, home secretary Madhukar Gupta told The Telegraph around 8pm.        
	The BJP tonight held the Congress-led governments soft approach towards terrorism responsible for the blasts.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh said the explosions were a dangerous indication of Pakistan-based terror groups spreading their activities into the Hindi heartland. Another BJP leader, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said such attacks were the result of the weak policies of a government headed by a weak Prime Minister and a coward home minister.        
	Pak condemns blasts        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has condemned the blasts. Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism and reaffirms its firm commitment to fight this scourge together with the international community, he said.        
	Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi expressed his condolences to the victims families. Muttahida Qaumi Movement chief Altaf Hussain said those involved in such attacks were not human.

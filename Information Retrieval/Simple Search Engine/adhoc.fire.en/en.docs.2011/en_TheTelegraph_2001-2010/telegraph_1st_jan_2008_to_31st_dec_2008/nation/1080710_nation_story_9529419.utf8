	New Delhi, July 9: The BJP-led NDA has declared it will meet the President tomorrow if the UPAs floor test date isnt set even as it fights shy of a no-confidence motion.        
	Beneath the date quibble  the Centre has said it would seek a House vote before going to the IAEA with the safeguards text of the nuke deal  lies the alliances apparent inability to extract a commitment from partners on voting against a trust motion.        
	The Akali Dal sought more time, with its leader, Sukhdeo Singh Dhindsa, telling NDA allies today his partys core committee would meet on July 15 to take a decision.         
	Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani told the meeting  also attended by Janata Dal-United, Biju Janata Dal and Shiv Sena representatives  the NDA must vote out a government that had lost its moral and numerical authority.         
	BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, confident the Akalis would vote against a trust motion, suggested the NDA could consider floor coordination if the Left approached it. But her remarks appeared little more than political posturing given the BJPs earlier position that it wasnt interested in floor coordination with the communists.         
	Shortly after Sushma spoke, her party colleague and the BJP spokesperson, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, blamed the Left for facilitating the Samajwadi Partys support to the Congress.         
	 The Left has been the informal patron of Samajwadi Party. The present rearrangement (the Samajwadi-Congress tie-up) is the outcome of the situation created by the Left. By delaying the withdrawal of support, the Left allowed the Congress to work on Mulayam Singh (Yadav) and Amar Singh, Rudy said.        
	Terming the pullout timing very suspicious, he said: Were they (the Left) waiting for the SP to cosy up with the Congress? One thing is sure. The Left was waiting for an opportune time so that the government did not fall.         
	The BJPs offensive against the Left seemed to ensure that the opponents of the nuclear deal remained divided  to the governments advantage. Rudy, like others in his party, skirted questions on moving a no-confidence motion, saying it wasnt the BJPs responsibility as the crisis was not of its doing. He said the strategy would depend on who bells the cat, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach.         
	Rudy steered clear of speaking about the trial of strength, saying the real issues were the increase in prices and the Samajwadis shady deal with the Congress.

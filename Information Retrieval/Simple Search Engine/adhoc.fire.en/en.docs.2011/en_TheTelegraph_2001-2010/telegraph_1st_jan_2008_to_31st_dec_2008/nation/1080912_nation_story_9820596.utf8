	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 11: The rod puppet theatre would meet a slow death, feels its exponent Maguni Charan Kuanr of Keonjhar.        
	The Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee left the audience spellbound with his amazing performance at the four-day Orissa Putul Kala Festival that concluded here today.        
	His troupe, Utkal Biswakarma Kalakunj, has been performing endlessly across the country. Ever since he founded the troupe in 1955, the versatile artiste has taken rod puppetry to another dimension. This form of puppetry is one of the four distinct styles prevalent in the country.        
	Magunis performance was unmatched and he wished to modernise his art to win the hearts of urban audiences but financial crunch has always proved a hurdle. Twenty-two years ago, the government honoured me but could not provide me a loan from any bank to save this popular art form, the veteran artiste rued.        
	Many of my disciples, including his two sons, have stopped practising it, he said.         
	Traditionally, puppetry shows have been a source of humourous entertainment along with moral lessons based on legends drawn from epics and Purans.        
	Handling puppets, designing them, crafting costumes, developing screenplays, deciding music, designing stage properties and craft, and lending a variety of background voices suiting the characters in his plays is not an easy task, Orissa Sangeet Natak Akademi secretary Manmath Satpathy said.

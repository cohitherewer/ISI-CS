The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Target election on CWC stage
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Target election on CWC stage

	New Delhi, Sept. 12: The Congress Working Committee will meet tomorrow against the backdrop of the historic Vienna victory but the session is expected to look beyond the NSG waiver to the polls ahead.        
	Sources said there would be a resolution congratulating Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and UPA allies Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh, but the CWC was not likely to focus on Vienna.        
	A decision has been taken to include the larger Congress parivar in the CWC. This will include party chief ministers, leaders of legislature parties, state presidents, secretaries and co-ordinators, who are often considered adjuncts to powerful general secretaries.        
	The session will see another departure from practice: the Delhi bosses could yield the stage to the chief ministers and state leaders, an indication that the Congress is in election mode.        
	The Lok Sabha polls are an aggregate of the results from states, so we have to take the inputs from there seriously before sizing up our strengths and weaknesses and finding out how prepared we are, a general secretary said.        
	The session could give the central leaders an idea of the partys prospects in states where polls are due, including Jammu and Kashmir. The reading is that although the Kashmir crisis has petered out, the Congress base in Jammu has eroded without corresponding gains in the Valley.         
	Leaders said they also expected to get a measure of how key allies  the Nationalist Congress Party, RJD and the DMK  are placed.

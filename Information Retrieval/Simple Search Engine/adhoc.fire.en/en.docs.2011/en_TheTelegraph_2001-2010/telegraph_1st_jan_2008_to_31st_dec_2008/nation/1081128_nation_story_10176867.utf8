	Nov. 27: The Oberoi Trident is one of the best-known business hotels in the financial capital.         
	The sea-facing hotel at Nariman Point  Mumbais tony business district  is well located with the Bombay Stock Exchange, the secretariat and the Assembly and most international and national banks headquartered within a radius of 1km.        
	The Cond Nast Traveler Gold List chose the Oberoi, Mumbai, among the best hotels in Asia, Australia and Pacific nations in 2006.         
	Eminent former guests include Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, Jack Welch and many heads of state. The Kohinoor suite, spread over 1,634sqft, is the crown jewel of the hotel, where many of those heads, stayed.        
	The hotel is owned by East India Hotels, a company headquartered in Calcutta and founded by Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi. The Oberoi Grand in Calcutta used to be the flagship hotel of EIH after the Rai Bahadur bought the Chowringhee hotel in 1938.        
	The Mumbai hotel, earlier known as the Oberoi Towers, was rebranded as Hilton Towers following a co-branding and marketing agreement in 2004 with Hilton International.         
	The alliance broke in 2007 after Hilton signed a pact with real estate developers DLF Ltd to establish a larger footprint in India. Now, the Oberoi hotel is known as Trident Towers.

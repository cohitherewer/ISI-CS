          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Bidhyashor                                  
	New Delhi, June 30: Thingujam Bidhyashor Singh, 25, is lying dead in hospital but his family is in no hurry to take his body away. They want to donate his organs so five others can have a new life.        
	But another death has so far blocked the way. The family has been told a senior doctor who is to approve the donation has taken leave because his father has passed away.        
	So the Manipuri student has been lying brain dead for seven days at Safdarjung Hospital  swathed in tubes as a ventilator keeps him technically alive  raising fears that his organs may no longer be fit for donation.        
	Two of his brothers, who have arrived from Manipur, are waiting stoically for things to start moving. The grief doesnt show on the faces of Tiken and Jayanta Singh who, without a place to stay in Delhi, have been roughing it out on the hospital corridors for four days.        
	Since most patients in a hospital die from infections or organ failure, only 1 per cent are eligible to donate their organs.        
	When we said we wanted to donate our brothers organs, the doctors told us he could give a new life to five patients with his corneas, kidneys and heart, said Tiken, 35, the eldest of five brothers.        
	But its been a few days now. I dont know if they are still in good condition. I dont mind the delay but I want my brothers memory to live on. If someone sees through his eyes and lives with his heart, he will remain immortal.        
	Bidhyashor, the youngest of the brothers, had a masters in biology and came to Delhi to prepare for his IAS exams. He never went home in three years. On June 23, he was run over by a bus and admitted to the hospital as an unknown victim. He was declared brain dead by evening and put on a ventilator.        
	Tiken and Jayanta said the hospital told them the donation would be delayed because a neuro-surgeon on the panel that clears organ donations was on leave. Later, they were told that since their mother wasnt here to sign the consent papers, the donation couldnt happen at all.        
	This evening, the hospital confirmed the senior doctor hadnt come but added they had decided to begin the donation process. Bidhyashors organs will be tested and if found fit, would be taken out and preserved. The hospital said it would make an exception and go ahead with the signature of one of the brothers.        
	But Tiken and Jayanta must wait at least another 24 hours before they can take the body away to Vrindavan, where their mother wants her youngest sons last rites done.

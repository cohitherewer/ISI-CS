The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bank loans to fund elite tech schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bank loans to fund elite tech schools
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Centre plans to borrow from banks to fund 20 new Indian Institutes of Information Technology that it has promised to build.        
	The loans will be transferred to the new IIITs, which will have to return the funds over a period of 10 years, top government officials told The Telegraph.        
	The Centre has never in the past taken bank loans to fund higher education institutions, sources said.        
	We are breaking new ground with this concept. If it succeeds, it could open up the path for this model of financing institutions using loans to be replicated with other higher educational institutions, a senior official in the human resource development ministry said.         
	The government has already held initial talks with banks, the official added.        
	The 20 new IIITs are to be built during the ongoing 11th Five-Year Plan under the public-private mode, a mechanism employed to help the government share the burden of funding with industry.         
	But the combined funds that the government can invest, and the money private players are likely to agree to provide, are still inadequate to start the new IIITs.         
	The IIITs are Indias best schools dedicated to IT learning and offer courses comparable to the ones offered by the computer science departments of the Indian Institutes of Technology.         
	India, which has nine IIITs at present, has decided to build more to help continue the countrys dominance in the IT sector.        
	Each new IIIT is estimated to cost around Rs 100 crore. Nasscom, which prepared detailed project reports for the new institutes, has estimated that the private sector, on an average, would be willing to invest around Rs 15 crore on each IIIT.         
	The HRD ministry has allocated Rs 100 crore for all the 20 IIITs under the five-year plan, which means Rs 5 crore for each institute.         
	States that want to host an IIIT will each have to shell out around Rs 10 crore, the sources said. Between the private sector, the state and the central government, we will only be able to muster around Rs 30 crore (for each IIIT). The rest  Rs 70 crore  will have to be made up from loans, a source said.         
	The concept of funding through bank loans can technically be used to start all institutions that are capable of earning significant revenue of their own to pay back the money, the source said. All institutions that can earn adequate funds from their research or consultancy to repay the loan can be considered for this model in the future.

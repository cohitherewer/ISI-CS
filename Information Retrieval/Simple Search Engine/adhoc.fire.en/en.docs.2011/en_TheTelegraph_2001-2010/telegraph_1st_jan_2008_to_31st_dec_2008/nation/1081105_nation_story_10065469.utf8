          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 4: The vice-chancellor who had locked a campus auditorium where Rahul Gandhi was to address students resigned today after 11 days of political furore.        
	V.K. Suri, who ran the Chandra Shekhar Azad Agriculture University in Kanpur, sent his resignation to the governor who accepted it, Raj Bhavan sources said. Suri did not specify any reasons, they added.        
	Governor T.V. Rajeswar, chancellor of the university by virtue of his office, had expressed his displeasure in several ways since Suri scuttled Rahuls planned meeting at the university on October 24.        
	The Amethi MP, finding the auditorium locked, had met students in a campus canteen, though.        
	A furious Rajeswar, hand-picked by Sonia Gandhi for his current job, had scrapped his own visit to the university later that day. The Congress accused Suri of acting under chief minister Mayavatis orders  a charge the state government has denied.        
	Rajeswar sought an explanation from Suri, who replied the meeting had not been formally approved. The governor, unhappy with this explanation, refused to meet Suri when the vice-chancellor called on him last week, the Raj Bhavan sources said.        
	The governor has asked the registrar to discharge the vice-chancellors duties for now. The state Congress said that although Suri had resigned, his alleged links with the BSP should be probed.

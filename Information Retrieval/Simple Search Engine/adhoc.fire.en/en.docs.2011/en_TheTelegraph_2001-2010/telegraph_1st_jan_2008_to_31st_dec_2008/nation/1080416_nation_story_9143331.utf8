          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             Key players: Leslie Tripathy, Raja Acharya. Telegraph file picture                                 
	Bhubaneswar, April 15: The police have zeroed in on gangster Raja Acharya as the prime suspect in the murder of Biranchi Das, but have failed to nab him despite conducting several raids in the city, Cuttack and Puri.         
	Police commissioner B.K. Behera said: We got leads from raids conducted since Sunday night. Every lead is being followed.         
	Geetanjali Das, the wife of the slain coach, has filed an FIR at Bargarh police station stating that she had heard her husband plead Raja please, Raja please. Geetanjali has also said that she saw Raja visit the judo hall twice earlier.         
	We have come to the conclusion that Raja is the one who committed the crime, the police commissioner said today. He did not rule out the possibility of a police-gangster nexus in helping Raja flee.         
	We are trying to trace the unscrupulous officers if there are any, he added.         
	Two platoons of police raided the areas around Shishmo Hotel this afternoon following a tip-off. The area was sealed for two hours while the police searched for the suspect in vain.         
	We received information that Raja was seen at an Omfed booth near the hotel, but it appears to be a hoax call, said deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Thakur.         
	Police sources said they were trying to track the mobile phones from which Raja had sent SMSes to Oriya film and video actress Leslie Tripathy. Inquiry has revealed that Raja used 32 mobile phones for the messages.         
	Meanwhile, police security has been provided to Leslie and Jubilee Sundarray, an album maker, who has received threat calls from Raja.         
	Senior bureaucrat and president of the Judo Association Priyabrata Pattnaik rubbished the charges that he had asked Biranchi to interfere in the Raja-Leslie case. I always asked Biranchi to stop interfering in others affairs, but he never listened. I never imagined that such a disaster would happen, he rued.         
	The police commissioner conceded that they were also working on other possible angles like the railway scrap deal.         
	Sub-inspector B.K. Mishra of Mancheswar police station was placed under suspension for his alleged nexus with the scrap racket and for reportedly releasing three trucks of railway scraps after taking bribe. Biranchi provided the police the tip-off regarding the gang. Mishra allegedly disclosed Dass name to the gang.         
	Senior city police officers were closeted at a meeting today where the leads were discussed. Later, in the evening, director-general of police G.C. Nanda chaired a review meeting on the law and order situation, which also discussed the murder.         
	Earlier, in the morning, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who holds the home portfolio, described the incident as unfortunate. Stating that he had spoken to senior officers regarding the matter, Naveen said: The police are doing their job and trying their best.         
	Raids continued in all the districts. A special team constituted for this case met at the commissioners office. The team comprises DCP, ACP and selected inspectors.

  - Signal of internal changes after Malegaon blast glare on officers        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Former military personnel at a wreath-laying ceremony in London on Friday to mark the contribution of the people of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Africa and the Caribbean in the two World Wars. (AFP)                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said the army would effect some internal changes after the arrest of a lieutenant colonel in the Malegaon blast case and a request from Maharashtra police to question three more officers.         
	Antony did not specify what these internal changes would be but a senior officer indicated it would mean a tightening of counter-intelligence within the service.         
	This is of great concern to us, Antony said on the arrest of Lt Colonel Shrikanth Purohit by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on charges of involvement with a group that set off the September 29 blast in Malegaon, killing six persons.         
	Purohit is alleged to be among the leading activists of a Hindu Right-wing outfit, Abhinav Bharat.        
	His arrest marks the first time such charges have been made against a serving army officer. Senior army headquarters sources said Purohits career would be frozen till he is either cleared of the charges or found guilty.         
	Maharashtra police are also understood to have requested permission to question  and have probably begun questioning  three more officers, one of whom is said to be a major general. But there was no confirmation from army headquarters.         
	Defence minister Antony, too, declined to answer a question on more arrests beyond saying that whatever is necessary will be done.         
	Purohit has been remanded in judicial custody till November 15. He is suspected of procuring and supplying explosives to a retired army major, Ramesh Upadhyay, and helping sadhvi Pragya Thakur, who is an accused in the case.         
	Let me assure you that we will get to the bottom of this (case). And the ATS and the Intelligence Bureau are investigating. We are waiting for the report. We will take all action that is required, Antony said.         
	He added that it was good that two external agencies  the ATS and the IB  were investigating instead of the armys own outfits.         
	Of the three officers reported to be under the scanner, one is said to be a major general and the others a colonel and a major. They are said to be posted in Deolali and Nagpur.         
	The police made requests to ask for clarifications from the officers after interrogating Upadhyay and Purohit and scanning their phone records.        
	CPM probe push        
	The CPM today asked the government to probe reports that Hindutva elements had penetrated the army. So far, there was a sanctity about the armed forces.... Now, that is clearly breaking down. So there is a requirement for immediate attention and correction, politburo member Sitaram Yechury told reporters.         
	The alleged involvement of army personnel in the Malegaon blast had disturbing implications for national security, he said, adding that the government should act against terrorism irrespective of which quarter it came from.

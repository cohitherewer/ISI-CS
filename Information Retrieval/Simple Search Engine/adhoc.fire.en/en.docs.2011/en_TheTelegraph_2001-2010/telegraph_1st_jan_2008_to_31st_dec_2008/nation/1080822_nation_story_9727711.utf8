	Washington, Aug. 21: America  not India  was on the mat at the end of the first day of deliberations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to exempt India from its strict guidelines for trade in nuclear material and technology that could be used for civilian and military purposes.         
	A handful of countries, which have reservations about a blanket exemption for India from the NSG rules, told the Americans in Vienna today that the dissenting nations were asking for nothing more than incorporating the requirements in the Hyde Act, passed by the US Congress, into the document allowing New Delhi to engage in nuclear commerce.         
	The Hyde Act has a number of prescriptive provisions, which India has rejected. These include prohibition of another nuclear test, if undertaken, will lead to the termination of the nuclear deal.         
	Critics of the US draft before the current NSG meeting also pointed out to the Americans that they had on their statute book other domestic legislation that triggered automatic sanctions against any country that tested a nuclear bomb except the five recognised nuclear-weapons states under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), diplomats in Vienna privy to NSG talks at Japans permanent mission to international organisations in Vienna said.         
	None of these prescriptions was reflected in the US draft asking the NSG to give India a clean exemption from the groups guidelines, they complained.         
	Although no country put it in so many words at the very civil NSG deliberations and in private discussions on its sidelines, such criticism of the Bush administration amounted to telling Washington that it had double standards on nuclear non-proliferation: one yardstick on the nuclear deal with India for Americas domestic constituencies and another for the international community on the same issue.         
	One Indian official said, half in mirth, that if India was not a beneficiary of the nuclear deal with the US, Delhi could have wholeheartedly agreed with the critics on the issue of Americas double standards.         
	How can we forget that they asked us not very long ago to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) even though their own Congress rejected the CTBT, said the official, who is under a gag order on talking to the media. And they wanted us to declare a unilateral moratorium on fissile material production while continued to stock up.         
	No NSG member voiced criticism of India over its record in non-proliferation though there were pious hopes that Delhi would join the NPT and the CTBT and do more towards a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT).         
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menons comprehensive briefing for NSG members that anticipated questions from dissenting countries left no room for any criticism of Delhis record in non-proliferation.

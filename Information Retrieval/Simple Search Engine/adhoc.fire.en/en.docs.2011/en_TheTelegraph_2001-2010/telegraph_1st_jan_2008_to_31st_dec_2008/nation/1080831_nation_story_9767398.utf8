          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh briefed Sonia Gandhi on the reworked Nuclear Suppliers Group draft and assured her that it would not transgress the commitments (the red lines) made by him to Parliament.         
	Sonia was told the draft did not insist on any prescriptive language requiring Indias future adherence to non-proliferation benchmarks such as the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.         
	The document will be circulated among NSG member nations on Monday before the elite club sits in Vienna on September 4 and 5 for its second meeting.        
	Congress sources said Sonia was told that the draft contained minimalchanges effected by semantic jugglery that would not compromise the basic position the government and the party maintained on the Indo-US nuclear deal: that it was a treaty driven almost entirely by Indias terms and conditions.        
	Describing the government and the Congresss mood as one of cautious optimism four days before the NSG meets, the sources admitted that the Group of Six countries  Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland  could insist on language that may not entirely be to Indias liking if Delhi jettisoned its unilateral testing moratorium in future.         
	These countries have reportedly sought a compromise formula for a testing post-condition which would be acceptable to India and the G-6.        
	Later, the Congress-Samajwadi Party co-ordination committee met for the first time at the Prime Ministers residence.         
	Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, who attended the meeting with Mulayam Singh Yadav, said the Prime Minister asked his party to join the government. But he declined, saying no new minister could do justice to his ministry with the Lok Sabha elections just six months away. Sonia was also present.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: Eight persons, including a VHP activist and a Shiv Sena worker, have been arrested for allegedly vandalising a prayer hall on Mumbais fringes amid a Christian councils allegations the pastor was stripped.        
	The arrests were made last night after the Hebran Prayer Hall in Thanes Bhayander, affiliated to the Pentecostal Church, was damaged in the afternoon. There have been complaints that officers from Navgarh police station, only 50 metres away, did not arrive to stop the mayhem.        
	Police claimed a quarrel broke out between some locals and the pastor over distribution of pamphlets for a peace meeting earlier in the day. The residents then barged into the hall, attacked the pastor and vandalised the place.        
	However, Christian groups in Mumbai had a different version. Abraham Mathai, the president of the All India Christian Council, said baptism services were on when the prayer hall was attacked.         
	I visited the spot. The attackers thought forcible conversions were taking place. They stripped the pastor, Phillip Fernandes, and thrashed him. At least 10 women participating the baptism services were also beaten up. There were two women among the attackers, Mathai, also the vice-president of the Maharashtra minorities commission, said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                       
	New Delhi, April 30: A parliamentary committee, caught in a dilemma over defining misconduct and ethical behaviour, has found a way out in the British seven principles of public life.        
	The committee has added two principles  responsibility and public interest  to the seven drawn up by a British parliamentary panel  selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.        
	Based on these principles, the committee, headed by Kishore Chandra Deo of the Congress, has recommended a code of conduct for MPs and suggested a separate panel for its implementation.        
	The Lok Sabha Speaker had ordered the committee to be set up following members queries about definition of misconduct and a general criticism that MPs claim privileges they are not entitled to.        
	The panels report, submitted in the Lok Sabha today, asserted that codes are useless unless there are penal provisions.         
	After exhaustive deliberations with members of the judiciary, media and political parties, besides academics, the committee felt that it may not be prudent to give a comprehensive definition of misconduct.        
	Misconduct may be broadly defined as conduct unbecoming of a member of Parliament, which may include acts of misuse and of abuse by members of their powers, privileges and immunities or rights and facilities enjoyed by them either in discharge of their parliamentary duties or public duties, it added.        
	Apart from being honest, selfless and responsible, the MPs must also make sure that they do nothing to further their private interests in the House. For instance, United Breweries owner Vijay Mallya, a Rajya Sabha member, cannot take part in any discussion on the liquor business.        
	Another committee, on parliamentary privileges, also submitted its report in the Lok Sabha today.        
	It hailed MPs for not misusing their special rights and advocated an awareness campaign to counter the notion that MPs abuse their powers.        
	There hasnt been any misuse of powers of privileges as erroneously believed in some quarters, the panels report said.

	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh today reiterated the Union governments promise to establish two universities in Orissa.         
	The Centre attaches priority to the development of Orissa. Steps are being taken to establish the two proposed education seats in the current Five Year Plan, he said.         
	The HRD ministers statement came in the wake of doubts expressed over the establishment of a central university and world-class university, announced earlier by the UPA government.         
	He was, however, silent on the establishment of a regional centre of the national tribal university in Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. He said that the government was studying tribal institutes before finalising a model.         
	Informing that his ministry has decided to set up 1,000 polytechnics across the country for promotion of vocational education, Singh said at least 15-16 of these would be in Orissa.         
	Inaugurating an international seminar on Myths and superstition vis--vis tribal society that was organised here by Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, the HRD minister said the members of the tribal community enjoyed an affinity towards nature.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rajnath Singh                                  
	Raipur, April 14: First his close aide, now a member in his government has put Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh in the dock for shady deals.         
	State chairman of the Khadi Gramodhyog Board Kriparam Sahu, who enjoyed the status of a state minister, was forced to resign from his office after being caught-on-camera while accepting Rs 2,500 for revoking the suspension of an official.         
	Singh today accepted the resignation after consulting senior party leaders.         
	Earlier a close aide, Pradeep Gandhi, who was one of the 11 parliamentarians expelled in December 2005 after a sting operation on cash-for-questions scam had put the chief minister in a tight spot.         
	After Singh became the chief minister, Gandhi had considerable influence in the corridor of power. Sahu can also claim to be close to the chief minister and asserted that it was he (Sahu) who brought Raman Singh into politics.         
	But for the chief minister, there was no question of re-paying his debt.         
	For, as far as Singh was concerned, the chairman had put the ruling party in a dilemma, especially when it was gearing for the Assembly polls  due in November 2008  by projecting itself as a crusader against corruption.         
	Sahu, an influential saffron leader from the Other Backward Class (OBC) community, had earlier served as minister in the Sunderlal Patwa government in undivided Madhya Pradesh.         
	The partys state unit spokesperson, Saroj Pandey, conceded that she would not like to comment at this juncture, as the party was taking up the matter at a higher-level.         
	Sources in the BJP, however, admitted that the party was mulling over suspension move. For the faction-ridden opposition Congress, the issue has come as a pre-poll gift.        
	The chief minister cannot escape responsibility, as this incident proves that the government is mired into corruption. Gandhi-Sahu episodes are just a small examples, said state Congress spokesman Ramesh Varlyani.

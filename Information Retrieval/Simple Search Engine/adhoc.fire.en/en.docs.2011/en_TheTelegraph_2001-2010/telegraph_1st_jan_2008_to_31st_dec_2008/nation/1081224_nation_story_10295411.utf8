          SANJAY K. JHA                                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The BJP will continue milking the A.R. Antulay controversy to expose the Congress mindset on national security at a time the government is gaining brownie points for its tough decisions after the Mumbai attack.        
	The Centre today tried to close the chapter by distancing itself from the minority affairs ministers controversial remarks, but the main Opposition party signalled it would not let the matter rest.        
	This is the test case: sack Antulay today or we will come to the conclusion that your anti-Pakistan stand is suspect and driven by electoral considerations, L.K. Advani said.        
	Antulay had hinted at a conspiracy behind the killing of Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karkare  who had arrested several people with links to the Sangh parivar in the Malegaon blast probe  on the first night of the Mumbai terror attack.         
	The government today told Parliament there was no such conspiracy.        
	The BJP has called a meeting of senior party officials tomorrow morning to decide the next course of action.        
	The Antulay row came as a windfall for the party. At its parliamentary party meeting this morning, Advani said: The government cannot talk tough with Pakistan on the one hand and, on the other, allow its minister to talk the language of Pakistan.

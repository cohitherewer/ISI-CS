	Chennai, Feb. 20: A chartered plane carrying Jayalalithaa to Thanjavur made an emergency landing at Chennai airport this morning following a snag.        
	The ADMK chief was on her way to the ancient Abirami Amman temple in Nagapattinam district for special prayers to mark her 60th birthday. Minutes after take-off, the pilot decided to return.        
	Jayalalithaas close aides, including Sassikala, were travelling with her in the eight-seater plane, which belongs to the Pondicherry Flying Club.        
	Sources at the airport said the technical problem was minor, but confirmed that the flight had made an emergency landing.        
	Jayalalithaa returned to her Poes Garden home, hoping to take an Indian flight to Tiruchirappalli in the afternoon. But when that flight was delayed, she chose to drive down to the temple, a five-hour journey from the city.        
	Jayalalithaa turns 60 on Sunday, but according to the traditional Hindu almanac, her birthday is tomorrow.         
	The Amman temple, believed to be 2,000 years old, is considered auspicious for any 60th year celebration  it could be somebodys birthday or marriage anniversary.        
	After prayers at the temple, Jayalalithaa is likely to visit another shrine nearby. The temple to Saturn at Thirunallar  a favourite with VIPs  is believed to help remove hurdles and solve problems.

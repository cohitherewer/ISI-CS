	Bhubaneswar, May 23: Infrastructure development activities would be hastened in Kalinganagar industrial complex with the construction of five more rehabilitation colonies and development of modern amenities over an area of 5,000 acres.         
	The industrial complex is presently spread over 13,000 acres and houses more than 10 steel plants, including Tata Steels 6MT mega-plant.         
	The decision to expand the complex was taken at a meeting attended by steel and mines minister Pradip Amat and finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei today. The meet was convened to identify and acquire an additional 5,000 acres land to develop civic amenities, including hospitals, schools, colleges, stadia, bus terminuses and market complexes.         
	Steel and mines secretary Ashok Dalwai was asked to identify and acquire the land for the expansion. It was also decided that an airstrip would be developed near Mangalpur on the periphery of Kalinganagar complex.         
	Before the decisions a review was conducted. It revealed that four rehabilitation colonies had been completed in the industrial complex till now. But the need for five more colonies to accommodate displaced families was felt. Two colonies at Manitira and Baligadia (Jajpur) would be started within the next week.         
	The Jajpur collector, D.K. Das, said at the meeting that the district administration had already allotted land for the two colonies and tenders had been floated for the appointment of consultant for a comprehensive development plan. Six private firms have submitted tenders.         
	Finance minister Ghadei, who represents the area, said expansion of four roads and construction of a railway overbridge near Manpur station would be taken up, while the Dangadi community health centre would be upgraded through a public-private partnership. Besides, plantation would be taken up in and around the complex.

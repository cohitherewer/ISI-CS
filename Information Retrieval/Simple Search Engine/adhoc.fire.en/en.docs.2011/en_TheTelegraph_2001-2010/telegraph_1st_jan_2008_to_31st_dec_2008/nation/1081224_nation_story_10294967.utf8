	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Supreme Court has said a complainant in a case can challenge the merit of granting bail to an accused, reports our legal correspondent.        
	It is not as if once bail is granted by any court, the only way to get it cancelled is on account of misuse. The bail order can be tested on merit also. In our opinion, the complainant can question the merit of the order... the apex court said.        
	It set aside a Patna High Court decision to grant bail to one Munna Jaiswal and asked the high court to take a reasoned decision.         
	Munna was facing prosecution on charges of murder and criminal intimidation when he was released by the high court.         
	Brij Nandan, whose son Jai Shankar was murdered, had moved the apex court.        
	The Supreme Court has directed Munna to surrender within a week.

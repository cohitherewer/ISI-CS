	Tips to girls to tackle wolves
 
	The city, or at least its schools, seems to be have woken up to the fact that it is not the safest metro after all. 
 
	Close to 50,000 girls in Class V and above in schools under the state education board were recently handed pamphlets carrying tips on what constitutes sexual harassment and how to tackle it. 
 
	Suman Shinde, education inspector, south Mumbai zone, is the man behind the mission. 
 
	The pamphlet tells girls how to differentiate between a person touching them out of affection and with sexual intention. It also urges them not to tolerate sexual advances like an unnecessary push by a stranger, in addition to providing tips on health, hygiene and the importance of education for the girl child.
 
	At present, the pamphlets have been handed only to girl students. We thought of dealing with girls issues first and then take up problems faced by boys, Shinde said. In fact, girls want us to educate boys about sexual harassment, which we will do soon.

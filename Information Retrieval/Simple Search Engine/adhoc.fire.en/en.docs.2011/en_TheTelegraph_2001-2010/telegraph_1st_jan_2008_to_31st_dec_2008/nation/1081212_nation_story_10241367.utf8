          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Dec. 11: Members of JD(U), such as general secretary Shivanand Tiwary, believe that BJPs ranting for the revival of Pota is the weak cry of a party that is fast losing its support base.         
	Instead, he adds, the NDA must go by the Bihar model of politics and governance if it wishes to do decently in the Lok Sabha polls. The senior JD(U) leaders reference was towards BJPs electoral setback in Delhi and Rajasthan and to its moderate performance in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.         
	The JD(U) spokesperon also pointed out to Nitish Kumars growing popularity in Bihar, which, he added, the chief minister had obtained by maintaining a subtle distance from the BJP planks.         
	Though BJP members, including spokesperson Kiran Ghai and vice-president Rameshwar Chourasia, sharply attacked Tiwary, going to the extent of describing him as Lalu Prasads agent, fact remains that Tiwary said what Nitish Kumar has been expressing through his actions.         
	Nitish has clarified over and over again that BJP and JD(U) are two outfits based on different ideologies. It is also known in the NDA circles, that the Bihar chief minister does not see eye-to-eye with the Gujarat chief minister.         
	On minority-related issues, Nitish has distanced himself both from Modi and prime ministerial candidate Advani.         
	The JD(U) grapevine has it that Nitish has been trying his best to marginalise the BJP further by offering less Lok Sabha seats to the latter than what was offered in 2004 polls.        
	The BJP had contested on 16 Lok Sabha seats, against 24 on which the JD(U) had fought. It will be better for the NDA, as a whole, if the BJP stays low-key in Bihar, said a senior JD(U) leader.        
	A section of BJP leaders also understands that Nitish Kumar has earned the trust of Muslims, who voted overwhelmingly for the NDA in the by-elections on seven Assembly and Lok Sabha seats. Besides, Kumar has carved out a niche for himself among the electorate for his emphasis on performance over rhetoric.         
	But, some hardcore BJP cadre recognise a gradual decline of the saffron party in Nitishs method. Staying with the JD(U), our party may lose in the long run, the way the Congress lost with Lalu Prasad, said a party member.

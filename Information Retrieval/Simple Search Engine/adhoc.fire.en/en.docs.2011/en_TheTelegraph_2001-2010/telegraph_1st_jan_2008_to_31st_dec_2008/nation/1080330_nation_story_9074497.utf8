The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIMA course gets three times costlier 
                                                                                                               IIMA course gets three times costlier 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, March 29: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, has increased the fee for its two-year postgraduate programme from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 11.5 lakh.        
	The nearly 200 per cent hike, applicable for the 2008-2010 batch joining in June, was announced after a meeting of its board of governors today.         
	In a statement issued after the meeting, IIMA chairman Vijaypath Singhania said the board had unanimously decided to charge Rs 5.5 lakh for the first year of the programme and Rs 6 lakh for the second. The current fee is Rs 2 lakh for each year.        
	The raise followed a review of the cost structure of the postgraduate programme. IIMA director Sameer Barua made a presentation to the board members, arguing the need to increase the fee to meet growing costs.         
	This is the highest fee hike announced by an IIM. In 2007, the IIMA had raised its tuition fee from Rs 1.77 lakh to Rs 2 lakh. In the last five years, when Bakul Dholakia was the director, IIMA fees have increased by only Rs 40,000  at an annual average of 7 per cent.         
	The fee hike, however, will not affect students from the lower-income group.        
	Reiterating its commitment that no deserving student would be deprived of the opportunity to study at IIMA because of financial constraints, the board has decided to triple the annual family income limit  from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 6 lakh  for a student to be eligible for aid.        
	The IIMA scored another first today. Despite taking such an important decision, the authorities shied away from the media. Only a brief press note was issued announcing the move.        
	Asked whether government representatives, who are nominees on the board, had agreed to the fee-hike proposal, Singhania refused to comment. We have issued a press note.        
	Sources at the IIMA agreed that it was unlikely for the institute not to brief reporters about the decision. Certainly, IIMA has something to hide, a source said.        
	IIMA spokesperson Ishita Solanki, however, said: We do not want any controversy. So many people are saying so many baseless things. We dont want to either contradict or confirm them.

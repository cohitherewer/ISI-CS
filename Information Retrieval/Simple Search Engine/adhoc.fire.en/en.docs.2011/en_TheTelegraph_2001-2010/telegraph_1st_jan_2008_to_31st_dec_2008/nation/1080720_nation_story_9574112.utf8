          AMIT ROY                             Chopra (top), Azmi                          
	London, July 19, 2008: Buckingham Palace today confirmed that Prince Charles had met Shabana Azmi, actress and social activist, as part of a group of business and cultural leaders from India to explore ways in which the Princes Charities can develop charitable links between Britain and India  a country which has been close to the Princes heart for many years.         
	The guests who had three days in London, during which they had a private dinner with the Prince and a brain storming session at the end of the trip, included K.P. Singh of DLF; Naina Lal Kidwai, CEO of HSBC India; and Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who asked if he could use the royal palaces as locations for his next Bollywood blockbuster (Yes, if the terms are right!).         
	K.P. Singh, who has a home in London, was out playing golf this afternoon, so it was not possible to ask him what he thought of the princes hospitality.         
	It is understood that Mukesh Ambani, Ratan Tata and Lakshmi Mittal were unable to attend.         
	A spokeswoman for Charles said that the Indian guests spent three days in London learning about the work of the Princes Charities and developing ideas for ways in which the charities can work in partnership with organisations and businesses in India to initiate charitable activities.         
	They visited the headquarters of the Princes Trust, and the renovated warehouse in Shoreditch which houses the Princes Foundation for the Built Environment, the Princes School of Traditional Arts and the Princes Drawing School. They also heard of the work of the Princes Regeneration Trust.         
	They were briefed on the two most recent initiatives of the Princes Charities: the British Asian Trust and the Princes Youth Business International.         
	Guests were allowed to bring partners but not allowed to take away souvenirs with royal crests.         
	The Indian party also included Sajjan Jindal, vice chairman and managing director, JSW Steel Limited; Lalit Modi, chairman of the Indian Premier League and vice president of the BCCI; S K Mishra, chairman, INTACH; and Bunker Roy, founder, Barefoot College.

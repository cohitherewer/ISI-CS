	Ranchi, Nov. 21: With the National Games looking at yet another postponement to January 2009, chief minister Shibu Soren is getting ready to knock on the Prime Ministers door with a request for fresh funds to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The committees working chairman R.K. Anand  Soren is the chairman  has been requested to seek an appointment with Manmohan Singh next week. We need the money and the Prime Minister has released funds in such exegencies to other organising committees too, Anand said after holding an executive board meeting of the committee today.         
	The cost of infrastructure, including stadium, is likely to be more than Rs 800 crore because of poor planning and inordinate delay in organising the Games.         
	But the overall expenses, including purchase of sports equipment, security equipment and event management are going to burden the state exchequer by a huge amount, said a sports department official.         
	Also, costs over-runs due to successive delays in scheduling the Games  from 2007 to 2008 and now, possibly 2009  and ongoing economic slump have made things much more difficult, the official added.         
	At the meeting, it was felt that overall budget would shoot up by a huge margin form the estimates prepared with the November 2007 schedule in mind.         
	Sports minister Bandhu Tirkey said the Centre had always allocated aid to other states organising the Games.

	Debjani Roy, a 32-year-old Mumbai-based executive from Calcutta, was returning from the airport around 11pm when she saw the explosion in a taxi on the Western Express Highway. Here is her eyewitness account:        
	Soon after my auto took a right turn outside the airport, I heard the explosion. I thought it was a post-Diwali firecracker. Then I saw the fire not more than 10 cars ahead.         
	Everyone seemed calm. I was stuck for about 15-20 minutes. It was only when the noise level started rising that I became alarmed. I called a friend who told me what was going on around the city.        
	The cops came quite fast and made way for people to get out of the area. I saw a ribcage  or part of it  lying some 10ft from the blast spot. There was a terrible smell of burning metal and flesh.        
	I stayed home today. The office is closed. I live in Bandra. People in the suburbs dont seem very scared. They seem more horrified.         
	Samiran Chakrabarty, chief economist with a leading bank, was going home from the airport when he saw the blast in the taxi.        
	I was returning from Chennai and took an auto from the airport. The driver stopped 100 metres from a traffic signal to take a call. That is when I saw a vehicle going up in flames with a deafening explosion. I could feel its impact. I also saw two dead bodies.         
	Zulfi Syed, model-turned-actor, had thrown a party at Sahara Star hotel in Santa Cruz. Zulfi and his celebrity guests were witness to the blast in the taxi.         
	A couple of guests had walked in when, around 11pm, we heard a massive explosion, something like a plane crash just outside the hotel. We ran out to see what was happening.        
	We saw fire and smoke billowing. Hotel staff and security quickly cordoned off the building. People from the media came back to tell us that a bomb had gone off in a taxi. By the time my guests were allowed to leave, it was already 1am.        
	I only got back home on Thursday afternoon. The roads were empty and there was an uncomfortable silence.

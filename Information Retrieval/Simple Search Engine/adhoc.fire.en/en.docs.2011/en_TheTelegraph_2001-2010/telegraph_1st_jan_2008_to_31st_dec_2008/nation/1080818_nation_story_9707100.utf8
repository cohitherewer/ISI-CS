	Srinagar, Aug. 17: It isnt often that the journey home is an unwilling enterprise. But then, it isnt often that youre having to leave such a beauteous vale, stained and scarred though it is today by erupting fires.         
	Ask Barikul Alam, a 21-year-old mason from a village in Malda, who has been forced into long and unruly queues at Srinagars Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) to get the first bus out of Kashmir. Kono dini jetaam naa, eto shundor jayega, kintu obostha khoob kharap, he says. (I would never have left, this is such a beautiful place, but things are very bad.)         
	Theres no certainty hell catch the bus tonight  or even if there is one leaving for Jammu across the Banihal Pass  but there is nothing for Barikul to do now but to jostle on for a seat home.         
	The first time he came here was as a 17-year-old, and got immediately seduced. Ive seen such extraordinary places, the people are good and so is the money. I have come back each year. But this time, it is all over, suddenly there is no work and everybody is saying there is no security either, better to get out before it is too late.         
	There are more people at the TRC than just Barikul and his group of seven from Bengal. Thousands and thousands of them, mostly skilled and semi-skilled day labourers driven from the penury of their homes in eastern India  harried, hungry and hopeless, a troubled human exhaust of this eruption in Kashmir.         
	Rafiq Zaman and Khalid from Midnapore, Burkan Ansari from Ghazipur, Surender Yadav and Jeeva Mahto from Katihar, Afsar Hussain from Samastipur, Akram Ali and Bhoginder Jha from Sitamarhi, all bivouacked with their worldly goods on the TRCs slush-ridden compound.         
	For most of them, Kashmir has meant sustenance these past years. Demand for basic vocational skills is high  carpenters, painters, barbers, masons, glass workers, even fruit-pickers and packers  and during the summer, work is intensive and rewarding.         
	In six months we were able to earn more than what we got in a year at home, says Binod Paswan, an interiors painter. But for a month now, there has been no work, only agitations, better to go home. But nobody knows when the next bus will go.         
	We have been here three days but no bus, says Akram Ali, a carpenter who, too, has been coming to Kashmir for several years to peddle his craft for cash. Several buses have gone, but there have been too many people too, getting a seat is tough. You should see the mad rush when the buses come, people are ready to trample over their kin to get in.         
	Theres a stampede on the ticket windows but for the moment the mesh is shut on the seekers; theres nobody manning the seats. What tickets can we give? asks a state transport official. We sent out 21 buses packed with these labourers last night, none of them has returned from Jammu so there are no buses and no seats.         
	The shortage of buses, and the sudden rush of passengers, was the least of their troubles, the official explained.         
	You know the situation, there is a security problem. The buses have to be sneaked in by night so that they have crossed the Banihal tunnel by daybreak, and security is not always available. Besides, there is a huge jam on both sides of the tunnel too. We are told security trucks and goods carriers are getting priority, not ordinary passenger buses.         
	But none of that is any consolation to Bihari Lal from Deoria in eastern Uttar Pradesh.         
	Koi bhaga nahin raha hai babu, lekin dar lag raha hai, sab azaadi azaadi chillate hain aur kaam bhi nahin hai, ab jaldi ghar jaana hai, (Nobody is driving us out, but we are afraid. Everywhere people are shouting azaadi and there is no work either, we must get home quickly.         
	Hes sitting in an abandoned double-decker in a corner of the compound, its rotten tyres sunk in the mud, its engine parts rusted and disgorged. This bus isnt going anywhere, but until a roadworthy one comes along, its good enough consolation for Lal.

	Suspicion of drunk pricking animals tail                          
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 23: An elephant gored to death three people at a festival in the temple town of Thrissur, apparently after being provoked by a drunk who pricked its tail.        
	The elephant, Unnikrishnan, belonging to a private contractor, went berserk around noon at the Koodal Manickam Temple, first stamping and goring to death 60-year-old Kausalya, a devotee from a nearby village.        
	Naushad, an onlooker who tried to rescue the old woman, was also gored to death. The third victim was elephant squad member N. Nitish, 30, who was killed as he tried to rein in the elephant that smashed the inner gates and tried to leave the temple premises.        
	For nearly two hours, the elephant ran amok, smashing and pulling down temple property. It swung its victims several times before leaving the bodies on the ground. Devotees tried to distract the elephant by yelling and hurling whatever they could lay their hands on.        
	Temple officials summoned vets to tranquillise the elephant but it calmed down on its own.        
	Timely action by other mahouts, who drove away some 14 other elephants from the gaze of the tusker, helped keep the toll down.        
	Tuskers go wild during season or when forced to work for prolonged spells in sultry conditions during the festival months in Kerala.         
	Most often what drives elephants into violent reactions is provocation, either from devotees or even drunken mahouts.        
	Residents said the same elephant had turned violent during the last festival. The temple officials suspended the rest of the festivities following the tragedy.        
	Thrissur collector V.K. Baby said the cause of the violent behaviour was yet to be identified. However a case has been registered and strict action would follow in case of any mischief is established, he said.        
	We are planning to modify the schedules in such a way that each animal is not strained beyond their capacity. The track record of the elephants will also be verified to check whether they had turned violent earlier, he said.        
	The temple board has announced Rs 1 lakh compensation for the dependants of the dead.

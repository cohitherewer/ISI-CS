	Darjeeling, Jan. 8: A nascent proposal to set up another states reorganisation committee has breathed fresh life into hopes for Gorkhaland, prompting some supporters of statehood to hit the streets in Darjeeling and burst crackers.        
	The Telegraph had reported in Tuesdays Late City edition that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was toying with a proposal to form the Second States Reorganisation Commission to look into demands for new states.        
	Although the Union government is yet to take the final decision, the possibility of the second commission has sent a wave of jubilation among activists of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, one of the Darjeeling-based parties advocating statehood.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung left for Delhi this morning with a four-member delegation. The party later organised a public meeting at Chowk Bazar here.         
	This is a political victory for us, said Amar Lama, a central committee member of the Morcha. Our 100-year-old demand (for separation from Bengal) has gone a step ahead and, though we should not get excited, we must rejoice. I would like to ask the GNLF if it still wants the Sixth Schedule status.        
	Under Sixth Schedule status, a new autonomous council will be set up in the Darjeeling hills with more powers. The hills, however, will remain part of Bengal.        
	The Opposition, which includes the Morcha, claimed that the Sixth Schedule status would only weaken the statehood demand.        
	Subash Ghisinghs GNLF has, however, not issued any statement yet and is probably waiting for the Centre to decide whether to set up a reorganisation commission.        
	The first state reorganisation commission was set up in 1954 and, following its report in 1956, Gujarat was carved out of the erstwhile state of Bombay.        
	But nothing on Darjeeling was included in the report, though representatives from the hills had deposed before the commission.         
	There was a huge uproar. The Bengal government then set up the Darjeeling Inquiry Committee. The committee, however, did not mention the statehood demand but recommended stipends for backward people and setting up of a TB hospital, among others, said Madan Tamang, who heads the ABGL, another Opposition outfit.        
	The second reorganisation panel, Tamang said, was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We must forget political affiliations and work for Gorkhaland, he added.        
	At todays public meeting, the Morcha asked all cultural organisations in Darjeeling not to attend any programme organised by the Bengal government.

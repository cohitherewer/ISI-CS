          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec 20: At least 100 rooms at the terror-ravaged Trident Hotel will be occupied when its reopens its doors on Sunday.         
	The five-star hotel  which has been shut since the terrorist attacks on Mumbai on November 26  expects occupancy levels to dip by 30 per cent from its usual levels in the immediate term.        
	The hotel has close to 550 rooms and restaurants like India Jones, Opium Den, Frangipani and Verandah  all of which reopen tomorrow. However, the groups adjacent hotel  The Oberoi  will have to be rebuilt and is expected to reopen in six to seven months.        
	Rattan Keswani, president of Trident Hotels, said that the Trident had suffered damages worth Rs 40 to 50 lakh. The estimates for the Oberoi are much higher at Rs 40 to 50 crore.        
	Both the properties have been insured against terrorism. The group is also covered against losses arising from any untoward events.        
	It has already received Rs 25 crore as advance from New India Assurance for rebuilding and reconstruction work. The group is working with insurance companies to ascertain the loss of profit.        
	Keswani admitted that the hotel had faced reasonably heavy booking cancellations. The impact of the terrorist attacks was not felt in Mumbai alone but at other properties as well.         
	The Trident usually sees relatively low traffic in December as business travel is impacted due to the holiday season. However, in January it picks up and the average occupancy rate in Trident is around 85 per cent. But we expect occupancy to drop by 30 per cent, he added.        
	Sundays reopening will start with a prayer service, which will be attended by some of the guests who were in the hotel when armed gunmen walked in and opened fire.        
	Initially, Keswani said the hotel would not accept bookings from Pakistani nationals if it received an advisory to this effect from the Centre.        
	Later, he said guests of all nationalities were welcome at the groups hotels. We have not received a notification from the government regarding Pakistani nationals, he said.        
	Keswani said security had been tightened at the hotel. Large baggage scanners had been installed along with metal detectors at the entrances to the hotel. Customers would have to carry a photo identity card with them, he added.

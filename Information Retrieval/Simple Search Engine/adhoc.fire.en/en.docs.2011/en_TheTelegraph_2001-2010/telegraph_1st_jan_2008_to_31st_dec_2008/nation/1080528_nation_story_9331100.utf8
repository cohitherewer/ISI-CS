                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chlorine leak at Telco colony
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 27: Gas leaking from chlorine cylinders kept at a water treatment plant in the Telco colony spread fear and panic among residents of Truck Park today.        
	At least 150 people, including several children, had to be rushed to hospital with complaints of suffocation and a burning sensation in the eyes.        
	While there were no casualties, at least five persons have been admitted to the ICU of Tata Motors Hospital.         
	According to Tata Motors plant head S.B. Borwankar, about 650 litres of chlorine had been stored in a drum. About 10 per cent of the gas was still in the drum when the leak took place. The drum was kept inside the plant. Later, it was put in a nearby pond. However, gas continued to leak from it, he said.        
	This was the first time that chlorine gas had leaked from the water treatment plant that was maintained by Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (Jusco), a subsidiary of Tata Steel.        
	Senior officials of Tata Motors, who rushed to the hospital and the plant, could not confirm whether the entire stock of gas in the cylinder had been exhausted.        
	But according to residents, a fair amount of chlorine had found its way into the atmosphere. It seemed chlorine gas was leaking from the cylinder from morning  as early as 10am  but residents of Truck Park realised something was seriously amiss only after many began falling ill, with a feeling of being suffocated accompanied by a burning sensation in the eyes and chest.        
	We got to know it was a gas leak after some youths, who were taking a bath inside the plant, rushed out to warn us, said Riazuddin Khan, a resident of Truck Park.        
	Then, there was panic all over. Within minutes residents of Truck Park and nearby areas, including Ring Road and Kharangajhar market, rushed out of their homes in search of a safe place.        
	A section of the harried residents, who lived in the 350 quarters of Tata Motors at Truck Park, sent away their families to other localities.        
	We were very confused and did not know how to react and what to do. The burning sensation in the eyes and chest was unbearable. Several residents may have unknowingly inhaled a fair amount of gas, said an elderly man.

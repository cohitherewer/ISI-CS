	June 20: Nearly 5,000 tourists now stuck in Puri because of the flood-hit train services will be brought back by bus on Monday, the Bengal government said today.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the state chief secretary had spoken to his Orissa counterpart and that the neighbouring state had promised full co-operation.        
	We expect almost all the 5,000 tourists to return by the buses departing on Monday, the minister said in Calcutta.        
	Beach Hotel, Puri, will be the registration site for those taking the special buses being arranged by the Orissa government. Whoever wants to return on Monday should register at the hotels registration counter, Chakraborty said.         
	The news should bring relief to Subhendu Biswas, a Jhargram resident who was standing towards the tail of a long queue in front of the Puri railway station enquiry counter this morning.         
	It has been a long wait, he said. I have been coming here for the past two days to find out when the trains will start again.        
	Biswas went to the holy town with his family to see Lord Jagannaths Snan Yatra and was supposed to take the Puri-Howrah Express on Wednesday. It was cancelled.         
	The 55 year-old man said he was running short of money.         
	Himadri Som from Calcutta, who is staying in a hotel on the beach, was also worried because his mother was ailing. I want to rush her home but even plane tickets are not available.        
	According to the East Coast Railways, 1,234 reserved tickets and 592 unreserved tickets were cancelled at Puri station in the last two days.         
	A reservation counter official in Puri said: It is taking long to get over with a passenger as nobody is sure about when the Puri-Howrah train service will resume.         
	The railways said the number of enquiry and ticket-refund counters had been increased but tourists and travel agents contested the claim.        
	At the extension counter set up at Bagala Dharmasala, some of those seeking refunds today were told there was a cash shortage.         
	Puri district collector Rashmi Ranjan Patnaik made light of the tourists travails. I have not heard of any major problem after enquiring with various hotels in the town, he said.        
	Orissa tourism director R.N. Nanda, too, said no serious problem had been reported. District tourist officer Sunil Patnaik had received complaints from tourists but pleaded helplessness, saying his department had little to do except advising them to return by bus.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The government today said all the promises Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had made to Parliament on the US nuclear deal had been fulfilled.        
	The statement by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee was in response to a privilege motion moved by Left parties against Singh.         
	Mukherjee said the deal would neither come in the way of Indias independent foreign policy nor affect its strategic autonomy. Our foreign policy will be determined at all times by our own assessment of our national interest.

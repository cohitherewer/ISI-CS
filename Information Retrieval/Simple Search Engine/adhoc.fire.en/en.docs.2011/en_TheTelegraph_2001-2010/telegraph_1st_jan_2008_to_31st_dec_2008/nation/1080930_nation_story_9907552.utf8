	Lucknow, Sept. 29: Police today arrested a 22-year-old man preparing for a medical entrance examination for alleged involvement in all the major blasts over the past year.        
	Mohammed Arief was caught by Uttar Pradesh police after a tip-off from Mohammed Saif, who has been arrested in connection with the Delhi blasts on September 13.         
	Arief has confessed to his involvement in the July 26 Ahmedabad blasts and the court explosions in Uttar Pradesh in November last year, state director-general of police Vikram Singh said. He added that Arief also had a hand in the Jaipur and Delhi blasts.         
	Arief has admitted to being a member of the Indian Mujahideen, suspected to have masterminded the terror attacks, Singh said.        
	Arief had moved to Lucknow from Azamgarh three years ago and had been preparing for the combined medical entrance test, he added.

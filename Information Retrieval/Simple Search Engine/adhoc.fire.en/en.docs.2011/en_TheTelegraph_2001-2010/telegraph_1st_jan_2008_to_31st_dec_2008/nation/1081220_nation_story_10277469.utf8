          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Dec. 19: Posters demanding salary revision of workers were found at the Bhilai Steel Plant this morning.         
	Though the white sheets were apparently carrying Maoist signatures, both company and CISF officials said that the posters  which also threaten senior SAIL officials with murder  might be handiwork of insiders.        
	Three pamphlets were recovered near the canteens at three different locations inside the plant, the steel plants senior communication manager S. Daripa said.        
	CISF commandant Jarnail Singh said that they had formally handed over the case to district police.         
	It is for sure that it is the handiwork of some insiders, he added.        
	We have not taken the matter for granted, Durg superintendent of police Deepanshu Kabra said.

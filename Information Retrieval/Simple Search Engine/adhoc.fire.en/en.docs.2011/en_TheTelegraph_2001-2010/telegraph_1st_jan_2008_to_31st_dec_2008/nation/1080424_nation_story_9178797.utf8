	Islamabad, April 23: Sarabjit Singhs wife and daughters today landed in Lahore to make a fresh appeal for clemency for the alleged Indian spy on death row in Pakistan.        
	I will file a fresh appeal to President Pervez Musharraf and seek clemency for my husband, Sukhpreet Singh told reporters after crossing the Wagah border.        
	Sukhpreet, who will be meeting her husband after 18 years, said he was not a terrorist and had never worked for any Indian intelligence agency. He had mistakenly crossed the border while drunk and was picked up by Pakistani law enforcement agencies, she said.        
	We are poor farmers and we want President Musharraf to pardon him, Sukhpreet, accompanied by daugthers Swapandip and Poonam, said.        
	Swapandip, 18, said she was only 23 days old when her father was arrested and pleaded that he be pardoned.        
	Poonam said she used to wait for her father every Diwali but he never came back. Now I am happy that I will at least be able to see my father.        
	Musharraf had stayed Sarabjits hanging, fixed for March 19, till April 30 after the Indian government sought clemency for him.        
	Last week, home department officials in Pakistans Punjab claimed the stay was further extended till May 30. But officials in the Presidents house denied it.        
	Sarabjit, a resident of Amritsar, was convicted in the early 1990s of spying and of involvement in five bombings in Lahore, Kasur and Faisalabad in Punjab.        
	In March 2006, Pakistan Supreme Court upheld the death sentence awarded to Sarabjit by lower courts.        
	Sarabjits family, including sister Dalbir Kaur, has claimed that his was a case of mistaken identity and he had never worked for the Research and Analysis Wing.        
	But Pakistan insists he was a terrorist who operated under different names and had a hand in the bombings.

	Raipur, June 9: Naxalites today attacked an iron-ore beneficiation plant of Essar steel in Dantewada district on Monday evening and set 20 vehicles on fire.         
	Twenty-four heavily-armed rebels raided the Essar facility around 8pm and sneaked into the plant, located near Kirandul in Dantewada district, 350km south of Raipur, by firing at the workers randomly. However, no casualty was reported.         
	The Essar steel pumps iron ore slurry through a 267km pipeline to the pellet plant from its iron ore beneficiation plant. This is the second attack on the Essar plant in two months. Rebels had attacked the same plant on April 25 and set more than 50 trucks on fire.         
	Sources reported that after entering the plant premises, rebels overpowered the employees; snatched their mobile phones and later set the 20 trucks parked on the premises. They took diesel meant for the vehicles to do their deed.        
	The exact number of the trucks and machines damaged in the attack could not be ascertained, as police had not reached the spot, which was still under the control of Naxalites fire, till the time this report was filed.        
	Sources said that company executives have stated that the plant had about 20-25 trucks parked outside the plant at the time of the attack.        
	Senior police officers started to mobilise forces soon after receiving information about the attack.        
	Police forces was deployed in and around Barsoor before the visit of chief minister Raman Singh, who landed there to inspect the on-going repair of power transmission tower that rebels had bombed on Thursday, plunging the entire Bastar region (and 1,500 villages and four district headquarters) into darkness.

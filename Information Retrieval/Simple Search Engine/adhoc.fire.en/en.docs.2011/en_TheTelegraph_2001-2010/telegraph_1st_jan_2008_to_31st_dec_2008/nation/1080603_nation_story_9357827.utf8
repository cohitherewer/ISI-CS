The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One more panel to add to Cong pile
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     One more panel to add to Cong pile
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	June 2: One more pill for the party but people are already looking at the expiry date.        
	Not many expect much from Sonia Gandhis move to appoint a party panel to revitalise the Congress because recommendations by earlier committees have seldom been acted on.        
	In the 10 years since Sonia has been Congress president, there has been a virtual panel raj with several committees getting appointed with the task of reviving the organisation. But most of the recommendations are gathering dust in the backrooms of 24 Akbar Road that houses the partys national headquarters in New Delhi.        
	Take, for instance, the report of the A.K. Antony Panel, formed after the 1999 general elections. Committee members had toured all over India and spoken to a large number of Congress workers about the reasons that led to the party getting its lowest ever number of seats (111 out of 542) in the Lok Sabha.        
	The committee had submitted 20 recommendations relating to party elections, inner-party democracy, party structure, candidate selection and observers for the process.        
	Recommendations were also made on matters of party discipline, the nitty-gritty of organisational elections, media relations as well as interactions with opinion-makers, alliances, coalitions and ideology and image. The committee had recommended a clean-up drive but the high command decided against it.        
	Apart from the comprehensive and exhaustive Antony panel report, Sonia is in possession of several other reports.        
	They include the report on organisational polls by Ram Niwas Mirdha, Manmohan Singhs report on party funds, the P.A. Sangma and Sam Pitroda reports on modernising the organisation and Pranab Mukherjees report on organisational affairs.        
	The list also includes documents prepared by the AICCs department of policy and planning (DIPCO) and the Future Challenges Group that has Rahul Gandhi as a member.        
	In a nutshell, almost all of these panels and committees have recommended sweeping changes in the organisation but intrinsic compulsions have prevented any concrete action.        
	For example, both Mirdha and Antony had emphasised the need for democratic organisational elections after discovering that the party had polled less votes in many states where the number of primary members was higher.        
	In July 2007, a party panel headed by foreign minister Mukherjee had called for scrapping Congress committees at block, city and district levels and recommended replacing them with units at polling booths and Assembly and parliamentary constituencies.        
	The logic was to make the Congress more election-friendly and eliminate the tendency of district Congress committees being at loggerheads with candidates contesting polls. But the leadership is still weighing the pros and cons of the suggestion.        
	Like Antony, Mukherjee, too, had insisted on selecting Assembly and parliamentary candidates at least six months before voting, but subsequent polls in Punjab, Gujarat, Tripura, Meghalaya, Karnataka and other states saw no sign of the recommendation being followed.                    
	Interestingly, Mukherjee, who was looking after the party in Bengal then, had opposed the idea of appointing central ministers as in-charge of Congress affairs in states.        
	Instead, the Congress now has over a dozen ministers in the Manmohan Singh government looking after party affairs across the country.        
	Against this background, cynics in the Congress wonder if Sonias penchant for panel raj would revive the party before the next round of general elections, likely to be held much before May 2009, when they are due.

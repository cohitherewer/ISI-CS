The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Polio virus surfaces in UP after 10 months
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Polio virus surfaces in UP after 10 months
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Oct 10: The most common form of the polio virus that health officials believed was on the verge of eradication from India has resurfaced in Uttar Pradesh, defying a new vaccination strategy introduced three years ago.         
	 The National Polio Surveillance programme has detected 32 cases of polio caused by the P1 polio virus in seven districts of Uttar Pradesh from June through September this year, after 10 months of no P1 anywhere in the state.         
	 The P1 virus  one of three serotypes of the wild polio virus  has returned despite intensive immunisation of children in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh with a new monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV) over the past two years. Indias health ministry had introduced mOPV about three years ago after studies had shown that it is a sharper and more effective tool against the polio virus than the trivalent OPV.         
	 Weve seen some great progress in recent months, but the appearance of P1 in UP is disappointing, said T. Jacob John, head of the India Expert Advisory Group, a panel that advises the government on how to conduct its war on polio.         
	The actual size of the resurgence  the total number of children infected  would be higher than 32, he said. Each case of polio indicates about 160 other susceptible, or unprotected, children infected, John said.         
	 Polio programme officials said the mOPV has performed very well and, as expected, better than the trivalent OPV. They said genetic studies on the virus circulating in Uttar Pradesh have shown that P1 slipped into the states Badaun district from Bihar.         
	 It is because of mOPV that the most endemic part of India  western UP  had been able to stop P1 transmission for more than 18 months, said Hamid Jafari, project manager of the National Polio Surveillance Project, a joint programme of the Indian government and the World Health Organisation.        
	 The P1 cases in Badaun reflect reduced frequency and increased interval between mOPV immunisation rounds in 2007 to tackle an outbreak of (polio caused by) P3, Jafari said.         
	This allowed an increase in (the number of) susceptible children in the young age group who had not receive sufficient doses of mOPV.         
	In a meeting in May this year, the IEAG had said that following intensive vaccination activities by the government in UP and Bihar during 2007 and 2008, the P1 strain of polio was on the verge of eradication from India.         
	Until June 2008, the NPSP had detected only four cases of P1 this year  one each in Bihar, Delhi, Orissa, and Bengal. And three districts in Utar Pradesh  Moradabad, Meerut, and Muzaffarnagar  dubbed by polio programme managers as the historical centre of P1 in India and the toughest place in the world to eradicate polio, had not reported P1 since November 2006.         
	The P1 circulation in UP can again be stopped by aggressive use of mOPV, while ensuring that P1 is also stopped in Bihar, Jafari said. The IEAG had cautioned earlier this year that P1 could be detected after several months. It P1 persists, the most likely period for its detection would be between July to November 2008, the IEAG had said, calling for intense surveillance.         
	 The mOPV has shown that P1 transmission can be stopped in its stronghold, said Nicholas Grassly, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College, London, who had published research to show that mOPV would be better than trivalent OPV.         
	There was no P1 transmission in western UP for 18 months, from November 2006 until June 2008. This had never been achieved before, Grassly told The Telegraph.         
	The national polio surveillance effort has detected 449 cases this year. The number of confirmed polio cases last year was 874.         
	 Genetic studies on polio virus strains have shown that virtually all of P1 in India originates in western Uttar Pradesh. Scientists in Mumbai looking for polio virus in sewage water have detected only a single P1 strain since the beginning of this year.         
	The sewage scan is intended to detect polio virus excreted by infected individuals in Mumbai, a city that attracts people from across the nation. In previous years, they used to detect P1 several times a year.         
	A decreased frequency of P1 in Mumbais sewage is an indicator of the progress the nation is making against polio, IEAG chairman John said.

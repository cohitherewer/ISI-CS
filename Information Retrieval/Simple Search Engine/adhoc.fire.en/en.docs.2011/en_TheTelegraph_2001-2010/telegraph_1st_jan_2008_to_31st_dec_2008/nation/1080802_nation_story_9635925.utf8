	Bhopal/Jaipur, Aug. 1: Madhya Pradesh police have registered a case against the Chhindwara-based Asaram Bapu ashram after two boys died there in three days, but the bereaved parents have given the ashram a clean chit.        
	Puja Manmodhe, mother of Vedant, 5, who died in his hostel bathroom, said: We do not rule out foul play, but we suspect its a conspiracy to defame Bapu. Father Krishna said: We dont want the authorities to do a post-mortem.        
	The Manmodhes, residents of Pune, said even if the ashram management was found guilty, they would not like any action.        
	The police case accused ashram director Om Prakash Prajapati and hostel warden Manohar Jaiswal of negligence that caused death.        
	On Wednesday, Mohan Yadav, father of the other dead boy, Ram Krishna, 4, too had given a clean chit to the ashram. He said some people were trying to defame Asaram, spiritual guru of Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani.        
	School doctor Lokesh Sharma said Vedant had probably risen early for a wash and slipped in the bathroom. He said the boys head was in a bucket of water.        
	Earlier this month, two students of a gurukul in Asarams Ahmedabad ashram were found dead in mysterious circumstances, sparking rioting between residents of the locality and Bapus devotees.        
	Puja said her daughter would continue to study at the ashram where she is a kindergarten student.        
	A post-mortem has failed to pinpoint why Ram Krishna died. State police chief S.K. Raut today sent a forensic expert from Bhopal to Chhindwara and said Asaram would be questioned if needed.        
	Demolition        
	Authorities in Rajasthans Mount Abu have demolished a building erected by Asarams eldest son Narayan Sai in Hetamji village. District collector Siddarth Mahajan said: The building was on government land. Second, the Supreme Court has banned any new constructions in Mount Abu.

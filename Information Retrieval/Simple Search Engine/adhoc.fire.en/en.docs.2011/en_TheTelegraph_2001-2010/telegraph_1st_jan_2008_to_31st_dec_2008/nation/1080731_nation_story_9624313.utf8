	Bhubaneswar, July 30: Students from as many as 45 engineering colleges under Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT) today demanded reintroduction of supplementary tests.        
	Students resorted to the protest path after talks with the administration, held last evening, failed to yield positive results.        
	A delegation of BPUT students discussed the mattter with Vice-Chancellor Omkarnath Mohanty and industries secretary Ashok Dalwai. Mohanty, however, ruled out the demand for supplementary exams.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 25: The economic meltdown seems to have little impact on Orissas industrialisation scenario.        
	Proposals submitted to the government for establishment of 15 industrial projects involving an investment of Rs 1.32 lakh crore were cleared by the high-level clearance authority, headed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today.        
	These projects included a mega steel plant, nine power plants, two alumina and aluminium units, said energy minister Surya Narayan Patro.        
	Navyung Steels Limited has proposed to set up a port-based 12MTPA steel complex at Astarang in Puri district at an estimated cost of Rs 34,000 crore. In power sector alone, investments to the tune of more than Rs 60,000 crore have been proposed to be made in nine projects, Patro said.        
	Earlier, 13 power companies had signed MoU with the government two years ago to set up thermal power plants. Eleven of these proposed projects have made some progress, he said. Of the nine power projects cleared today, the biggest one would be built by public sector power giant NTPC. A coal-based mega thermal plant with a capacity of 3,200MW would be set up by NTPC in Dhenkanal district at an estimated cost of Rs 19,840 crore.        
	Jindal Stainless Steel Limited will establish a 1,000MW independent power plant with an investment of Rs 4,090 crore in Dhenkanal district, while a new power firm Astarang Power Company Limited has intended to set up a 2,640MW coal-based power plant at an estimated cost of Rs 11,200 crore in Puri district.        
	Nalco has proposed to set up a 1,260MW captive power plant near its under-construction aluminium smelter at Brajarajnagr in Jharsuguda district.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The CPM today said the state departments answers to the US Congress had vindicated its stand on the nuclear deal and demanded that the government suspend all moves to activate the anti-national pact.        
	A politburo release said the document was kept secret because it would have completely exposed the UPA regimes false claims regarding the terms of the deal.        
	The party said the document showed that the US had given no binding assurance on fuel supply and that civil nuclear co-operation was linked to Delhi not testing a nuclear device again.         
	Each of the commitments Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made in Parliament had been violated, it added.         
	The government stands thoroughly exposed, the CPM said. Proceeding with this deal will make Indias civilian nuclear programme vulnerable to US blackmail for the next 40 years.

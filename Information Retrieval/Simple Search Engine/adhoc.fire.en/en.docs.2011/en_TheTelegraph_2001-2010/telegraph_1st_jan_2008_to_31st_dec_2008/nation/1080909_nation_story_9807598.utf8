The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Parties split on Kashmir elections
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Parties split on Kashmir elections
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The poll panels meeting with political parties today failed to throw up any pointer on the timing of the Jammu and Kashmir elections with each player expressing a different point of view.        
	Sources said the task of the Election Commission, plagued by differences within itself, had become tougher with some parties insisting the time was not right for elections, some pressing for timely polls and others refusing to take a stand.        
	The poll panel had decided to consult the parties after two election commissioners disagreed with their chief N. Gopalaswamis opinion that the elections, due in November, should be held on time.        
	At the meeting, the main Jammu and Kashmir players  the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference  argued that the ground situation was not conducive to elections.        
	The BJP thought otherwise, plumping for timely elections. The Congress refused to take a stand. The Left parties were divided among themselves, with the CPI wanting early polls and the CPM saying normality should be restored before elections were considered.        
	Sources said the Election Commission was now contemplating talks with the Union home secretary, defence secretary and the state chief secretary on the Jammu and Kashmir ground situation.        
	Giving their opinions one by one, the PDPs three-member team, led by general secretary Nizamuddin Bhatt, said there was total absence of the rule of law in the state and the atmosphere was so vitiated that free and fair elections were impossible.        
	The governments authority has been weakened. Peoples anger is very high. Election is now a non-issue. Any fiddling with the current situation will further dent the system, a PDP team member said.        
	The NC, which had indicated its approach would be different from the PDPs strident posturing, expressed somewhat similar views. It said the government should take corrective steps to restore normality first as a less than expected turnout would serve no purpose.        
	We told the commission that for holding elections the ground situation must be conducive. The atmosphere must be peaceful so that all sections of the people can take part in the polls, party chief Omar Abdullah said.        
	He dodged a direct reply when asked if his party would boycott elections if they were announced, saying the working committee would take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time.        
	We are not in favour of depriving people of their democratic rights. We are in favour of empowerment of people. Elections are not the solution to the Kashmir issue. Elections will solve only day-to-day problems. If elections are held now, there will be serious ramifications internationally, Abdullah said.        
	The BJP team, led by vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, stressed that elections would boost democratic activity in the state and enable mainstream parties to occupy the space hijacked by separatists. It felt that any delay would push the elections back by months as winter would set in.        
	The Congress delegation, comprising former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, PCC chief Saifuddin Soz and AICC general secretary Prithviraj Chavan, indicated it was not keen for early elections.        
	Bhim Singh of the Panthers Party said elections should not be held till delimitation of constituencies was done. Any election without delimitation would be illegal and unconstitutional, the party said in a six-page memorandum.        
	The poll panel also heard out the Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party, which do not have a single MLA in the state.        
	Mirwaiz no        
	The moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference today rejected polls, saying the democratic process had failed to resolve the Kashmir issue.        
	The Hurriyat Conference rejects elections. It is also not an issue of good or bad governance. The Kashmir issue cannot be resolved through polls, chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said in Srinagar.

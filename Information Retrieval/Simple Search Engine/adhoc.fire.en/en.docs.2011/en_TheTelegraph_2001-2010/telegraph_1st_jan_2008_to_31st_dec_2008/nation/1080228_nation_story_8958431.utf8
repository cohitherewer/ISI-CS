          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: India and Pakistan have agreed on a set of proposals for better treatment of each others prisoners.        
	The plan was finalised at the first meeting of the India-Pakistan joint judicial committee on prisoners yesterday.         
	To start with, the release of prisoners who have served their sentences will be speeded up and steps taken to ensure that the rights of those behind bars are not violated.        
	Consolidated lists, with details about prisoners and their cases, are likely to be exchanged by March 31.         
	Those who have completed their sentences and whose nationalities have been verified will be freed as soon as possible.         
	Special consideration, on compassionate and humanitarian grounds, will be given to women, juveniles and disabled prisoners so that they can go home early.        
	Fishermen whose nationalities have been confirmed will be released soon or given consular access  to help them get official sanction about their identities  by March 31.        
	The judicial committee, which meets again in April in Pakistan, will visit jails in that country, sources in the external affairs ministry said.         
	The Indians on the joint panel are former Bombay High Court Chief Justice K.R. Vyas, former Punjab and Haryana High Court judges Amarjit Choudhary and A.S. Gill, and former Delhi High Court judge M.A. Khan.        
	The decision to set up the panel was taken in early 2007. Pakistan handed the names of its members in February last year. India had done so a month later.        
	The government had told Parliament on November 29 last year that there were 518 Indians in Pakistani jails, most of them charged with illegal entry and maritime border violations.         
	The figure was 4,681 in jails of all Asian countries and 516 in the prisons of nations outside Asia.        
	The Supreme Court last week asked the Centre what it had done to bring back Gopal Dass, an Indian languishing in a Lahore jail for 22 years.        
	Despite a decision to release him, Dass isnt a free man yet because there has been no diplomatic initiative.

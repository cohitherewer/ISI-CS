          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 25: Orissa has achieved a spectacular fiscal turnaround. It has reduced its debt stock significantly, courtesy a World Bank-induced fiscal reform.         
	The states debt stock has gone down from Rs 37,249.51 crore in 2006-07 to Rs 35,875.58 crore in 2007-08, conceded finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei.         
	The net reduction in debt stock during the year was Rs 1,373.93 crore and the percentage of debt stock to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) has come down from 40.87 per cent in 2006-07 to 34.73 per cent in 2007-08, he added.         
	Similarly, the debt stock-revenue receipt ratio has come down from 206.57 per cent in 2006-07 to 164.53 per cent in 2007-08, said the finance minister.         
	Fiscal adjustment support on softer terms from the multi-lateral and bilateral aid agencies like World Bank and DFID were utilised by the state government for the retirement of costlier debt.         
	The government has also utilised a part of its own resources to repay the high-cost debt in order to lessen its interest burden and utilise the fiscal space created for development works.         
	The development cost has gone up to Rs 13,059.07 crore in 2007-08 crore from Rs 9,384.80 crore in 2006-07.         
	Capital outlay for creation of physical expenditure has been stepped up from the level of Rs 834.09 crore in 2000-01 to Rs 2,807.47 crore in 2007-08, said Ghadei. Revenue expenditure compression measures, including cutting down salary bill, have helped in arresting the rapid growth of unproductive revenue expenditure and creating fiscal space for development expenditure.         
	On the other hand, revenue augmentation ways such as introduction of entry, profession and value-added tax, rationalisation of stamp duty, coupled with modernisation of tax administration have helped improve the resource position.         
	It has been a long and arduous journey on the path of fiscal correction to reverse the trend of rising deficits and unsustainable debt stock, he admitted.         
	Our state took over an almost empty treasury, which could not pay for the daily government expenditure without resorting to ways and means advance and overdraft. But, we have not taken any overdraft or ways and means advance since December 2004, said a proud finance minister.

	Indore, Oct. 19 (PTI): Two Delhi Public School students were rounded up for allegedly sending a threat mail to the institution, police said today.        
	The boys  students of Class IX and X  have admitted they sent the mail in the name of the Indian Mujahideen, the police said.        
	Police sources said the two created an account that introduced them as Mr Mujahideen after a teacher scolded the Class IX student.         
	School authorities, who received the mail on October 4, panicked and called in the police and the bomb disposal squad, but a search of the campus yielded nothing.         
	The students were later released on bail, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley set for brother-sister battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Valley set for brother-sister battle
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Abdullah: Poll war                                  
	Srinagar, Nov. 9: Come December 24, it could be brother versus sister in the Valley.        
	Rivalries in the grand old political family of Kashmir that dominated discussions here in the pre-militancy days have returned to the states political landscape.        
	Now the stage is set for a contest between Farooq Abdullah and his sister Khalida.        
	In the eighties, a bitter power struggle in the family of National Conference founder Sheikh Abdullah had ripped the party apart and the tensions would often spill over to the streets.        
	At the centre of the struggle were Sheikh Abdullahs son Farooq and son-in-law Ghulam Muhammad Shah, both of whom served as chief ministers in those less troubled years.        
	After 1987, Shahs party entered a phase of near-wilderness. Now, 21 years on, the Awami National Conference (ANC) has decided to contest the Assembly polls.        
	The ANC will contest around 70 of the 87 seats in the state and the 82-year-old Shah is planning to field his wife, Farooqs sister Khalida, from Srinagars Sonawar constituency.        
	We have requested her (Khalida) to contest the polls but she has not given her consent so far, said Shahs son Muzaffar, who now looks after the ANC though his ailing father is officially still in charge.        
	Farooq has already been nominated National Conference candidate from Hazratbal but has expressed his desire to contest from Sonawar as well.        
	We have a democracy here and anybody is free to contest polls from anywhere, the National Conference patron said, asked to comment on the possibility of contesting against his sister.        
	Sonawar and Hazratbal both go to the polls on December 24, the last leg of the seven-phase Kashmir elections.         
	The ANC has lost most of its influence because of its self-imposed wilderness and may not be able to pose any challenge to the National Conference. But leaders of Farooqs party are worried it might cut into their votes to the advantage of rivals like the PDP.         
	Before his death in 1982, Sheikh Abdullah had nominated his son as his political heir in the face of stiff opposition from Shah.        
	Farooq took over the reins of the state but Shah hit back by splitting the party in 1984 and formed the government with Congress support. This led to months of disturbances in the state, which witnessed frequent curfews and strikes.        
	The friendly relations between Shah and the Congress did not, however, last long. In March 1986, the Congress withdrew support, leading to Presidents rule. In November that year, Farooq was reinstated as chief minister and won the elections in 1987 in alliance with the Congress.        
	After 1987, Shah took a back seat though he briefly flirted with separatism during the 1990s.         
	His relations with Farooq had already soured and the only time the two were seen together in public was when Sheikh Abdullahs wife Akbar Jehan passed away a few years ago.

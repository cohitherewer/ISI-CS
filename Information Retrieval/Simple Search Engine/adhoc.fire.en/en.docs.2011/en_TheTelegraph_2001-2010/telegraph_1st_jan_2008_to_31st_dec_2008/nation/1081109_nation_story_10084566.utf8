	Houston, Nov. 8 (PTI): Indian-American Democratic employment lawyer R.K. Sandill, who entered the Harris County judicial race, has become the first from the community to be elected a district judge in Texas.        
	Sandill won the election on Tuesday, receiving a total of 554,482 votes, defeating incumbent Republican judge Sharlyn Wood.        
	However, another Indian-American candidate Ashish Mahendru, who had contested on the Democratic ticket for the judicial race, lost to Sharon McCally in the 334th judicial district race. McCally received 563,517 votes and Mahendru 532,135 votes.        
	The district court normally handles matters like personal injury, medical malpractice, commercial disputes, state constitutional issues, temporary restraining orders, eminent domain cases, tax cases and collection.        
	Sandill is an associate attorney with Steele Sturm PLLC in Houston.         
	He had worked in the Bill Clinton administration as a member of the Presidents and the First Ladys advance teams.        
	Despite the Democratic sweep in the Harris County judicial races, Indian-born Mahendru, 37, fell little short.         
	Mahendru attended University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 1993 and later attended the University of Texas School of Law.        
	He has authored articles on the subject of guardians ad litem and the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act. He lives with his wife, Sameera Kapasi Mahendru, an assistant city attorney and their two sons.

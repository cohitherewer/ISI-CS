     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: An extra-marital affair cannot be a ground for dismissal from ones job, Bombay High Court has ruled.
    
	A bench of two women judges yesterday set aside a zilla parishad order dismissing a married village schoolteacher on the alleged ground that she had committed adultery with a colleague.
    
	Justices Rajana Desai and Roshan Dalvi termed the order strange, shocking and discriminatory, citing that the zilla parishad had not acted against the male employee.
    
	The court further said that such a dismissal could stigmatise a womans career, her lawyer Uday Warunjikar said.
    
	The 34-year-old teacher had joined an anganwadi school  a state-run playschool for pre-kindergarten children  in Taldeo village, Satara district, in 2001. She was sacked in November 2005 for having an illicit affair.
    
	In December 2005, the woman petitioned the high court alleging the zilla parishad had neither conducted an inquiry nor given her a chance to be heard. She denied having an affair and cited certificates from the tehsil authorities to argue she was good at her job.
    
	S.D. Shedge, the child development project officer and the man behind the sack, defended the Satara zilla parishad order. She has committed sexual offence and extra-marital relation and such a lady cannot be allowed to continue as anganwadi assistant. (since it could have had) a bad effect on the character of the children, his court affidavit said.

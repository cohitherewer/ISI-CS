  - Patients going in for timely surgery have higher survival rates: Study          G.S. MUDUR                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Delays in heart bypass surgeries may raise the risk of patients dying after the operation even before being discharged from hospital, said a medical study released on Friday.         
	Researchers in Vancouver, Canada, who tracked the fates of 7,316 patients who had undergone heart bypass operations, have found that patients with early surgery had higher survival rates than those with delayed surgery.         
	Even after doctors have diagnosed severe heart disease and recommended bypass surgery, delays may occur if patients are placed in a queue or if patients themselves opt to postpone the operation for various reasons.         
	Although doctors have long observed that early bypass surgery translates into higher survival rates, researchers have until now made no direct estimates of the likely benefits of heart bypass surgery when performed in time.         
	Now, researchers at the University of British Columbia and neighbouring hospitals have found that the proportion of patients who had died after their operations before discharge was 1 per cent among patients treated within the recommended time, and 1.5 per cent among patients whose surgeries had been delayed. The findings were published on Friday in the journal BMC Health Services Research.         
	Our findings suggest a significant survival benefit from performing surgery within the time deemed acceptable by consultant surgeons, said Boris Sobolev, professor at the University of British Columbia.         
	Indian cardiologists said the new findings could be used by doctors in India to influence patients who sometimes tend to delay surgery even though a bypass is recommended only in cases of severe heart disease.         
	This result is pertinent to India because some patients try to avoid surgery, said Zile Singh Meharwal, director of cardiac surgery at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre.         
	There is no national database to indicate the number of heart bypass surgeries performed each year in India, but cardiac surgeons estimate that the number would be more than 40,000.         
	Weve seen patients who seek multiple opinions or try drug treatment, but end up only delaying the surgery, said Balbir Singh, a senior consultant cardiologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi.         
	Sometimes diagnosis of heart disease itself is delayed, but even after diagnosis, patients delay things. In my experience, about two in 10 patients, particularly those without symptoms, are likely to delay surgery, Meharwal told The Telegraph.         
	Doctors say heart disease involving the left main artery is among conditions in which they do not recommend waiting even one day for the surgery. Patients who have heart disease with angina pain even at rest are also advised early surgery.         
	But there are conditions labelled semi-urgent when surgery can wait for up to six weeks, and non-urgent when it can wait up to 12 weeks.         
	In the Canadian study, Sobolev and his colleagues labelled surgery early if performed before the recommended six-week or 12-week period, and late if it was done after that.         
	They observed 27 in-hospital deaths among 2,675 patients who had early surgery and 70 deaths among 4,641 patients who had late surgery.         
	While patients are waiting for surgery, their heart functions may deteriorate. And compromised heart function is among the most important factors that influence mortality after surgery, said Singh.

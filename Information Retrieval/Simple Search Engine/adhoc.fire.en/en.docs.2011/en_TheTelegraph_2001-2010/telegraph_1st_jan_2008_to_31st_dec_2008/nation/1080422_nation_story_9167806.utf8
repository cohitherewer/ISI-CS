          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 21: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today defended his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, who drew BJPs flak for the non-inclusion or the exclusion of BJP MLAs in the recently shuffled council of ministers.         
	Why is Modi being blamed? This is a coalition government and according to the coalition dharma, I abided by a list furnished by the BJPs central leadership while making the inclusion or the exclusion. The moves were based on consent, said the chief minister.         
	Nitish Kumars remarks have given a new twist to the turmoil, as 12 BJP MLAs have been vociferously targeting Modi so far, holding him responsible for the exclusion of certain performers or inclusion of certain non-performers in the council.         
	The rebel MLAs have gone to the extent of demanding Modis resignation as the BJP legislature party leader and as the deputy chief minister.         
	We will not settle for anything less than Modis removal. As a Bihar legislature leader, he has made the party his pocket borough and operates it like a dictator, said BJP MLA Awanish Kumar. MLA Nityanand Rai echoed Awanish Kumars sentiments.         
	Though Modi must have felt a momentary relief by Nitishs defence, he has been severely affected by the studied silence being maintained by the BJP central leadership regarding the issue.         
	Sources reveal that Modi got the list of probable ministers approved by party president Rajnath Singh before the swearing-in ceremony on April 13.         
	The ceremonies got delayed and was stretched till late evening because Modi had been unable to contact Rajnath Singh on that day. It took place only after Rajnath Singh approved the list, said a top source.         
	Now, Modi supporters are perplexed as to why the leadership is not clearing the air.         
	Though party high command has called party leaders Kailashpati Mishra, Kalraj Mishra and Radhamohan Singh to douse the dissent fire in Bihar, it has so far resisted itself from making a more pronounced announcement.        
	Modis supporters believe that with the chief minister speaking out today, the central BJP leadership, too, may come in Modis defence. The party leadership must understand that the tirade against the party leader by the MLAs will affect the prospect of the party in the election year, said a Modi supporter.         
	Nitish Kumar, however, sounded confident while talking to the media. The cabinet reshuffle in any state causes some sort of turmoil as some people are left out and others are included. But, a turmoil is ephemeral and things will have to settle down soon enough.         
	The chief minister had dropped 10 ministers, including two from the BJP, and had included 19 new faces in his ministry in the revamp that he executed on April 13, setting off a rebellion in the NDA rank.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Army wants pay review
                                                                                                               Army wants pay review
          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, March 25: The armed forces are likely to plead with the government for an upward revision of the salaries recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission.         
	The service chiefs have asked for an analysis of the pay panels recommendations before a formal plea is made. But even before that study, the mood in defence headquarters the day after the commissions report was submitted was a feeling of being short-changed, to quote more than one officer.         
	We knew that our proposals would not be accepted in toto but this is really looking dismal as a soldier moves up the scale, a major general said. The overwhelming sentiment is that the pay commission recommendations make entry-level salaries for officers more attractive but that pales as an officer moves up.         
	There is little we can do but remind the defence minister of his assurances. We cannot resort to trade union action of the kind you might see in civilian sectors, the officer said.         
	The armed forces feel that the creation of two pay bands for officers gives the illusion that salaries are more attractive. Officers of the rank of lieutenant (and equivalent) to brigadier (and equivalent) have been put on a pay band of Rs 15,600-39,100 a month (basic) plus a monthly military service pay of Rs 6,000.         
	Take my example, a brigadier said. It has taken me 34 years of service to get where I have. There are so many like me serving in field stations in the (Kashmir) Valley and in the Northeast. But the most I am eligible for under the new pay commission is a basic of Rs 39,100.         
	The major general pointed out that the pay band of Rs 39,200-67,000 for major generals and lieutenant generals was also misleading.         
	A major general serves in his rank for a maximum of three years after which he is either selected for promotion to the rank of lieutenant general or has to retire.         
	Army officers say officials of the rank of joint secretary in the bureaucracy do not have to retire as early as a major general. They say both are equivalent ranks. There is no military service pay for general rank officers.         
	Personnel below the officer rank, too, are disappointed. A subedar major  the highest rank to which a jawan can rise unless commissioned as an officer  would earn a military service pay  an allowance  of Rs 1,000 a month after about 26 years of service.         
	In their proposals, the armed forces had sought officer-level pay scales starting from Rs 24,000-900-26,700 to Rs 100,000-5,000-11,500 (for the chiefs). The pay commission has recommended scales starting from Rs 15,600-39,100 to Rs 90,000 (fixed).

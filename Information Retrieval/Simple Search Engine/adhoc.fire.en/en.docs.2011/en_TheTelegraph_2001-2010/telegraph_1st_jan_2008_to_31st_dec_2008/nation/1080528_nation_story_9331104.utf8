                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian killed in Poland

	New Delhi/Calcutta, May 27: Santo Sinha had tried to stop her daughter from going to Poland with her husband, but failed. Now he has had to visit the country himself to receive his daughter Jonakis dead body  and bring his 3-year-old granddaughter home.        
	Jonaki Sinha Plesniak, 27, was murdered earlier this month. Police in Krakow arrested her husband Maciej Plesniak and charged him with the killing.        
	Jonaki, who had wanted to be a singer, had been reported missing since May 16. Six days later, the police found her body in a compound attached to a house in Wieliczka near Krakow.        
	Sources in the Indian mission in Warsaw said investigators ascertained the cause of her death to be a blow to the head with a heavy object.         
	Plesniak is said to have confessed to killing Jonaki, his wife of four years, during intense questioning.         
	Her family, which is originally from Guwahati and has been living at Baguiati in Calcutta for some years, had informed the Indian embassy that she was missing.         
	The embassy immediately got in touch with the police authorities and Indian nationals based in Krakow. The same day, the embassy also formally took up the matter with the ministry of foreign affairs in Warsaw and sent a note to the police station in Krakow seeking assistance in tracing Jonaki, Srikumar Menon, an embassy official, told The Telegraph.        
	Menon added that Jonakis parents had reached Krakow to take custody of her body.         
	Santo and Ila Sinhas eldest daughter, Sharmila, who lives in England, has also reached Poland. A.K. Roy, a neighbour and family friend, said the couple left last Friday en route to Poland once they learnt Jonaki was missing after calling their son-in-law.        
	He was not being able to contact his daughter for a few days. A week ago, he called up his son-in-law who told him that Jonaki was missing. It was then that the couple grew suspicious and decided to leave for Poland, Roy said.        
	Roy recalled that Jonaki had come to Calcutta and stayed in the family house with her husband and daughter about six months ago. They looked happily married, he said.        
	Jonaki met her husband in New York while she was studying computer applications, though it was singing which was her passion.        
	When Jonaki was expecting she had come away to India and lived with her parents in India where her daughter was born and she even took up a job in Calcutta.         
	After long separation, Plesniak wanted to take her and their daughter with him, to which Jonaki agreed against her familys wishes.        
	They first settled in England where the Pole got a job. They left for Poland a few months ago when his contract ran out.        
	 Jonakis family had tried without success to persuade her not to accompany him to Poland.

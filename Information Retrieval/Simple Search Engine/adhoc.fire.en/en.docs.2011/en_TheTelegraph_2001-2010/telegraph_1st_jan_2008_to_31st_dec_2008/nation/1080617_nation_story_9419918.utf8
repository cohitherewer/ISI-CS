          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              (Above) The shoveller. A whistling duck that travels to Orissa in the winter                    
	Sambalpur, June 16: Much to the delight of wildlife officers, hordes of migratory birds that visit Hirakud reservoir every winter stayed back for two extra months this year.         
	More than 50,000 birds from as far as Siberia and Himalayas come down to Hirakud reservoir every winter and stay on for four months till the end of February. Usually, they are back home by the first week of March.         
	But this year a number of birds stayed there till mid- May, said P.K. Jha, the divisional forest officer of the wildlife division of Sambalpur.         
	This is a new development and we are yet to ascertain the cause behind this extension in the birds stay. But we are delighted that they kept on staying for two extra months, said Jha.        
	Unlike Chilika, Hirakud does not have ornithologists coming in to study the behaviour of the winged guests. Hence, the behavioural change is still a mystery to the experts.         
	When contacted, the life science and environment science department officials in Sambalpur University said that they do not conduct studies on migratory birds. But the phenomenon has managed to make a few observers curious.         
	Till the time a reason is found, experts would like to believe that safe living conditions and abundant supply of food offered by the Orissa holiday home have spurred the extension in their stay.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Metro thumbs down to Rs 5000-bill plan
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry has ruled out the Forward Blocs proposed condition that each customers bill at its EM Bypass outlet must be at least Rs 5,000 for every single item.        
	The company has made it clear to state government officials that it would not accept any condition that goes against its business model.         
	Metros tough talk comes a day after Ratan Tata decided to leave Bengal in the face of protests led by Mamata Banerjee. The German firm, too, has been facing opposition, but from a CPM ally  the Forward Bloc.         
	The state agriculture marketing board, led by Bloc leader Naren Chatterjee, is supposed to issue the agri-produce marketing committee licence to Metro by October 10 following a consensus reached at a Left Front meeting last Sunday.         
	The front had ruled that the Bloc and the CPM would mutually agree on certain conditions to safeguard the interests of small businesses.         
	A Metro spokesperson confirmed that company representatives had met government officials but declined to give details. We will continue our discussion, he said.         
	Secretary to the chief minister Subesh Das and Chatterjee were present at the meeting held at Writers Buildings.         
	Government sources said the Metro team agreed to accept only two conditions. The company has categorically said it would agree not to venture into retail business and contract farming. But it wont accept anything more, a source said.         
	Metro has four stores in India, where the minimum bill amount must be Rs 1,000, but not for a single item. The company officials told the government it would not be possible to change this business model for the Calcutta store.         
	The company argued that only a handful of people would buy a single item worth Rs 5,000.         
	Metro said its business model allows small stores to buy in small quantities. So, they dont have to spend a huge sum of money at one go. This helps kirana stores, a source said.         
	Metro had taken its legal head to the meeting, who explained that the minimum-bill condition was not tenable under the agriculture produce marketing committee act.        
	If the Bloc does not budge from its stand, the company would have to act firm as well. It has already made a veiled threat to pull out two weeks ago.         
	Chatterjee said the meeting was held on the chief ministers instruction.         
	Todays discussions followed the Left Front decision to find ways to protect retail business without affecting wholesale agri-businesses. More discussions are possible before October 10  the deadline for renewal or fresh issuance of licence to Metro Cash amp; Carry. A final decision will be taken in the presence of the chief minister, the agri-marketing board chairman said.         
	Asked if the conditions to be imposed on Metro were discussed, Chatterjee said: Since we havent finalised the conditions that are to be set, I cant comment on that.                    WITH INPUTS FROM OUR BUREAU

	Calcutta, Nov. 12: Singur will have to wait at least a year for a new investor, Bengal industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.        
	He said the government expected Tata Motors to take a year to dismantle the Nano factory. We have told Faw Corporation of China, which has expressed interest in setting up an automobile plant in Bengal, about this, he added.        
	Chemical hub        
	The Union ministry of chemical and fertilisers has approved a plan to build a chemical hub on Nayachar island, off Haldia. Sen said the ministry had sent the states proposal to a high-power committee chaired by the cabinet secretary.

  - Capital residents to take on civic body        OUR CORRESPONDENT                           A road in the residential area filled with muddy rainwater. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                        
	Bhubaneswar, June 10: It is said, a picture speaks a thousand words. Now, they will represent thousand complaints.        
	Shahid Nagar Residents Welfare Association has taken the clich literally and plans to bring it to practical use to get the roads in the neighbourhood repaired.         
	Irked by the inaction of the Bhubaneswar civic body, Shahid Nagar residents have decided to send photographs of the broken and crumbling roads in the neighbourhood to Bhubaneswar Municipality Council authorities every fortnight as reminder.        
	It will be a photo reminder from now on, said association president B.K. Tripathy, who happens to be a retired inspector-general of police.         
	Despite being called a posh area and being situated in the heart of the city, Shahid Nagar is in a dismal state, said Benudhar Mohanty, a resident of the area.         
	The condition of roads is deteriorating with each passing day and with the arrival of the monsoon, residents believe, a new nightmare is set to start.         
	Potholes and roads dug on either side is a common sight. With the advent of monsoon, drains would soon flood the roads.         
	The residents of the area, including doctors, lawyers, academicians and teachers, last week planned this silent protest.         
	Around 10 per cent of the residents in the area are senior citizens and are afraid of using the streets at night on rainy days         
	Each time we complaint, BMC officials give us readymade answers and assurances. This time around, we have decided to say it through pictures. On a Sunday of the month from now on we will be sending a photograph showing the wretched condition of the roads to the BMC reminding them of their assurances, said the association secretary H. Balakrishnan.        
	For the past few years the residents of the area had been drawing the civic bodys attention towards the dismal condition of 20 roads passing through Shahid Nagar, but have failed to make a change each time.         
	The issue had been brought to the notice of the authorities through different means every month.         
	The lanes and by-lanes in this area look no better than a slum and soon after a drizzle muddy water starts flooding the streets everywhere. We already have photographs to show the plight and if needed we will be taking more, Balakrishnan summed up.

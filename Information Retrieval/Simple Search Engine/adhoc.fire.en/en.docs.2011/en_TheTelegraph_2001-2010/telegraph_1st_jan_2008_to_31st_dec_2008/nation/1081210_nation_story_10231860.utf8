          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The rural development ministry has proposed a course on security operations for village youth keeping in mind the increasing number of terror attacks in the country, the last being in Mumbai.         
	About 50,000 rural youth from different parts of the country will get hands-on training to use security and surveillance gadgets.        
	They will also be trained to handle sniffer dogs.         
	The Private Security Agencies Regulation Act, 2005, makes it mandatory for personnel to have at least 160 hours training in security duties.         
	The proposed course is expected to be introduced through universities. We have discussed the idea with the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) which already runs a programme and has agreed to the proposal, a ministry official said.         
	Apart from improving the security climate in the country, the proposed course will also offer job opportunities to the rural youth, the official added. Those who complete the course will get a diploma and a certificate in security operation.         
	After the Mumbai attacks, the demand for private security personnel has gone up in restaurants, hospitals, malls and multiplexes. There were reports that security agencies were finding it difficult to get enough hands.         
	Assocham had predicted that the private security business in the country would become a Rs 50,000-crore industry in the next four years.         
	The rural development ministry is of the view that a university-based training programme would be more effective and systematic than private training. These courses will greatly improve the level of professionalism among security professionals, said the ministry official. The course will be short-term and will start from February, he added. The educational and physical criteria for selecting the candidates is yet to be finalised.         
	The Security Services Council of India will provide the technical support and skill development while IGNOU will design the course and take care of the academic aspects.

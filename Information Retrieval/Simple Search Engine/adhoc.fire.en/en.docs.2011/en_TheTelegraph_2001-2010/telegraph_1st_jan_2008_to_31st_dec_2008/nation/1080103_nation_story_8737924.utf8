          JOHN MARY                          Antony: Stranded                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 2: Defence minister A.K. Antony was among a group of passengers stranded at the airport here today after their Delhi-bound Indian flight was delayed by one-and-a-half hours allegedly because of overbooking.        
	The reason for the delay, according to Indian officials, was a technical snag. But sources said the flight was overbooked and boarding passes were issued in excess of available seats.         
	Some of the passengers had to be offloaded, after which Flight IC 168, scheduled to take off at 2.55pm, left at 4.35pm.        
	Offloading and overbooking are a routine affair with Gulf-bound flights. Airline sources attributed todays incident to the post-Christmas and New Year rush.         
	Antony was here for an event to mark the takeover of Kerala Hi-Tech Industries by the Defence Research and Development Organisation. It has formed a new company called BrahMos Aerospace (Thiruvananthapuram) Ltd.        
	The defence minister is entitled to use helicopters or the AN-32 military aircraft for official purposes. But Antony uses service aircraft only when he visits troops in areas like Siachen. The delay at Thiruvananthapuram airport might, however, prompt a rethink on his part.         
	Yesterday, another VIP got a taste of an airlines sloppy service.        
	Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had to wait more than six hours at the Nedumbassery airport on New Years Day when the crew of the Sharjah-bound Air India Express struck work.        
	Eighty-five passengers, including the minister, had boarded Air India Express 457, which flies from Kochi to Sharjah via Thiruvananthapuram. But the crew, saying their duty hours were over, refused to operate the 10.45am flight. They cited the duty time limitation guidelines of the directorate-general of civil aviation to make their point.        
	Balakrishnan was stuck in the plane for more than an hour before he was requested to return to the lounge. He contacted the Air India airport manager and gave him a piece of his mind.        
	The flight left at 5pm.

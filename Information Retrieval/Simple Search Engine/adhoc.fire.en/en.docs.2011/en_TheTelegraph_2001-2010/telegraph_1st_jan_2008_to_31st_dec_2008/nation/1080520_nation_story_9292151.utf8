          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 19: Several men and women from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh nursing dreams to make it big in the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examinations have effectively shattered the must-know-English myth writing their papers in Hindi.        
	This year, a larger number of students writing their papers in Hindi have made it through the IAS, IPS and IRS examinations.         
	The director of Nirman IAS (a coaching institute), Kamal Dev, told The Telegraph from New Delhi: Though I do not have the complete figures, 40 students succeeded despite writing their papers in Hindi from this institute. They also made it to the top 50 of the list.         
	Of the 50 students, Dev added, 12 are from Bihar.         
	Neelima of Saharsa district (Bihar) ranked 23rd in India and topped among girls. Neelima chose geography and Hindi as her main subjects. She did excellently, said Dev.        
	Students from Bihar, he said, not only know their language, but they comprehend it better to form incisive expressions and put ideas across succinctly  a necessary trait in any personal interview.         
	For example, a student coined Vikashil Vikshit (developing-developed) to define the present state of the Indian economy, as he understood it.        
	The director of Nirman IAS said he took the challenge to prepare Hindi-medium students to prove a point.         
	I cleared my UPSC written tests twice and through Hindi-medium. But I could not make it finally, said Dev, popularly known as KD among his students and peers. He said a part of the process was shedding clichs and old Hindi phrases.         
	My students stressed on the power of their mother tongue. Hindi can be as incisive, precise and powerful as any language, said KD with pride.         
	Amit Kumar, hailing from Hilsa (Nalanda district of Bihar), said: I ranked 89 in the civil services examination while answering my tests in Hindi. I dont think the choice of my language hampered my chances in the UPSC in any way.        
	Ranjit Kumar from Buxar is yet another example, with Ram Krishna Kedia, again from Bihar, who grabbed the 377th rank. For no, its hail Hindi from the state.

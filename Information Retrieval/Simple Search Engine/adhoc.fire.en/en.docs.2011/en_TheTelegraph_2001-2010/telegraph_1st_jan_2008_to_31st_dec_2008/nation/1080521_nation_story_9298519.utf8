	New Delhi, May 20: The investigation in Noida schoolgirl Aarushi Talwars murder today appeared to focus on her father, but police refused to confirm anything.        
	Sources, however, said the cellphone records of the murdered 15-year-old and her dentist parents had thrown up a few leads.        
	They said Rajesh Talwar  whose patients include top politicians, former policemen and bureaucrats  had in the past one month spoken 197 times over the phone to a woman friend, who is a doctor.        
	Rajesh allegedly made six calls to this woman on Thursday, the day of the murder. The Talwars driver, Umesh, says Rajesh didnt go to his clinic that day.        
	The call details also suggest Aarushi  of whom a poster put up by her friends at her memorial says Everything about her was the best... she was just too perfect  didnt have a perfect social life, the sources said.        
	She would apparently receive text messages from people and, immediately afterwards, call them. Officers have questioned all these people but would not say who they are.        
	Relatives and friends, however, vouch for the quiet girl. Her friendly nature is evident in her profile and scraps on Orkut where she wrote she loved hanging out with friends and going to school.        
	She had the usual teen discussions with her friends on her scraps  about dating and breaking up.        
	The sources said the parents had gifted Aarushi a camera hours before her death. It had arrived by courier.        
	Rajesh and his wife were grilled till 2am today. Later, police searched and sealed their garage from where they operated a clinic not too long ago. One of the things the police want to know is why the parents had hastily got rid of the girls blood-soaked mattress. Driver Umesh said he and the clinic manager, Vikas, had carried it to the terrace and left it there.

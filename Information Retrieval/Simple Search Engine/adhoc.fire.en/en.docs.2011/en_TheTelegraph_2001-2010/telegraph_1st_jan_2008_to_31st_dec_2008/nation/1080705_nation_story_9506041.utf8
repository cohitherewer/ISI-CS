	Patna, July 4: The Bihar excise department today busted two hooch manufacturing units allegedly run by a kin of the ruling JD(U) MP and partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Prabhunath Singh.         
	Officials also arrested four in this connection. Sources in the department revealed that Rajkumar Singh, the son-in-law of Prabhunath Singh, owned the two illegal liquor establishments in Mukera village under Ribilganj police station under north Bihars Maharajganj Lok Sabha constituency  which Prabhunath Singh represents.         
	The party, led by state excise commissioner N. Vijaylaxmi, seized 8,000 litres of hooch, spirit and chemicals used to prepare the hooch, with thousands of empty and full bottles.         
	In 2005, the excise department had cancelled licences of two liquor-manufacturing establishments run by Rajkumar after chancing upon irregularities in the business. But, the owner ran the establishment using political clout.         
	Sources maintained that it was for the first time that the department laid hands on the kin of a powerful politician, known for his muscle power.         
	All four arrested by sleuths were employees of the illegal factory, while Rajkumar and his family evaded arrest. Prabhunath also faces over two dozen cases, including murder, kidnapping and extortion charges.

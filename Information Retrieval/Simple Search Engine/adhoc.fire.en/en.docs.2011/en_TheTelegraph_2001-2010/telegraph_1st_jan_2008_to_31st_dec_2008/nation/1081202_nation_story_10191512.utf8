                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Quitting leaders earn Nitish flak
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish: Tough talk                                  
	Patna, Dec. 1: The series of resignation of UPA ministers in less than 24 hours since yesterday following the terrorist attack in Mumbai has drawn flak from Nitish Kumar.        
	Resignation at this juncture is no solution. It is time to act in unison and put in place solid policy and execution to meet the menace of terrorism, Nitish said, adding: It is also the time to keep the morale of people high.        
	The Bihar chief minister said that the Centre should convene a meeting of all chief ministers and all political parties time and again to arrive at a consensus on the policy decisions it intends to take on terrorism. One meeting will not do, for the challenge is grave and enormous in proportion.        
	Nitish pointed out that long ago he had demanded action on the fissiparous forces in Maharashtra assaulting the people of Hindi heartland in that state to foment regional sentiment. But neither the Union government nor the Maharashtra government acted on my call.        
	The chief minister said that the situation was worsening because of the weakness on the part of the central government to act in a proper manner.         
	He pointed out that the people perceive the countrys Prime Minister as their leader.         
	But two power centres has emerged at Delhi giving the impression that the Prime Minister is weak which is not good for the political system, Nitish said without referring the names of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.        
	Nitish also said that the formation of a national federal agency to check terrorism would be tantamount to interference in the state subjects. But the Centre should go ahead forming it if it feels its formation necessary to curb terror strikes, he said, adding: The Centre must discuss these things with all the political parties and chief ministers.        
	He also flayed army officers, policemen and other members of the security agencies speaking on TV channels.

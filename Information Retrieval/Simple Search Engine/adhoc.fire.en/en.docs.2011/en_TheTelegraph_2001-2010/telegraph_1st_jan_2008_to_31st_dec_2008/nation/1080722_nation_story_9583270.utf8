	New Delhi, July 21 (PTI): A proposal to ban free sale of acid, because it is often used in attacks, has not found favour with states, the Centre informed the Supreme Court today.        
	The Centre, asked to consider a Bangladesh-like law to restrict acid sales to ensure it wasnt used to attack people, said the curbs would not be practical and would lead to inspector raj.        
	The states representatives were almost unanimous against the proposed ban for the reason that the same is not practicable since acid is needed for many purposes. Similarly, licensing its sale was also opposed on the grounds that it could lead to inspector raj, the Centre said.        
	However, most states have favoured strengthening the provisions of the IPC to minimise attacks with acid.

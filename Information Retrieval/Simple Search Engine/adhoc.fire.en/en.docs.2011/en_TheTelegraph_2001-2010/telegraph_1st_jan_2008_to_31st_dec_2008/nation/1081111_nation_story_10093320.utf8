The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scarlett fear hits German rape case
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Scarlett fear hits German rape case
                            
	Panaji, Nov. 10 (PTI): A German woman who accused a Goa ministers son of raping her daughter and later withdrew the complaint has said life had become hell since she went to police.        
	She said she had dropped the charge because she was afraid her 14-year-old daughter might become Scarlett Two, a reference to the British teenager found dead on Goas Anjuna Beach in February.        
	Since the day I filed the complaint on October 14, life has become hell for both me and my daughter. There are allegations and counter-allegations in the media and we have now realised that we have been trapped in a situation (that is) not in our interest. We are also scared of being Scarlett Two, she said in a letter to the authorities yesterday.        
	In the letter, she sought to withdraw her complaint against Rohit, the 21-year-old son of Goa education minister Atanasio Monserratte. The police had arrested Rohit almost a month after the complaint was lodged. The Goa childrens court today granted Rohit conditional bail.        
	We have learnt the bitter truth, that making genuine complaints against the rich and mighty is entirely counter-productive. We are constantly hounded, our names sullied, campaigns organised against us and all sorts of motives attributed to us, the letter said.        
	She added that the victim had been treated like an accused. We are unable to lead (a) normal life and even our lives are at stake. We are crushed under the weight of the rich and mighty and are strangers unable to beat the system.        
	At the childrens court, Rohit said: I have not done anything. Rohit has to report to Calangute police for the next three days.

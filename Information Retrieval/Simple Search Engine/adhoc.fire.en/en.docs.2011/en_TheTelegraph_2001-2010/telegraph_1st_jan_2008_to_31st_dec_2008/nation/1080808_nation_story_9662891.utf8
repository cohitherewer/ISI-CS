          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Monika                                   
	Imphal, Aug. 7: Manipur today erupted over weightlifter Monika Devis shock exit from the Olympics squad, with its government, Opposition and people uniting to dub her failed drugs test a conspiracy.        
	Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh rushed sports minister N. Biren Singh to Delhi with letters of protest this morning while the powerful United Committee, Manipur, started a 33-hour state-wide strike from 10am.         
	Ordinary people, sportsmen and sport officials protested on the streets and the Khuman Lampak Stadium, where they burnt effigies of the man they held culpable: R.K. Naidu, the director (teams) of the Sports Authority of India.        
	The Manipur Olympic Association (MOA) accused Naidu of conspiring to replace Monika with P. Shaleja, a lifter from Andhra Pradesh.        
	Biren carried the chief ministers letters, which demanded steps to clear doubts over Monikas dope test, to Union sports minister M.S. Gill and the minister for Northeast, Prithviraj Chavan.        
	We do not believe in the test result and will seek justice, Ibobi said here.        
	Monika had tested positive on Tuesday and was dropped from Indias squad for Beijing. The United Committee labelled the results as an attempt by mainland India to suppress Manipuris and demanded another test.        
	If the wrong is not corrected, it will weaken the countrys unity, Opposition Manipur Peoples Party chief L. Chandramani Singh said.        
	Officials of the MOA, Manipur Weightlifting Association, athletes and volunteers from the All-Manipur Anti-Drug Association protested at the stadium. We will be compelled to resort to violence unless the injustice is corrected, MOA executive member S. Indrakumar said. MOA secretary B.C. Singh faxed a request to the Union sports ministry and the Indian Olympic Association asking Monika be allowed to go to Beijing.        
	The protesters marched towards the chief ministers office but ran into a wall of police, who fired tear gas, burst stun bombs and wielded their sticks on the sportsmen and sportswomen. Five girls were injured. Finally, a smaller team was allowed to meet Ibobi, who reassured them his government had taken the matter up with Delhi.

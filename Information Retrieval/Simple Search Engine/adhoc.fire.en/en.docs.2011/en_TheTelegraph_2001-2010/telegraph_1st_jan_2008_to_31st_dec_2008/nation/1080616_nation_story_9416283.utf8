          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, June 15: The Bihar government has cut down VAT on LPG cylinders by 3 per cent, making the commodity cheaper by Rs 10 in a bid to provide some sort of cushion to the consumers against the Centres price hike by Rs 50 per cylinder.         
	A notification issued by the commercial taxes department said that the applicable VAT on LPG cylinders had been reduced to 1 per cent from the earlier 4 per cent.         
	The Andhra Pradesh government, too, reduced the LPG cylinders rate by Rs 50.        
	While the Delhi government reduced the same by Rs 40, virtually neutralising the impact of the Centre-sponsored hike.         
	Neighbouring Jharkhand, too, has reduced the price of the LPG cylinder by Rs 40.         
	Each cylinder would cost Rs 343.25 from Monday in the wake of the commercial tax departments notification.

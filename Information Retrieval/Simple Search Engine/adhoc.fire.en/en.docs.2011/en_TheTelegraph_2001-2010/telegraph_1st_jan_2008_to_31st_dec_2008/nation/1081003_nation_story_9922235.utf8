          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The CPM and the CPI are yet to seal alliances in two key southern states in their hunt for a non-Congress, non-BJP coalition for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	In Tamil Nadu, there are signs that the communists are preparing for life without ruling ally DMK.         
	The rift in the ties, strained since the Left withdrew support to the UPA over the nuclear deal, deepened after CPM state secretary N. Varadarajan warned last week that the DMK would also sink if it stayed with the Congress.        
	DMK chief M. Karunanidhi reacted with derision, writing in party mouthpiece Murasoli that the Lefts veil of intrigue had come off.        
	Some Left leaders in the state favour exploring a tie-up with Jayalalithaa, but the central leaders want a guarantee she would have no truck with the BJP.        
	In Andhra Pradesh, the CPM wants to stay with the Telugu Desam given Chandrababu Naidus efforts at setting up a third front. Some state Left leaders are keen on Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam but the central leaders think it is untested.         
	A tie-up is possible also with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, whose boss Chandrasekhar Rao met the state CPM secretary on Tuesday.

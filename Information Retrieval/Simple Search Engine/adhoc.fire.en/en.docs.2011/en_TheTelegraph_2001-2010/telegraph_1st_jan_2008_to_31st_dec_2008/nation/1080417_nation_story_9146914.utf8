          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 16: A Sitamarhi cattle trader allegedly provoked 50 fellow tradesmen to torch dozens of residences belonging to dancers and sex workers yesterday.        
	The man was allegedly offended at being beaten up and looted of Rs 30,000 at the red light area  Bohatola.         
	The incident occurred around 1pm yesterday at the town located 80km from Patna, that is home to over 50 families of dancers and sex workers who live in thatched brick and mud homes.         
	The offended traders torched homes fortunately harming none. District administration, however, had to send government vehicles to transport families to safer parts of the town.         
	So far, the police have not identified the trader, or the person or persons who looted him or the people involved in the arson.         
	Sitamrahi superintendent of police Ajitabh Kumar said the fire was controlled before it could spread to surrounding areas.         
	There was little damage to household goods. But nothing more, he added.        
	Sushil Kumar, a resident, said a trader fought with a man who lived in the red light area some two days ago. The trader was beaten up and Rs 30,000 was taken away from him. The insulted man gathered over 50 fellow traders yesterday and decided to teach the residents a lesson.         
	Sitamarhi is an area that is also home to over 300 trader families who live around Bohatola and enjoy dominance.         
	Police have registered a case of arson and vandalism against unknown persons at the Town police station.        
	Toy pistol        
	A youth looted Rs 4.89 lakh from the DRM branch (Katihar) of the State Bank of India today, brandishing a toy pistol.        
	The youth entered the bank and locked employees inside a room at gunpoint, before fleeing with the money from the counter. He made his escape on a motorcycle. Raids are on to apprehend the unidentified young man.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 8: Chief minister and president of BJD Naveen Patnaik today said his party was ready to face the elections at any moment.         
	Elections seem to be imminent as the Left parties have finally withdrawn their support from the UPA government at the Centre, Naveen told reporters here today.         
	Now it will be an extremely unstable government at the Centre. It will have to prove its majority in the Parliament, he said.         
	In the past we have been observing that the Congress leaders have been contacting smaller parties for their support, said Patnaik.         
	BJD, a constituent of NDA, disapproves of the Indo-US nuclear pact since it is detrimental to national interest, said Naveen. As far as elections are concerned, BJD is prepared to face polls at any moment, Naveen said. It is believed in the political circles that Naveen will opt for a simultaneous Assembly poll if the parliamentary elections are held early.         
	In 2004, he had dissolved the Assembly to facilitate simultaneous poll with Lok Sabha elections a year ahead of schedule. Since the past year, Naveen has been preparing the party and the coalition government to face a possible snap poll.         
	On June 29, the ruling BJD-BJP combine had launched its electoral campaign from Rourkela. BJPs L.K. Advani and Naveen had jointly addressed the rally.         
	Yesterday, too, the state government announced a populist scheme of providing rice at the rate of Rs 2 per kg to all BPL families. The decision possibly has twin objectives  primarily to woo the poor, who constitute more than 47 per cent of the population, and to snub the UPA government at the Centre for the inflation and price hike of essential commodities. My government has decided to supply rice at a rate of Rs 2 per kg to the poor to lessen their burden, said Naveen.

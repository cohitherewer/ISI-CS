          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Congress will project the alleged involvement of sadhvi Pragya Singh and her associates in last months Malegaon and Modasa blasts as a manifestation of BJP terrorism, not Hindu terrorism.         
	Party leaders believe the strategy will reinforce the UPA line that terrorism has no religion and undermine the Sangh parivars efforts to identify the threat with Islam.        
	We will not and cannot allow the suggestion of Hindu-versus-Islamic terrorism to gain ground. This can irrevocably polarise our society and polity on religious lines, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said today.        
	Congress sources agreed that Maharashtra polices revelations about Pragya had come at an opportune time (elections) to halt the RSS-BJP propaganda on Islamic terrorism but said the disclosures must be calibrated in a political campaign so the party does not appear to be taking sides.        
	We have to make a distinction between the BJP and Hindus because the former has a propensity to speak on behalf of Hindus and even succeed up to a point. They will play up the sadhvis arrest as a conspiracy against Hindus and we should caution ourselves against this. We also need Hindu votes, a minister said.        
	The message of caution on the sadhvi has been conveyed down the Congress hierarchy: party workers in Maharashtra have been told not to attack or needle RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists, like the way the Congress coalition partner in the state, the Nationalist Congress Party, had done. On Saturday, suspected activists of the NCPs student wing had ransacked a VHP office in Nashik, not far from Malegaon.        
	There is another reason why the Congress has welcomed the sadhvis arrest. It may disabuse many of the perception the state (Maharashtra) targeted Muslims in terror cases and that the system is not even-handed. There was a lot of pressure within our party that things were not what they appeared in the Jamia encounter. The Muslim leaders wanted a probe, which the government could obviously not agree to, another leader said.        
	Sources in the government said top Maharashtra politicians were privy to the alleged involvement of RSS front organisations in the Malegaon blast soon after the strike. The leaders, the sources added, had even shared the information with authorities in Delhi. But the evidence had to be foolproof before it was disclosed because it is so sensitive, one source said.        
	Once officials were convinced they were on strong ground and the politicians realised the need to balance religious interests, the Centre went public with the information that led to Pragyas arrest last week, the source added.        
	BJP ticket        
	Indore, Oct. 26: Shyamlal Sahu, one of the accused arrested for alleged involvement in the Malegaon blast, had four years ago sought a BJP ticket for Indore civic polls, PTI said quoting Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morchas state vice-president Rajesh Sonkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pakistan plays round-up card
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Pakistan plays round-up card
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Rice in Islamabad. (Reuters)                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 4: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice today said the Pakistan government had pledged to co-operate in rounding up suspects of the Mumbai terror attacks, fuelling speculation that Lashkar-e-Toiba leaders could be detained to defuse the escalating bilateral tension.        
	Rice said both countries should co-operate fully to investigate the attacks and bring their perpetrators to justice. What I heard was a commitment that this is the course that will be taken, Rice said after meeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and army chief Ashfaq Kayani.        
	Pakistan, the Pakistani leadership, understands the importance of doing that, particularly in rooting out terrorism and rounding up whoever perpetrated this attack, she said.        
	Her comments came soon after Mumbai police sources revealed that the lone arrested gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Mohammed Amin Kasab, took orders from Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged operations chief of the Lashkar.         
	Lakhvi, 48, has directed Lashkar military operations in Chechnya, Bosnia, Iraq and southeast Asia and ordered the recruitment and training of suicide bombers in 2006, according to the US government.        
	India has demanded that Pakistan hand over 20 men, including Lashkar founder Mohammad Hafeez Saeed, Lakhvi and Yusuf Muzammil, head of the outfits anti-India operations. Hafeez is said to be based in Lahore.        
	Rices comments on rounding up have raised the possibility of some Lashkar leaders being picked up after a probe  a path chosen earlier by Pervez Musharraf in the face of intense international pressure. Most such detained militants were released once the heat was off.        
	Zardari today pledged to Rice that Islamabad would act against any Pakistani found involved in the terror attack. I found Pakistan focused and committed to act, Rice said.        
	The US secretary of state said everybody wanted to avoid tensions. This was not talk about military action, this was talk about how to deal with this particular problem, she said about her meetings.        
	She hoped that Pakistan and India would keep their lines of communication open to get to the bottom of the terror strike.        
	This was a sophisticated attack (the like of which) we have never seen in the subcontinent, which means there is an urgency to get to the bottom of it, urgency to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice and urgency to prevent such attacks in the future, Rice said.        
	The comments came on a day the Pakistan Army chief chaired a meeting of corp commanders to review the forces operational preparedness.

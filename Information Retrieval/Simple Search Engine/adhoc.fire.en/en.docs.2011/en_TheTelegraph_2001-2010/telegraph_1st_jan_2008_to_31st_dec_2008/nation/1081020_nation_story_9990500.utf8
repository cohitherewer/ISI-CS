	Cuttack, Oct. 19: The challenger series for the NKP Salve Trophy one-day cricket tournament will be held at Barabati Stadium here from October 23, officials of the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) said.        
	The challenger series is being staged by the OCA and would be a key determinant in choosing the Indian team to face England next month. The tournament would be played over four days from October 23 with the final being played on October 26.        
	The premier domestic day and night limited over matches will have 42 best available players in India in action, OCA secretary Ashirbad Behera said.        
	The tournament will, however, not see the Big Four  Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni  as the selectors decided to give them rest in view of the hectic schedule ahead.         
	The tournament, a top feature in the domestic circuit, will see India Blue led by Yuvraj Singh, India Green led by Md Kaif and India Red led by S. Badrinath battle it out in three matches followed by the final between the top two teams, Behera said.

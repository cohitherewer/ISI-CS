The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary Brown in rush to Delhi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wary Brown in rush to Delhi 
          AMIT ROY                           Brown: Concerned                                  
	London, Dec. 12: Gordon Brown is so concerned that the situation between India and Pakistan could get out of hand that he decided today to fly to Delhi at the weekend.         
	The British Prime Minister will then go to Pakistan in the role of a mediator, though officially nothing is being confirmed. We dont discuss the Prime Ministers travel plans until he has arrived, for security reasons, is all a Downing Street spokesperson would say.         
	But a source close to Brown said: He decided to go to India only today.         
	Browns visit follows that of the American secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev although the latters trip was scheduled.         
	That Brown should drop everything at home, when his priority is to deal with a deepening economic recession, indicates the UKs determination to keep a lid on worsening India-Pakistan relations.         
	The UK government has said it is totally supportive of India and is prepared to lend its forensic expertise to the security authorities in Mumbai. Brown had earlier confirmed that the Scotland Yard team sent to India included officers who could offer their experience in this field to their Indian counterparts.         
	However, the UK also wants India to take the government of President Asif Ali Zardari at its word and allow it to track down the masterminds behind the Mumbai attacks.         
	The Prime Minister will, no doubt, be asked why India should not follow the Bush-Blair principle that justified military action against Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not directly implicated in 9/11. Weapons of mass destruction were also not found, although, this was ostensibly the reason for British military action.         
	Brown will argue that comparing Iraq and Pakistan is not comparing like with like. In Iraq, part of the reason for military action was to topple a military dictator.         
	It must also be assumed that Brown is going to India and Pakistan after consultations with the Americans, who attach greater importance to continuing the war against the Taliban on Pakistans western front.         
	However, Brown does have an urgent domestic reason for supporting India. Home-grown Britons of Pakistani origin, mostly young and born and brought up in the Yorkshire region, have travelled to Pakistan to link up with their mentors and handlers there before returning to the UK to attempt acts of terrorism on British soil.         
	In the immediate aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, foreign secretary David Miliband held a news conference after a visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan and said: In all of my talks with President Zardari of Pakistan and with foreign minister Qureshi they emphasised very, very strongly their commitment to work with the Indian government to build economic, political and cultural ties between India and Pakistan, two great countries who should be able to work and trade and live together side by side.         
	He went on: I believe that the comments and leadership of Prime Minister Singh in India show that he is a man also of great statesmanship and great determination to build links between India and Pakistan and to stop those people who would seek to divide these countries.         
	Miliband pointed out: We have a special interest in this country, in closer links between India and Pakistan because we have such large Indian and Pakistani communities, British citizens of Indian and Pakistani origin. We know from our own country of the ability of those communities to work together and I think its very important the message goes out that we want India and Pakistan to find political and cultural and economic links there as well.

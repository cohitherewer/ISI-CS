	Guwahati/Bhopal, July 28: When it comes to the numbers game, none can beat the Samajwadi Party. Whether at the temple of democracy or at a temple to a goddess.        
	Samajwadi MLA Kishore Samrite has sacrificed 13 buffaloes and over 200 goats at the Kamakhya temple since July 20, to ensure victory in the trust vote and then to express gratitude when it was achieved.        
	The sacrifice will continue till July 30, the MLA from Madhya Pradesh said today. By then 15 buffaloes and 317 goats would meet their end, said Samrites priest Ranjeet Sarma, who added that the MLA was offering the Dasamahavidya Puja.        
	Samrite had arrived in Guwahati a day before the trust vote and rented a room near the temple. He said he had acted under orders from the party high command.        
	The puja was offered for the victory of the UPA government, the progress of the Samajwadi Party and to see Mulayam Singh Yadav become Prime Minister after the next general election, he said.        
	The People for Animals (PFA) erupted in anger today, saying it was unbecoming of a lawmaker to participate in an ancient, blood-soaked ritual.        
	The PFA has sent a memorandum to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to put a stop to the madness. Copies were sent to Sonia Gandhi and Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi.         
	The organisation held a march in the city protesting against this act of cruelty in the name of religion.        
	State PFA chairperson Sangeeta Goswami said: It is indeed a great shame that when the country is moving towards nuclear power, some of our politicians have gone back to those days when illiteracy reigned.        
	When Samrite was elected to the Assembly, a big feast had followed in his hometown. In the presence of Mulayams son Akhilesh, the MLA is said to have sacrificed 108 goats in Balaghat.

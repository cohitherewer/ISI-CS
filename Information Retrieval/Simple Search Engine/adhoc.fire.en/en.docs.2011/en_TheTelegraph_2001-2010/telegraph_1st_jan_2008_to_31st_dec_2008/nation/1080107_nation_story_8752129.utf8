     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Lucknow, Jan. 6: Nineteen Lucknow University professors were suspended today as outgoing vice-chancellor R.P. Singh, who has been praised for his efforts to bring order to the troubled campus, wielded the broom on his last day in office.
    
	All 19 have been accused of skipping classes and 15 are further charged with corruption. One professor is facing a case under the Gangster Act for an alleged murder attempt.
    
	The suspension letter of G.S. Bhadauria, who teaches in the department of ancient Indian history, quoted the police case against him for allegedly hiring hitmen to kill colleague Manoj Dixit. Dixit survived the attack. Bhadauria had earlier been suspended for sexual harassing some girl students, but was reinstated. 
    
	A conspiracy is being hatched against me in connivance with the head of the department. I am a victim because I had written 17 letters to the VC against the head of the department, Bhadauria said. The (Gangster Act) case is going on and the court has not held me guilty yet, he added. 
    
	The suspension letters were signed yesterday by Singh, who retires tomorrow. They were served today.
    
	The vice-chancellor had about a year ago suspended 165 students after the university had to be shut down for a month because of campus violence. Many of these students, who had political connections and were accused of indulging in nefarious activities from the hostels including running a sex racket, were later expelled. The high court had intervened to get the hostels vacated.
    
	Singh today accused a section of the teachers of contributing to the anarchy on the campus.
    
	Most of these teachers were involved in politicking. They were staying away from classes and tarnishing my image by giving false statements to the media because I was trying to restore discipline, the vice-chancellor said.
    
	Among the teachers facing corruption charges is Anakshi Khare of the chemistry department, who has been accused of issuing contracts for supply of lab equipment and chemicals to a company that does not exist. She called the vice-chancellor a coward and a liar today.
    
	A three member committee headed by pro-vice-chancellor R.S. Yadav will be set up to allow the professors to defend themselves. If the committee is satisfied with their replies, they may be let off, otherwise these teachers could be sacked, a university source said. 
    
	The university teachers union president, Pushpendra Mishra, alleged that Singh was himself involved in corruption and had no right to suspend the teachers. 
    
	But the students are happy. We have been worst hit by violence on the campus. We also could not catch up with lost days of study because the teachers did not co-operate, law student Nishi Bharadwaj said.

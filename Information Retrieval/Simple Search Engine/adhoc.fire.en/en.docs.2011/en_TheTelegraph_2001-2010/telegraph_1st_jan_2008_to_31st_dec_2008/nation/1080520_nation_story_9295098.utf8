	Srinagar/New Delhi, May 19: Pakistani troops apparently opened fire on Indian positions today, killing a soldier in the Mendhar sector of Poonch on the Line of Control in Jammu.         
	Naik Jayashwar of 2/8 Gorkha Rifles was the first casualty in three violations of ceasefire by Pakistani troops in the last 10 days.         
	At 8am today, the troops opened unprovoked heavy firing on Indian positions with small and medium weapons.        
	Todays violation came two days ahead of foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Pakistan for bilateral talks.         
	Army sources in New Delhi said the brigade commander in Mendhar would seek a flag meeting with his counterpart shortly. No time and date has been fixed.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Colonel S.D. Goswami said Pakistani troops from the Rashid post fired on the Dhip post on the LoC in Krishnagati in Mendhar.         
	They used small and medium weapons and lobbed grenades from Under Barrel Grenade Launchers for about 15 minutes in Mendhar sector. Rocket-propelled guns were also used, he said.         
	There was no retaliation from the Indian side. It is an unprovoked firing from their side and we did not retaliate, Goswami added.         
	Unlike the firing on May 13, the army is still not officially describing todays incident as a ceasefire violation.         
	We still need to ascertain the facts. The firing came from across the LoC but we do not know who fired, a source said.        
	On May 13, the army was certain that the firing was from a regular Pakistani army post. The director-general of military operations at army headquarters, Lt Gen A.S. Sekhon, had talked to his Pakistani counterpart G.A. Pasha to lodge a protest.         
	On May 9, Pakistani troops allegedly provided covering fire to a dozen-odd militants infiltrating the Samba sector of the international border (IB).         
	The incident proved to be a major embarrassment for the Border Security Force, which had claimed it had foiled the infiltration bid. A fierce encounter two days later in Samba rebutted its claim, as it left nine persons, including two soldiers, a politician and a photo-journalist, dead.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had described the May 13 firing as worrisome. The ceasefire along the LoC and in Siachen has held since November 2003.         
	The ceasefire came into force on November 26, 2003, when the then Pakistani Premier, Zafarullah Khan Jamali, announced a unilateral truce to which New Delhi responded positively.         
	All three frontiers in Jammu and Kashmir, including the 780km LoC, 187km IB and 150km Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) at the Siachen glacier, have remained largely peaceful since then.         
	The recent incidents were preceded by reports of successful infiltration bids by militants, mostly in the Keran and Machil sectors of the LoC, sparking fears that Pakistan was reviving jihad in Kashmir.

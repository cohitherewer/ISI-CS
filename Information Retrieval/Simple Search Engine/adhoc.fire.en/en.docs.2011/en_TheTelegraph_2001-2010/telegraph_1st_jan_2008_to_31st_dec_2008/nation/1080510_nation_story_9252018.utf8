	London, May 9 (PTI): Indian-born Manjula Sood is set to become Britains first Asian woman mayor when she takes up the post in Leicester city next week.         
	Sood has been actively involved in projects involving the Asian and African-Caribbean communities.        
	Her term in office at the Leicester city council will be for one year.         
	Im really honoured and privileged. Im looking forward to serving the city which has given me so much support. I dont want to be the first and last Asian woman lord mayor in the country, Sood, who migrated to the UK in 1970, said.         
	As Leicesters first citizen, the lord mayor has a high-profile role in maintaining and promoting the interests of the city and its people.         
	There have been Asian lord mayors in British towns but this is the first time a woman of Indian origin will hold the post in the UK.        
	The only other Indian-origin mayor currently in office is Harjit Gill in Gloucester. Leicester council sources said that Sood, who has two sons, will assume charge on May 15.        
	This year is the 800th anniversary of the lord mayors office. Sood was also Britains first Asian female high bailiff.

	Mumbai, Feb. 16 (PTI): Actor Aamir Khan today lost the legal battle for custody of his mentally ill brother, Faisal Khan, as a court held that Faisal need not be in anybodys custody and can live anywhere he wants.        
	He, however, requires regular medication, the Bandra metropolitan magistrates court held.        
	Faisal, a one-time actor, suffers from schizophrenia, according to JJ Hospitals report. But the report did not say he could not live on his own.        
	Faisals mother had filed a police complaint last year when he went missing. He was found in Lonavla.         
	Both Aamir and father Tahir Hussain had filed applications seeking Faisals custody. Hussain later withdrew his plea.

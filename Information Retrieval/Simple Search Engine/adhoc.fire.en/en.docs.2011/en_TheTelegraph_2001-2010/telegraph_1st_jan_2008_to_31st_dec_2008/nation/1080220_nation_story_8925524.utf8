                                                                                                               Delhi plays safe on Kosovo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: India today said it was studying the evolving situation after Kosovos unilateral declaration of independence, striking a middle ground amid contrasting reactions from the US and its European friends and Russia and China.        
	We have taken note of the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo. There are several legal issues involved in this declaration. We are studying the evolving situation, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.        
	While China said it was deeply concerned, Russia declared it wouldnt recognise Kosovos independence from Serbia. But the US and its European friends like Britain have recognised Kosovo as a sovereign state.         
	Sources said Delhi believed the Kosovo territory was not a settled matter. So the evolving situation, along with legal issues of recognising a country, needed to be examined further, they added.

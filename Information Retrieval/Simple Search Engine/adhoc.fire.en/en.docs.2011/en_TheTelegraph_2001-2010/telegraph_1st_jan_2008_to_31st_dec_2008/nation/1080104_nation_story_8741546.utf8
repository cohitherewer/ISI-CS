     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Jan 3: Navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta is leaving tonight for a four-day visit to Israel during which he is expected to negotiate special radar systems to be installed on Indian warships. 
    
	Mehta leaves a day after India and Israel concluded a defence security dialogue.
    
	Defence secretary Vijay Singh and his counterpart from Tel Aviv, Brigadier (retired) Pinchas Buchris, co-chaired the meeting of a joint working group that lasted two days.
    
	Both sides agreed to cooperate on gathering and sharing intelligence on fundamentalist outfits like al Qaida. Buchris led a six-member team.

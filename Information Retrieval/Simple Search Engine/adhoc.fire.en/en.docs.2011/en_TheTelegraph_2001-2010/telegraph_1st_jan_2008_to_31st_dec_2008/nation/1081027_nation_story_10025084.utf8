  - Panel slams ministry           SUJAN DUTTA                           Focus on stress                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The military establishment is playing down suicides and fratricide in the armed forces that are the result of long deployment in operations, a parliamentary committee has said.        
	The standing committee on defence, which presented its 31st report on stress management in the armed forces in Parliament on Tuesday, said 635 soldier suicides were reported between 2003 and 2007.         
	In addition, it found 67 fratricidal killings, the military jargon to describe soldiers killing colleagues and seniors.        
	The alarming trend of suicides and fratricidal killings in the armed forces, the committee said, is attributable to increased stress environment leading to psychological imbalance in the soldiers.         
	The defence ministry has not taken steps to address the issues of man management and stress in the armed forces, the report said.        
	However, the ministry has made an attempt to downplay the magnitude of the problem by putting forth the plea that the overall psychiatric morbidity in the armed forces has been less than the national figures, it said.         
	The report acknowledged that the demands on the armed forces had increased.         
	Soldiers are now being deployed for longer periods in field areas. Also  though it does not specifically mention this  local (state) administrations have been calling for army help more frequently to tackle law-and-order issues, a responsibility that is primarily the polices.        
	The long periods of deployment mean that the soldier is more tense because he has less time to attend to personal and family problems.        
	The inability of soldiers to solve their family problems due to operational requirements and other constraints within which they have to work... results in enhanced negative stress leading to a variety of illnesses and behavioural problems including suicide, fratricidal killing, early mortality or desertion from the armed forces, the report said.        
	By refusing to acknowledge that the stress-related problems were more serious than was being projected, the defence ministry not only displays insensitivity towards the problem but also highlights its inaction, the committee said.        
	The committee asked the ministry to make a realistic assessment of the problems and take the help of both public and private organisations.         
	Although there have been nine studies in the armed forces on soldier suicides and stress management, little has been done to sensitise officers or improve the basic facilities, the panel noted.         
	The committee studied two reports that were marked secret but found nothing sensitive or strategic in them and recommended that they be placed in the public domain.

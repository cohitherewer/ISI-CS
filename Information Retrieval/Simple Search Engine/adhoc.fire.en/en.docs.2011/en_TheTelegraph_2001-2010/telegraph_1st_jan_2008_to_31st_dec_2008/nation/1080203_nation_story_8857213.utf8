	London, Feb. 2 (PTI): An NRI doctor has been jailed for 11 years in the UK for drugging and raping a prospective Indian bride and trying to commit the same offence with another woman after luring them through a matrimonial website.
    
	Anil Tangotra, 53, who gave false names on the website, attacked the women, in their early 30s, at his home in Essex.

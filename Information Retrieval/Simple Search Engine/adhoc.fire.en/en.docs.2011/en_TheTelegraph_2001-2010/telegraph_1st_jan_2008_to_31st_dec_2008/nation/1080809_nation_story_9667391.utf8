          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Union cabinet today refused to clear the long-awaited bill on free and compulsory education, fearing a strain on the Centres pockets if the states do not pick up their part of the tab.        
	The draft Right to Free and Compulsory Education Bill has been tossed to a Group of Ministers for a review, delaying a seven-year-old commitment to guaranteed schooling yet again.        
	The bill is to implement the 93rd Constitutional Amendment of 2001, which made education a fundamental right for children between six and 14.        
	At todays meeting, some cabinet ministers expressed fears that the bill leaves the Centre to cough up the lions share of the money, government sources said.        
	The Centre is to contribute 75 per cent of the funds for implementing the bill while the states provide the remaining 25 per cent, human resource development ministry (HRD) officials said. The northeastern states, however, have to contribute only 10 per cent, with the Centre paying the rest.        
	Not all cabinet ministers, apparently, were convinced that the states would contribute their share.        
	There is concern (among some in the cabinet) that the states may not pay their share, leaving the Centre a choice between overspending and breaking the law. Since the law is a central one, the onus of implementation finally rests with us, a senior HRD ministry official said.        
	The draft bill includes a clause that will force all private, unaided schools to reserve 25 per cent seats for children from economically weak backgrounds. The Telegraph, in February, had first reported the governments decision to bring private schools under the ambit of the right-to-education law.         
	The HRD ministry had first drafted a Right to Education Bill in 2005 but it left private schools out of its ambit. Several educators and activists objected to the draft, alleging it would only legalise the gulf in the schooling opportunities available to the rich and the poor. They argued that though the poor would have the right to education, they would have no right to equality of education.

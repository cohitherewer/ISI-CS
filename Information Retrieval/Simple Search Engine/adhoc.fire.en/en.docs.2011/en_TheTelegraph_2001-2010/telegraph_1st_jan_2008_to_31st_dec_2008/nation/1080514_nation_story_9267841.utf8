The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Patel, panel in airport duel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Patel, panel in airport duel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              (From top) Patel, Ahluwalia      
	New Delhi, May 13: The Planning Commissions constant objections have delayed the modernisation of Calcutta and Chennai airports, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said today.        
	Patels allegation came in a letter to plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who had recently blamed the delays in modernising Delhi airport on the ministry and the airport operator, GMR.        
	The modernisation of Calcutta and Chennai airports is being delayed due to constant objections being raised by (the) Planning Commission about the scale and size of these airports, the letter said.        
	(This) despite the fact that the committee on infrastructure, headed by the Prime Minister, has categorically approved the projects.        
	The committee on infrastructure has cleared the first phase of Calcutta and Chennai airports. Calcuttas first phase is expected to cost about Rs 1,542 crore, including about Rs 1,300 crore for a new terminal, Rs 100 crore for a runway and cargo complex and Rs 100 crore for a communication and navigation system.        
	However, the detailed plan is yet to be cleared by a public investment board (PIB), which is co-ordinated by the Planning Commission but draws members from several ministries, such as finance and civil aviation, and the cabinet secretariat.        
	A plan panel adviser said: We have raised normal queries which any fund-sanctioning authority will ask before such large sums are paid out. We have past experience of the civil aviation ministry being unable to spend money sanctioned or complete work on time.        
	Officials from other ministries said it wasnt just the Planning Commission but also the PIB, with members from so many ministries, that was asking questions about the delays.        
	The delays are really because the civil aviation ministry is unable to satisfy those who will sanction the money, an official said.        
	Patel, however, implied that the reason his department was seeking so much money was that the modernisation plans were trying to foresee and provide for the airports future growth.        
	His letter said the plans had taken into account the growth that would be needed a good 10-20 years down the line and (were trying) not to repeat the past mistakes of the current IGI (Delhi) Airports international terminal  plans then approved by the Planning Commission and our ministry.        
	The last bit could be a dig at the plan panels alleged inability to envision growth, analysts said.        
	Ahluwalia had earlier this week pulled up the ministry and GMR for congestion at Delhi airport and the delays in work. Sources said Patel was extremely unhappy at this.        
	Patels letter mentioned regret about your (Ahluwalias) private visit to Delhi airport, which resulted in inconvenience caused to you and your personal guests and your anguish over the slow pace of progress.        
	Earlier, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had attacked Patel over the delays in modernising Calcutta airport and backdoor privatisation of certain services at the airport.        
	The minister had replied that the Airports Authority of India would run the airports and had merely been allocating commercial space that would be run by private parties.

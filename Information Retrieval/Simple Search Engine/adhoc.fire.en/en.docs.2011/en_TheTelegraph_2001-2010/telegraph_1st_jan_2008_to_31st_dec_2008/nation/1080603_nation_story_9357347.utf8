	New Delhi, June 2: Differences marred the concluding day of the BJP national executive meet here today.        
	The first to create a flutter was Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa with his assertion that he would prefer the Atal model to the Modi or Advani style of governance.        
	Later, senior leader Jaswant Singh left many uneasy by voicing anguish over the violence in party-ruled Rajasthan.        
	Yeddyurappa, addressing his first press conference in Delhi, asserted that development, not Hindutva, was his priority. Asked if he would follow Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis model in running his government, he said: I will adopt the Atal Bihari Vajpayee model.         
	When the question turned to whether the L.K. Advani model was the right one, Yeddyurappa wriggled out by saying: Even Advaniji follows the Vajpayee model.         
	The Karnataka chief ministers remarks carry significance given that he wants to consolidate his position after crossing the first hurdle of getting a majority.         
	He realises the BJP cant expand in Karnataka without an inclusive agenda. His intentions became clear early on when he inducted a Muslim minister who wasnt even an MLA into his cabinet. He appears convinced the Vajpayee model will enhance his appeal.         
	At the same time, the Karnataka veteran, keen not to antagonise anybody at this juncture, praised Modis development work in Gujarat. I will send a team of officials to Gujarat to see the developmental activities there for implementation in Karnataka, Yeddyurappa said.        
	Jaswant Singh, who struck the more discordant note, said what was happening in Rajasthan was a matter of grave concern to everybody. He dropped subtle hints that chief minister Vasundhara Rajes attitude towards the killing of Gujjars was insensitive.

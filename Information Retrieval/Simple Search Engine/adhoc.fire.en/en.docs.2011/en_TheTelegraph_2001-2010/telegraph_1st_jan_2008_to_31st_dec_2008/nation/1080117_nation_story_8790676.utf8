     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: A gang of burglars was arrested in the city after a jeweller to whom they sold their booty fell into the police net today. 
    
	Gold ornaments worth Rs 25,000, Rs 1.14 lakh, four cellphones and two motorcycles were recovered from the accused.
    
	Those arrested were identified as Bhagwan Das, the jeweller, and Bankana Singh and Babu Singh, both residents of Narga village near Ghatshila, and Gajji Singh, a resident of Lohabasa village in Govindpur. 
    
	Acting on a tip-off, the police raided Dass jewellery shop at Gadra in Parsudih, where he used to buy the booty from burglars. During the raid, the police could not find anything that substantiated the allegation. But the jeweller confessed everything while being grilled.
    
	Das told the police about six thieves, who would burgle houses in Telco Colony and Birsanagar before bringing the booty to his shop. There, Das would immediately smelt the jewellery. He used to pay cash to the burglars later. 
    
	Das claimed to have provided the gang two motorcycles to go around Telco and Birsanagar areas to spot locked houses, which could be targeted at night. He also provided each thief with a cellphone. 
    
	Deputy superintendent of police (city) Madhu Sudan Bari said: A police team raided two hideouts in Narga and Lohabasa from where they nabbed three burglars. The trio have criminal antecedents and had been in jail a year ago. 
    
	Bari said the gang was operating over the past six months during which they had targeted 15 houses in Telco, Birsanagar and Ghorabandha areas. He said the goons have confessed the exact dates when they committed burglaries. 
    
	We intimated those who had lodged FIRs regarding their houses being burgled in the past six months. We asked them to identify the stolen jewellery items, but unfortunately, majority of the jewellery reported stolen have been melted, said Bari. 
    
	The accused would be sent to jail tomorrow.

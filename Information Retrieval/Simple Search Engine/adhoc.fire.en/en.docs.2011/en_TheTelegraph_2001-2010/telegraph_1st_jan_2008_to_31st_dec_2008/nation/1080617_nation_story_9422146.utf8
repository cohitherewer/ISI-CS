          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 16: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Iran next month is expected to give the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline plan a fresh impetus.         
	India hopes to make progress in sorting out differences with Pakistan on matters like transit fee and security.        
	Mukherjee, scheduled to be in Tehran on July 29-30 for the India-Iran joint commission meeting, will bring up the project during his talks with the Iranian authorities.        
	The pipeline, which will also figure in the talks that Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi will hold during his trip to Delhi on July 27, has significance in the context of the Centres stress on expanding the energy basket.         
	This is part of its efforts to push the Indo-US nuclear deal with the Left parties. The project was also discussed during Mukherjees visit to Pakistan last month.         
	Although the neighbours have expressed keenness to sort out their differences, the pipelines safety and the transit fee (to be paid to Pakistan) remain the main sticking points.        
	Hopes of finding common ground have risen in recent months, though, since both countries realise that there is an urgent need to augment energy resources, officials said.         
	The Left, convinced that the pipeline will boost fuel supplies, has criticised the Centre for not doing enough to push the project, saying it was because of US pressure.         
	In trying to push the nuclear deal, the Centre, too, has harped on the need to expand resources, saying the agreement will help bring in much-needed nuclear energy.

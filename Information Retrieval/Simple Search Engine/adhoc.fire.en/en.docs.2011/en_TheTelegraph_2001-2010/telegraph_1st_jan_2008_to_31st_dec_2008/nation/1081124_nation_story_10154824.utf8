	Hyderabad, Nov. 23 (PTI): A 22-year-old software professional hanged herself today, apparently depressed that she wouldnt be a good wife because she was obese.        
	Swati A., a resident of Amberpet, was set to marry a relative. She was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home this afternoon, police said.        
	A suicide note purportedly written by Swati was found at the spot. No one is responsible for my death. I am obese and not fit to be a good wife to my relative, the police quoted it as saying.        
	Swatis parents have lodged a police complaint alleging that growing dowry demands had driven their daughter to death.        
	Swatis body has been sent for post-mortem. The police have registered a case and a probe is on.

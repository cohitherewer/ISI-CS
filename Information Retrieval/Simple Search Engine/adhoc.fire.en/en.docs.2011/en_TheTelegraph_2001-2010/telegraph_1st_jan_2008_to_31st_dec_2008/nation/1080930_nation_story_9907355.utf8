          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, Sept. 29: Chandigarh police today said they had stumbled upon clues to the identities of two of the six men a German woman claimed had abducted and molested her late on Saturday night.        
	We are only working on what the victim has told us. As of now, we have registered a case of abduction, molestation and attempt to rape against the six youths, SSP S.S. Srivastava said.        
	A PTI report said police today arrested one of the suspects from Ambala in Haryana.        
	Sketches of the other suspects were being prepared.        
	The 20-year-old German, in Chandigarh to attend the wedding reception of a friend who had married an NRI, alleged that the men in a black Scorpio abducted her when she had stepped out for a smoke outside Taj hotel.        
	The abductors yesterday left her near the Sector 20 house she had been staying in.        
	Police sources said the Maruti 800 used to drop her had been traced.         
	The sources said the woman, in her statement to a magistrate last night, said she had no idea whether she had only been molested or also raped. In her first statement, she had said she had not been raped. She is still in trauma, an officer said.         
	The report of a medical test on the woman was inconclusive, but Srivastava said the police had some clues.        
	We hope to catch them soon, the officer added.        
	Six police teams have fanned out to various parts of Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to trace the suspects.        
	The police are tracing all mobile phone calls made in the vicinity of Taj hotel at the time of the abduction.        
	We are also questioning the hotels security staff, an officer connected with the probe said.

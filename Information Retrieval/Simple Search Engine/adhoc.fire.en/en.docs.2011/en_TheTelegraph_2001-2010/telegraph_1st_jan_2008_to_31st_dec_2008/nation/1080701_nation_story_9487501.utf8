          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                       
	New Delhi, June 30: Energy-efficient appliances may become cheaper and car makers may be forced to enhance fuel efficiency of vehicles if broad directions outlined in a national action plan on climate change unveiled today turn into specific actions.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today released the plan that proposes incentives for energy-efficient living and a vastly enhanced reliance on energy from the sun as part of multi-mission programme to steer India into an energy efficient economy.        
	Our vision is to make Indias economic development energy-efficient, Singh said, releasing the document expected to spur action by different arms of the government, by sections of the industry, and -- eventually -- by the nations consumers.        
	Over a period of time, we must pioneer a shift from economic activity based on fossil fuel to one based on non-fossil fuels and... renewable sources of energy, Singh said.        
	The plan has proposed differential taxation, on energy efficient appliances. This would make low efficiency appliances -- from refrigerators to air conditioners to even geysers -- more expensive than high efficiency machines.        
	It has also called for enforcement of fuel-economy standards for carmakers and transport pricing to influence the purchase and use of vehicles and the promotion of coastal shipping and inland waterways.        
	A national solar energy mission would promote expansion of solar-powered electricity and fund research projects specifically aimed at developing disruptive innovations that would help solar energy compete with fossil fuels.        
	The mission would also aim for local photovoltaic production to a level of 1000MW per year, but proponents of renewable energy said they are unclear what this means.        
	If its only local production, its no big deal. We already have companies producing vast levels of solar photovoltaics in this country, primarily for exports, said K. Srinivas with Greenpeace India.        
	But if the plan is to increase current local solar photovoltaic utilisation from 30MW to 1000MW, Id like to hug whoever proposed this, Srinivas said.        
	The plan also proposes that electricity commissions should ensure that renewable energy technologies contribute a minimum of 5 per cent to electricity grids from the year 2009-10, and increase the figure by 1 per cent each year over the next 10 years.        
	It has also proposed steps to encourage various sectors of industries to improve energy efficiency in their processes. One of these may be to restructure fertiliser subsidies to coax fertiliser units to become more energy efficient.        
	The action plan has also proposed missions to increase efficiency in homes and commercial buildings, conserve water, increase forest cover, sustain the Himalayan ecosystem, and to acquire strategic knowledge on climate change.         
	In international negotiations to seek ways to tackle climate change -- global warming -- caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, India and China have come under growing pressure to take measures to reduce their future emissions.        
	Reiterating Indias position, Prime Minister Singh today said that while India was prepared to make its contribution to the global effort on climate change, it was looking for an outcome that is fair and equitable.        
	Every citizen of this planet must have an equal share of the planetary atmospheric space. Long-term convergence of per capita emissions is therefore the only equitable basis for a global compact on climate change, Singh said, once again, iterating his earlier assertion that Indias per capita emissions of greenhouse gases will not exceed the per capita emission of developed industrialised countries.        
	But some environmental activists said the action plan appeared to focus more on market mechanisms than on regulations to achieve energy efficiency.        
	An energy-efficiency rating system alone wont help much. The government needs to regulate, force industry to manufacture high efficiency products, said Vinuta Gopal, an energy and climate campaigner.

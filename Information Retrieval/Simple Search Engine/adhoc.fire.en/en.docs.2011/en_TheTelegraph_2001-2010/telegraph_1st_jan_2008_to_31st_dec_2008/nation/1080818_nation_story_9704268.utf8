          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Car friendly rebels                                  
	Raipur, Aug. 17: Drivers playing foul with traffic norms will pay through fuel for their follies in Chhattisgarh.         
	Raipur district administration has decided to stop selling fuel to vehicles moving around without registration number plates in a move to regulate traffic and check illegal use of vehicles.         
	Raipur divisional commissioner B.L. Agrawal convened an official meeting and instructed officials to stop giving fuel to vehicles plying without number plates from Monday, August 18, said a senior officer told The Telegraph.         
	Police have been asked to ensure a strict implementation of the order.        
	The administration has passed the order on to petrol pump owners and warned of strict action against anyone who violates the norms, the officer said.         
	He explained that besides ensuring the proper implementation of traffic norms, the decision is also aimed at checking the misuse of vehicles for crimes.         
	When the police discovered and destroyed the urban network of Naxalites in Raipur during January 2008, they also chanced upon large-scale use of vehicles  in almost all their urban operations.         
	It was found that the red army used unregistered vehicles (without number plates) to carry explosives and weapons people and rebel paraphernalia.        
	Moreover, in the state terrorist groups were also using different vehicles to commit the crimes.         
	Petrol Pump Dealers Association has welcomed the decision, but they have also raised reservations seeking some relaxation.         
	The latest order is a welcome step and our members are ready to implement it, provided that the administration addresses the points they have raised, said association president R. Bhatia.         
	People generally use diesel sold in big canister for tractors, water pumps and industrial use.         
	The association added that such tradesmen and businessmen are the potential petrol pump customers and they cannot be ignored in the larger interest of the business.

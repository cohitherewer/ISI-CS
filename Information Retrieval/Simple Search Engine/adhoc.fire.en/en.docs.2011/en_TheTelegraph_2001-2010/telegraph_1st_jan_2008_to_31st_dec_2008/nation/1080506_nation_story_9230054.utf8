	New Delhi, May 5: The Supreme Court today issued a notice to actress Sridevi on a petition seeking to get her tried in a cheque-bouncing case, reports our legal correspondent.        
	Mumbai-based financier Madhu S. Gupta claims that three cheques issued to her by Sridevi  for a combined sum of nearly Rs 10 crore  had bounced. She has appealed against a Bombay High Court stay on the trial.        
	Gupta has lodged a case against Sridevi for recovery of Rs 10 crore, which the actress allegedly owes her for supplying raw film to Sridevi Productions.

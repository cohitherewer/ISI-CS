	Srinagar, July 7: Governors rule can be imposed in Jammu and Kashmir under Section 92 of the states Constitution of 1957.        
	The section is equivalent to Article 356 of the Indian statute, which provides for Presidents rule in states under certain conditions.         
	Kashmirs governor, however, draws his power from the Constitution of the state but needs concurrence of the President.         
	Governors rule in the state can be imposed for six months without Parliaments ratification. If the Assembly has still not been formed by then, the state will come under Presidents rule with parliamentary ratification. It can subsequently be extended every six months.         
	Governors rule was first imposed on the state on March 26, 1977, when the Congress withdrew support to National Conference chief minister Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and the Assembly was dissolved. It lasted less than four months as Abdullah won the elections held in June that year and was appointed chief minister on July 9.        
	Section 92 was again invoked on March 6, 1986, when the Gul Shah government was dismissed after the Congress pulled the rug from under its feet. Shah, a son-in-law of Abdullah, had come to power after engineering a split in the National Conference, then headed by brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah.         
	On September 7, 1986, Presidents rule was clamped for the first time after the expiry of six months of Governors rule. It was revoked on November 7, 1986, following an accord between Farooq Abdullah and Rajiv Gandhi, paving the way for the National Conference leader to take over as chief minister.         
	In the elections held on March 23, 1987, the NC-Congress alliance swept the polls, which are widely believed to have been rigged.         
	After the inception of militancy, governors rule was imposed on January 19, 1990, when the Farooq Abdullah-led government opposed the appointment of Jagmohan as governor.         
	Six months later, Presidents rule was imposed which was extended, after every six months, until October 8, 1996, when Farooq Abdullah again became the chief minister.

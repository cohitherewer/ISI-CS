	Bhubaneswar, March 30: The directors seat has always been an attraction for some actors thus it came as no surprise when Oriya superstar Siddhant came out with his decision to don the directors hat soon.

	The film would star Siddhanta and Delhi actress Namrata in the lead and is slated for a 2009 release.         
	I have always followed my heart. I had been thinking about this (directing) for quite sometime. As soon as I got a decent story, I grabbed the opportunity. I am excited about the movie and expect that it will do well, said the actor.        
	There is no confusion in my mind that this is the right move for me. I am taking care of all the finer details myself and will certainly try to give my audience something fresh, he added.

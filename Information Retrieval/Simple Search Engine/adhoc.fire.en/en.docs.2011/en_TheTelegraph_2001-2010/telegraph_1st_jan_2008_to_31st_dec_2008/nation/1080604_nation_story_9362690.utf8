	Lucknow, June 3: A girls family slit her throat last evening for trying to elope with her boyfriend and then strangled the man before scores of villagers.        
	The murders of Mamta Yadav, 18, and Anil Kumar Singh, 25, were the latest honour killings in western Uttar Pradesh where families oppose love marriages even if the couples caste and economic condition match.        
	Both Mamta and Anil were Yadavs and children of affluent farmers who were neighbours in the village of Nawada Bilsandi in Bareilly district. But when Mamtas parents learnt that the couple were in love  a concept considered shameful in local culture  they arranged her marriage elsewhere.        
	The girl, an intermediate college student in nearby Faridpur town, slipped out of home yesterday and accompanied Anil to the house of one of his relatives, about 3km from Nawada Bilsandi. Anil, a trolley-van driver, then left for work to another village where he ferried crops.        
	Mamtas father Nahne Singh Yadav, uncle Ebran Singh Yadav and brothers Rakesh and Mukesh tracked her down to the house, officers said.        
	They dragged her out and, on their way back to Nawada Bilsandi, slit her throat and left her to die in a jungle, said R.P. Pandey, superintendent of police (rural), Bareilly.        
	At the villages entrance, the four men ran into Anil who was returning home in his trolley-van. They overpowered him and throttled him. Then they poured petrol on his body and set it on fire, Pandey said.        
	It all happened too fast for Anils family to get wind of it. The other villagers were either too afraid to intervene or considered honour killings justified, officers said.        
	The four accused, named in the first information report, have gone into hiding, said Ashutosh Rai, an officer at Faridpur police station.        
	The murders came a day after a man in Hardoi killed and buried his 21-year-old daughter at their home after learning about her relationship with a local trader, social workers in Lucknow said.

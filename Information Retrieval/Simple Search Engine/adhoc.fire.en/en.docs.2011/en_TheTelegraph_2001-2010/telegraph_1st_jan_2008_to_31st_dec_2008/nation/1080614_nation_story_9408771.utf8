	Patna, June 13: Mohammed Naiyar, the son of a retired IPS officer in the rank of deputy inspector-general, was caught with firearms, ammunition and Rs 50,000 from Siwan in north Bihar, 140km from here, with four other men.         
	Naiyar alias Tanu is the son of former DIG H. Sidiqui. He was arrested with Intazar Hussein, Tauhir Khan and Imtiaz Hussein. They were in an Indica near a railway crossing under town police station area, said Siwan superintendent of police Umesh Kumar. The police have seized a pistol, a gun, 107 live cartridges, seven cell phones and Rs 50,000, besides the vehicle.         
	Intazar Hussein is wanted in a case of theft and police received a tip-off regarding his whereabouts and intercepted the car. Naiyar described himself as a commandant of the central force and refused to co-operate, said a personnel adding: We guessed that an officer cannot move around with men with criminal antecendents.

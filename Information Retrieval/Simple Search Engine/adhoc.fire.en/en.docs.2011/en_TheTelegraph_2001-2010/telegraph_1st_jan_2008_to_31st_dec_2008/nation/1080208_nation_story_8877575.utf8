The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lefts budget wish list
                                                                                                            Lefts budget wish list
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Left today handed in its budget wish list, demanding a near two-fold hike of Rs 60,000 crore over last year in the governments support to the central plan. That increase was Rs 32,373 crore in the 2007 budget.        
	A note prepared by the CPM, CPI, All India Forward Bloc and the RSP and submitted to the government said the hike in the funds  called gross budgetary support in budgetary parlance  was needed to fulfil promises made in the UPAs national common minimum programme.        
	Writing off debts of small and marginal farmers, extension of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act  the Centres flagship welfare scheme  to urban areas, introduction of long-term capital gains tax and an end to the myriad tax concessions to companies and the affluent sections are among the other key demands.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, speaking after finalising the note with other Left leaders, said the key commitments in the common programme hadnt been met. The suggestion was that more cash for welfare schemes would help the government keep those promises.        
	The government must address the real and urgent problems facing the people, especially the agrarian crisis, unemployment and price rise, the CPM leader said.         
	Karat recalled that finance minister P. Chidambaram had stopped pre-budget consultations since the past few years. We were invited only in 2004 and 2005. But we will submit our memorandum through the government.         
	Another key suggestion is to set up a farmers debt relief commission that can write off loans taken by small and marginal farmers across the country. A hike has also been sought in the allocation for health and education.         
	On revenues, Karat said the Centre could bring back long-term capital gains tax (on stocks), besides raising the rates of short-term capital gains tax and securities transaction levy.         
	Referring to the slowdown in the US economy, a recurrent theme of concern for policy makers and business, Karat warned against moving towards capital account convertibility of the rupee. India, he pointed out, was insulated from the 1997 East Asian economic crisis because of tight financial and currency controls, which meant shutting the door on full currency convertibility.        
	The government should consider taxing the capital flows of foreign institutional investors (FIIs)  a plan that could rattle stock markets at a time when fears of a US slump loom.

          JAYESH THAKER                          Bharatiya Bhojpuri Sangh members vandalise Borwankars bungalow in Jamshedpur on Tuesday. Picture by Bhola Prasad                                  
	Jamshedpur, Oct. 21: After Mumbai rage, revenge in Jamshedpur.        
	Members of the Bharatiya Bhojpuri Sangh (BBS) today vandalised the official residence of Tata Motors Jamshedpur plant head S.B. Borwankar, a Maharashtrian.         
	The attack came two days after Raj Thackerays party workers stormed railway board exam centres in Mumbais suburbs and beat up candidates from north India.        
	Armed with rods and hockey sticks, more than 100 BBS workers stormed Borwankars Nildih Road bungalow around 3.30pm. Shouting anti-Mumbaikar slogans, they smashed windowpanes and broke flowerpots.         
	Borwankar was away in office but his mother and wife were at home at the time of the incident.         
	The protesters, however, did not assault anyone except a security guard who tried to resist them.        
	H. Nath was beaten up with sticks when he stopped the BBS men at the main gate. They damaged his motorbike and also vandalised the guards quarters. Nath had to be given first aid.        
	By the time police and senior functionaries of Tata Motors reached Borwankars house, the BBS members had left the spot. An officer confirmed that Borwankars family members were safe.         
	Tata Motors spokesperson Captain P.J. Singh called the incident unfortunate. We will probe the matter, he said.         
	Borwankar was not available for comment.        
	Superintendent of police Navin Kumar Singh said an FIR would be lodged against the culprits.        
	He said the attack was being investigated, but no arrests had been made yet.        
	BBS president Anand Bihari Dubey said: I was not with the mob. I was coming on my way home from the railway station when someone informed me about the attack. I rushed to the spot and asked our members to leave immediately.        
	Dubey said BBS members had been seething since the Mumbai attacks. (But) I never thought they would attack Borwankars residence.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Minority worry for Congress 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Congress is looking to contain damage following reports of Muslim alienation after the Jamianagar encounter.        
	There have been suggestions that the real events of the alleged shootout may have been covered up.        
	A central minister, considered one of the Congresss pro-Muslim faces, said he and other leaders would reach out to Muslim opinion-makers and civil society after Id and explain why the government had to take a tough line on terror.         
	We are sure no right-thinking Muslim will disagree with our approach. Muslims, Hindus and all other communities have a stake in keeping the country together whereas acts of terrorism are meant to break it up, the minister said.        
	The government may ask the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, which had earlier spearheaded an anti-terror campaign with the Dar-ul Uloom seminary of Deoband, to resume the effort.        
	The Centre believes that such a movement from within the community could help dispel the stereotypes about Muslims that are being reinforced through the Sangh parivar propaganda following the recent blasts.        
	Mahmood A. Madani, Rajya Sabha MP and head of the dominant Jamiat faction, said a message on the lines proposed by the Centre would be conveyed through a general session he would hold in Hyderabad in the first week of November.        
	Madani said he would offer a platform to government representatives.        
	We will tell people that the terrorists are anti-Islam and should be punished if proved guilty. But innocent Muslims shouldnt be victimised in the name of terror, he said.        
	Not many Muslim leaders appear willing to be co-opted by the establishment.        
	What do these sops amount to when we are under siege? I live in Jamianagar and we cannot move freely because it is like a police state, said Zafarul Islam Khan, president of the Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.         
	He said the Muslims of Delhi would teach the Congress a lesson in the Assembly elections for using secularism and pro-minorityism to foist a soft Hindutva agenda and compete with the BJP.        
	Congress sources put their anxiety down to various factors.        
	They said that during the Jammu and Kashmir crisis, an impression had been created that the Centre was handling the Jammu protesters with kid gloves while cracking down heavily on the Valley agitators.         
	Second, they said, an overdrive on the encounter was avoidable.        
	They wondered why senior leaders like Digvijay Singh had demanded the hanging of Afzal Guru, convicted of the 2001 Parliament attack.        
	The last straw, they said, was the Prime Ministers remark to US President George W. Bush that Indians deeply loved him.        
	They said their advice to the party leadership would be to downplay Manmohan Singhs success in nearly swinging the nuclear deal for India.        
	Bush is anathema to the Muslims. Singhs we-love-you statement will be a further provocation, a Congress source said.        
	Government officials rued that the political mess had overshadowed the good work done on the Sachar recommendations.        
	A booklet brought out by the minority affairs ministry, which the Congress was to have handed out among its workers, is gathering dust.         
	Among the initiatives the booklet lists is a special area development programme for 90 minority-dominated districts, classified backward in basic amenities and socio-economic parameters.        
	The programme covers education, employment, sanitation, housing, drinking water and power supply.         
	The first approvals are expected soon for districts in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Assam.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chennai, March 24: The dog-eared ration card may ultimately decide if a patient gets a dog-bite injection at a Salem hospital.        
	The Salem Government Medical College and Hospital, Tamil Nadu, will give anti-rabies injections only to patients who stay in and around the town after checking their addresses on their ration cards.         
	Several taluka hospitals that are sufficiently stocked with the anti-rabies vaccine refer cases to the Salem hospital, the districts medical headquarters.         
	This vaccine is made available there itself. Why should patients from Mettur and other places be made to travel as much as 60km to Salem? It defeats the norm of having to take the first dose immediately after a dog bite, said the Salem hospitals medical superintendent.        
	The hospital gets 80 to 110 dog-bite cases daily, which it says is a a drain on our resources. Four doses cost over Rs 1,000, the official said.        
	The cost of the vaccine and the fact that poor patients can get it free at the hospital has led to misuse, too.         
	The hospital wants the neediest to get it free, and the ration card may prove handy in solving the problem. Those with a monthly income of over Rs 10,000 have ration cards of a different colour. Also, the first page of the document specifies the card-holders income category.         
	Of course, the first dose will be given to any patient, but for subsequent doses, the patient will have to produce a copy of the ration card, the official said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           The college                                  
	Darjeeling, June 16: Loreto College, Darjeeling, will now be Southfield College.        
	The Loreto Sisters handed over the institutions management to the Bengal government on Saturday.         
	The formalities are over. The college will henceforth be known as Southfield College, said Rinjee Wangdi, the new teacher-in-charge.         
	The college, being run by the Darjeeling Loreto Educational Society since being set up in 1961, was specially sponsored by the state government. The society had the right to appoint an honorary principal and two teachers.         
	The new management today sought to assuage apprehensions about the overall educational standard of the college following the nuns decision to move out.         
	We have gone through a wonderful period and we are confident that the legacy of this college will continue as the same teachers are still here, said Wangdi, a Loreto College teacher for 36 years.         
	The college has a strength of 460 students. It has 14 full-time teachers, six part-timers and 11 non-teaching employees.               
	There are two vacancies in the non-teaching section. Six posts of part-time teachers are also vacant, said Wangdi.         
	The Loreto Sisters, which follows the order of the Institute of Blessed Virgin Mary, runs 11 educational institutes, including Loreto College, Calcutta. The Sisters manage institutes in Ranchi, Lucknow, Shillong and Dharan (Nepal) and St Teresa Higher Secondary School in Darjeeling, Loreto Sanjeevan Siksha Sadan in Panigattha near Siliguri and Loreto Convent School in Loley, Kalimpong.                     
	Wangdi said the college will soon propose to the government opening an open university and study centre here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mayavati sure she will be PM 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mayavati sure she will be PM 
  - Delhi dream on fast track, says cm          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A crowd at the BSP meet in Lucknow on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Lucknow, Aug. 9: Chief minister Mayavati today said nobody could deny her the chance to become Prime Minister and stop her partys march to Delhi as developments before last months trust vote had handed her the master key of national politics.        
	If I could be chief minister of Uttar Pradesh four times, I could well be the Prime Minister of the country.... Why cant I be? Who will deprive me of the top post? she told a rally organised by her Bahujan Samaj Party in Lucknow to let her supporters hear from her mouth how casteist forces had stopped a Dalit from heading the country.        
	But members of sarv samaj (all castes) continue to rally round me and the BSP, she told the crowd. They would finally make me Prime Minister.        
	Mayavati said she was proud to have been born in a Dalit family. Struggle is the way of my life and I will continue to work for Dalits and the poor throughout my life, she added to roars of applause.        
	Earlier, at a party convention to chalk out strategy in the changed political scenario, Mayavati told BSP workers that both the Congress-led UPA and the Opposition NDA had somehow managed to stall her from becoming Prime Minister.        
	But the developments helped the party achieve in six days what it would otherwise have managed in six to seven years, she said, alluding perhaps to the third alternative being worked out.        
	CPI leader A.B. Bardhan had told reporters earlier this week that Mayavati was better than most who wanted to become Prime Minister though he said it was too early to talk about projecting her as the leader of an emerging Left-backed, 10-party alliance.        
	However, neither the Left nor any of her allies like the Telugu Desam Party had sent any delegate for todays rally. But present at the meeting was a man nobody expected: suspended Congress leader and former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh.        
	Natwar and his son Jagat, who had begun to distance themselves from the Samajwadi Party ever since Mulayam Singh Yadav decided to cosy up to the Congress, are expected to join the BSP.        
	Natwar later told reporters he would now work with Mayavati.        
	The chief minister ruled out any tie-up with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal. My party will contest 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which means Ajit is out, there is no pact with him.

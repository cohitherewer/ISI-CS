	Bhubaneswar, May 28: Kalpana Dash is steady and recuperating at a Kathmandu hospital.        
	Kalpana, the first woman from Orissa to reach the Mount Everest last week, was suffering from high-altitude syndrome and dehydration, and had to be airlifted from the base camp on Sunday.         
	At present, Kalpana is admitted to the ICU of Norvic International Hospital in Kathmandu. Officials in Nepal informed her family members in Dhenkanal over satellite phone from the base camp that she was not keeping well.         
	They also requested the family on Saturday to send her brother Pradip to Nepal as soon as possible. As her condition worsened, efforts were on to shift her from the base camp to some hospital in Kathmandu, However, heavy fog had prevented landing of the rescue helicopter delaying the process. Only yesterday, she could be flown from Gorekshep to Kathmandu.         
	The Indian embassy in Nepal organised the air trip, said Pradip, who is in Kathmandu.        
	Kalpanas mother Sailabala, who was asked by the Nepalese officials not to take stress, said: We are all praying for her to recover fast. I want to see her.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik also talked to officials enquiring about her health conditions. He also requested resident commissioner L.N. Gupta to provide all kind of support to her.         
	Two doctors  J.P. Jaiswal and Nandita Ghimeri  are attending her, Pradip said, adding that Kalpanas blood counts are now normal.         
	She is responding well, he added.        
	Kalpana was among the 27 individuals who successfully scaled the Everest as members of High Altitude Workers of HAD International Everest Expedition 2008.         
	She led a team of five persons, including Ryszard Kurdziel from Canada and three from Nepal  Lhakpa Rangdu Sherpa, Kusang Tenzing Sherpa and Ngima Nuru Sherpa.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 30: A person was allegedly beaten to death by his neighbours after he asked for his due payments at Dhaneshpur village in north Bihars Samastipur district, 130km from here.        
	The Samastipur superintendent of police, S.L. Das, confirmed the death today and said that Lakhendra Paswan (35) was tied to a bamboo tree before being lynched to death by his neighbour Heeralal Paswan yesterday at noon.         
	Heeralals family, however, has alleged that Lakhen entered their household in an inebriated state and attacked the wife of Amarnath Paswan, who is a relative of Heeralal. Neighbours, with Heeralal in tow, tied Lakhendra to a bamboo tree and punished him.         
	A state rights team is expected to go to the Dalit village tomorrow to investigate the matter. The police today arrested Amarnath. The members of the lynching party are absconding and a named FIR has been registered.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Bangladesh Rifles has agreed on joint operations with the Border Security Force to remove terror camps of Indian insurgents in that country.        
	Dhakas nod came at the India-Bangladesh border co-ordination conference that concluded yesterday in the Bangladesh capital.         
	Cracking down on insurgent outfits that have found shelter in Bangladesh has been the biggest challenge in countering militancy in the Northeast.         
	Speaking on the agreement, A.K. Mitra, the director-general of the BSF, said today: It was an offer from the BDR.         
	Based on intelligence inputs, India this time had given a list of 110 camps of insurgent groups being run in Bangladesh. Last year, the BSF had handed over a list of 117 camps. Inputs on some of the camps were found to be untrue last year, though Mitra said all the information was not false.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 5: The Bengal CPM is ready to ensure Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswass return to the Rajya Sabha but would like his party to reconsider its decision to go it alone in the panchayat polls.         
	CPM and Bloc leaders held a meeting on the eve of a Left Front session to resolve the row over sharing four Rajya Sabha seats the alliance stands to win in Bengal.        
	The CPM might leave one seat to the CPI. Elections to five Rajya Sabha seats in Bengal will be held this month.        
	Front sources said the Bloc leadership had promised to tone down its belligerence as the CPM had agreed to dilute charges in the Dinhata violence case.

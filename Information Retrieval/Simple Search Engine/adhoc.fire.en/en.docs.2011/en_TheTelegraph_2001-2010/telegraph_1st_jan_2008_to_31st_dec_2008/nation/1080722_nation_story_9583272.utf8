          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 21: The parents of five students who drowned off the Goa coast during an educational tour today appealed to the Supreme Court to get the Union tourism and culture ministry to frame guidelines for such trips.        
	Five MBA students of Amity Business School were washed away during the monsoon on a killer stretch of the beach on August 25, 2003. The parents initially moved Delhi High Court seeking action against the college and a CBI probe.        
	They also sought guidelines that would ensure teachers supervised such trips. They had claimed that the students were allowed to go unsupervised to an unsafe stretch.         
	The high court had dismissed their plea on the ground that the incident took place in Goa. It, however, directed the Centre to coordinate with educational institutions to frame guidelines for study tours.         
	The college, contesting the parents appeal against the high court order, claimed the deaths were an accident. The parents argued that the high courts directive to the Centre was illusory as it laid down no time limit to draw up such guidelines.         
	At the previous hearing, on March 14 this year, the Supreme Court had asked all parties  the Centre, state, institutions and the parents  to place their suggestions before the court on ways to ensure safety during educational tours.         
	The Goa government informed the court today that it had complied with its order to identify the killer beach stretches and would put up notice boards warning visitors. The parents insisted the Centre must ensure the boards were actually put up.         
	The parents counsel, M.N. Krishnamani, said the steps adopted by the state and the Centre so far were wholly inadequate. He demanded that such measures be taken across the country.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Care for mother and child is priority for the project                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 6: The state government has entered into an agreement with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for implementation of the State Programme Action Plan.        
	The formal agreement was signed by state health and family welfare secretary T.K. Pandey and Nesim Tumkaya, the country director of UNFPA. The action plan is a part of the UNFPA support to the states health sector during 2008-12.        
	It intends to facilitate the implementation of ongoing maternal and child health programme besides supporting population stabilisation initiatives. Improvement of overall maternal and child health status is the primary agenda of the health sector, said Pandey.        
	The health department has already initiated structural reforms to bring about overall development in the healthcare service delivery system, he added.        
	The UNFPAs technical and institutional support will further expedite the service in the state, hoped Pandey.        
	Tumkaya was apprised of the current progress in health sector in the state. He said UNFPA had a mandate to work on reproductive health and population issues and is already working in partnership with various state governments. Shadrak Omol, the state representative of Unicef, said the state had made visible progress in recent times in terms of programme implementation in health.         
	He also suggested that development partners in collaboration with the state government would be able to initiate many more intervention in future.

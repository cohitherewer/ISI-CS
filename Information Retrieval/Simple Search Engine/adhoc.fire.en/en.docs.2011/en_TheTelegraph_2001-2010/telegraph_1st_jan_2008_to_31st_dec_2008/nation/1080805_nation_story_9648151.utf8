          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 4: A man held after the Ahmedabad blasts has jumped to his death in custody, police said today, fuelling murmurs that detainees were being ill-treated.        
	Kalimuddin Shaikh, 40, an auto-rickshaw driver and drug addict, allegedly leapt off the third floor of Civil Hospital around 4am yesterday and died an hour later. His family and several others from the minority community believe he may have ended his life to escape torture.        
	Shaikh had been admitted to the hospital on August 1 for chest pain a day after his detention, and was being guarded by two constables posted outside the ward.        
	When the police came to take him away on July 31, his sisters had told them their brother was unwell and, if anything went wrong, the police would be to blame, Shaikhs cousin Junaid said.        
	Mukhtar Ahmed, a social worker who helped rehabilitate the 2002 riot victims, suggested that many of the 150 detainees were probably being harassed, and that Shaikh must have been tortured very badly for him to want to die.        
	This is not an isolated incident. My friend Yusuf Shaikh, who runs an NGO in Vadodara, was detained and harassed for three days in connection with the bombs found in Surat just because they had been planted in cars registered in Vadodara, Ahmed said.        
	Police sources suggested that Shaikh may have killed himself because he was unable to procure drugs in custody.        
	Junaid said Shaikh, a brown-sugar addict, had been arrested about a decade ago on the charge of stealing bicycles, but received bail. Since several of the bombs in Ahmedabad had been planted on bicycles, the police may have wanted to find out if Shaikh knew anything about them, he reasoned.        
	The police sources said one of the other detainees had mentioned Shaikhs name. During questioning on August 1 night, the auto driver complained of chest pain, was taken to hospital, brought back and again driven there to be admitted.        
	Officers have told Shaikhs family he had jumped from the alleyway of the ward and landed on the parking lot  the site of two blasts on July 26  and smashed his skull. He died in the trauma ward, where the blasts had killed a doctor, his wife and several volunteers.        
	Ahmed said that when a person is detained in a terror case, his family is shunned by neighbours as well as community leaders for fear of police harassment. The situation becomes unbearable for the family, he said.        
	The police have the right to pick up anyone for questioning, whether on the basis of suspicion or definite information, former Ahmedabad police commissioner Manmohan Mehta said.        
	But any suicide in custody amounts to serious negligence on the part of the force.

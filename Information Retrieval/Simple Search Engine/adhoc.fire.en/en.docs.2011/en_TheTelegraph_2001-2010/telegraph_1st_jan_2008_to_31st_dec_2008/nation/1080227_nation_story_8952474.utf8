     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Feb. 26: Moved by railway minister Lalu Prasads budget bonanza for Bihar, Rabri Devi described her husband as the best railway minister in the history of Indian Railways.
    
	Lalu Prasad, who chose his wife to replace him as the Bihar chief minister in 1997, was faithful to her yet again through the budget in which he introduced the Hajipur-Phulwaria Passenger train.
    
	The train is one among the 12 new ones that the budget offers to Bihar. 
    
	Its special, too, as it would halt in Selarkala  Rabris village. 
    
	It would also halt at Phulwaria in Gopalganj district, which is Lalu Prasads ancestral village, one-and-a-half kilometres from Selarkala.
    
	The 2008 budget, presented by my husband, is better than last years. Its not a joke to ensure profit to the Indian Railways for five consecutive years, said a beaming Rabri. 
    
	In a way, Rabris claim was justified, as Lalu Prasad presented 12 new trains to his home state in 2008, vis--vis the mere six last year.
    
	Todays budget also promises to make the Patna junction a world-class halt. 
    
	Besides, the Indian Railways would get one more captive power plant in Bihar, thanks to Lalu Prasad.
    
	But the budget that elicited maximum praise from Rabri Devi, failed to impress Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, replaced by Lalu Prasad as the railway minister.
    
	Todays budget is disappointing. The speech had poetry and parodies but no substance, Nitish Kumar said, adding: Lalu Prasad has no time to fulfil his budget promises. His tenure will end before he starts to fulfil his impractical promises.
    
	The group that is likely to celebrate the budget the most are the coolies, who have been assured appointment as gangmen in the railways, at stations across Bihar. 
    
	In fact in most places, the men exchanged pleasantries and played with goolal to celebrate the announcement. 
    
	Laluji has always been a benefactor of the poor and the poor masses occupy a special place in his heart. The budget has once again proved that he is the saviour of the masses, said a proud Rabri.

	Dehra Dun, July 3 (PTI): Twenty people, including four women, were killed and 28 injured when a bus rammed into a tree in Uttarakhand today.           
	The accident apparently occurred when the front tyre of the bus burst and the vehicle lost balance. The impact of the collision was so high that the bus broke into two pieces, police said. Nearly 300 people have been killed and over 500 injured so far this year in road accidents in different parts of the hill state.                   
	New Delhi: The Centre has decided to increase funding for the implementation of OBC quotas at central universities by 30 per cent above the amount recommended earlier by a committee for overseeing implementation of quotas. The decision, announced by the human resource development ministry on Thursday, follows complaints from vice chancellors that the earlier amount was inadequate to build infrastructure to accommodate an increased number of students.                  
	Jaipur (PTI): A second tiger will soon be flown from Ranthambhore to the Sariska reserve in Rajasthan to revive the big cat population in Sariska. The chief wildlife conservator of the reserve, R.N. Mehrotra, said on Thursday that arrangements were being made to bring a female tiger. The first tiger flown in last week was a male.

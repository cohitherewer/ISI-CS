          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, May 10: The creative head of Synergy Adlabs, which produces Kya Aap Paanchvi Paas Se Tez Hain, Shah Rukh Khans show on STAR Plus, has gone missing.        
	Neeraj Grover, 25, had dinner with girlfriend Maria, a 28-year-old Kannada actress, past midnight on Tuesday, police said.        
	Nobody has seen him since then, said inspector Deepak Fatangare of Malad police station, where a case has been lodged.        
	Neerajs family suspects Marias involvement in his disappearance, the police said. The couple have been in a relationship since last year.        
	One of Neerajs friends received a business card from his phone on Wednesday. If Neeraj had forgotten it at Marias home on Tuesday night, who sent the business card? his father Ambarnath has said in his complaint.        
	Maria has told the police that Neeraj met her at her Malad home around 10.30pm on Tuesday. He left at 12.30am when some friends invited him to a party in Andheri.        
	Neeraj had said he would stay the night at Marias place. I was shocked when I received calls from his office on Wednesday, saying he hadnt turned up. Then, Maria called to say he had forgotten his cellphone at her place. When we went to pick it up, Maria made us wait downstairs, said Neerajs friend Nishant Lal.        
	Neerajs family and friends have also told the police that Maria has given them different versions of the story.         
	The family has expressed suspicion about Maria. She was the last person he was known to have been with before disappearing. On the other hand, Maria has claimed in her police statement that though Neeraj had met her on Tuesday night, he left at 12am to catch up with some friends at a party in Andheri. We are still investigating the matter, Fatangare said.         
	In her statement, Maria has pointed the needle of suspicion towards Neerajs friends. She has said two women, named Nisha and Varsha, called him saying there was naya maal (new stuff) at the party and he should come and check it out, Fatangare said.         
	A Synergy Adlabs spokesperson refused to comment.

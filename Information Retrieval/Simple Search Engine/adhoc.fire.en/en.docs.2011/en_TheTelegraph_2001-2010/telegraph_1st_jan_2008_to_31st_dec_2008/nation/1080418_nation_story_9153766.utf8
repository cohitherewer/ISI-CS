                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sonia pat for student Nalini
          M.R. VENKATESH                          Sonia                                  
	Chennai, April 17: Sonia Gandhi had congratulated Nalini Sriharan, convicted in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, six years ago for completing a string of academic courses from jail.        
	On February 21, 2002, Sonia had written to social worker V. Mohini Giri, thanking her for information on the present status of Nalini. The Congress president had then conveyed her congratulations to Nalini for completing the certificate courses and wished her well.        
	Nalini received a copy of the letter in her Vellore prison cell on March 18, 2002. Her lawyer, Ilangovan, released copies of it today, days after the revelation that Sonias daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had met Nalini in jail last month to find peace.        
	Nalinis death sentence was commuted to a life term in 2000, nine years after her arrest, following a mercy petition from the Gandhis.        
	The prisoner kept in touch with Giri, who works among marginalised women, and wrote to her about her academic progress. She said she already had an MA at the time of her arrest.        
	From jail, Nalini completed her MCA (master of computer applications), certificate courses in food and nutrition and computer education, a preparatory programme in computer applications and a postgraduate diploma in computers. All were courses offered by Indira Gandhi National Open University.        
	She also took six months training in tailoring and embroidery, and did a 15-day book-binding course.        
	Giri wrote to Sonia on February 8, 2002, giving these details and informing her of Nalinis determination to study further. Nalini, however, has not done any other course since 2002.        
	Sonias reply was drafted by S.K. Gupta, then her assistant private secretary. Sonia was then leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	Priyankas jail trip was sucked into controversy today with Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy demanding action against her for trespassing into a highly restricted prison.        
	Swamy claimed that the visit hadnt been entered into the jail logbook, and action should be taken against Priyanka for this violation.        
	Priyankas visit would obviously have been sanctioned at a high level. She appears to have tried to keep the trip a secret, and succeeded for a month.

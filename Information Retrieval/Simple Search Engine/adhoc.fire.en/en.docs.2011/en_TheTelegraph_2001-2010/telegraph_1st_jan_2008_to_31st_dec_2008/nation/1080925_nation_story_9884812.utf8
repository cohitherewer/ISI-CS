          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is headed for a Mediterranean storm when he lands in Marseilles next week for the EU-India summit.        
	A European Parliament communiqu today voiced deep concern over the plight of Indias Christian minorities and regretted the impact the countrys anti-conversion laws might have on freedom of religion.        
	The statement called for a progress report on human rights policies implemented in the country, where a recent spate of violence has left churches damaged and forced thousands of Christians to flee their homes.        
	A joint resolution on preparations for the September 29 summit in the French port city on the Mediterranean Sea also urged the two sides, the European Union and India, to conclude free trade area negotiations before the year ended.        
	The Italian cabinet has asked French President Nicolas Sarkozy  who would chair the summit as France now holds the EU presidency  to take up the persecution of Christians at Mondays session.        
	Although sources said Indian foreign ministry officials had already explained to European diplomats that India has taken steps to stop the attacks, the European Parliament members said the issue would be a major point of discussion.        
	MEPs express deep concern at the current situation of Christian minorities, and regret the impact that the anti-conversion laws that have spread among several Indian states may have on freedom of religion, the communiqu said.        
	The statement also said the members were surprised that India was not on the list of countries eligible for European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights funding for civil society microprojects.        
	The fund is an instrument for external aid to support projects that promote human rights and democracy worldwide.        
	Terrorism is also set to be a major issue at the meet. The European Parliament has asked both EU and India to make clear their joint commitment to dealing with the scourge.        
	It has called for enhanced co-operation on intelligence-sharing and requested that serious consideration be given to India having privileged status within Europol (European police).        
	Before leaving for America, from where he would go to Marseilles after his four-and-a-half-day US visit, Singh had said the EU was Indias largest trading partner with whom we enjoy a multifaceted strategic partnership.        
	We have diverse areas of co-operation, including in the area of counter-terrorism, which I will seek to strengthen, Singh had said.

	Rabri Devi described her husband as the best railway minister in (Indian) history after Lalu Prasad gifted Bihar 19 new trains on Tuesday.
    
	The budget is better than last years. Its not a joke to ensure profits for the railways for five consecutive years, said a beaming Rabri at her Patna residence after watching her husband present the budget on television.
    
	One of the new trains is the Hajipur-Phulwaria Passenger that will halt at Rabris village, Selarkala, and at Lalu Prasads village, Phulwaria, 1.5km away.
    
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, a former railway minister and Lalu Prasads biggest political rival, was unimpressed. 
    
	Todays budget is disappointing. The speech had poetry and parodies  but no substance, Nitish said.
    
	Lalu Prasad has no time to fulfil his budget promises. His tenure will end before he starts to fulfil his impractical promises.
    
	The budget has pledged to make Patna junction a world-class halt and given the railways one more captive power plant in Bihar.
    
	Those celebrating the most were the porters, who have been assured jobs as gangmen. They played with goolal at stations across the state.
    
	Laluji has always been a benefactor of the poor. They occupy a special place in his heart. The budget has once again proved that he is the saviour of the masses, Rabri said.

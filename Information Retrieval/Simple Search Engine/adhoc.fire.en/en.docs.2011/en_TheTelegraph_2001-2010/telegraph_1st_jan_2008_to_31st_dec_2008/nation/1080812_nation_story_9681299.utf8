          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul                                  
	Aug. 11: Abhinav Bindra has pulled off what Rahul Gandhi would love to have achieved.        
	When he was 18, the ambition of winning a shooting medal for India burned within Rahul. The then Prime Ministers son would spend hours practising at Delhis Tughlaqabad range.        
	In 1988-89, his coach Rajpal was convinced that Rahul was capable of gaining international recognition in shooting. Praise of a VIP scion comes easy to many but Rajpals views were backed by Dipti, daughter of Ajit Singh, then a Janata Dal leader and a bitter critic of Rajiv Gandhi.        
	Dipti, herself a shooter, had told this correspondent: Rahul is an excellent shooter and if he concentrates more, he can shape into a star.        
	At the 32nd national shooting competition, Rahul finished fourth in 25m centre-fire pistol (Indian rule) and mens (civilian) individual event, scoring 271 out of 300. Earlier, Rahul had won eight medals at a local Delhi event.        
	Rahuls shooting skills earned him a sports quota seat at St Stephens. That triggered a political row about backdoor entry but two Indian Olympic Association officials, Randhir Singh and B. Adityan, authenticated his certificates.

	Lucknow, Aug. 21: A Lucknow software professional has told police he returned from a trip to find that his email ID was hacked in the past week to send jihadi messages, reports our special correspondent.        
	Sleuths are probing if his Hotmail account was breached by Ali Mohammad, the mystery engineering student from Lucknow said to have learnt English from American Kenneth Haywood, from whose ID warnings about the Ahmedabad blasts had been sent.

	Cuttack, Jan. 20: About 196 prisoners in Orissa jails would benefit from a plea bargain agreement, an alternative dispute resolving system.
    
	This system entails an agreement where the accused pleads guilty to a lesser charge and the prosecution in turn drops the more serious charges against him. But, this provision can only be used in cases where the offence draws a maximum punishment of seven years. Offences affecting the socio-economic condition of the nation and those committed against a woman or a child below 14 years are excluded.
    
	The concept of plea bargain was first introduced by an amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code in 2005. District judges of Cuttack and Khurda have set the stage for the first cases of plea bargain, based on an Orissa High Court order filed on January 3. 
    
	The Khurda district judge, in a report submitted on Friday, said meetings with 110 prisoners at Bhubaneswar jail revealed that they were willing to embrace the alternative system. However, only 97 of them qualified for the system. 
    
	The alternative system is a result of a PIL filed by Maitree Sansad, a social organisation, which had alleged human rights violation in the overcrowded Orissa jails.
    
	Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty have issued directions to the state government to submit a report on the introduction of video conferencing facility in the jails by February 14 whch in turn would facilitate the plea bargain system, said Sansad counsel Ajay Mohanty, while talking to The Telegraph. 
    
	The state plans to start video conferencing system in six jails  in Cuttack (Choudwar), Berhampur, Bhubaneswar, Baripada, Sambalpur and Rourkela.
    
	Explosives found
    
	On Saturday explosives were found in Boudh jail during a routine inspection. The matter is under investigation. Action would be taken against persons involved in it, said Boudh SP U. Ramarao. The seized materials were hand-made bombs, Ramarao added.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Bhubaneswar, March 3: If senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Praveen Togadia is to be believed, Maoists have a link with the ISI. 
    
	Talking to reporters here today, Togadia said he had information that made it clear that Left-wing rebels received financial and arms support from anti-India forces such as the ISI. 
    
	On his information source, the VHP leader stressed that the Centre was aware of the matter through intelligence reports. He declined to divulge further details. 
    
	Togadia added that it was an ISI idea to expand the red corridor from Nepal to India. According to him, the threat was not limited to the east, but was spreading to the west, too. Reportedly the agency had links spreading to Konkan, western parts of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. 
    
	The VHP leader also alleged that the Maoists were linked with missionary organisations in Orissa. He accused the rebels of a mob attack on a Hindu village in Brahmanigaon under Khandhamal during the recent clashes. The VHP leader expressed his serious concern over the growing minority militancy in Orissa. 
    
	Some missionaries are collaborating with the rebels without realising the dangers, he said. 
    
	Togadia, on a three-day visit to Orissa, said the VHP was going to launch a nation-wide agitation from tomorrow to protest against the Congress-led UPA governments stand on the Ram Setu and for communalising the budget.

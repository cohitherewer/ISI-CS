                                                                                                               RJD worker killed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 13: An RJD worker, Mohammed Ikram (30), was shot dead in Patna this morning.        
	The incident took place around 6am when Ikram had gone to Dadar Mandi from his house at adjoining Durukhi Gali under Alamganj police station.         
	Police said the man received at least 16 bullets from a regular pistol from close range. Ikram died on the spot.        
	Ikram, the police added, was well known in his area as an honest social worker and had exposed some petty criminal gangs in the past.         
	Alamganj police station officer in charge K.K. Singh told The Telegraph: Though we have not been able to arrest anyone so far, we are sure to close in on some people in connection with the murder within a day or two.        
	Singh said that the victim had no criminal antecedent but had surely antagonised some people.        
	Ikram was instrumental in exposing in smack-seller gang a few months ago.         
	Though there is no immediate protest in Patna over the murder, the Opposition RJD is likely to take up the matter in Assembly during ongoing session.         
	Last month, a Bhagalpur RJD leader was shot dead.

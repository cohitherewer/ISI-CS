	Ahmedabad, July 29: The people of Surat are taking the battle to the terrorists even as the diamond city grappled with an unexploded bomb every hour.         
	The chief of the citys police force, R.M.S. Brar, lauded residents for taking the lead in providing information to investigators that resulted in the recovery of 18 live bombs from 10 locations, most of them around the diamond hub of Varachha.         
	The people in turn believe the police should be given credit for succeeding, so far, in averting a tragedy and saving innocent lives, unlike in Ahmedabad where a series of 16 explosions on Saturday killed dozens.        
	The residents hailed the role of Brar, who involved the people in staving off attacks. His pro-active approach involving the people in averting destruction has worked, said Rupin Patchigar, former chief of the South Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry.         
	The people also credit his predecessor, Kuldip Sharma, who launched Friends of Police, an informal organisation made up of ordinary citizens. The outfit co-operates with the police and has turned out to be an effective and credible intelligence-gathering network.         
	Even today, it was the people who provided the information, not the police intelligence network.        
	Brar admitted as much. The police have not done anything extraordinary. The people are giving us information. We are just lucky, he said.         
	Minutes after news of the Ahmedabad serial blasts broke on Saturday evening, Brar set up a control room in Umara police station  a five-star-like swanky building donated by a diamond businessman. The police commissioner made that his base, monitoring the information flow.        
	The first thing Brar did was flash his mobile number through a local news channel, appealing to people to contact him directly if they saw any suspicious object.         
	Regarded as an accessible and people friendly officer, Brar answered every call that came from informers and members of Friends of Police. He was the first to know about the bombs recovered from near a hospital and the two cars in the last couple of days.

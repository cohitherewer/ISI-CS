          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: Raj Thackeray today said he had asked his activists to maintain calm during Chhath puja after getting assurances that the north Indian festival wouldnt be politicised.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief didnt say who had given him the assurances but his apparent call for restraint comes amid speculation that big guns in the Vilasrao Deshmukh government had urged him to keep the festivities on November 3 and 4 free of trouble.        
	Having been assured by people from top to bottom that this years Chhath puja will not be politicised, I am asking my party workers to maintain calm during the festival, Thackeray told a news conference at Bandras MIG Club.         
	The MNS chief, under a gag order from Mumbai police, claimed he had special permission for the meet.        
	The olive branch held out by Thackeray, who has in the past derided the political nautanki (gimmicks) by north Indian leaders during Chhath, comes days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote a strongly-worded letter to chief minister Deshmukh asking him to ensure the safety of all citizens.        
	Unconfirmed reports said that in his letter dated October 27, the day migrant job-hunter and hostage-taker Rahul Raj was gunned down, Singh had ticked off the Democratic Front government for showing too much latitude to Thackeray and his outfit.         
	The letter, according to the reports, states that no state government could be mute spectator to violence.         
	Maharashtra chief secretary Johnny Joseph told PTI today Deshmukh had replied to the letter.         
	The Congresss heartland allies at the Centre appeared to have gone soft with the threats to the government following the letter. Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, who has issued threats to the government over the killing of a Uttar Pradesh labourer by Marathi-speaking men on a Mumbai local train, said he backed the UPA but wanted it to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the situation in Maharashtra.        
	The allies, however, insisted that the government must act against Thackeray. By saying this, his sins are not washed away, Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan said when asked about Thackerays conciliatory statement on Chhath.         
	At the news meet, the MNS leader recalled that as a child he had attended Durga Puja celebrations by Bengalis and Ram Lila festival by north Indians in Mumbai. I am opposed to efforts (by north Indian leaders) to indulge in political nautanki (gimmicks) to capitalise on Chhath puja, he said.         
	Raj sought to justify the police shooting of Rahul Raj. Had he opened fire at the police or commuters, you would have taken the police to task. He entered with a weapon and declared his intention to kill me. Did the police then know which state he belonged to or where he came from?

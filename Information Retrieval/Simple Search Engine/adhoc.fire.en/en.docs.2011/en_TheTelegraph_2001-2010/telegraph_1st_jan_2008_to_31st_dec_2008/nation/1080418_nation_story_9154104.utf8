          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 17: Two men on a motorbike snatched a womans gold chain while she was walking back from a wedding in Salt Lake tonight.        
	The incident took place hours after another Salt Lake resident was robbed of cash and valuables when a gang broke into his apartment.         
	Tapati Sengupta said she had just come out of the wedding in DA block when the robbers rode up to her, took her chain and sped away. My sister and my son were walking with me and I was just two steps behind them.         
	She called her husband, who runs a printing business, and he informed police.

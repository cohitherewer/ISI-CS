          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 5: The first casualty of the Prime Ministers fuel price hike-driven austerity directive was the petroleum minister himself.        
	Murli Deora cancelled his air ticket to Japan after Manmohan Singh yesterday asked his ministry colleagues to curtail spending on administration and travel.        
	As Singh preached austerity to the country after the government raised fuel prices, he wrote to Union ministers to share the common mans burden by reducing air travel and, especially, not to go abroad unless it was absolutely necessary.        
	It came as bad news for those ministers who may have been thinking of chilling out in the cooler climes of Europe, America or Australia during the scorching Indian summer.        
	Priya Ranjan Das Munshi quickly declared he would fly economy class. The information and broadcasting minister, who has just returned from a Fifa event in Sydney, has another soccer trip to Beijing lined up in his capacity as Indian football chief.        
	Although the government will not have to pick up the tab, Das Munshi sounded unsure about making the trip.        
	Singh himself has no major foreign visits scheduled, barring one to the G8 summit in Japan in July, unless the much-awaited trip to Pakistan takes shape.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, however, left for China yesterday for bilateral talks fixed a long time ago.        
	The Prime Ministers clearance is a must for every overseas trip by his ministers and top government officials. Chances are, he might not clear a single one.        
	Even in the past, Singh did not take kindly to his ministers foreign junkets, especially in summer. He had discreetly conveyed his disapproval but few of them took it seriously. Singh spiked their requests whenever Parliament was in session.        
	Sources said the cabinet secretary was expected to soon ask ministers not to use their official cars for personal use. These are now often used by their families to, say, travel to school, college or shops.        
	This is not the first time Singh has delivered sermons to his ministry colleagues. In August 2004, he had shot off back-to-back letters, asking them not to flout the ground rules of good corporate governance and not to use the public sector units to underwrite personal expenses.        
	The Prime Minister yesterday made it clear that if the people had to share some of the burden, it was equally, if not more, incumbent on the ministers to discharge their moral duty to cut out all wasteful expenditure in our own establishments.        
	This economy may be made applicable immediately for your own self and also for all senior functionaries in your ministry, his letter said.

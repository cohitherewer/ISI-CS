          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A burnt down church in Khandhamal. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 10: Patrolling by central paramilitary forces and police was intensified today in pockets of Khandhamal even as the site remained calm on the second day after clashes broke out.         
	As many as 600 CRPF personnel were rushed to Khandhamal to maintain order following tension in the district on Tuesday.         
	Deputy inspector-general (southern range) R.P. Koche said the situation was tense but under control in the past two days. Koche, who is camping at the district headquarters, said measures were being taken to prevent clashes in the district.         
	Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahu has also been deputed to the district to monitor the law and order situation.         
	Krishna Kumar, who was appointed as the Kandhamal collector last night in place of Manish Verma, joined today.         
	Meanwhile, VHP leader Laxmanananda Saraswati and his supporters have called off their dharna at Tumudibandh following an assurance for prompt action against the culprits involved in the alleged attack on Brahmachari Madhav Chaitanya (Madhu Baba) on Tuesday.         
	Addressing a news conference today, Madhu Baba alleged that he was assaulted by a group of unidentified men with sharp weapons when he protested against cow slaughter at Malipada on Tuesday. He sustained multiple injuries in his neck, left hand and other parts of the body and lodged an FIR at Tumudibandh police station, but allegedly no action was taken against the culprits yet.        
	Alleging that the district administration and the police have closed their eyes to the cow slaughter, Vishwa Hindu Parishad state unit general secretary P.K. Acharya blamed them for the tension and demanded ouster of Khandhmal superintendent of police Nikhil Kanodia.         
	The VHP leader also demanded a probe into illegal cow slaughter being carried out in Khandhamal, arrest of culprits, strict enforcement of Orissa Freedom of Religion Act and complete ban of cow slaughter.         
	He threatened that VHP activists would stage dharna in front of churches if their demands were not met with.

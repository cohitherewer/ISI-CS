     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Sonia
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Sonia Gandhi has dubbed the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh election results disappointing but coated the hard message with palliatives.
    
	Addressing Congress workers in the latest issue of Sandesh, the partys monthly magazine, Sonia said lessons from the debacles were being learnt. We have sought to understand this (the defeats) and see what lessons these results hold for us. 
    
	She did not elaborate on the reasons, but the editorial was upfront and pinned the defeats on organisational weaknesses, lack of strong leaders and factionalism. But it was made clear that the setbacks did not mean the defeat of our (the Congresss) ideals and programmes. 
    
	Just because the BJP won the election in Gujarat does not mean a narrow-minded vision of Hinduism and the nation has won the battle, she said in the write-up, titled Embracing the future.
    
	Gujarat was an exceptional case and the debacle there was the result of the deep polarisation due to the persistent efforts of the Modi government, Sonia said, urging party workers not to be apologetic or defensive about the defeat.
    
	The editorial also took a swipe at the Left parties. Its (the Congresss) over hundred-year history has taught it patience and peace. We refuse to be a party that uses cadres to browbeat or kill others. The Congress created the idea of a modern Indian nation. 
    
	Sonia said the Congress needed to look back on the fundamentals that made it the single-largest pan-Indian party. 
    
	She exhorted party workers to once again propagate our ideas against the lies and divisive agenda spread by the BJP but was quick to delink this battle from winning and losing elections.
    
	The editorial noted that since the Congress was not a cadre-based party, it must evolve mechanisms to create a sense of discipline, solidarity and ensure grassroot workers get their due. 
    
	Stress was laid on the idea of holding elections at the grassroots and making workers responsible for social development in their regions  a theme close to Rahul Gandhis plan of beginning the process of participative democracy. 
    
	In a message to the chief ministers and leaders of states where elections are due this year, Sonia said she would work in tandem with them where they were in power and where they werent.

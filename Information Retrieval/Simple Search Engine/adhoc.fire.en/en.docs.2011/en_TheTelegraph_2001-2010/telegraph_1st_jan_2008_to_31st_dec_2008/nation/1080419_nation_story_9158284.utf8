          OUR BUREAU                          Sarabjit                                  
	April 18: The Pakistan government has put off the execution of alleged Indian spy Sarabjit Singh for another month, officials said today.        
	Delhi, too, made a fresh appeal to Islamabad seeking clemency for Sarabjit, but it wasnt clear if the appeal came first or the stay on execution.        
	The President (Pervez Musharraf) has delayed the execution for another 30 days and the new date of hanging will be fixed after May 30, a Pakistani official told The Telegraph.        
	Musharraf had initially rejected Sarabjits mercy petition on March 15, after which a death warrant was issued so he could be hanged at his jail in Lahore on April 1.        
	But the President stayed the execution for 30 days on March 19, a day after Delhi sought clemency for the convict, who has spent over 17 years in Pakistani jails.        
	I would appeal to the authorities in Pakistan to show clemency to Sarabjit Singh, an Indian prisoner who has been in Pakistani jails since 1990 and who has been under sentence of death for the last 17 years, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a statement to the media today.        
	Whatever the legal position may be, on humanitarian grounds alone I would hope that mercy could be shown to this unfortunate human being.        
	Sarabjit, whom Pakistan calls Manjit Singh, was sentenced to hang on the charges of espionage and carrying out five bombings in several Pakistani cities that killed 14 people. Sarabjit denies the charges.        
	Delhi hopes that with a new government taking charge in Pakistan, Sarabjits chances of escaping the hangman have improved.        
	His relatives today said they would travel to Pakistan on April 23 to meet Sarabjit in his Lahore jail, PTI reported from Amritsar.        
	His sister Dalbir Kaur was quoted saying the travellers would include her, husband Baldev Singh, Sarabjits two daughters Swapandeep and Poonam, and his wife Sukhpreet.

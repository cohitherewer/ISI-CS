 Buzz in Big Cities 

       
	Hot on the menu: protected species
  
	Monitor lizard, grey partridge, spotted deer, black buck, peacock, black naped hares (rabbits)  these arent what you would show your children at the zoo, but a part of the menu on dhabas on the citys outskirts. 
  
	Raids by Karnataka forest officials have revealed an alarming trade in vanishing species as demand for exotic meat goes up. It seems the nouveau-riche are willing to pay exorbitant sums to satisfy their palate.
  
	The officers found five dead and three live monitor lizards  each at least five-six feet long  at the dhabas, along with parts of other protected species. Another swoop found hundreds of partridges, including some dead ones, stuffed into cardboard boxes. 
  
	The culprits get away because of legal loopholes. For example, grey partridges and Japanese quails look similar. But while the former is protected, the latter isnt. The owners insist that these are quails and dodge the net.
    
	Court rush to save heritage
  
	An NGO moved court early this week to get the Archaeological Survey of India to protect historical monuments in the capital, saying its efforts werent enough.
  
	The Heritage and Culture Forum, along with another petitioner, sought to draw Delhi High Courts attention to 13 structures that it said were in poor shape because of the departments careless attitude to their upkeep.
  
	The petitioners cited the example of Moti Gate, built by Sher Shah Suri, and cited an ASI letter that recommended the structure be taken off the list of protected monuments because it had lost its antiquarian value after years of urbanisation all around.
  
	The judges, though, were in no hurry to hear the plea. Tell me which monument is going to fall in a day or two, the bench said when the NGOs lawyer persisted. 
  
	Tech leap for IT zone cops
  
	Like the infotech flag-bearers they protect, police in Hyderabads boomtown are taking a technology leap of sorts.
  
	The men in uniform in Cyberabad, home to 2 lakh IT professionals, including 5,000 foreigners, will soon be armed with a GPS-based Tetra radio system, making them the first force in Southeast Asia to be given the device.
  
	The analogue radio networks now used snap when there are too many users. In Tetra, or Terrestrial Trunk Radio System, there are several channels to cope with the rush. 
  
	The police can create different groups, one each for law and order, crime and traffic. The police can talk and listen at the same time, like in cellphones. Terror outfits cant intercept police frequency.
  
	Tetra is like GSM phones. With hand-held compact radio sets, voice calls can be made and messages sent, said Vinay Ranjan Ray, director of communications in Andhra police.
  
	An agreement with the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company was signed last month to procure the system, which will be in place by March.
    
	Mess filters
  
	The capitals Yamuna clean-up drive has hit the fast lane.
  
	The Delhi Jal Board and Engineers India have teamed up to install interceptor sewers to treat the water flowing into the polluted river from large drains in the city. The interceptors will check the untreated water, which contain high levels of toxic effluents from industries.
  
	The interceptors will trap the water from the areas where there are no checks on the dumping of waste in drains.
 
	 Delhi: Ignore the traditional warning for once and try mixed drinks at Uppals Orchid, near international airport, between noon and 11.30pm. The drinks may appear spiked, but are just carefully mixed to ensure you get that high without any side effects. Price: Rs 450 without taxes.

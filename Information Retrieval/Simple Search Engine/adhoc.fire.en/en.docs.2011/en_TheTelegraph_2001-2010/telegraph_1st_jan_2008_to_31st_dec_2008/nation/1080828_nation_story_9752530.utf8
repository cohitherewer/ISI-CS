          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: Pressure has been mounted on ruling coalition partner BJP to withdraw its support to the Naveen Patnaik government in the wake of the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, with a party MLA requesting the state leadership to seriously consider it.        
	BJP legislator Brundaban Majhi told The Telegraph that he had written a letter to partys state president Suresh Pujari to consider withdrawing support to the BJD-BJP coalition which had failed to protect the life of Saraswati and four of his associates on Saturday night.        
	Majhi claimed that at least nine party MLAs, including two ministers, were in favour of the idea. Sources said several party MLAs had gathered at a meeting till late last night here to discuss the matter. Most of them had supported the move. Sources said handloom and textiles minister Golak Nayak, higher education minister Samir Dey, BJP deputy chief whip Mohan Majhi and party MLAs Brundaban Majhi, Karendra Majhi, Draupadi Murmu (former minister), Bimbadhar Kuanr (former minister), Gourhari Nayak and Pramila Giri were in support of withdrawing support to the government. They feel that the move will prevent erosion of the partys support base in tribal belt in the coming election, he said.        
	Another disgruntled legislator Mahesh Sahu, however, said they should seek the permission of the central leadership before making any such move. BJP legislature party leader Biswa Bhusan Harichandan and deputy leader Manmohan Samal  both senior cabinet ministers  are opposed to the idea of withdrawing support. There is no question of withdrawing support, said Harichandan.        
	There are 34 BJP members, while its big brother BJD has 68 members in the 147-member Assembly. The coalition government is already under pressure as the Opposition has moved a no-trust motion scheduled to be discussed and voted on August 29.

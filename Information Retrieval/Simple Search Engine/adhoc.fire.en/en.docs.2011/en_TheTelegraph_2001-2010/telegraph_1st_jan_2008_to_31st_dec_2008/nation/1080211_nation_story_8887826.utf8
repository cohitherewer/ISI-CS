The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre peddles pedal corridor
                                                                                                            Centre peddles pedal corridor
          MANDIRA NAYAR                          A cycle track in Sydney: On way to India?                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Salman Khan can indulge his passion for cycling more often on Mumbais chaotic streets if a Union government plan takes shape.        
	The urban development ministry has asked all the states to mark out paths for cyclists whenever a new road or flyover is built in busy urban areas, or an existing street widened.        
	The idea is to ensure space, speed and safety for a breed of commuters that is increasingly being elbowed out of big-city streets by the burgeoning automobile traffic.        
	If Maharashtra authorities comply, Salman can criss-cross Mumbai on his bicycle even during rush hour, using a network of cycle tracks running by the side of the pavements.        
	The actor, a fitness freak, can often be seen pedalling to film shoots in the morning or afternoon while his bodyguards follow in a car. Sometimes he bikes down Bandras roads in the small hours, usually in a pair of white shorts and a T-shirt, occasionally stopping to chat with other cyclists.        
	Mumbai may be happy to see Salman, a hit-and-run accused, on his cycle oftener than at the wheel of a car.        
	Its unfortunate that whenever urban roads are now widened, the space for pedestrians and non-motorised transport is diminished, the ministrys letter says.        
	The cycle tracks - one along each pavement - are likely to be raised slightly from the rest of the street, unlike in the US where they are marked out only with white lines.        
	Delhi now has cycle tracks on a couple of flyovers but the Union ministry wants them on all major roads in all cities, and says they must be interconnected so they form an entire network. Small neighbourhood roads that dont carry heavy traffic will not need to have them.        
	Where it is not possible to provide dedicated paths. limit the maximum speed of motorised vehicles to 30km per hour or so, the ministrys letter says.        
	It also demands designated paths for pedestrians whenever a major road is built or widened. This is mainly a call for wide and encroachment-free pavements, enough footbridges and road dividers that are not too long, sources said.        
	The chief reason behind the ministrys move is to try and encourage cycling in cities at a time the rise in the number of cars threatens heavier pollution, traffic snarls and parking nightmares. Reducing accidents is another objective.        
	Doctors are happy that those who switch to bicycles will get more exercise.        
	Apart from being environment-friendly, cycles are good for the heart, said D. Prabhakaran, a cardiologist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Ten per cent of Indians above 30 years are vulnerable to heart attacks.        
	Calcutta, where the total road area is the lowest among metros and pavements are virtually non-existent, will find it tough to implement the plan.        
	The Bengal urban development minister, however, said he welcomed the Centres move. We, too, are trying to mark out a portion of roads in big towns for cyclists. This will lower the pollution level, Asok Bhattacharya said.        
	The Union ministry has said that city master plans must now provide a blueprint for a complete corridor of bicycle tracks for safe pedalling between home, school and work.        
	When state governments develop IT/BPO towns, satellite towns and SEZs, these proposals must make provision for both cycle tracks and pedestrian movement, the letter says.        
	The ministry plans school, state and national-level painting competitions on the theme of promoting public transport, cycling and walking. Poem and essay competitions may also be considered, a source said.        
	The ministry wants people to feel proud while travelling by bus or walking to their destination.        
	Salman needs no official encouragement to jump on his cycle. He recently rode from his Bandra home to ND Studio in Karjat, 90km away, for the shoot of brother-in-law Atul Agnihotris Hello on a Saturday afternoon.        
	When in the mood, he is known to bike to Panvel - a three-hour ride. His bodyguards are never far away: once Salman tires, the cycle is loaded into the car and the actor driven off.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Raipur, Jan. 18: Workers of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) clashed with Samajwadi Party (SP) activists in the capital late in the evening today, in presence of Mayavati, while the latter protested against attacks on SP members in Uttar Pradesh.
    
	Scores of SP activists lined up in the Mana airport to oppose Mayavatis visit. The BSP chief landed here on a two-day state visit. The activists held black flags to protest against the reported manhandling of SP leaders in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP leaders, who were present in the airport to receive Mayavati, could do little to help her. Police had to be called in to clear the route for the convoy.
    
	However, within an hour, hundreds of BSP workers mobilised in the capital around 8pm and marched to the residence of the state SP chief, Balram Singh, in Rajendra Nagar area. The workers stormed into the house; ransacked furniture and set Singhs Maruti Swift into flames. SP workers soon came to Singhs rescue and clashed with the BSP.
    
	Police force reached the spot in time and dispersed the agitated workers before they could take their battle to an explosive end. Senior police officers said tension prevailed in parts of the city. 
    
	But the situation was brought under control as police force was deployed to meet any eventuality. Mayavati is scheduled to address a public meeting tomorrow in the state capital. 
    
	It appears that SP workers were protesting against the incidents that have taken place in Uttar Pradesh, said Raipur superintendent of police Amit Kumar. 
    
	No arrests have been made so far.

  - Sena chief support for superstar, Kannadiga heat on southern star        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Amitabh Bachchan, Bal Thackeray: Friends now                                       
	Mumbai, April 7: Bal Thackeray has jumped to friend Amitabh Bachchans defence within two days of his party newspaper questioning the actors loyalty to Maharashtra.        
	Amitabh is not just a hero who belongs to a particular state or region. He is a mahanayak (superhero) for the entire country. Thats why nobody should drag (him) into the janambhoomi-karambhoomi (birthplace-workplace) controversy, Thackeray wrote in an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna today.        
	A report in Saturdays issue of the newspaper had remarked that actor Rajanikanth had dwarfed Bachchan by putting his place of work (Tamil Nadu) over his place of birth (Karnataka) in the Hogenkal water project row.        
	Bachchan had lost his cool when a TV reporter asked him for his reaction and snapped: If you dont know (what I have done for Mumbai), then it is not fair to ask.        
	As TV channels aired the actors angry reaction, Thackeray issued a statement hours later distancing himself from the Saamna report and blaming the TV channels.        
	Amitabh Bachchan is our family friend. I have not spoken anything (against) him. Yet the TV channels have tried to create confusion in the minds of the people, the statement said. His editorial today repeated the charge: The electronic media tried to hurt the sentiments of our friend Amitabh Bachchan.        
	Thackeray targeted Sonia Gandhi, saying: If the Maharashtra government puts up a proposal before Bachchan, he will definitely accept it and crusade for the state. But Sonia Gandhi will not allow that to happen, because the Gandhi family does not have a good opinion about Bachchan.        
	He slammed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati for harassing Bachchan through baseless allegations.        
	Thackeray, however, saluted Rajanikanth and said he wanted the outsiders settled in Maharashtra to learn from him. Rajanikanth, we are proud of you. From here, we would like to greet you with Jai Maharashtra and love, the editorial said.        
	Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said: There is no change of heart. Balasaheb has always supported Bachchan. Todays editorial spells out the cultural hounding of Bachchan by the Congress and Mayavati. He added without explaining that the Sena expects better assimilation and a feeling of ownership by the people.        
	In the next few days, Thackeray is likely to watch Ram Gopal Varmas new film, Sarkar Raj, featuring Bachchan. The film is a sequel to Sarkar in which Bachchan played a character resembling Thackeray. The new film has a character based on his nephew Raj, who first attacked Bachchan.

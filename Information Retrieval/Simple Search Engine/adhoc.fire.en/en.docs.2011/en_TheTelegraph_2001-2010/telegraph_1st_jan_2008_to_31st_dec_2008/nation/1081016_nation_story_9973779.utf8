The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong push for Jamia probe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cong push for Jamia probe
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: The Congress is pressing the Centre to order a probe into the Jamianagar encounter in spite of national security adviser M.K. Narayanans refusal because it fears the incident is turning Muslims away from the party.        
	The advisory board of the partys minority department, which includes Salman Khurshid, Mohsina Kidwai, Oscar Fernandes and K. Rahman Khan, also the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, is expected to formalise its stand tomorrow and place it before Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this week.        
	Khurshid, a former Uttar Pradesh Congress unit president, said: This is not about establishing the culpability of any person in terrorism but compliance with the due process in subjecting anyone to legal sanctions any time if someone puts a question, he cannot be branded as an anti-national. We cannot gag persons.        
	A transparent reappraisal of the facts or a fact-finding mission or an inquiry by the human rights commission would do, he said.        
	This comes after certain party leaders, close to the governing establishment, claimed the Prime Minister was not in favour of a judicial probe because this would undermine polices morale in combating terrorism.        
	Narayanan, in a TV interview before the National Integration Council meeting, said it was a travesty to call the encounter fake and added that the Bajrang Dal and the Simi were not two sides of a coin. Better policing was more practical in dealing with the Bajrang Dal than a ban, he said.         
	Union ministers Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and E. Ahmed, and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh criticised his statement as insensitive.         
	Government sources said it was unclear if Narayanan was mandated to make these statements by the Prime Minister.         
	Manmohan, they said, was as concerned as the Congress about the socio-political fallout of the encounter and the communal attacks.         
	Khurshid said since there was no conclusive discussion in the cabinet and Narayanans interview was only a reasonable assertion of a view-point thats supposed to reflect the governments thinking, we have the right to say, please re-examine the given view.

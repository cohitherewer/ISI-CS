          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 4: On the sixth day of search operations, divers of the Indian Navy and a Visakhapatnam private agency today recovered eight more bodies from the Balimela reservoir in Malkangiri.        
	With todays recovery, the official death toll climbed up to 18, said Malkangiri superintendent of police S.K. Gajbhiye to The Telegraph.        
	Yesterday, eight bodies were recovered from Balimela reservoir and two personnel were found in the previous two days. Of the 18, 16 personnel belonged to the Andhra Pradesh Greyhound Force and two were Orissa citizens (constable Ranjan Khara from Chitrakonda police station and driver Iswar Rao).        
	The bodies of the Greyhound Force commandos have been flown to Visakhapatnam by a helicopter.        
	According to police sources, the divers today pulled out eight bodies after breaking open a portion of the sunken boat. Special equipment procured from Visakhapatnam was used to salvage the vessel. Three motor-launches and four boats were pressed into service for the search.        
	Divers conducted the operation in the 40m-deep reservoir, while 1,000 personnel of the Indian Navy, Greyhound Force, Orissa polices Special Operation Group and CRPF combed the surrounding forests.        
	Twenty-eight of the 66 personnel travelling on the boat, mostly Greyhound jawans, had managed to swim ashore after the Naxalite attack on Sunday. Rebels had showered bullets on the boat ferrying the commandos when it was crossing the Balimela reservoir, near the Alampekka village under the Chitrakonda police station.

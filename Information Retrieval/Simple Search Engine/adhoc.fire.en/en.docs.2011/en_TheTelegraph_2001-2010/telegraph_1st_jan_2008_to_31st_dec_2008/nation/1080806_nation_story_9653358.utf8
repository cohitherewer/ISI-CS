	Naina Devi, Himachal Pradesh, Aug. 5 (PTI): One-year-old Nehas cries for mum were answered last evening.        
	The baby, lost during Sundays stampede here, has been reunited with her family, temple sources said today.        
	Her father Kala Ram and mother Manju arrived at the temple from Diwana village in Fatehbad, Haryana, after learning that their daughter had been found.        
	For a whole day, Neha, spotted and cared for by temple employees, had kept mumbling mum mum, searching for a familiar face among every adult who came into view.        
	The moment she saw her parents, her eyes lit up and she jumped off the lap of her caretaker to rush into her mothers arms. The parents said the girl got separated from them in the chaos of the stampede that killed 151 people, mostly women and children.        
	We looked for her desperately. Then, fearing the worst, we went home, Kala Ram said. Yesterday a relative told us Neha had been found and we rushed back to take her home.        
	We took great care of Neha, temple official and local tehsildar Narendra Kumar Ahluwalia said.

	 Chandigarh, Jan. 3 (PTI): The robe of honour the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee reportedly offered to Amitabh Bachchan at the Golden Temple recently has led to a rift between two radical Sikh organisations.
     
	The robe was reportedly offered when the actor had gone to the Harmandir Sahib with his family following the death of his mother.
     
	Amitabh, in league with Rajiv Gandhi, was instrumental in the open murder of Sikhs after Indira Gandhis assassination, said the general secretary of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Amritsar), Bhai Ram Singh.

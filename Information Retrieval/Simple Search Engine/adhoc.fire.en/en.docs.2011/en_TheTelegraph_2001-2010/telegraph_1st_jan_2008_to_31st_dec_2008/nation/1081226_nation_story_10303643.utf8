          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 25: Christmas celebrations passed off peacefully in trouble-torn Kandhamal and parts of Orissa amid tight security.         
	We had a peaceful Christmas in Kandhamal and other coastal districts, said archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese Raphael Cheenath. The only glitch, he said, was that fear and security kept residents of five Kandhamal villages away from the midnight mass. As things stand now, I do not apprehend any violence tonight, said the visibly relieved church leader, who had sought pin-proof security for missionary institutions from chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	Cheenath wasnt the only one who felt relieved because the day was by and large uneventful. We are glad that Kandhamal remained incident-free, said director-general of police (DGP) Man Mohan Praharaj.         
	No trouble was reported from other sensitive pockets, the DGP who went on an aerial survey, said. Praharaj toured Baliguda, Brahmanigaon, G-Udaygiri, Tiakabali and Raikia  all in Kandhamal and bordering Gajapati  in a chopper provided by the Centre. Additional director-general of police Deshraj Meena and director of intelligence R.P Singh accompanied him.         
	The state police chief also visited Barakhama in Kandhamal. Last Christmas, the place had witnessed riots that left two people dead.        
	There was tension in Kandhamal this morning as members of the Kui community held a congregation under the banner of Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti to commemorate the martyrdom of Khageswar Mallick, killed in pre-Christmas clashes in 2007.        
	Sensing trouble, the district administration clamped prohibitory orders in the area and persuaded the tribals to hold their congregation elsewhere, said special administrator M.S. Padhee.         
	The rally turned out to be a low-key affair and concluded peacefully, confirmed Kandhamal SP S. Praveen Kumar who was camping on the spot.         
	Kumar said more than 60 churches were provided security before the midnight mass, though 30 were initially identified for the purpose.        
	The state had witnessed widespread communal violence in August-September this year after the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati. This had triggered fears of violence during Christmas.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram had called up chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday and urged him to ensure a peaceful Christmas. Prodded by the Centre, Naveen had directed police administration to take all possible steps to make the day event-free. Security was also tightened around churches of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.        
	Even at Daringibadi, where communal violence had erupted last year, people from different communities celebrated Christmas together. There are 12 more hours to go, said a cautious Praveen Kumar. Tonight is crucial. We are keeping close watch.

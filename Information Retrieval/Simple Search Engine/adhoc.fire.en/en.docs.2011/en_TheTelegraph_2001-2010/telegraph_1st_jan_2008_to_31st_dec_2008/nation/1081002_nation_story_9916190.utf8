          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 1: Pabitra Nayak, a GRP constable accused of pushing off a vendor out of a running train yesterday, was arrested and forwarded to court today.        
	Rajib Singh, 19, a resident of Gopabandhu Palli and a small-time vendor, died after he was allegedly pushed out by two railway policemen for not paying the money they had asked for.         
	Rajib had boarded the Saranda Passenger from Jareikela yesterday afternoon and was carrying vegetables and firewood to Rourkela. As the train was about to reach Rourkela, two GRP personnel walked up to him. The duo reportedly demanded money from Rajib accusing him of indulging in liquor trade. Although Rajib coughed up Rs 150 to let him go free, the men wanted more. An altercation followed after which the angry cops pushed him out of the running train. Rajib came under the wheels of another speeding train that severed his leg. The profusely bleeding youth was rushed to the Ispat General Hospital but succumbed to his injuries a few hours later. The incident was narrated by Piyush, an eyewitness who was accompanying Rajib yesterday. Piyush helped the police identify Nayak. However, the other accused is yet to be identified. Investigation is on, said superintendent of railway police R.K. Bal.

	Cops blow out fiery protests    
	The smoking ban might have taken the romance out of many a restaurant by targeting candle-light dinners. Now candle-light vigils appear to have come in the firing line.     
	Delhi police recently outlawed all such protests, the curbs coming against the backdrop of terror strikes.    
	Police chief Y.S. Dadwal, who issued the order, didnt specify a terror threat, merely saying the restriction was prompted by inputs that some people may indulge in activities prejudicial to peace in the city. The order forbids torch carrying flames or fire candles or live fire in processions, rallies and functions.     
	Those found violating the order may be jailed for up to six months or fined Rs 1,000. They will be prosecuted under Section 188 of the IPC, which makes it an offence to disobey an order by a public servant. The candle-light curbs will affect those planning such demonstrations to highlight their causes, possibly forcing them to think of other, less fiery, forms of protest. (PTI)        
	Port gets a French toast     
	The tide might turn for Mumbai after a recent French toast.    
	Mumbai port, one of the countrys oldest, has entered into an understanding with the Marseille Authority in France to strengthen co-operation between both bodies.    
	The two have signed a sister port agreement to exchange expertise in engineering, management, security, city-port relations and sustainable development, the Port of Marseille Authority said.    
	Marseille, a leading port in the Mediterranean, is the third-largest oil port worldwide. It handles crude, oil products, general cargo, dry bulk and liquid bulk consignments. It also caters to passenger ships.    
	Port joint secretary Rakesh Srivastava, Mumbai Port Trust chairman Rahul Asthana, Marseille Authority executive managing director Jean Claude Terrier and the French consul-general in Mumbai, Francois Pujolas, were present during the signing ceremony. (PTI)    
	Cash row over closed schools    
	A plan that turns closed municipal schools into money-spinners appears to be raising more dust than cash.    
	The capitals civic body, the MCD, believes nine of its defunct schools can boost its coffers by Rs 500 crore if they are let out for commercial purposes or turned into guesthouses for the Commonwealth Games two years away.    
	These schools have been vacant since they were merged or folded into bigger institutions two years back.    
	But opposition to the BJP-run civic bodys move has come from the CPI, whose Delhi secretary Amarjeet Kaur said recently that better infrastructure should be provided to students instead of putting such buildings to commercial use.    
	MCD commissioner K.S. Mishra hasnt cleared the proposal but an official said the schools would make ideal guesthouses.    
	We hope to begin work on this project by the year-end so that it can be completed by the 2010 Games. The plots in such schools can be developed into guesthouses. (UNI)        
	On a high    
	After Chennai airport, upgrade plans are ready for the one in Madurai.    
	The expansion of the airport in the temple town, which draws thousands of tourists, got off the ground with the ground being laid to begin acquisition of land.    
	In all, 614 acres will be needed for the Rs 300-crore project, officials said, adding that a lot of the land would be used for the expansion of the runway to international standards. The runway length will increase from 9,000ft to 12,500ft. (PTI)

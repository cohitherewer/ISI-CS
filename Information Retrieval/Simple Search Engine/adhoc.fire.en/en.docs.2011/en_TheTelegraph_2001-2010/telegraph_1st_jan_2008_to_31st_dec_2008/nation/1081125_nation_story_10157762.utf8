	Patna, Nov. 24: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today inaugurated 115 bridges that his government has built across the state and promised to build more linking villages separated by the Ganga, Sone, Kosi and Gandak rivers.        
	Explaining the importance of these bridges while presenting his governments report on completion of the third year in office, Nitish stressed on what the bridge stood for in the wider context of the system evolving under his governance.        
	Besides bridging gaps among villages and also linking rivers through the bridges, we have also bridged the gaps at social, political and administrative levels. Nobody now speaks about caste divide. We are reaching out to all sections of the society  be it the Muslims or the Mahadalits or the extremely backward castes. The human massacre  a regular phenomenon before our arrival  is a thing of the past now. There is social harmony. People are now breathing in free and fearless atmosphere, Nitish said.         
	Our primary objective is to carry out all inclusive development with justice, he added.        
	In fact, Nitishs approach of doing basic things in a simple manner has proved difficult for his main opponent  a flamboyant and rhetorical Lalu Prasad and his RJD to counter.         
	Lalu Prasads RJD too issued a chargesheet today to counter Nitishs report card, terming it a bundle of lies and fake promises.        
	At least, our government has made them (read Lalu) do something which the Opposition is supposed to do. They did not come out with any report card on their performance in 15 years of their rule. Now, at least, they are spending time to study and react on what we are doing. These are positive things, Nitish said with sarcasm.        
	Asked about his most remarkable achievement, the chief minister said: I am not satisfied with what we have achieved in three years. There is a lot to be done.

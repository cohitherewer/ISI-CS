          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 29: The Centre plans to set up an empowered commission of senior government officials to carry out medical, economic, social and environmental rehabilitation of victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy 24 years ago.         
	In a statement today, the Prime Ministers Office informed NGOs working with gas leak victims that the commission would subsume all existing committees on different aspects of the rehabilitation.         
	The NGOs have been demanding that the Prime Minister set up an empowered panel that would work for at least 30 years  the time required, they estimate, to wipe off all physical scars left behind by the tragedy.         
	In the early hours of December 3, 1984, the toxic gas methyl isocyanate had leaked from a Union Carbide plant in the heart of the Madhya Pradesh capital, killing 3,000 people, according to official figures.         
	Today, over a lakh people are estimated to have problems that can be traced back to the leak. Several babies with birth defects have been born to mothers who were victims of the gas tragedy.         
	The central government will take the initiative in speedily working out the modalities for setting up such a commission, Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state in the PMO, read out to activists and victims protesting in Delhi today.         
	Chavan emphasised that the statement had been authorised by the Prime Minister.

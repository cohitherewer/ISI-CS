	Behrampore, July 3: Schoolchildren dragged a BSF jawan to their classroom, thrashed him and locked him up for allegedly molesting a student.        
	The girl, 15, said she was attacked around 10.45am on her way to school, about 500 metres from a BSF camp at Rajanagar, Murshidabad. Sunil, 30, admitted he had tried to drag her to a jute field. She bit his wrist and freed herself, a police officer said at Domkol.        
	Some 100 students marched towards the BSF 90 Bn camp but spotted the jawan at a bus stand. They dragged him to the school and beat him up, tearing his shirt and vest.        
	The teachers intervened but were threatened. When the police and BSF arrived, the students threw bricks injuring two jawans, who have been admitted to hospital.        
	After the BSF sent feelers through senior teachers and promised to punish Sunil if found guilty, the students let their prisoner go.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 31: Orissa High Court today refused to interfere in the choking of sulphur supply to the sulphuric acid plant of Paradeep Phosphates Limited by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB).        
	The PSU had filed a fresh petition seeking judicial intervention after OSPCB had sealed the supply of sulphur at its Paradeep plant on Thursday as it threatened operations there. B. Rath, the counsel for the unit, also moved a contempt application against the board alleging violation of the high court order.        
	The division bench of Justices I.M. Qudussi and B.N. Mohapatra, however, declined to pass any order at this stage and set the next date of hearing on November 3.        
	Court sources said the units plea would be taken up for analogous hearing along with a petition filed by some villagers of the area. Advocate Buddhadev Routray filed the petition today on behalf of Govinda Tarei and others.        
	The petition sought judicial intervention against the industry-related hazards and various diseases that were taking toll on people of the area because of effluents released by the fertiliser plant.        
	Solid pollutants released from the unit have been affecting people living within a radius of 20-30km. They are suffering from eye diseases, tuberculosis, gastro-enteritis, malaria, jaundice because of ammonia gas and acid discharge from the plant. The discharge of effluents had led to depletion of fish population in the rivers and canals, while paddy crops were also affected, the petitioners alleged.        
	Earlier, a vacation bench of the high court had on October 10 ordered for a status quo at the unit on a petition filed by the PSU challenging a closure notice issued by the board without giving opportunity to rectify anomalies. OSPCB asked the unit on October 3 to close down all plants, including gypsum manufacturing unit, on the ground that it was handling hazardous substance without taking preventive measures.

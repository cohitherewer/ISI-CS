	Srinagar, May 24: Street protests broke out in Srinagar and life across Jammu and Kashmir was paralysed today as the hardline Hurriyat faction called a strike against the Presidents visit, reports our special correspondent.        
	Pratibha Patil arrived in the Valley yesterday.        
	Police lobbed tear gas shells at protesters who threw stones at the cops at several places. There were clashes at Habba Kadal, Nowhatta and Nawa Kadal, a police official said.         
	Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani said: We have no problem with her visit but the government wants to give an impression that the situation is normal here.

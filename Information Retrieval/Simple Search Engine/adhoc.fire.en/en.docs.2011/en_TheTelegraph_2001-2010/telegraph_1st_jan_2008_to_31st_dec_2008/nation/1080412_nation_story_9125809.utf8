	Mumbai, April 11 (PTI): A Bollywood item girl and her driver slapped each other outside a shopping mall last night. As she got off the car at the Lower Parel mall, Sambhavana Seth asked the driver to wait at the same spot. But V.K. Choudhary drove to the parking lot after a guard told him to do so.         
	This infuriated Seth who started abusing him. Choudhary answered back and it ended only after they slapped each other, police said. Seth had appeared in 36 China Town.

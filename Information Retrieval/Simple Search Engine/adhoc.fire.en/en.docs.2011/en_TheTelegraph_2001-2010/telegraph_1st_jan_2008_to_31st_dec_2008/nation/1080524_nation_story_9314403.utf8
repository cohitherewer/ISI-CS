          HEMENDRA SINGH BARTWAL AND PTI                          Two persons injured in the clash being taken to a Jaipur hospital on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	May 23: At least 14 people were killed when police opened fire on a Gujjar mob that lynched a policeman in Rajasthans Bharatpur district.        
	Ten columns of the army (about 2,000 troops), 200 Rapid Action Force personnel and 300 CRPF men were called in to maintain law and order as the Centre put neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi on alert for a possible backlash.        
	The Gujjars, who had organised a rail roko to press their demand for Scheduled Tribe status, clashed with the force and set two police jeeps on fire.         
	Policeman Bhola Ram was beaten to death by the mob, Rajasthan home minister Gulab Chand Kataria said. He claimed the police used tear gas and fired 80 rubber bullets, before firing in the air.         
	The state government has ordered a judicial probe into the firing, which comes a week before the first anniversary of the police firing on Gujjar protesters and the subsequent clashes, spread across neighbouring states, which claimed 26 lives.        
	The probe will be conducted by Fateh Chand Bansal, a retired Rajasthan High Court judge, an official spokesman said in Jaipur.        
	Chief minister Vasundhara Raje called an emergency meeting of the state cabinet to review the situation.         
	The flare-up, coming soon after the Jaipur blasts and months before Assembly elections, is worrying for the BJP government. In Delhi, top party leaders held a meeting to review the violence and president Rajnath Singh called up the chief minister to discuss the matter.         
	The rail roko call was given by Gurjar Sangharsh Samiti spearhead Kirori Singh Bainsla, who went into hiding after arrest warrants were issued against him and five other leaders.        
	The Samiti had recently rejected the states package  offered on the suggestion of the Ramdas Agarwal Committee that examined the demand for ST status  worth Rs 282 crore for the Gujjar-dominated districts.         
	Agitators damaged rail tracks between Dumariya and Karwari stations in Bharatpur, principal home secretary V.S. Singh said.         
	Tension ran high in villages around the protest site. The agitators were refusing to let some bodies of the firing victims to be taken away.         
	A group of Gujjar youths also put up blockades on the Jaipur-Bikaner highway near Sikar, about 250km from the state capital, the police said.         
	Prohibitory orders have been promulgated in Bharatpur, Dausa, Karauli and Sawaimadhopur, which have a large Gujjar population.

	Lucknow, March 25: Suspected poisoning is said to have killed 40 peacocks in Etawah district, where their carcasses were found scattered across several crop fields yesterday.        
	Vinod Singh Bhadoria, a farmer in Nasidipura village, found seven dead on his plot. Later, other farmers found peacock carcasses in the fields in and around the village.         
	Although 40 birds were killed in Etawah, only 13 carcasses were found, wildlife official Ranjan Chauhan said. The villagers told the officials that they had counted 40 dead birds around 8am. But when the forest officials went there after three hours, only 13 carcasses were found, leading to the suspicion that the poachers took away some dead birds.        
	We have collected some of the carcasses from the village and sent them for post-mortem, said Vivekanand Dubey, the deputy ranger of Etawah. It is difficult to say what killed the birds. Prima facie, they were poisoned.         
	We have drawn up FIRs against the suspected poachers in the police stations of Etawah, said the states chief wildlife conservator, D.N.S. Suman, today.         
	Some villagers told forest officials that farmers, worried the birds would raid the fields, may have poisoned them. Others said poachers out to kill peacocks for their feathers were active in the area.         
	Last week, 16 peacocks were found dead in a Bulandshahr village. Forest officials suspect farmers inadvertently poisoned them.

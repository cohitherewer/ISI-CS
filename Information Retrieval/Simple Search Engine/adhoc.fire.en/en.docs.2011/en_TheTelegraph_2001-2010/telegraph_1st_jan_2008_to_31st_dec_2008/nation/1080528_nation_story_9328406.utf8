          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 27: The ambitious plan to centralise garbage disposal at Chakradharpur has hit a roadblock with local residents strongly opposing plans of a single-point dumping site in their backyard.         
	The proposed plan would have enabled the city to have a single-point dumping yard and facilitate a waste to energy power project under a Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Twin City Solid Waste Management Plan.        
	Presently, Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) manages to collect less than 60 per cent of the nearly 500 tonnes of the citys solid waste generated in a day and dumps them in 62 locations along the citys fringes. A large load is disposed into the Mahanadi.        
	Acting on a PIL, the high court on March 5 had fixed April 30 as the deadline for stopping the haphazard system of dumping of garbage at multiple locations.         
	The civic body was expected to adopt a centralised system from May 1.        
	The CMC had since identified and started working on a single-point dumping yard at Chakradharpur in Barang block, 15km to the south of the city, where the district collector had allotted 30 acres in pursuance of a court order. But, the civic body had failed to make any headway in construction of the yard.        
	Starting work at Chakradharpur has not been possible so far due to opposition from the local residents, mayor Nibedita Pradhan told The Telegraph today.         
	The residents have grievances and we will try to address their complaint and sort out the issues, the mayor added.        
	The residents had reportedly expressed apprehensions that a dumping yard would turn the area into a breeding ground of germs and vectors of diseases and pose threat to their health. They have even threatened to resort to agitation against it.        
	Official sources said the Cuttack civic body had taken the issue to the state high court, which asked the civic body to go ahead.

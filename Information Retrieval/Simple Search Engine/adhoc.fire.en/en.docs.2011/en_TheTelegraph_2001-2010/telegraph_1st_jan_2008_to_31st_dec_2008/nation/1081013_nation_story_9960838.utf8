          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has said an automobile company would set up a plant in Singur following the Tata pullout.        
	Just wait for six months. You will find another car manufacturing factory coming up there for which we have already started preparations. It will take one or two months for us to sort out legal complications and administrative matters, Chakraborty told a television channel.        
	However, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said from Delhi tonight that he had no knowledge of another car manufacturer setting up a plant in Singur.        
	State transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, too, said he was not aware of any such development.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP relook at terror strategy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP relook at terror strategy
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani: Identity crisis?                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The results of the Assembly elections that were billed a semi-final to the Lok Sabha polls may compel the BJP leadership to re-examine its strategy for the big show.         
	There is a feeling among a section of senior leaders that too much stress on terror and inflation had not yielded positive results.         
	The party had stated at its Bangalore national executive meeting in October that it would focus on inflation, terrorism, agrarian distress and vote-bank politics in the next general election.         
	It had also said that of the four issues identified, terrorism would be the engine of the partys campaign. The Mumbai attacks further deepened the partys belief that terrorism was enough to sink the Congress.        
	But Delhi, where the partys main slogan was Vote for BJP to defeat terror, and Rajasthan, where Vasundhara Raje, too, ran an emotive campaign on terrorism, sent out a clear message that the majority did not prefer to see the national crisis as a partisan political issue.         
	Price rise was another big issue the party was relying on but the rate of inflation has already shown a downward trend and it is expected to go down further with the onset of winter. The government has reduced petroleum prices and more cuts are in the offing. By the time the general election is held, inflation may not remain a potent electoral tool.         
	Agrarian distress is already out of the mainstream public discourse.        
	The fourth plank  vote-bank politics (a sophisticated phrase for Muslim appeasement)  is anyway a permanent fixture on the BJP agenda.        
	Apart from identifying these issues, the Bangalore meet had worked out a massive plan for projecting L.K. Advani as the prime ministerial candidate. But the BJP is faced with a crisis on this front, too.         
	People in different states have shown little interest in him and the party has betrayed a tendency of localising elections. Its campaign in Madhya Pradesh revolved around Shivraj Singh Chauhan while in Rajasthan, it centred on Vasundhara. Chhattisgarh could not have been won without the Raman Singh effect. The trend had been evident in Gujarat and Karnataka, too.        
	The BJP fought the earlier elections primarily under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose appeal transcended region and caste barriers. Advani has not only failed to cultivate that charisma, his wild swings between moderate and hawkish postures have created a new identity crisis for the leader.         
	He has desperately attempted to concentrate on development and good governance but repeatedly failed to resist temptations of emotive issues like Ram setu and Amarnath.        
	He compared Malegaon blast suspect Pragya Singh to Nathuram Godse and then stooped to defend her. He often advocated a cordial relationship between rival parties in a democracy and at the same time continued to make the severest personal attack on the Prime Minister.        
	His interactions with the youth, a section his party has set its sights on, bear testimony to his vacillations. While talking to students from elite institutions, he mentioned the moon mission, Sachin Tendulkar, Abhinav Bindra, Taare Zameen Par, world-class education, employment opportunities, urban renewal, environmental protection and a strong and united India.        
	But his tenor changed when he addressed a BJP youth rally in Delhi as he hailed the divisive Amarnath campaign and focused on the anti-Hindu mindset of the Congress.

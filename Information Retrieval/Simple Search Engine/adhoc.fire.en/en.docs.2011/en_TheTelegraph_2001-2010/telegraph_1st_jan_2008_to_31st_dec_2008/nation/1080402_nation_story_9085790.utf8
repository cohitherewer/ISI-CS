	Patna, April 1: Lalu Prasads nephew, Anil Rai, has been arrested and his car seized in connection with an alleged attempt to abduct a doctor.        
	In his FIR, Ajay Kumar has said four youths chased him in an Ambassador  it belonged to Rai  and tried to stop him on Bailey Road near Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park last night.        
	But they failed to overtake my car as the road was quite crowded, said Kumar, the president of the All-India Urological Society and a former head of the Indian Medical Association.         
	The doctor went to Shastri Nagar police station and gave the officers the cars registration number, which led them to Rai.         
	The police picked him up from his Patna home today. During interrogation, Rai admitted that the Ambassador was his but denied any link with the kidnap bid, saying he was not in the car when the doctor was being chased.        
	My driver had taken the car out, Rai told the police.         
	Deputy superintendent of police Sridhar Mandal said a hunt was on for Rais driver, who is absconding.         
	Mandal said the police were also investigating whether the youths wanted to kidnap the doctor or just intimidate him. Kumar, who too was questioned by the police, however, insisted that the gang was trying to abduct him.         
	We are investigating the case from all the angles, Mandal said.

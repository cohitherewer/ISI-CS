	Cuttack, Oct. 5: For pandal-hoppers, the next three days would be safer than never before.        
	With the spate of violence continuing in Kandhamal and neighbouring districts, the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar police commissionerate has put the city on high alert during the Puja and immersion celebrations.        
	Flag march by Orissa State Armed Police force personnel in areas under 10 of the 11 police stations since last night marked the prelude to the five-day Dussehra that began today under the heaviest security bandobast the city has ever witnessed.        
	The police commissionerate, however, maintained that the flag march was part of a routine exercise in view of the present situation in other parts of the state. It was to instil a sense of confidence among common people, deputy commissioner of police A.N. Sinha told The Telegraph today.        
	Sources said 45 platoons of armed Orissa State Armed Police along with Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Quick Action Force (QAF) were deployed at many sensitive areas in the city. Special screening of bags and frisking have started at railway station, bus depot, markets and the 152 puja pandals across the city.        
	All the sensitive places are being kept under strict vigil and adequate security measures are being maintained at all religious places, Sinha said.         
	Those found indulging in undesirable activities would be dealt strictly, he added.        
	The city has been divided into four zones under a three-tier security arrangement that includes plainclothes policemen, police video teams, anti-liquor squads. Police aid posts were also set up at 26 places.        
	Police commissioner B.K. Sharma would monitor the situation from a camp office that would operate in the city till completion of immersion celebrations on October 10.        
	A sizeable number of security personnel have been deployed from the local police stations while the rest have come from different battalions of the Orissa State Armed Police force.        
	According to an official release, five additional superintendents of police, 20 deputy superintendents of police and assistant commandants, 38 inspectors, 344 sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors have been pressed into service.         
	The traffic police are also taking no chances and have informed the local puja committees and organisers of soire to ensure disciplined parking and free flow of traffic in roads near their mandaps.         
	During the festival, 384 traffic constables and 350 homeguards have been deployed for traffic management.

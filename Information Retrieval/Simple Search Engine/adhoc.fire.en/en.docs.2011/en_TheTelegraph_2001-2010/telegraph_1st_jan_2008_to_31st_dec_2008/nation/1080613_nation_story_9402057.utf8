          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, June 12: A teenage girl died under the wheels of a government bus this morning, minutes after she had left home riding pillion on her fathers motorcycle to submit the form she had filled in to enter college.        
	Nineteen-year-old Mali Sarkars body had to be pulled out from under the wheels but not before local residents and passers-by had managed to push the Siliguri-bound bus a little.        
	Her father Haradhan, 48, was admitted to Behrampore New General Hospital with head injuries and a fractured right hand.        
	Police said Mali and her father were thrown off their bike on the Behrampore-Banjetia road, about 200km from Calcutta, after being hit by another motorcycle coming from the opposite direction around 11.        
	We are yet to trace the motorbike owner who hit Sarkars vehicle. But preliminary investigations suggest the road full of craters contributed to the mishap, said deputy superintendent Santa Mitra.        
	Residents said the public works department had ignored repeated reminders to repair the stretch, barely 5km from Behrampore town.        
	As we fell, the bus rammed into us unable to control its speed. I saw my daughter getting stuck under the rear wheels but couldnt do anything, Haradhan, a clerk in the district magistrates office, said from his hospital bed.        
	Ranjit Biswas, who owns a roadside tea stall, said they had to push the bus a little to extricate the girls body.        
	Mali had died on the spot, clutching the form she had filled in for admission to BA first year in Behrampore Girls College.        
	Others stopped a rickshaw van and rushed the man to hospital, Biswas, 32, said.        
	As news of the accident spread, students from three nearby colleges  Murshidabad Engineering College, Murshidabad Institute of Technology and an ITI rushed to the spot and started stoning the bus. A mob soon gathered and set the bus on fire.         
	Residents also stoned another government bus that passed around the same time.         
	The mob later blocked the road for half an hour, demanding the arrest of the driver who had fled the scene.        
	When we reached the spot around 11.30, we saw the bus was in flames and people blocking the road. We called the fire brigade and dispersed the mob but didnt have to use force, said an officer.        
	Suboj Saha, a student of Murshidabad Institute of Technology, said he did not approve of the mob fury but the situation had spun out of control. The residents were furious, he added.        
	Doctors at Behrampore New General Hospital said Haradhan, who had to be given 12 stitches, was stable.         
	In his hospital bed, Haradhan recalled his daughters dreams.        
	My daughter was placed in the first division in this years higher secondary examination, he said, his voice barely a whisper.        
	I had promised I would help her continue her studies till post-graduation. But all her dreams have been shattered.

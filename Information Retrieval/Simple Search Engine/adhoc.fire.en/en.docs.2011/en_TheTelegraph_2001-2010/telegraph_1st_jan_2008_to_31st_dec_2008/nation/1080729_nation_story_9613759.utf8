          SHEENA K                               
	Raipur, July 28: Fifteen migrant workers from Jharkhand died in a road accident today on their way back home when their vehicle turned turtle near Balrampur in the afternoon.         
	The deceased include eight women and four children.         
	Nineteen persons were also injured in the mishap. Of the 19, the condition of five is reported to be critical. The injured have been admitted to the government hospital in Ambikapur.         
	The labourers  from Jharkhands Harhe village under Ranga police station in Palamau  migrated to Chhattisgarh three months ago to work in the Samri fields.        
	Sources said hundreds of labourers from the border districts of Jharkhand cross over to Chhattisgarh before monsoon to work in the farms, mainly in the paddy fields. After three-four months, they return to Jharkhand.         
	Todays accident took place around 1.30pm on a hilly stretch near Amajharia  some 500km north of Raipur.        
	Boarding the bauxite-loaded truck cost the labourers their lives, as they were crushed under the mineral when the truck turned turtle. The driver lost control over the steering while negotiating a blind curve and that led to the truck overturning, said a senior police officer from Balrampur.        
	About 35 labourers intercepted the truck while they were waiting for transportation to cross the border and get to Jharkhand. The truck, too, was onits way to Jharkhand carrying bauxite from Hindalcos Samri mines to plants in the neighbouring state, police sources said.         
	Of the victims, 11 died on the spot itself, while four succumbed to their injuries on their way to the hospital.        
	The Chhattisgarh district administration has announced a compensation of Rs 5,000 each to the family member of those killed and Rs 2,000 each for the injured.

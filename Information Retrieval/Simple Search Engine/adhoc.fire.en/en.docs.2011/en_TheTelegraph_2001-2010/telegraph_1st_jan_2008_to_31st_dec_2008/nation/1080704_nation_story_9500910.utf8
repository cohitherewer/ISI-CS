          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 3: Ferroalloys Industries drawing power from Northeastern Electricity Supply Company of Orissa (Nesco) have moved the high court against a sudden denial of benefit of 25 per cent discount on energy charges under special agreement-based tariff.         
	The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) withdrew this concession to ferroalloys industries while fixing a retail supply tariff pleaded by Nesco for 2008-09 in March this year.         
	The concession of 25 per cent discount on energy charges (up to 50 per cent load factor) was granted for 2005-06 2006-07 and 2007-08.         
	OERC had order issued on an application submitted by Nesco on revenue requirement and tariff for retail supply for 2008-09. Nesco is the licensee for distribution of power in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Bhadrak, Balasore and parts of Jajpur.         
	Ferro Alloys Corporation and three other such power intensive industries have filed a petition challenging the Nesco application.         
	Instead of reduction of cross subsidy OERC had enhanced the cross subsidy, the petition regretted alleging violation of provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 and National Tariff Policy.         
	In the absence of determination of the supply cost, the question of reduction and elimination of cross subsidy cannot be implemented.         
	Furthermore, the OERC has neither fixed the period of elimination of cross subsidy nor reduced the subsidy as envisaged among their mandatory provisions, the petition filed yesterday argues.         
	Power constitutes almost 50 per cent of the raw material of a ferroalloys industry and uninterrupted power at competitive rates is essential for sustenance.         
	The commission has not increased tariff for any category of consumers, except ferroalloys power intensive industries.        
	Meanwhile, the advocate-general has sought a reply to the petition from the state energy department.         
	The petition is expected to come up for hearing in the high court by next week.

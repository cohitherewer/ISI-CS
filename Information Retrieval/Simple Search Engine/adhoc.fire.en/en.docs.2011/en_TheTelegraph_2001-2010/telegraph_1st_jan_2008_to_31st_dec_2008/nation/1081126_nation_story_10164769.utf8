	Panchkula, Nov. 25: The army has handed over to police two medical corps personnel accused of raping an airmans wife at the Western Command hospital and trying to buy her silence with footage of the assault.        
	The duo, along with another accused Raj, allegedly molested and raped the 35-year-old when she went to the hospital for physiotherapy on her shoulder on Saturday.        
	The victims husband had recently been transferred to the Jamnagar air force station in Gujarat and she was expected to join him soon. She was staying at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory with her two children.        
	Both the accused were produced in court today and remanded in police custody for two days. A hunt is on for the third accused who allegedly recorded the rape.        
	The duo, Hottam Singh and Iftikhar Khan, were employed in the army medical corps. Singh was the documentation in-charge in the neurosurgical ward and Khan was employed as a nursing attendant seven months ago.        
	In her statement to the police, the woman said that after her treatment, she went to visit a relative in the hospital. On the way, she was apparently hustled into a room by Singh and Khan and raped. Raj molested her and recorded the assault by the others on a video camera, the complaint said.         
	The woman said Singh later threatened her not to mention the incident to anyone. He said they would make the recording public if she went to the police.She knew all of them as they had become friendly when her husband was hospitalised for nearly two months after an accident in February, a policeman said.

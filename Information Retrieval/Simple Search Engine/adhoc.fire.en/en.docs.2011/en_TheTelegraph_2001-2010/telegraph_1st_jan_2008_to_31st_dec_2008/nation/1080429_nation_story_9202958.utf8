          NALIN VERMA                                     
	Patna, April 28: Chief minister Nitish Kumar said he would relay the request to free incarcerated Nepalese Maoist prisoners in jails across Bihar as a gesture of recognition of the peoples mandate to the Maoist government in Nepal.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said two senior Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) politburo members, Hisila Yami and C.P. Gajurel, supposed to play a key role in the new government, met him at his Anne Marg residence asking for the release of their comrades.        
	The leaders had been in Patna on the invitation of the external affairs ministry and Bihar government to attend a seminar on Emerging trends in India-Nepal relations.         
	I have asked the Nepalese dispensation to furnish further details. We will initiate appropriate action once we receive the details, said the chief minister, adding: We recognise and respect the peoples mandate in Nepal.         
	Sources in the chief ministers office and home department disclosed that the chief minister was favourably disposed towards the demand.        
	But, such release would require an approval from the Union home ministry and external affairs ministry first.         
	The Indian dispensation may ask the new Nepal government to not support cross-border insurgency in India in a quid pro quo to the release, sources said.        
	Gajurel, on his part, apprised the Indian dispensation that there was no working relationship between Naxalites in India and their Nepal counterparts despite ideological similarities.         
	Gajurel who reminded all that the Nepal Maoists have come to power through electoral battle said: And now it is for other parties (read Indian Naxalite outfits) to take a cue from us.         
	At a media meet, Nitish Kumar said his proposal for high dams in Nepal got strong backing from the representatives and their Indian counterparts.         
	Both Yami and Gajurel approved my proposal of building high dams in Nepal to ensure water management and create hydel-power in Nepal. The Union minister of state for commerce and industries, Jairam Ramesh, too, approved the idea, he added.         
	The chief minister said that the Nepal dams would check recurring floods in Bihar, besides create a strong hydel power infrastructure in Nepal and help store its water resources.         
	We are always ready to buy surplus electricity from Nepal which it can procure by creating dams, he added.

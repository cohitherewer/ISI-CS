  - boat and buy in curfew break          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          People buy vegetables from shikaras on the Dal Lake as curfew was relaxed for five hours in Srinagar on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, Aug. 30: The Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti today asked the government to reveal its formula for resolving the land dispute.        
	We are sending our members to meet the four-member government panel and get its proposal. It will then be placed before the core committee, which will take a decision, said Leela Karan Sharma, convener of the body spearheading the pro-Amarnath agitation in Jammu.        
	The Samiti had placed its proposals before the government a week ago, seeking restoration of a plot of forestland in Kashmir to the Amarnath shrine board as well as autonomous status for the board.         
	Its other demands include an amnesty for pro-Amarnath protesters and a package for Jammu traders affected by the agitation.        
	Sharma today regretted that the government had not replied. He said: The government has taken no decision on this. We would now like to see their proposal first and then decide.        
	Officials said the government would suggest making the land at Baltal available to the board for three months a year without giving it any proprietary rights.        
	The Samiti, however, wants complete restoration of the land, which the state administration has said was never formally given to the board.        
	The government has to concede the main demand of restoring the land. The government should not be vague and its proposal should be clear, Samiti leader Brig (retd) Suchet Singh said.        
	As it waits for the governments proposals, the Samiti has decided to go ahead with its planned rally in Jammu on Sunday.        
	The Samiti held three rounds of talks last week with the panel set up by governor N.N. Vohra to work out a compromise and end the two-month-old agitation in Jammu.         
	The fourth round was put off twice because government panel head S.S. Bloeria was unwell.        
	The Samiti expects the government to yield to its demand and has been planning celebrations in Jammu once the matter is made official.        
	Suchet Singh today accused the Peoples Democratic Party patron and former chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, of obstructing a solution.        
	The Mufti had on Friday warned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against handing over the land to the board and insisted that talks should be held with the Valleys separatist leadership.        
	The government has arrested the four topmost separatist leaders: Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, Yasin Malik and Shabir Shah in Kashmir. Shah was nabbed from a hideout yesterday after raids on dozens of houses, including those of several mainstream politicians.        
	Three among the dozens of other separatists arrested  Asiya Andrabi, Ayaz Akbar and Mehrajuddin Kalwal  have been booked under the Public Safety Act, which allows detention for up to two years without trial.

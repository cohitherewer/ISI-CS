	New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): Tata Sky today offered to bring back the ESPN-STAR Sports bouquet for general viewing after Delhi High Court said that DTH operators move to take this out of the basic bouquet amounted to contempt of the court.         
	Tata Sky told the bench hearing an ESPN petition against the move that the channels would be restored within 12 days.        
	Justice Manmohan said: Prima facie, I feel it is a case of contempt.... It was consensual order (of the high court in May) which is breached.         
	The counsel for Tata Sky, Ramji Srinivasan, said there was no question of wilful disobedience of the courts order.        
	He said the agreement between both the parties came to an end on April 30 and it was not obligatory after the termination of the deal to carry the channels on the basic bouquet.

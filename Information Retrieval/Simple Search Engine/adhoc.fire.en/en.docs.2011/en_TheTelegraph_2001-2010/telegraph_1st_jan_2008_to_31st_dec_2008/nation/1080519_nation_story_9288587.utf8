	Sambalpur, May 18: The Sambalpur Bikash Manch, which earlier raised the issue of a false affidavit filed by Sambalpur MLA-cum-minister of transport and commerce Jayanarayan Mishra, has now alleged that Mishra is directly involved in rice smuggling to Bangladesh through Gopalpur port in Ganjam.         
	The organisation has also alleged that the minister of supply, Manmohan Samal, and owner of Orissa Stevedore Mahima Mishra are also involved in the illegal trade.         
	There were allegations that rice meant for BPL families in undivided Sambalpur were being smuggled with support from Sambalpur MLA and supply minister to Bangladesh, said Debashis Purohit, the manchs convener.        
	It has also said that the Ganjam and Sambalpur commercial tax departments have been in the dark regarding the trade.         
	Talking to the reporters, Purohit demanded a CBI probe into the high-level nexus involving Sambalpur MLA Jayanarayan Mishra and Mahima Mishra.         
	The two were spotted together at Jamadarpali airport few days ago on unofficial business where they landed their aircraft illegally.         
	The organisation has lodged an FIR at Sasan police station for the unofficial landing of the aircraft, Purohit added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 5: A teenager was killed and another was injured when a crude bomb exploded at Gopalganj this morning even as police defused a bomb planted on the NH-28.        
	Police said the explosion took place around 7.30am near a crowded market place in Bahora Tola under Town police station, around 225km from here. Rag pickers Nasiruddin (15) and Ashu Ali (14) were rummaging through the garbage heap when the crude bomb exploded. Nasiruddin, who was standing in front of Ashu, was grievously injured and was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Ashu suffered serious injuries in his abdomen and shoulders.        
	Gopalganj superintendent of police Amit Raj said: The incident took place near NH-28. We are trying to ascertain if the bombs were planted to inflict serious damage or to create mischief.         
	For now, the police believe that local gangs might have masterminded the blast. Raj said preliminary investigations suggest that the bomb-maker might have been a novice. The police also played down rumours about the bomb being found close to the ancestral home of railway minister Lalu Prasad.        
	RJD spokesperson Shyam Rajak termed the blast a prank and said local journalists were trying to link the incident with the RJD boss. Lalujis house is 6km from the spot. Linking a freak blast to the minister is far-fetched.         
	Two Patna photojournalists suffered injuries during a scuffle with striking doctors at Patna Medical Hospital around 11.30am.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Jan. 17: Unauthorised units manufacturing unsafe drinking-water pouches came under judicial scanner in Orissa today. 
    
	Carrying forth its judicial activism Orissa High Court directed the government to constitute a special squad and take stock of the manufacturing units and initiate action against those found to be violating norms. 
    
	Expressing concern over the unchecked proliferation of uncertified pouches in the market, the two-judge bench of Justices I.M. Quddusi and A.C. Parija ordered for action against them under Section 49(28) of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1955.
    
	The order was issued after a petition sought judicial intervention against the illicit units that were not adhering to hygiene and quality standards. Reports of people falling ill after contracting water-borne diseases were increasing due to the sale of these pouches, the petition alleged. 
    
	Three Berhampur based companies  Smart Aqua, Megha Industries and Surya Purifier  had filed the petition.
    
	Earlier, counsel for the petitioners, senior advocate Bijon Ray, had submitted pouches which neither contained any certification or the BIS and ISI marks. 
    
	According to the petition Berhampur had emerged as a hub of unauthorised manufacturing. Though nearly 80 units were engaged in the pouch manufacturing business in the Berhampur municipal area alone, only 23 had obtained certification. Unauthorised units were allegedly packing water into pouches without spending a penny, when at least Rs 30 lakh was required to set up an unit adhering to norms.
    
	Fake drugs
    
	The Orissa High Court also observed that the state had become a dumping ground for fake medicines and ordered for compulsory drug inspectors to be posted at the four border-check gates. 
    
	Two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty said: The sales tax department shall co-operate and provide all possible help at to the drugs inspectors for a prima facie check.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 11: A rapist and murderer whose teenage son spotted the body of his 10-year-old victim sticking out from under the bed was today sentenced to death by Bombay High Court.
    
	The court also upheld the death sentence handed by a lower court to a man who beheaded his uncle.
    
	Haresh Rajput, a resident of Pimpri near Pune, had lured the child who lived in the neighbourhood to his house on October 24, 1999, and raped and strangulated her. 
    
	He then wrapped the girls body in a bedsheet and hid it under a bed before going out to buy country liquor. He watched television till 10pm when his mother and 13-year-old-son Khushal returned home from Kalyan near Mumbai where they had gone to seek help for Rajputs alcoholism.
    
	Khushal spotted the hand of the 10-year-old sticking out from under the bed and informed Pimpri police after his father fell asleep.
    
	But the son, who was one of 12 prosecution witnesses, went back on his statement before the Pune sessions court. Testimonies by other witnesses and a medical report helped convict Rajput. 
    
	He was given life imprisonment in 2001.
    
	The high court today said Rajput should be mercilessly and inexorably punished in the severest terms and awarded him the death sentence. 
    
	A murder destroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless female, the division bench said. 
    
	The judges also noted that Rajput sat without compunction and remorse after he extinguished the life of a little girl.
    
	In the second case, the high court upheld the death sentence awarded by a lower court to Satara resident Dnyaneshwar Kulal who had beheaded his 70-year-old uncle Dhondiram with a sickle in September 2004, believing that the relative had killed his father using black magic. 
    
	He threw the headless corpse in a field.

	Ahmedabad, Nov. 18 (PTI): Hit by the global slowdown, diamond associations in Gujarat have decided to slash work hours at cutting units to five days a week for two months.         
	Diamond associations have taken the decision... so that there are no layoffs, Surat Diamond Association president C.P. Vanani said. We have already taken a decision to extend the regular vacation period by a week and units will now reopen on December 8.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, May 27: Rajesh Talwar, the father of slain Noida teenager Aarushi, was remanded in police custody today as the family demanded an impartial CBI inquiry.         
	The judge in the Noida court allowed a lawyer to be present during Rajeshs interrogation after the defence expressed apprehension that he could be tortured in custody.        
	But late tonight, his lawyer Ashish Chatterjee claimed Rajesh had been taken away to an undisclosed location and the defence team was not informed.        
	Earlier in the day, Rajesh had been remanded in three days police custody. He maintained that he was innocent and was being framed.         
	Wife Nupur did not appear in court for Rajeshs bail hearing but is believed to have given an interview to a news channel at home.         
	Senior counsel for the Talwars Pinaki Misra told a news conference this evening: The police investigation was shoddy. So, we want an impartial CBI probe.         
	He added that while the police counsel was allowed to argue Rajeshs (counsel) was not allowed to.         
	Once judicial custody is given, police custody is not given unless there are extraordinary reasons. This is against natural justice, he said.        
	The family was scared for Rajesh, now that he would be in police custody till Friday, Misra said. We fear for his well-being. Aarushi has died. Hemraj has died and as a cover-up the police have arrested him (Rajesh). The police may resort to tactics that are not legal.         
	Rajesh, who is an asthma patient, is said to be depressed and in a fragile state of mind.         
	His brother Dinesh said: We started with full faith in the police. We consulted the police on every issue. But everyone took our silence as a sign of guilt.         
	Dinesh claimed the police had promised the family they would nab the culprit and not make anyone a scapegoat. We were told that they were looking for the killer. I never thought that the rule of law would be circumvented.         
	The Talwars also claimed that the police had not even given them the list of things they had seized from the house.         
	The family had repeatedly asked what to do about the blood-soaked mattress. Who would want the mattress in the house? asked Misra. It is not a palace. It is a small flat. The mattress was lying in the next room reminding them of what happened, he said.         
	Aarushis friends held a candlelight vigil outside her house today.

	Cuttack, Aug. 26: With Orissa High Court affirming a Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) ruling on Cuttacks All India Radio recruitment process, the controversy over the selection of news readers has taken a turn.        
	The Cuttack bench of the CAT had directed AIR, Cuttack, in March 2008 to enlist qualified candidates, allegedly kept out of the final round of the 2005-06 recruitment. But AIR, Cuttack, initiated fresh procedure on May 30, overlooking the tribunal order. CAT directed AIR to rethink the selection. No prejudice was caused to the petitioners by the direction, stated a bench.

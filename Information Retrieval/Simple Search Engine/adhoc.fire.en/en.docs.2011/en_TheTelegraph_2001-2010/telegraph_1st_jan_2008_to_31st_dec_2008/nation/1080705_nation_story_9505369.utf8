          OUR CORRESPONDENT       
	Cuttack, July 4: Thirty-four months after Orissa High Court ordered the invalidation of the appointment of candidates who had secured less than 50 per cent in selection tests for ad hoc judges, the government has apparently made no effort to comply with the judgment, fully.         
	Consequently, seven persons have continued in service as additional district judges in parts of the state. Taking note of it, a two-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice I.M. Qudussi and Justice B.N. Mohapatra cancelled their appointment on Thursday, while the cancellation was confirmed today.         
	Selection and appointment of ad hoc judges for fast track courts have been embroiled in controversy since 2005 when some lawyers challenged the process adopted for filling up 15 posts.         
	Candidates, who had secured less than 50 per cent marks, were selected while more deserving candidates (with more than 50 per cent marks) were pushed down in the selection list by limiting their via voce test marks, it was alleged.         
	Acting on it, the high court had invalidated the selection of 12 of the 15 appointed in 2004 on the ground that they were made without confirming to the stipulations prescribed in the advertisement inviting candidates to apply for posts. The Supreme Court later upheld the high court order. That was on September 9, 2005.         
	Nearly three years into it, the order was evidently not applied for appointment against nine posts (2003) even as qualifying aggregate was reduced from 50 per cent to 40 per cent and qualifying mark in written tests (per paper) was brought down to 30 per cent from 40.         
	The continuance of seven judges in service, despite securing less than 50 per cent, was brought to the notice of the court recently. Acting on it, the bench cancelled the services of ad hoc additional district judges in Cuttack, Patnagarh, Aska, Athagarh, Jagatsinghpur, Jeypore and Sundergarh.

  - Jaya joins CPM alliance, robbing the BJP combine of another woman leader        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Dec. 5: First Maya, now Jaya  the CPMs dour general secretary seems to have mastered the art of tying up with the countrys temperamental women leaders, much to the disappointment of the BJP which once held the monopoly of hitching up with fiery female power.        
	Prakash Karat and Jayalalithaa today sealed a pact for the 2009 general elections between the Left and the ADMK, an erstwhile ally of the BJP. The arrangement comes at a time the DMK, whose Congress-backed alliance swept all the 39 seats in the last Lok Sabha elections, is fighting anti-incumbency.         
	Its hard-nosed politics, not personal charm, that led to todays announcement in Chennai. Just as Karat had turned to BSP chief Mayavati when the Left was isolated after the Samajwadi Partys decision to back the Manmohan Singh government over the nuclear deal this July, todays pact came as a result of the Lefts decision to break ties not just with the Congress but also key UPA allies, including the DMK.        
	The DMKs bete noire in Tamil Nadu became the natural choice  never mind Jayalalithaas past hobnobbing with the BJP or her brushes with corruption charges.        
	We have decided to work with the ADMK for the Lok Sabha elections. The modalities of the alliance will be worked out later, Karat told reporters, as Jayalalithaa stood smiling next to him. She confirmed the deal and declared: I am happy with the outcome.        
	To a question whether this would mean an indirect alliance of the ADMK with the BSP, Karat clarified that so far his party had a tie-up only with the Telugu Desam Party and the Janata Dal (Secular).         
	Karat chose not to reply to a question on who would be the fronts candidate for Prime Minister. Both Mayavati and Jayalalithaa have prime ministerial ambitions.        
	But the most disappointed was the BJP whose separation streak with women ranging from Uma Bharti to Mamata Banerjee to Jayalalithaa stretches unbroken. Leaders of the Tamil Nadu BJP were hoping that Jayalalithaa would at least wait for the results of the six Assembly elections before finalising her course of action.         
	The BJPs hopes were raised when Narendra Modi and Jayalalithaa met in January for what was then considered a patch-up, but nothing came of it eventually.        
	Not that the CPM is overjoyed. It must be difficult for Karat and the party to swallow the righteous indignation with which they had launched many an attack on the ADMK leader earlier.        
	The Left parties were at their vociferous best when the NDA government in 1999 shifted corruption cases against the former Tamil Nadu chief minister from a special court to a normal court.        
	When Jayalalithaa was chief minister, the Left didnt spare her either, accusing her of anti-people policies.        
	The CPM might still be wary since nothing prevents Jayalalithaa from joining hands with the BJP after the elections.        
	The 2009 election could see a three-way contest between the DMK-Congress combine, the ADMK-Left alliance and the DMDK led by actor-politician Vijayakanth. Which way the PMK swings could prove to be a decisive factor.        
	Although the DMK is busy wooing the PMK back, it is most likely to jump on to the ADMK bandwagon, which now consists of the CPM, CPI and the MDMK. If it does, all parties barring the Congress that had fought the 2004 Lok Sabha elections with the DMK would have changed sides.

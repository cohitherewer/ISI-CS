                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shrapnel gift for brother
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Lawyers try to catch a glimpse of the blast site on the CJM court premises in Guwahati                                  
	Guwahati, Oct. 30: Umesh Chhetri had stopped at Ganeshguri market to pick up a gift for his sister when the bomb went off.        
	He felt a stinging pain. A shrapnel had grazed him just below the left ear.        
	He was lucky. It was only a minor cut and he could make it to his sisters place for the paanch rangi  yellow, green, red, blue and white  tika.        
	Gautam Sarkar wasnt so fortunate.        
	He, too, had stopped at the market to pick up a bhaiphota gift for his sister. Hours later he was at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, along with fellow Bengali Hiralal Biswas.        
	Both had missed out on the phota  the mark a sister puts on her brothers forehead as a shield against Yama, the god of death.        
	Chiranjib Saha, too, was in hospital. An engineer with a telecom firm, Saha was planning to visit his sister in the evening after office but the blasts cut short his plans. He was on his way to office near Ganeshguri when the bomb went off.        
	Still, they were lucky to survive, as Umesh said, ear bandaged, wincing in pain. It was my sisters prayer that saved me.        
	But the blasts ripped the festive mood among Bengalis and Nepalis who make up a sizeable chunk of the citys population.        
	My sister was delighted to see me alive, but none of us was in the mood for celebrations any longer. I didnt even buy any gift for her, Umesh said.        
	Everything went haywire after the blasts. I got stuck in my office in Ganeshguri, said Atul Laskar.        
	Laskar had planned to go over to his sisters place and had told his office he would be taking half-a-day off. I was just preparing to leave when there was a huge sound, he said. Our building shook.        
	Worse, mobile phone lines jammed. I couldnt even call her up to say I may not be able to make it this year, Laskar said.        
	The clogged network also deprived Anirban Basu from calling up his sister Rupasree, who lives in California. But I have sent her a mail, he said.        
	For others like Tapan Dey, it was the curfew that played spoilsport. Yes, the curfew upset all my plans. My sister called up to say I shouldnt venture out.         
	He paused a few seconds then went on: But so many sisters must have lost their brothers in this madness, God knows how they must be feeling.

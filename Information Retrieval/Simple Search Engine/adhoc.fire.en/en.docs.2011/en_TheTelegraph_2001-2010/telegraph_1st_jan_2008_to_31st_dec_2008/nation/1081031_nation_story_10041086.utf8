          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has sought a joint report from Kandhamal collector and superintendent of police on the alleged rape of a nun in the district on August 25 and the role of the state police personnel in the case.        
	The report that is independent of the state crime branch probe is expected in 24 hours. On October 3, the government had handed over the case to the crime branch following allegation that the police sat over the case for more than a month.        
	On October 24, the nun gave her first appearance at a Delhi press conference where she charged the Orissa police of being friendly with the attackers. Expressing her lack of faith in the police, she had demanded a CBI probe.         
	She had alleged that the incident had taken place in presence of Orissa Special Armed Police jawans who had remained mute spectators to her predicament.

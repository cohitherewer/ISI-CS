The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IB ticked off for prisoner lapse
                                                                                                               IB ticked off for prisoner lapse
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          A file picture of Sarabjit                                  
	New Delhi, March 24: The Prime Ministers Office is embarrassed that it was intimated about the death of a Pakistani national by the Pakistan high commission and not the Intelligence Bureau.        
	The PMO, which has been trying to ensure leniency for Sarabjit Singh who is on death row in Pakistan, was taken aback when told that Khalid Mehmood had died of a liver ailment at the AIIMS on February 12.        
	The IB, the premier spy agency, was in the dark about Mehmood who was lodged in Haryanas Bhondsi jail.        
	Sources said the PMO officials were livid. National security adviser M.K. Narayanan called a meeting with IB director P.C. Haldar and senior officials last week and gave them a much-needed dressing down, the sources said.        
	It is the IBs job to gather sensitive information and update the government on the goings-on in the country. Even the Research and Analysis Wing, the external intelligence agency, had no inkling about Mehmoods death.        
	The IB officials were apparently defensive at the meeting with Narayanan and claimed Haryana police had not informed them about Mehmoods death.        
	They said the police had jumped protocol by directly informing the Pakistan high commission, without briefing either the home or the external affairs ministries.        
	Ordinarily, it would have been left to the central government to inform the Pakistan high commission.         
	The PMO officials, however, refused to buy the explanation. They said the IB should have known from its own sources about the prisoners movements and not waited to be informed by the police.         
	The IB is supposed to have its moles in crucial places, including prisons and hospitals. But the agency knew neither that Mehmood had been shifted to AIIMS nor that he had died.         
	Mehmood was caught in Faridabad with fake passports in 2006 and booked under the Official Secrets Act, Passport Act and the Foreigners Act. He had been in jail since June that year.        
	Asked why they had jumped protocol, the Haryana police apparently told the PMO that before doing a post-mortem on a foreign national they had to inform his or her country.        
	In Mehmoods case, the Pakistan high commission had to be intimated so that it could supervise the post-mortem and claim the body.

	New Delhi, May 20: Unrest in Tibet has taken a toll on the Kailash Manasarovar visit that several hundred Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from India take between June and September every year.         
	The start of the yatra has been deferred by a fortnight and the first pilgrims to be allowed this year will leave Delhi on June 13.         
	The first two batches that were to leave between June 1 and June 12 have been cancelled, a spokesperson for the external affairs ministry said here today.         
	The government of Peoples Republic of China conveyed to the ministry of external affairs that on account of domestic reasons, they would not be in a position to receive pilgrims before June 21, 2008. In view of this, the ministry of external affairs had to cancel the batch numbers 1 and 2, the spokesperson said.         
	However, the Indian government was still trying to persuade the Chinese government to accommodate the pilgrims of the first two batches. There are about 60 travellers in each batch.         
	The visit to Kailash Manasarovar from Delhi, a distance of 865km, is conducted by the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam from the Indian side and by the Tourism Bureau of Ngari (Ali) Prefecture on the Tibetan side.         
	The Chinese governments request to defer the yatra leaves the Indian government with little choice because the local guides are provided by the TBN and arrangements for their travel and accommodation are made by the local administration.         
	The postponement of the pilgrimage this year apparently because of domestic unrest has taken the Dalai Lamas camp by surprise.         
	Tibetans have always had the greatest respect for the pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar. There has been no unrest in western Tibet. Protests have been in eastern and north-eastern areas, said Thubten Samphel, spokesperson for the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala.         
	Earlier reports from global private travel and tourism operators had suggested that the Chinese government was discouraging foreigners from entering Tibet.        
	The US state department has also warned US citizens through notices in its embassies from visiting Tibet following the unrest.

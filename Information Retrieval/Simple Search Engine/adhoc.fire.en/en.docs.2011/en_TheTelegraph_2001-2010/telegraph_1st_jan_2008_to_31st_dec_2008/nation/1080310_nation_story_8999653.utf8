          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 9: The Communist Party of India has strongly opposed the Orissa governments nod to Posco to use Mahanadi water, through the Taladanda canal, for its proposed steel plant near Paradip.         
	The Naveen Patnaik governments decision to allow the diversion of the Mahanadi water for industrial purposes came under heavy flak at the CPI state conference, which began here on Saturday. CPI general secretary D. Raja said the government should not allow the use of the water, as it would harm lakhs of farmers who depend on it for irrigation.         
	He demanded that the government withdraw its assurance. Raja alleged that the Naveen government was trying to push industrialisation at the cost of the poor. Bengal minister Nanda Gopal Bhattacharjee also criticised the Orissa government.        
	Taladanda, Orissas longest canal originates at Jobra in Cuttack. It links the Mahanadi with the Bay of Bengal at Paradip. Lakhs of farmers of Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada depend upon it for irrigation. Posco-India had obtained permission to draw over 3,000-cubic-meters per hour from the Taladanda.         
	Earlier, the issue had dominated the Cuttack CPM conference in December. The party had then passed a resolution to demand the withdrawal of the assurance. The Orissa Pradesh Congress, too, had submitted a memorandum to Governor M.C. Bhandare seeking a withdrawal.        
	The memorandum also sought the withdrawal of further assurances given to 17 industries, as it would also affect irrigation in Sambalpur  referred to as the rice-bowl of Orissa.

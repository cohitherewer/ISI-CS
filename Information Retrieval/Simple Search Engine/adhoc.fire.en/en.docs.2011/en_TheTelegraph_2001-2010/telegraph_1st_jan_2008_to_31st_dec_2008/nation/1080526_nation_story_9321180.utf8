                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Raje talks tough on Gujjars
                            
	Jaipur, May 25 (PTI): Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje today talked tough on the Gujjar flare-up, claiming thugs had joined the protesters in the violence.        
	It is shocking that dacoits and goonda elements, wielding arms and ammunition, have joined Kirori Singh Bainsla and are indulging in violence. Such things will not be tolerated, Raje told reporters this evening.        
	She warned that the Gujjars wouldnt be allowed to hold the state to ransom even as she appealed to the agitators not to be carried away by false propaganda and sit for talks.        
	Vasundhara hinted at a plot to stoke the unrest, alleging that a political party from a neighbouring state was instigating and pumping in money to fuel the violence that has claimed 37 lives over the past three days.        
	The government was ready for talks to resolve the issue  the Gujjars demand for ST status  in a peaceful manner, she said, regretting Bainsla had rejected her appeals.        
	Vasundhara said it was unfortunate the violence was raging at a time the state was yet to recover from the May 13 serials blasts. She said Saturdays firing, which killed 20 people at Sikandra police station, was ordered in self defence after an agitator snatched a policemans gun and shot at a constable.         
	She said the government had held several rounds of discussions with Bainsla and other leaders since the first round of agitations began in May last year. The talks had focused on a relief package of Rs 282 crore, suggested by the panel looking into the demand for ST status.        
	Everything was done with the consent of Bainsla. A letter recommending 4 per cent reservation for the community was sent (to the Centre).         
	She accused Bainsla of betraying her trust. I trusted his words and didnt order his arrest, but he betrayed.        
	Vasundhara claimed the Gujjar leadership was under pressure from those who didnt want a peaceful settlement. There is a feeling their leadership has been taken over by dacoits and goonda elements who do not want any settlement. Perhaps Bainsla has come under pressure.         
	Later this evening, the chief minister left for Bayana in Bharatpur, one of the flashpoints of the unrest, to take stock of the situation and try to start talks.        
	The government today denied permission to Congress MP Sachin Pilot to visit Sikandra. An angry Pilot told PTI: This is not the way. I wanted to visit the injured who have been attacked by the police.        
	More forces        
	The Centre has rushed additional forces to Rajasthan. Over 2,000 paramilitary forces, including the CRPF and RAF, have been deployed since the trouble erupted on Friday.         
	The army staged a flag march in Bharatpur, Dausa, Karauli and Sawaimadhopur. Neighbouring states have been alerted.

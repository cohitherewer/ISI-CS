	New Delhi, June 13: The CBI today formally arrested Krishna, the compounder of Aarushi Talwars dentist-father Rajesh, on the basis of polygraph, narco-analysis and brain-mapping tests.        
	CBI joint director Arun Kumar, handling the probe into the Noida schoolgirls murder, did not say what Krishna (in picture) was being charged with but sources said he had been arrested for murder, conspiracy and destruction of evidence.         
	Talwar was questioned in jail today. Pradeep Tyle, a friend of the Talwars and their business partner Durranis, was also quizzed, sources said. Pradeep, who had hired the car for Aarushis last rites in Hardwar, also faces a lie test.

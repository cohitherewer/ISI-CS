     A STAFF REPORTER 
   
	Calcutta, Feb. 3: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee has warned of international isolation and possible sanctions if the nuclear deal with the US is not sealed.
    
	We do not live in isolation. If we do not fall in line (and sign the nuclear accord), there may be sanctions. We will face problems, Mukherjee said at the 176th annual general meeting of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce today.
    
	He said India and the International Atomic Energy Agency were still negotiating the draft safeguards agreement necessary to operationalise the civilian nuclear deal. Once the draft is finalised, the UPA-Left committee will discuss the text. 
    
	The government is trying to stitch up bilateral and multilateral pacts with countries that could supply nuclear fuel, Mukherjee said, adding the nuclear deal will clear the way for energy co-operation not only with the US but also France, Russia and other nations. 
    
	My ministry is aware of these challenges and is making all attempts by focusing on bilateral and multilateral engagements for co-operation with source countries.
    
	The deal is necessary to increase the share of nuclear power in the mix of the countrys energy sources and ensure that India is not held responsible for global warming.
    
	It is very important that we think about the environment and our future generations. India, with 17 per cent of the worlds population, has only 4 per cent of the global greenhouse gas emissions.
    
	Mukherjee said India had to depend heavily on the import of crude oil and other fossil fuels. 
    
	Our energy needs will keep growing with our projected growth rate, which for the 11th plan (2007-12) has been estimated at 9 to 10 per cent. Oil prices, averaging $100 a barrel now, are a drag on our resources that could have gone into more productive purposes. 
    
	He also said: People are opposing the deal by pointing out that we have enough coal to opt for thermal power. These are the same people who had opposed computerisation in the 70s and 80s and look where we are today.
    
	Bengal gain
    
	Bengal is well poised to benefit from the growing trade with China with the volume expected to rise from $40 billion to $60 billion in 2010, Mukherjee said. 
    
	But to make the best of the Centres Look East policy, infrastructure on both sides of the Nathu-la needs to improve, he added.

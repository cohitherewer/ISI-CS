          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 1: Hum Bahubali, the first Bhojpuri film sponsored by Mumbai Mantra, a Mahindra amp; Mahindra group company, was screened here today, heralding the corporate sectors interest in the arena of Bhojpuri entertainment industry.        
	The title, Hum Bahubali, is befitting to the political set-up of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh where bahubalis (musclemen and dons) call the shots. Bhojpuri is also the language of the people in this part of the country.        
	Hum Bahubali would be released tomorrow in theatres across Bihar, Jharkhand, Mumbai, eastern UP, Punjab and Delhi. Incidentally, it is the first movie to be screened under the Mumbai Mantra banner.         
	Bhojpuri matinee idols Ravi Kishan, Nirahua aka Dinesh Lal Yadav, Amar Upadhyay, Rinku Ghosh and Monalisa star in the film directed by Anil Ajitabh.         
	Mumbai Mantra CEO Andrey Purushottam told reporters: We expect our first project would be to take Bhojpuri cinema to new levels of production values and excellence.        
	Though made in the local language, the film is targeting the national and international audience. It will be released in Calcutta during Diwali.

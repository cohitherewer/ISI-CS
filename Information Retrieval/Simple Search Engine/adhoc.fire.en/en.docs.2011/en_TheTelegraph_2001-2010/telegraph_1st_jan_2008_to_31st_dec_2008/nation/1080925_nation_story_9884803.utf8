          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 24: The Bengal government has requested German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry to wait for the outcome of Sundays political meeting on its licence before evaluating options.        
	The request was made by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when Martin Dlhouy, the managing director of the Indian unit, and Henry Birr, the vice-president (international relations), Metro Group, called on him at Writers Buildings.        
	 It was a good meeting, Dlhouy said after the interaction. Metro has called a news conference tomorrow.        
	The Forward Bloc, whose board had revoked a licence that would have allowed Metro to sell farm produce at its wholesale store off EM Bypass, and the CPM are scheduled to meet on September 28 to discuss the issue.        
	Industry observers hoped the government would find a way out of the impasse and ensure that another investor did not give a thumbs down in the middle of the Singur crisis.        
	Tired of waiting for the licence, Metro had last week said it was evaluating its options.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naidu thorn in Uma return trip
                                                                                                               Naidu thorn in Uma return trip
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            M Venkaiah Naidu and Uma Bharti                                
	Bhopal, March 17: The appointment of M. Venkaiah Naidu as BJP point man in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh is bad news for Uma Bharti who is trying to return to the parent organisation.        
	Uma, locked in a running feud with Naidu, has been accusing him of plotting and conspiring against her. After she quit as Madhya Pradesh chief minister in August 2004 following an adverse court ruling, she accused Naidu and Pramod Mahajan of blocking her return to the hot seat.        
	In the murky battle that followed, Uma was expelled from the BJP after she gave an explosive interview to a Hindi magazine. She accused Naidu of making a national issue of his wifes illness and claimed he had cited that reason to quit as BJP president.        
	Till yesterday, Uma was busy mobilising four suspended BJP MLAs loyal to her to vote for BJP nominees in the March 28 Rajya Sabha elections. Today, her supporters said she might review her decision.        
	The BJP is desperate to get the support of these MLAs to ensure victory for its candidates Maya Singh, Raghunandan Sharma and Prabhat Jha. For the third seat, the BJP is short by eight votes and faces a stiff challenge from Congress-backed lawyer Vivek Tankha, who has the support of the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and Independents.        
	State minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, perceived to be close to Naidu, waved off Umas review decision. Quoting amendments in the 10th Schedule, he said all 166 BJP MLAs, including the four suspended ones, would have to abide by the party whip during the Rajya Sabha polls.        
	Sources close to Uma conceded Naidus appointment was a setback to her.        
	Uma has also been disillusioned with her breakaway, and now defunct, Bhartiya Jan Shakti (BJS) party. For over a week, there have been behind-the-scenes talks between some BJP, VHP and RSS leaders to consider her return.        
	Some BJP leaders, including Kalyan Singh, are said to favour Umas return on the ground that it would shore up the partys prospects in the year-end Assembly elections.        
	One of the BJPs Rajya Sabha candidates, Raghunandan Sharma, had quit the BJP and joined Umas BJS. But he returned following differences with her on the eve of last years Gujarat elections.        
	Yesterday, BJS spokesman Narendra Birthare said: Raghunandan Sharma is a gentle person who has always stood for Hindutva and nationhood. Therefore, we urged the MLAs to support him in the ensuing Rajya Sabha polls.        
	Uma and Bhirtare declined comment on Naidus appointment. You will get to know everything on March 28, Bhirtare said.

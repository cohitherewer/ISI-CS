	 New Delhi, July 6 (PTI): The Central Information Commission has asked the CRPF to explain why it had repeatedly posted a lady officer in a male battalion as it amounts to violation of human rights.          
	The directive to the paramilitary force, which is exempt from answering queries under the Right to Information Act, came on a petition. Dr Asha Singh, chief medical officer with the CRPF, alleged that she was being harassed by male officers and had been denied salary for three months when she was on medical leave.                   
	 Mumbai (PTI): A married BPO employee has been arrested for allegedly trying to marry a wealthy city girl whom he had contacted through a matrimonial website. The 25-year-old girl, who was engaged to Suresh Harilal Panchal, the accused, did not know he was married.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Andhra Pradesh government has ordered compulsory registration of FIRs in every case of missing persons. This is a first in India, where such complaints are usually registered in the general diary, which means investigations are not monitored by courts.                   
	 Dubai (PTI): Indian professionals can secure jobs in the medical and IT sectors of Saudi Arabia, which is looking forward to India to boost its workforce, a health department official said here.                   
	 Kuala Lumpur (PTI): The detention of five activists of a Hindu rights group, arrested for organising a rally of ethnic Indians, has been prolonged because Malaysian officials said the march was organised in spite of the government declaring it illegal.                  
	 Patiala (PTI): The Punjab Vigilance Bureau on Sunday questioned former chief minister Amarinder Singh in a disproportionate assets case against him and his son. SSP S.K. Sharma said Amarinder evaded most of the questions.

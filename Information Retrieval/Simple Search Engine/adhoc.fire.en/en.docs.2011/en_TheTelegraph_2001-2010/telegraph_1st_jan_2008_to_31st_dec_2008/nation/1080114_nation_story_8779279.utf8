     CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Idukki in Kerala has become Indias first district to officially pledge to stamp out corporal punishment in schools, a disease that thrives across the country despite being banned in some states. 
    
	The hilly district has presented to the Centre detailed plans, using which it hopes to become free of corporal punishment in a year. 
    
	Borrowing terminology commonly used in reference to the elimination of clinical diseases, the district has said it will not allow a single teacher or administrator who beats a child to escape punishment. 
    
	Physical abuse of children was banned by the Supreme Court in 2000. Delhi High Court upheld the ban the same year, while Calcutta High Court banned caning of students in 2004. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh amended their education laws, in 2003 and 2002, to ban corporal punishment. 
    
	But a massive countrywide study by the Centre in 2006 revealed that the crime is rampant in every single district of the country. 
    
	The report on child abuse by the ministry of women and child development revealed that two out of three children in India are beaten at school. 
    
	People may ask what our initiative is about... after all, they may say corporal punishment has been banned by the Supreme Court. But you tell me, there is a law against dowry. That hasnt ended dowry, has it? asked Ashok Kumar Singh, Idukkis district collector. 
    
	Initiatives against dowry which have succeeded needed much more than just a law. Paper tigers are no good, he said. 
    
	In a voluntary promise to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Indias apex child rights body, Idukki has said it will not leave a single school untouched. 
    
	Idukki can become a role model for the whole country. Other districts, we hope, will follow, Shantha Sinha, the commission chairperson, told The Telegraph from the district where she is studying the promise. 
    
	Kerala does not have a law against corporal punishment. But the district will use Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act  cruelty to a juvenile or child  to punish culprits with a jail term of up to six months, with a possible fine in addition. 
    
	The task is monumental, but we believe we have a strategy which can help us achieve the goal, said Sabu Thomas, a lawyer who is on the districts child welfare board, which will monitor the implementation of the programme to eradicate corporal punishment. 
    
	Complaint boxes will be placed outside every school  public and private  where students can register cases of abuse. The boxes will be opened only by the child welfare board. 
    
	The district administration is also planning to involve the states highly political student bodies. 
    
	A team comprising the National Students Union of India and the Students Federation of India  student wings of the two big parties here, the Congress and the CPM  will be set up, a senior state government official said. 
    
	In Kerala, when student unions take up a cause, it invariably meets with success. This team of youths will be used to campaign against corporal punishment, said the official, who is assisting Idukki in its initiative.

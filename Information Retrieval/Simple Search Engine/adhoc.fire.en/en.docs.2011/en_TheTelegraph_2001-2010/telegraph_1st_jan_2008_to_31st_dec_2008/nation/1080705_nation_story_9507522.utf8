          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 4: The government has decided to reply to the Lefts letter that set the July 7 deadline but not before the Congress gave vent to its pent-up anger.        
	Congress sources said the reply by Pranab Mukherjee was unlikely to indicate a time-line for the IAEA process or make specific commitments.        
	The minister will send the reply as appropriate, said Congress chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily.        
	The decision was taken at a Congresss core committee meeting at which Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi were present.        
	Earlier, emboldened by the meetings with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress had reacted with derision to the Left ultimatum. Sovereign governments or political parties cannot be subjected to deadlines. We are working towards triple objectives: to do a nuclear deal in national interest, to carry along our allies with us for that purpose and to go to elections as per the constitutional schedule, said spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi.        
	Moily said that instead of sending a letter to the external affairs minister and releasing it to the media before it reached him, the Left should have asked for a meeting of the joint panel on the deal. The committee has not wound up yet. The (Lefts) action smacks of lack of courtesy. Are they driven by desperation or frustration? he asked.        
	On the meetings with Mulayam Singh Yadav, Moily said: Our support for the Samajwadi is not a new phenomenon. They have been supporting us from outside. Sometime back, publicly they said they would withdraw support but they did not give the President a letter. The Samajwadi is a responsible partner of the UPA.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Barack line for BJP
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani: For change?                                  
	Jaipur, Nov. 6: L.K. Advani rushed to adopt Barack Obamas call for change, but selectively  he wanted it in Delhi but not in Rajasthan.         
	 This government (the Centre) has nothing absolutely nothing to showcase as achievement. People are angry and want to punish the government. They want change, he told a poll rally here today, referring to Obama but offering little beyond the BJPs pet themes of terror, Muslim appeasement, Ram Setu and Amarnath.        
	The BJPs shadow Prime Minister said India had never sought change as desperately as it did now.         
	But he couldnt pack a punch into his call for change, urging the gathering as he did to reward governments that performed, like ours (the BJPs), and punish those that have betrayed, like theirs (the Congresss). Rajasthan will vote on December 4.        
	Senior leader Venkaiah Naidu echoed Advani, asking voters to think of change, again in Delhi. You are not safe, your money is not safe, your job is not safe dont even think of the Congress, he said.        
	Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, seeking re-election, had no time for change. She questioned the Congresss promise of building a new Rajasthan. What did you do in the past 40 years. You have no business talking of anything new.         
	All belligerence, Vasundhara added: The Congress says NREGA (the national rural employment scheme) money is sent by the Centre. Paisa kisi ke baap ka nahi hai (Its not anybodys fathers money.) It is our money.         
	Her campaign theme, Jai, Jai Rajasthan, mirrored colleague Narendra Modis triumphant election slogan of Jeetega Gujarat. Speaking in Modis language, she said: Its not an election. Its a war between Rajasthans humiliation and Rajasthans pride.

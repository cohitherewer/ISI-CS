          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 18: Tibetans began the second phase of their protest today, resuming the march to their phayul (fatherland).         
	About 250 marchers will attempt to cross the border in Uttarakhand into Tibet. The government of India has done its duty, we have to do ours. We have stayed here as guests and are requesting the government to let us return home, said Tsewang Rigzin, president of the Tibetan Youth Congress.         
	The Tibetans described yesterdays Olympic torch relay as a Chinese party and the high security as sad. Rigzin, who was at a prayer meeting at Rajghat today, said as his countrymen fight at home, Tibetans in India feel they should help. Over 2,300 Tibetans have been arrested since the March 10 uprising in various parts of Tibet, the protesters said.         
	About 200 monks and 50 others, including eight foreigners, started walking towards Nainital around noon. They will attempt to reach the Tibet border through Pithoragarh district.

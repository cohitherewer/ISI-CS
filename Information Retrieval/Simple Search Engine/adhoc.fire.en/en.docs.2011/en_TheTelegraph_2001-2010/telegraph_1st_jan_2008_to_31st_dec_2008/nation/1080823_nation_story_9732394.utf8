The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Warning: back to industrial vacuum 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Warning: back to industrial vacuum 
          OUR BUREAU                          The camp in which Mamata Banerjee is expected to sit on dharna in Singur being set up on Friday. Picture by Ananda Das                                  
	Aug. 22: Ratan Tatas warnings on Singur have sent alarm bells ringing in business with the CII saying a pullout could take Bengal back to an age of industrial vacuum.         
	Expressing deep concern, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said: Any adverse development with regard to the upcoming Tata Motors Nano plant in Singur will irreversibly hamper future industrialisation in the state and could take the state back to an age of industrial vacuum.        
	The CII statement added that a solution through dialogue was the most urgent need of the day. Law and order and stability are a must for industrial investment to flow and stay in Bengal, Banerjee added.        
	Ficci also made an appeal for talks, saying the Bengal government and Trinamul Congress leaders should sit across the table and work out a solution for the Nano project.        
	Sajjan Jindal, who is to set up a steel plant in Bengal, echoed the fears voiced by the CII, saying a Tata withdrawal would completely ruin the states industrial progress.        
	Some didnt read much into Tatas words, though. One was Venugopal Dhoot, whose Videocon group has big plans in Bengal. There is no problem with the state, we have made crores of investment, taken 2,000 employees and havent faced any trouble.        
	The concern is greater among BPOs and IT start-ups, which were drawn to Calcutta and Bengal by its new industry-friendly image.        
	Indranil Chowdhury, co-founder and director of Lexplosion, a Calcutta-based legal outsourcing firm, said: For an outsourcing firm like ours, it (the Singur trouble) will have a negative effect as global clients and potential customers will question the sanity of investing in a state not able to fulfil its commitments to investors.        
	However, Vinnie Mehta, executive director of the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology, said: The Singur agitation is an unfortunate event... but the plans of most infotech companies in the state will remain steady because of the many pluses such as cheap, well-trained manpower and lower operating costs.         
	Manufacturing firms appeared worried, with some painting a bleak future for investment in Bengal if the Singur impasse wasnt handled well.         
	Tata Motors is making such a huge investment and if the conditions persist, other investors will be wary, said Samsung India Electronics deputy MD Ravinder Zutshi.        
	Orissa offer        
	Orissas Biju Janata Dal-led coalition and its Opposition displayed rare unity today when they chorused that the states doors were open if the Nano plant shifted out of Bengal.         
	If they come here, the Orissa government will provide all kinds of support, industry minister and senior BJP leader B.B. Harichandan said.         
	The Congresss J.B. Patnaik echoed the invitation.        
	Their assurances come two years after Tata Steel was forced to drop its proposal for a plant in Kalinganagar because of an agitation by tribals who complained they werent compensated adequately for their land.

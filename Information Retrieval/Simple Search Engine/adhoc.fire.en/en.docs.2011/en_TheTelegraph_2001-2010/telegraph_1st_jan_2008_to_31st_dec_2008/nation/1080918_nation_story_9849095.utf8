	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The CPMs top party body today asked the Prime Minister to walk out of the nuclear deal as India could again face a fuel supply blockade and land in a similar mess that followed the scrapped Tarapur accord.        
	A politburo statement said conditions in the 123 Agreement were almost identical to the 1963 pact that the US had unilaterally terminated, forcing Delhi to run from pillar to post for fuel.

	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Uttar Pradesh MP Atiq Ahmed, considered by Mayavati as the face of Mulayam Singh Yadavs goondaraj, was arrested here last evening, eight months after he skirted a police dragnet and went underground.
    
	Ahmed was picked up from a friends house in the citys west by Delhi polices special cell after a tip-off from their Uttar Pradesh counterparts that the Phulpur MP was in the capital, sources said.
    
	The MP, earlier in the Samajwadi Party, was sent to Tihar Jail by a magistrate early today but by evening, Uttar Pradesh police had procured a transit warrant. He is now in their custody, sources said. The transit remand says Ahmed has to be produced before Allahabad High Court.
    
	Soon after she came to power in May last year, Mayavati vowed to punish the goondas who she claimed had thrived under Mulayams regime. Ahmed came in for special mention on the list of people she had threatened to target.
    
	A CBI probe was ordered against Ahmed, who has 13 cases against him, including charges of killing BSP MLA Raju Pal on January 26, 2005, in Allahabad. A prize of Rs 20,000 was announced for anyone who offered information on Ahmeds whereabouts.
    
	After being dumped by the Samajwadi Party, Ahmed tried to cosy up to the Congress but failed to make headway.
    
	Ahmed had earlier accused Mayavati of conspiring to kill him.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Raman sweeps red zone with rice
          SHEENA K.                          Raman Singh at the BJP office in Raipur. (PTI)                                  
	Raipur, Dec. 8: In the rebel heartland, the BJP has tasted success with rice.        
	Saffron flags today flew high in Chhattisgarhs red zones after the ruling BJP swept the election in the Maoist-infested Bastar region, which holds the key to power.        
	The BJP secured a clear majority with 50 seats in the 90-member Assembly, notching up a vote share of around 42 per cent.         
	The Congress bagged 38 constituencies and a share of around 38 per cent, followed by the BSP with two seats and a share of 4 per cent.        
	The clincher appeared to have come from the 12 seats in rebel-infested Bastar, with 11 going to the BJP in a surprise victory. The Congress managed to get only one.         
	In South Bastar, whose three constituencies are under the control of rebels, the BJP bagged two seats.        
	The triumph could be sweeter for the BJP since the rebels had done all they could to defeat the party, besides calling for a poll boycott, political observers said.        
	According to a senior BJP leader here, the partys terror card might not have worked in Rajasthan and Delhi but it paid off in Chhattisgarh, especially in the Maoist hotbed of Bastar where the government had mounted an offensive against the rebels in the past year.        
	Eventually, though, it was the BJPs promised cheap-rice scheme that appeared to have carried the day in a state where vast swathes are mired in grinding poverty.        
	The BJP had promised a kg of rice at Rs 2 to each below-poverty line family and at Re 1 to Antyodaya (poorest of the poor) cardholders, besides free salt to tribals.        
	The Congress, too, played the same card, offering a kilogram of rice to a BPL family for Rs 2 if the party came to power.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh appeared to underscore how important rice was in this election as he dubbed todays outcome a victory of his policies and a rejection of the Congresss false promise of providing rice at Rs 2 a kg.        
	Ajit Jogi, who had spearheaded the Congress campaign, conceded defeat. We accept the peoples mandate and will play the role of constructive Opposition.        
	Todays results shocked several heavyweights. Prominent leaders who lost included Speaker Prem Prakash Pandey (Bhilai), leader of Opposition Mahendra Karma (Dantewada) and state BJP chief Vishnudeo Sai, state Congress chief Dhanendra Sahu (Abhanpur).

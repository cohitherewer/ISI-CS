          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said powerful economies in the world should come forward to shield developing countries from the global financial crisis but added that there was no danger to Asias Bimstec region.        
	He called for an early conclusion of a free trade pact among the seven Bimstec member countries which, besides India, includes Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal.         
	Days before he leaves for Washington for the G20 summit, where world leaders would examine ways to overhaul the global financial system, Singh said the G20 should ensure that millennium development goals were not affected.        
	Our message to the G20 will be that they must do everything in their power so that the process of development, particularly with regard to the millennium development goals, is not adversely affected he underlined.         
	At a news conference after addressing the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Co-operation (Bimstec) summit, Singh said international institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, and regional development banks, must be strengthened to ensure that the fallout on the developing countries of the global crisis is minimal.         
	Banks in India were well regulated and had adequate capital, Singh said, but added that the economic meltdown in the developed countries might affect growth rates in developing nations.         
	Also, because of the financial crisis, banks and other financial institutions are reluctant to lend money to the developing countries both for investment and for trade credit. That will, therefore, create problems for some of the developing countries in managing their balance of payments.         
	Earlier in the day, Singh said at the summit: I feel that we should do something visible in the area of trade and economic co-operation as a manifestation of our ability to do something big together.

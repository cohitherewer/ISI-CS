	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Students from the United Arab Emirates aspiring to study at the Indian Institutes of Technology will no longer be forced to travel to India for the IIT joint entrance examination, reports our special correspondent. 
    
	For the first time, the IITs will allow students to appear for the JEE from abroad. An examination centre in Dubai, the financial capital of the UAE, will host it in 2008. 
    
	We have been contemplating this move for a while now. There is a massive demand in terms of students from that region, IIT Powai director Ashok Mitra said in Delhi today. 
    
	Once the Dubai centre becomes popular, we hope students from Jordan, Syria etc. will appear (for the JEE) from there, he said.

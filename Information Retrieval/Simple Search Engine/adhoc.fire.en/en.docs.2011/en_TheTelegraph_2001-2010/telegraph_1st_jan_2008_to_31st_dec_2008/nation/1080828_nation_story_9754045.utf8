	Mumbai, Aug. 27: Twenty-two Mumbai customs officers cavorting semi-nude with bar girls hopped straight into police arms after a midnight swoop on the famous Khandala hill resort.        
	Police officer S. Darekar, who led the raid following a tip-off, said 40 people had been arrested from a private cottage, including the 22 customs officials 11 bar-dancers, a DJ, a driver, a caretaker and his wife.        
	They have been booked for drinking without a licence, under prostitution-related laws and for watching illegal shows of blue films and a dance show by bar girls, banned by the government in 2005, said a police officer.        
	Among those arrested were nine inspector-level officials from Kandivali and Malad, police sources said. The bar girls are also from the same areas.        
	The sources said the bar girls had been brought by Sony Choudhary, a former dancer at a bar in Kandivali, a Mumbai suburb.        
	Many of the officials were in various stages of undress. Most of them work in and around Mumbai. Some are connected with the Mumbai international airport at Sahar, said Pune rural police chief Ravindra Kadam.        
	Police officers said they had information that on Tuesday evening, several vehicles carrying the dancers and some government officials were expected to reach the two-storey bungalow.        
	Around 6pm on Tuesday, several vehicles and a mini-bus carrying the officials and dancers arrived at the two-storey bungalow. The party started soon after. Our team waited outside, Darekar, senior inspector with Lonavla police station, said.        
	The cottage belongs to a garment exporter based in Mumbai. The police have seized pornographic CDs, liquor bottles and Rs 80,000 in cash the customs officers had given to the bar girls.        
	A search is on to find out if narcotic drugs were used during the party.        
	One Raju Bibbas Bharundev Choudhary made the arrangements for the customs officials. We are trying to ascertain who engaged him  the officials or any of their beneficiaries. We are probing whether this party was a payment in lieu of any illegal aid extended by the customs officials to someone, Darekar said.        
	Choudhary, known for organising rave parties in Mumbais Page 3 circuit, had been arrested last year in connection with a Pune party from where several college students and upcoming models were arrested.

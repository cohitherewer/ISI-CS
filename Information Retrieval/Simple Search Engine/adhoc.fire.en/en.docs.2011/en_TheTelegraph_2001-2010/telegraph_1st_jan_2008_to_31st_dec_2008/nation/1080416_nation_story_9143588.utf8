                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     British charity fires Christian bias charge
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, April 15: Christians are being persecuted in India, a British charity claimed today.         
	Although by no means one of the worst countries in the world for persecution of Christians  India ranks 30 in a league table of 50 offenders  Open Doors, a charity based in Witney, Oxfordshire, said today it wanted to raise awareness of a growing problem.         
	For now, the charity is not calling on UK Christians to boycott holidays in India but instead recommends writing letters to members of Parliament and generally protesting about the treatment of their co-religionists.         
	A spokesman for the charity told The Telegraph that an estimated 200 million Christians around the world were facing varying degrees of persecution.         
	Open Doors supports persecuted Christians, he said.         
	North Korea heads the table, as a place where Christians face severe persecution, followed by Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Maldives, classified as countries where Christians face oppression.         
	Pakistan is ranked 17th while Bhutan is 7th. Bangladesh is better for Christians apparently  it is ranked 44th.         
	The charity, which wants to be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a right-wing fundamentalist organisation, is not calling for a boycott of the 50 worst offenders. But it urges tourists to be aware of their record.         
	The Anglican Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Rt Rev Alan Smith, said: For many years, I have tried to make ethical decisions about where I take my holidays and I would encourage all Christians to do the same. We also need to support our fellow Christians in other countries, many of whom are suffering or whose lives are under threat.         
	Eddie Lyle, chief executive of Open Doors UK and Ireland, said: Sun, sea, sand and persecution would be an appropriate adage here. The image many of us have in our minds of these gorgeous locations is one of sandy beaches, palm trees and exotic cultural treasures. But the reality for those people living there wishing to express their faith openly and responsibly is very different from how the brochures portray things.         
	He added: Christians commonly experience discrimination in the workplace and in education, are abused physically and emotionally, cannot hold church services, are thrown into jail and  all too often  murdered.         
	Steve Gaukroger, chairman of Open Doors council of reference, said: These days we routinely make decisions about important ethical issues such as the impact food-miles have on global warming. Given the appalling ways that our Christian brothers and sisters are being treated in many places around the world, we need to apply similar criteria to our holiday destinations, too.         
	Open Doors, whose survey of persecution is contained in its latest annual report, is critical of India.         
	In the largest democracy in the world, seven states now have anti-conversion laws which are being increasingly used by Hindu ultra-nationalists to harass Christians, it said. Reports of threats against pastors, false arrests, beatings and even murder have been increasing, now averaging one incident every three days. Many of the Dalits, the untouchable caste of Hinduism, are converting to Christianity. This is one reason why Hindu nationalists are targeting Christians.         
	It suggests prayer, so that Christians will receive justice and be given the same treatment as Hindus by the government.

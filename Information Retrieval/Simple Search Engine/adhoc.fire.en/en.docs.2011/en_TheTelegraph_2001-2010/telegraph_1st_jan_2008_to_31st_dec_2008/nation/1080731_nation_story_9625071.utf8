	Patna, July 30: A day after Lalu Prasad inaugurated the Rs 1,417crore railway wheel factory at Bela in his Chapra Lok Sabha constituency, Nitish Kumar today lambasted the railway minister stating that the latter was only interested in the development of his ghar (home) and sasural (in-laws place).        
	Lalu Prasads visible contribution is the Phulwaria-Selarkala-Hajipur Passenger the people describe as Lalu Sasural Express, said the Bihar chief minister. There is no leader across the world who can outsmart Lalu Prasad when it comes to dishing out half-baked truths.        
	Phulwaria is Lalu Prasads ancestral home, while Selarkala is Rabri Devis village.         
	Countering the railway ministers allegation that the JD(U) government was not co-operating with the railways in acquiring land, the chief minister counter-attacked by asking: How did he manage to inaugurate a factory in Bela if the government did not co-operate?         
	Nitish Kumar took the occasion to remind all of the time when he was the railway minister and former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had laid the foundation stone of a railway coach factory at Harnaut in 2003. But, Lalu Prasad has conveniently forgotten it, Nitish said.        
	Incidentally, Harnaut is the ancestral village of Nitish Kumar.         
	The chief minister also reminded the reporters that Lalu Prasad had not invited government representatives in any railways functions. He (Lalu) has forgotten that the railways had given an opportunity to Rabri Devi to share the dais with the former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee, when I was the railway minister. I always invited the government to maintain transparency, he added.         
	In Bihar, Lalu Prasad uses railway functions to deliver political speeches. But, in other states, he remembers to call the government representatives. Nitish Kumar refused to accept that the railways was making profit with Lalu Prasad at its helm. Where is the profit going? Where is it being invested? the chief minister sough to know.

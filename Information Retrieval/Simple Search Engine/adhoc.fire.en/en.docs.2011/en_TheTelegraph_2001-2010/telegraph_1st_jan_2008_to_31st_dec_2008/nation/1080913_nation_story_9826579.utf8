          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was today given a military assessment of the situation in the neighbourhood, a senior army officer said.         
	The timing of the meeting is important because it comes after the revelation yesterday that US President George W. Bush has authorised commando attacks in Pakistan by US forces without Islamabads explicit permission. But no detail of the army chiefs briefing was made public.         
	For India, the development means that Americas war against the Taliban in Afghanistan is no longer a country away but immediately next door. Along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Army is already preparing for a blowback with the Afghan war spilling over Pakistans western border.         
	The US Presidents authorisation was said to have come after evidence the US claims it has of Pakistans direct involvement in the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul on July 7 that killed the Indian defence attache and the media counsellor among others.         
	Since the ceasefire with India in November 2003, the Pakistan Army had moved some of its units to provinces along the Afghan border. But Bushs authorisation of US commando attacks follows a conviction in the Pentagon that Pakistans army is incapable of or unwilling to pursue the Taliban.         
	The US has already been using drones (unmanned aircraft) to fire missiles at suspected militants in Pakistan but Islamabad has claimed that in two attacks this week, civilians and non combatants were killed.         
	Yesterday and today, Pakistans army chief, General Ashfag Pervez Kayani, and its military spokespersons have railed against the US decision.         
	An Indian Army officer involved in analysing Pakistans military said there was a real possibility that elements of the Pakistan Army could rebel against unilateral US action unless Kayani and the civilian government in Islamabad responded strongly.

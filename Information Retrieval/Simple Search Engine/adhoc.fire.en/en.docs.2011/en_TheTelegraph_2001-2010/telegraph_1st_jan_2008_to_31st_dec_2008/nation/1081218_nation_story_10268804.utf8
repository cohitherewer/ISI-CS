	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The serial blasts that struck Delhi in September have also been linked to forces from across the border, police sources said, quoting from the chargesheet filed today.        
	The 76-page chargesheet alleges a nexus among the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba, Simi and the Indian Mujahideen. The September 13 blasts, blamed on the Simi and the Indian Mujahideen, had killed 21 people.        
	The chargesheet names 27 accused, including Atif Amin alias Bashir, the alleged leader of the Indian Mujahideen, and Mohammad Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy, arrested on the charge of sending a threatening email after the blasts.        
	According to the chargesheet, 13 men from Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh and all the key conspirators were trained in Pakistan. The sources said the documents also suggested that the Indian Mujahideen was not based in India, implying that the blasts were not carried out by homegrown terrorists.        
	The focus was on establishing that the Indian Mujahideen was a smokescreen behind which the Lashkar operated to divert attention from terrorism originating in Pakistan, the sources said. It has also been mentioned that Riyaz Bhatkal, suspected to be a founder member of the Simi, and all the missing men of the suspected Delhi module have fled to Pakistan.        
	The chargesheet finds similarities with the way emails had been sent after the Mumbai attacks and the Delhi blasts, the sources said.        
	Delhi police, which filed the document, claimed to have linked the network of five arrested suspects to the blasts in Jaipur and Ahmedabad as well.        
	The chargesheet mentions that Mumbai police, which had interrogated Sheikh, had said that he had gone to Pakistan in 2004 and received nine months training in handling arms and explosives in camps organised by the Lashkar, the sources said.        
	The chargesheet, the sources pointed out, in effect binds all the terror attacks that happened in the country since 2005 and points in the direction of Pakistan.

  - Battle of the eloquent duo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Brinda Karat, P Chidambaram                                               
	New Delhi, April 21: Scorned by the governments most suave minister, the CPM today fielded one of its most articulate leaders in Parliament for a tit-for-tat attack, calling P. Chidambaram a public enemy.        
	CPM politburo member Brinda Karat told the Rajya Sabha that those who framed policies that excluded the poor from economic growth were enemies of the people.        
	Chidambaram, the Union finance minister, had yesterday made a veiled attack on the Left during his Kerala trip, saying those who opposed growth were enemies of the people.        
	People will decide who is their enemy, Karat said, naming Chidambaram who wasnt present, at a discussion on the rural development ministrys performance.        
	Karat wasnt done, though. Outside Parliament, she ripped into another comment attributed to the finance minister  that Left-ruled Kerala should learn from Gujarat how a state ought to pursue economic growth.        
	Its Chidambaram and his party that should learn from Gujarat, the CPM leader bristled. She claimed that Kerala owed its leading position in the social sector to the Left.        
	The two MPs battle of barbs forms a side show to the continuing brinkmanship between the UPA and its most crucial ally on the governments pro-poor programmes  with the rural development ministry playing a key role in the fight.        
	After a Left MP had alleged poor implementation of the Centres flagship rural job scheme in a senior Union ministers constituency, the government had replied by publicly announcing last month how badly Left-ruled Bengal had done on this score.        
	A media release from the rural development ministry disclosed that Bengal  the state that elected Karat to the Upper House  had provided each rural household an average of 18 days of work during the 2007-08 financial year against a target of 100. Perhaps to make it sting, Bengal was the only state whose figures were given.        
	Karat today hit back, citing the lacunae in the rural development ministrys schemes. She said that despite the claims of rising outlays, the money spent on rural development had fallen from 0.36 per cent of the GDP in 2005-06 to 0.27 per cent in 2008-09.        
	The CPM leader said a powerful lobby was working to ensure that minimum wages need not be paid under the rural job scheme. She alleged that the survey to define below-poverty-line families was a fraud and blamed the Planning Commission.

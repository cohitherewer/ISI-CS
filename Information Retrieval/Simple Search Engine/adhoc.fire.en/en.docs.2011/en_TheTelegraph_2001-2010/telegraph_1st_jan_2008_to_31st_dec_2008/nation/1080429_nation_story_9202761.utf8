The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Baalu row: Party rush to protect PM image 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Baalu row: Party rush to protect PM image 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Baalu                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: The Congress today tried to distance the Prime Minister from the T.R. Baalu controversy after Parliament erupted over the PMOs alleged aid to the DMK ministers private business interests.        
	Both houses saw slogan-shouting and walkouts as the Opposition demanded that Manmohan Singh explain the eight letters sent by his office to the petroleum ministry to try and speed up gas supply to companies owned by Baalus family.        
	The government did not respond but Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the letters had been sent to the PMO by Baalu and his family, and were forwarded (to the petroleum ministry) in a routine manner.        
	It happens all the time, Singhvi said. There is nothing wrong or unprecedented.        
	Earlier, BJP leader Jaswant Singh had told the Rajya Sabha that since the Prime Ministers conduct was directly involved, he should come to the House and clarify. He said the Centres argument that the PMO did not mean the Prime Minister was very curious.        
	Congress sources told The Telegraph their mandate was to protect the PMO and not Baalu. The partys main concern is that it doesnt lose the governments USP: the Prime Ministers unquestioned integrity and probity.        
	If the BJP persists with its campaign against Baalu, let the DMK answer, a party official said.        
	Asked if the Congress might ask M. Karunanidhi to drop Baalu from the cabinet, a source said: We wont but if the DMKs internal dynamics work for his removal, well be happy.        
	Baalu told the Rajya Sabha last week that he had put in a word with petroleum minister Murli Deora for allocation of natural gas to firms that he once headed and which are now owned by his family.        
	The BJP is not very comfortably placed since it was the NDA government that had signed the agreement with Baalus companies for gas supply at a concession. But the BJP is raising a furore partly to please ally Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhis arch-rival.        
	The letters to the PMO for resumption of supply came from S. Baalu, the ministers son and director of the King India Power Company. The NDA government had stopped supply after the DMK left the alliance, although the official explanation was that the company had not fulfilled the agreements terms. The BJP has asked the Centre to make public all the files and agreed to an inquiry.

          SANJAY K JHA                                               
	New Delhi, April 7: Former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha today dedicated himself to the Tibet cause and asked India to be ready for a conflict with China if required.         
	The BJP leader also exhorted the Dalai Lama to break free of Delhis shackles and openly fight for a free Tibet.         
	We want good relations with China. I am not saying lets have war with China. But if we reach a point of conflict over Tibet, we should be prepared for that eventuality, he said.        
	Sinha was speaking at a conference titled Tibet and Indias Role, organised by an RSS outfit called Himalay Parivar.         
	The Sanghs antipathy towards China is well known but the previous NDA government had walked the extra mile to improve relations with the powerful neighbour.         
	Sinhas radical stance is bound to raise eyebrows in the BJP, which has criticised Delhis muted response to the turmoil but has not gone this far.         
	But it was greeted with cheers by Tibetan protesters present at the conference.         
	Personally, I am dedicating myself to the cause of Tibet. We, along with the brave Tibetan activists, will not relent till we get justice from China. If need be, I am prepared to march to Lhasa in support of this movement, the former minister said to applause.        
	Sinha said India should review its position since there was no future for Tibet if it co-existed with China. The autonomous Tibet formula was invalid now, he argued, drawing another round of frenzied clapping.         
	I appeal to the Dalai Lama to break the restrictions imposed on him by the Indian government that he cannot do politics from Indian soil. The Indian government cannot do to him what it did to Taslima Nasreen.         
	Sinha said India had always lacked self-confidence vis--vis China but should change its attitude now. We are not an India of 1962 and the world, too, has changed. The feeling of weakness, of fear, of surrender lets give up. We dont need to bend before China anymore, he said.

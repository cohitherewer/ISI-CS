          K.P. NAYAR                          Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in Delhi. (PTI)                                  
	Washington, July 19: Long before Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh became neo-converts to the Indo-US nuclear deal, Shahid Siddiqui, the now ex-general secretary of the Samajwadi Party, has been engaging the Americans on the deal.        
	The Americans found in him a reasonable and rational critic of the controversial deal, someone with whom they could debate Indo-US relations without any ideological baggage distracting the talks.        
	Since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush announced the landmark deal in the White House in 2005, Siddiqui has repeatedly been part of a select, high-profile group of Indian MPs with whom Americans at the highest levels of the Bush administration have discussed the deal behind closed doors, its future and corrective action.        
	These discussions have been held under the Chatham House Rule that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.        
	By his admission, Siddiqui has held Bushs hand and told him that India will not accept the deal.        
	To be fair to Siddiqui, he was the only MP in one large delegation that came to Washington under the auspices of what was then the Indo-US Parliamentary Forum (IUPF) to take the view that, if need be, India should drag its nuclear negotiations with the Americans into the next US administration.        
	When it was suggested to Siddiqui that if the Democrats came to power in 2008 they may drop the deal for reasons of non-proliferation, Siddiqui was sanguine.        
	He argued that if India kept up its economic growth and remained open to engaging the world, it would be in the interest of any US administration  be it Republican or Democrat  to woo the country with better and more favourable terms.        
	On one of his visits to Washington, in the presence of this correspondent, Siddiqui told two US Congressmen --- Gary Ackerman and Jim McDermott, both stalwarts of the India Caucus on Capitol Hill --- that he was not being unreasonable in his opposition to the nuclear deal.        
	We do not know what is happening. The Manmohan Singh government is not discussing anything with us. How can we support something when we do not know its consequences? Our government is being secretive, he told the two Congressmen.        
	To Siddiquis surprise, both Ackerman and McDermott told him that they shared the same concerns then on the US side. The Bush administration was equally secretive and it was unreasonable to expect the US Congress under those circumstances to vote for the deal.        
	Siddiqui told this correspondent many months later that while the Bush administration had considerably shed its secretive attitude and co-opted the US Congress, the UPA government was being arrogant and refusing to be open with MPs.        
	After Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee churlishly insisted that the Forum should change its nomenclature to Indo-US Forum of Parliamentarians, the group sent another delegation to the US.        
	Siddiqui was fielded by the Biju Janata Dals B.J. Panda, chairman of the Forum, at a public interaction here with Americas corporate leaders, organised by the US-India Business Council during that visit.        
	The Samajwadi MP walked a fine line between his personal opposition to the nuclear deal and the expectations of middle class India from its engagement with the US in his answers to questions from American corporate leaders who were concerned that the deal was being derailed.        
	Americans who have briefed this correspondent about regular, structured interaction between Indian MPs and the very top levels of the Bush administration have repeatedly said that they have found their dialogue with two Indian legislators opposed to the deal to be extremely useful and productive.        
	One is Siddiqui. The other is BJPs Manvendra Singh, who has also been part of the Forums dialogue with the Americans.        
	With Siddiquis departure, the Samajwadi Partys big casualty of its engagement of the outside world will not be its dialogue with America.        
	Siddiqui has extensive contacts in the Gulf states and the loss of those contacts may mean more to Mulayam Singh Yadav in more ways than one in the long run if these contacts lean towards Mayavati.

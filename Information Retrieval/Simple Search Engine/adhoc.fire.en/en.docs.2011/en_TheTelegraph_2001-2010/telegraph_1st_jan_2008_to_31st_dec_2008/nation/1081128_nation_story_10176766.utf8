	Two more explosions are heard from inside the hotel, where intense firing rages on.         
	Around 5pm, 30 hostages walk out of the Oberoi holding up their hands. Police officials say 35 more hostages are trapped inside.         
	According to the evacuated guests, Turkish nationals are trapped in a room attacked by the terrorists. An Italian national is also believed to have been killed. Ambulances carry away at least five bodies.

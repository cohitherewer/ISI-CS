          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 23: Two arms of the central government have  unknown to each other  been working on different drafts of a proposed law to regulate private universities for more than two years, potentially delaying the legislation.         
	Under pressure from the Left, the human resource development ministry in 2005 decided to dump the Private Universities (Establishment and Regulation) Bill it had introduced in Parliament in 1995.         
	The ministry decided to officially withdraw the bill before the cabinet, and began working on a new law encompassing concerns of the UPA governments allies, sources said.         
	But it did not inform the cabinet secretariat, which briefs the council of ministers before each meeting. The MHRD never informed us it had decided to withdraw the earlier bill. It is complete lack of communication, a senior cabinet secretariat official said.        
	Now, the cabinet secretariat has written to the HRD ministry seeking an explanation whether the old bill is to be withdrawn.         
	An embarrassed HRD ministry is learnt to have apologised to the secretariat, informing them about the new bill it has been working on.         
	A complicated and potentially controversial legislation needs time to be understood by everyone. Such confusion can only add to delays, the cabinet secretariat official said.         
	After a bill is ready, it is placed before the cabinet, which often sends the draft legislation back to the concerned ministry with its recommendations.         
	HRD officials accepted that they had forgotten to inform the cabinet secretariat of their plan to draft a fresh bill, but said the error would not delay plans to bring in the legislation.         
	The proposed law will cover Indian higher private education institutions and foreign universities that want to enter India. Foreign education providers at present need to tie up with an Indian institution to offer their courses. The planned legislation aims to check fees at institutes and ensure that they follow the governments reservation policy.         
	In 1995, the HRD had introduced the earlier bill in the Rajya Sabha.

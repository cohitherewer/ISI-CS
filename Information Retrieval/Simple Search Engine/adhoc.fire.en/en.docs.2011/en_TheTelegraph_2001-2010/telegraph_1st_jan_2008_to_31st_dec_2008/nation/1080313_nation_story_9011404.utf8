The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Notice to CS on sugar mill
                                                                                                               Notice to CS on sugar mill
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 12: Orissa High Court, suspecting behind-the-scene manoeuvring to push Badamba Sugar Mill towards closure, has asked Orissa chief secretary to reason why the CBI should not be asked to look into the matter.         
	The court wants the CBI to probe into the role of administrative officers as well as political persons in the issue. A two-judge bench of Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda yesterday set March 20 as the deadline for the official reply.         
	Orissa co-operative department had sold off Badamba Sugar Mill to Balaji Sugar and Allied Industries in 2005. But since then the 2,000TCD mill could not even 20 per cent of its installed capacity due to non-availability of sugarcane. The agriculture production commissioner had not allegedly prevented Shakti Sugars from procuring sugarcane from its command area.         
	Its work was also affected as licences issued for distillery, ethanol, sulphur and diesel were not renewed. The mill director, too, was threatened with dire consequences if he did not leave the state. Police had taken no tangible action in the matter.         
	These problems forced Balaji Sugar and Allied Industries to file an affidavit in the court. Taking note of it, the court observed: In view of the facts and circumstances, we suspect foul play. The firm wanted to increase the installed capacity of Badamba Sugar mill from 2,000TCD to 5,000TCD.         
	The company had announced plans to start its sugar refinery with an investment of Rs 40 crore and set up an ethanol plant with a capacity of 40,000litres. Plans included a 20MW power plant using crushed cane instead of coal.

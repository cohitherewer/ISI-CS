  - Call for harmony at Delhi meet        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 13: Stung by criticism from across the globe for the attack on Christians in Kandhamal, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today claimed that the recent incidents of violence in the district were an outcome of discord between tribals and Dalits.        
	Addressing the National Integration Council (NIC) meeting in New Delhi today, Nav een said the long history of ill feeling and suspicion between the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes on issues like forcibly occupying tribal land and jobs secured on the basis of false caste certificates prompted the recent violence.        
	Making an earnest appeal to the entire nation to fight divisive forces that spread hatred and fanaticism, the chief minister mentioned that Orissa had an excellent track record of peace and harmony and was remarkably free of casteism and communalism.        
	Naveen claimed that there had not been any communal violence in the entire state during his eight years in office except for the two unfortunate incidents in Kandhamal  one last December and the other in August this year.        
	Condemning such acts of violence, the chief minister said in the meeting that more than 1,000 persons had been arrested in the state. Of them, more than 500 were from Kandhamal district alone.        
	The Crime Branch, which is investigating into the incidents of violence, has made significant progress and arrested three persons involved in the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, said the chief minister.        
	Describing the rape of a nun in Kandhamal as a shameful and barbaric incident, Naveen said that eight persons had been arrested in connection with the rape case and prompt action had been taken against the laggard police officers.        
	Claiming that Kandhamal district did not experience any communal violence for the past 10 days due to presence of police forces, Naveen listed the measures initiated by the government to contain the strife and restore peace and harmony.        
	A special administrator has been appointed for Kandhamal district to address the long-standing problems of the people of the district as well as to oversee implementation of a special package announced by him a few weeks ago, the chief minister said.        
	 Mentioning the steps, including creation of 15,000 posts in police, taken to fight extremism in the state, Naveen requested the Centre to accept Orissas long-standing demand for deployment of four more CRPF battalions for at least two years.

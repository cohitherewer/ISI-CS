	Mumbai, June 8: Caught napping by the pre-monsoon showers, the Maharashtra government today waded into battle  not against the rain but the media.        
	As television channels splashed pictures of streets waterlogged after yesterdays showers along with old clippings of floods, authorities went on the offensive.        
	The government will take action as it deems fit against news channels who show old footage of floods without marking it file, said state relief and rehabilitation chief M. Tamesh Kumar. Such footage often creates unnecessary public panic which results in unwarranted situations.        
	Last year, too, the state government had warned news channels against running old clippings without mentioning the words file footage.        
	Kumar said most channels were more or less careful but some turn a blind eye.        
	We are keeping a close watch to nail offenders, he added.        
	The warning came a day after just 15 minutes of pre-monsoon showers left parts of the countrys commercial capital flooded.        
	It took commuters three-and-a-half hours to crawl from Borivli to Santa Cruz  a distance normally covered in an hour.        
	A Western Railway spokesperson said the downpour delayed many long-distance trains. Flights were delayed by five minutes to half an hour.        
	Kumar said under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, anybody spreading false information could be jailed for a year or slapped a heavy fine.        
	The Centre came out with the act to tackle such incidents last year. It will ensure punishment for giving any false information about the monsoon, he told PTI.        
	Offenders could also be tried under the Indian Penal Code, which, too, Kumar said, had provisions for tough action against people spreading rumours, hoaxes or unsubstantiated news.        
	The state government, he added, is taking steps to ensure that people get correct information about rain and avoid panic.        
	No news channel would officially comment on the governments warning. But sources in the top management of both English and Hindi channels said it might be possible that at times an old footage had been used without the file logo.        
	But it is usually an act of oversight under deadline pressure, and not with any malicious intent, said a source in a Mumbai-based news channel.        
	Besides, the voiceovers on the footage also indicate that the pictures used in the story are those of past incidents. I think the government, being on the back foot as it is, is only trying to distract viewers from the main issue, the source added.

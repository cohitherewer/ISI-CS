          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 8: The Orissa government has urged the Centre to compensate the states revenue loss on account of delay in revision of coal royalty and phasing out of central sales tax.        
	The government has also urged the Centre to share the burden on cash reserves after the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission. In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the delay in revision of coal royalty had caused revenue loss to coal-producing states such as Orissa. The revision had been due since the past two years. The state should be suitably compensated for the loss of revenue, he added. Naveen also reiterated the demand for ad valorem fixing of royalty at 20 per cent of the sale price instead of adopting a hybrid formula.        
	Referring to a recent levy on export duty implemented by the Union government (on chrome and iron ore at a rate of Rs 3,000 and Rs 300 per MT, respectively), Naveen demanded that the export duty be passed on to the states since they bear the cost of environmental damage. Similarly, states exporting thermal power should be compensated by allowing levy on power generation or a certain percentage of power should be given free to them by the central power utilities, he added.        
	Claiming that states with low resource base like Orissa will be incapable of bearing the entire burden of the revision of pay-scales of government employees according to the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, Naveen urged the Centre to share the states additional expenses.

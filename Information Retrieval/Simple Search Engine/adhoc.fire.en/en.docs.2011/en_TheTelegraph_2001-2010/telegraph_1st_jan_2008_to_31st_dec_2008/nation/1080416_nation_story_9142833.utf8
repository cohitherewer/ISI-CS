          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Soha Ali Khan at a promotional in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, April 15: Actress Soha Ali Khan has pulled out of the Olympic torch relay, citing very strong personal reasons.        
	However, brother Saif and co-actor Aamir Khan are still in the run.         
	I fully support the Olympic relay and am saddened at the disruptions as well as the violence in Tibet. But I cant run because of very strong personal reasons, Soha told reporters.         
	She is the third celebrity to opt out of the relay, after footballer Bhaichung Bhutia and former IPS officer Kiran Bedi. Bhutia had expressed solidarity with the Tibetan cause while Bedi said the tight security for the relay went against the Olympic spirit.         
	Saif and Aamir, who is sporting a new haircut for the film Ghajini, will be part of the relay on April 17 along with tennis star Leander Paes.        
	There is no change in Aamirs stand, and he is a certainty at the torch relay, his spokesperson said.         
	In a statement on his online blog, Aamir had empathised with the Tibetan struggle but asserted that he would run the relay. I feel that the Olympic Games do not belong to China, he said in the statement.

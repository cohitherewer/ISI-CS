          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Hassled passengers                                  
	Patna, April 23: Railway passengers in Bihar had a horrid time in small hours today, as dacaoits raided two trains, while two others derailed.        
	Around 50 armed criminals stopped Saharsa-Patna Kosi Express near Mansi railway station under Khagaria, nearly 140km from here, around 1am today and looted 100 passengers for nearly 45 minutes. The passengers of the train travelling through Saharsa and Lakhisarai lost cash and belongings worth lakhs. The train had begun its journey for Saharsa from Patna station at 5.05pm yesterday.        
	The armed dacoits stopped the train by releasing its vacuum. Boarding the train, they asked the passengers to hand over cash, mobile phones, watches, chains, rings and luggage at gunpoint. An official of the Mansi railway station said 12 passengers were beaten up when they tried to resist the criminals.         
	In another case of train loot, 15 men stole cash, jewellery and phones from 20 passengers of Muzaffarpur-Bhagalpur Inter-City Express. Hari Prasad, the head constable of Lakhisarai Government Railway Police (GRP), confirmed that the incident took place around 4am today when the train stopped at an outer signal near Mankatha railway station near Lakhisarai, around 100km from Patna.        
	The robbers reportedly thrashed the passengers resisting them. A woman sustained minor injuries when she tried to stop the robbers from snatching her gold chain. Later, a case was registered at Jamalpur railway station.         
	In another incident of embarrassment for the Indian Railways officials, the engine and 11 compartments of the Rajgir-New Delhi Shramjeevi Express derailed near Sohsarai in Nalanda early this morning. Fortunately, the train had few passengers on board and was moving at a slow pace when the accident occurred. No casualty was reported.         
	East Central Railway chief spokesperson A.K. Chandra said the train that started from Rajgir derailed between Bihar Sharif and Bena.         
	Seven compartments of an almost empty train also derailed near Rajgir last night. No casualty was reported.

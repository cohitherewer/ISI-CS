	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Florida-based radiation physicist Sudarshan Chamakuri is ready to sign a cheque for $750,000 to help build a cancer treatment centre in Visakhapatnam, where he went to school, college and university. 
    
	Vizag is my place  and it desperately needs a cancer centre with cutting-edge technology, said Chamakuri, president of Nuclear Radiation Services, a US company providing quality assurance services for oncology and nuclear medicine. 
    
	He has pitched the plan for the cancer centre to the state government, hoping it will contribute at least through land. And he is examining options to raise additional funds for the project. This is how I want to give back, Chamakuri said today on the sidelines of the Pravasi Bharatiya conference. 
    
	More persons of Indian origin (PIO) appear to be ready to funnel their funds and skills into efforts in India to improve health care or education or just give to social causes than before, delegates said. 
    
	The funds collected for India-centric causes from the PIO community in the US alone during 2006 touched $35 million, said Inder Singh, the president of the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin based in Tarzana, California. 
    
	PIOs are also willing to lend their expertise. 
    
	Chest medicine specialist Hemant Patel and his colleagues from the Association of American Physicians of Indian Origin have offered their services to the health ministry to improve the state of trauma care in medical colleges and on national highways. 
    
	India lacks advanced emergency and trauma services of the kind available in the US. We believe we can make a significant difference in this area, Patel, the president of the association, said. 
    
	Association members will provide guidelines for trauma care, outlining procedures to stabilise an accident victim on site and transport the person to a health centre, and assist in identifying equipment for trauma centres. 
    
	A PIO effort may also help improve child care in India. Canada-based consultant Kasi Rao has finalised a programme that will take five paediatricians from an Indian medical college to Canada this summer for advanced training. 
    
	We will continue to support them for five years after they return, Rao said. These are junior-level faculty who are going to train future paediatricians in India. This is going to make a material difference to the lives of children here. 
    
	But PIOs have concerns about how the funds are spent. 
    
	Were ready to give, but what we want back is transparency and accountability, said Nirmal Pal, a Jadavpur University-educated electrical engineer who moved to the US in the 1970s. 
    
	I can tell from my experience there is very little explanation of how the money is actually spent, Pal said. He had sent $1000 to a non-government organisation for earthquake victims in Gujarat, another $1,000 for survivors of the 2004 tsunami. I never heard from them  and still dont know how it was used, Pal said. 
    
	We want to make a difference but the donations should be used effectively with accountability, said Singh. 
    
	Some PIOs also want India to help them trace their own roots. 
    
	Wed like to find places where our grandparents came from and help schools and clinics there, said Ashook Ramsaran, secretary general of the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin, New York. 
    
	Ramsaran, a third-generation Indian, whose grandparents went to Guyana as indentured labourers, is now trying to find his ancestral village in India. Ill need old records from Guyana to do this.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Marriott gets bomb wall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Marriott gets bomb wall
          NASIR JAFFRY                          The Marriott after the blast                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 19: The Marriott will re-open its doors to guests three days to the new year, but with a three-layer bomb-proof boundary wall that could give it the feel of a fortress.        
	The wall, 14-foot-high and 15-foot-thick, is capable of absorbing the shock of massive blasts and will secure the hotel building and its guests even if there were to be an explosion at the gate.        
	A powerful truck bomb had killed 60 people and gutted the spectacular five-storey hotel three months ago, leaving only cinders and a charred shell. Some 11 foreigners and 40 hotel employees were among the victims.        
	We will have a soft but grand re-opening on December 28 with 60 rooms which are currently being furnished, Khawar Jameel, the spokesperson for Sadruddin Hashwani and his chain of Marriott hotels in Pakistan, told The Telegraph.        
	He said the hotel in its second avatar would not be a soft target for terrorists and billions had been spent to ensure that.        
	Vehicles belonging to the general public will not be allowed entry into the hotel. Guests will have to get off at the entrance and walk in through a bomb-proof room in which sophisticated scanning equipment  imported from Britain  has been installed.        
	Vehicles carrying VIPs will be allowed to drop guests at the front porch but will have to drive out immediately.        
	Jameel said all eight restaurants  including Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Lebanese, American and Pakistani  would re-open on December 28. Some 150 more rooms will be ready in January and all 289 by March.        
	A landmark in Islamabad and a favourite with diplomats, government officials, businessmen and foreigners, the Marriott has a 2,000-strong team working round the clock to renovate it.        
	The burnt wood panelling, shattered chandeliers and charred furniture have been replaced. Power supply has been restored in lobbies, shops and rooms that are now being done up with exquisite paintings.        
	Marriotts kitchens are open and laundry services have restarted. Sales proceeds from outdoor catering have been steadily rising.        
	Hashwani, 68, heads the Hashoo Group that is known for its dominance of Pakistans hotel industry. The Hashwanis also have a real-estate business and are involved in the trading of cotton, grain and steel. Till cotton export was nationalised in 1974, they were known as the Cotton Kings of Pakistan.         
	The group also exports rice, wheat and barley.

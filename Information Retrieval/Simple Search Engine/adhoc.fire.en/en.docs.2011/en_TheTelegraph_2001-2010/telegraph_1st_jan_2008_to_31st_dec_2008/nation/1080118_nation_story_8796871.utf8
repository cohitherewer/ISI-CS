     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan 17: Two persons were killed and several injured, including policemen, in two incidents of clashes and exchange of fire today. 
    
	Two days after Gammon-India, a construction company, lodged an FIR against a ruling JD(U) MLA for demanding extortion, supporters of a panchayat mukhia (headman) gunned down one Nakul Singh, the local manager of Morban Construction Company, in north Bihars Siwan district. 
    
	Police sources said two motorcycle-borne assailants holding AK-47s reached the construction site at Shivpur-Sakra village under Asaon police station around 7am and dragged Nakul from his camp and pumped bullets into him. Nakul died on the spot. 
    
	Earlier, Nakul and his co-workers had complained that mukhia Ram Awadh Sahani had been putting pressure on the company to dole out Rs 10 lakh as extortion before allowing them to carry out work in the area. 
    
	Siwan superintendent of police dispatched six armed policemen from Asaon police station to the spot. But the jeep dashed against another vehicle, 2km from the clash site. All six policemen were injured. 
    
	We are investigating into the matter. Strict security is being maintained at the construction site, said Siwan SP Sunil Kumar. 
    
	In another incident, a Mohan Singh fired at his co-villager, Bhola Singh, killing the latter on the spot at Rampur under Sasaram muffassil police station in Rohtas today. Subsequently, the armed supporters of both Mohan and Bhola exchanged rounds of fire. The men at war also burnt tractors. When the police arrived at the scene, they, too, were forced to fire several rounds in the air and used batons on the warring crowd, leaving four injured. Police said Bhola Singh and Mohan Singh were fighting over a yajna committee. Bhola had ensured his competitors wrath by becoming the committee president and carrying out a yajna on January 12. 
    
	Rohtas SP Nayyar Hasnain Khan said: We have deployed paramilitary forces at the village, which is still in the grip of tension. Khan, however, said the situation was under control.

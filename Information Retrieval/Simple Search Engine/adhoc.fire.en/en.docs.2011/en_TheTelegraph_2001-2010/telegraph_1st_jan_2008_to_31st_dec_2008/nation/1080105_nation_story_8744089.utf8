	Patna, Jan. 4: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited, Hindustan Petrochemical Corporation Limited, Rollocon and a Bihar firm have grabbed contracts for reviving six of the 13 closed state-owned sugar plants in Bihar.         
	The companies emerged as successful bidders on a long-term lease, said sugarcane development minister, Nitish Mishra. While RIL bagged the bid to revive and run Motipur mill, the HPCL got the nod to run factories at Sugauli, Hathua and Lauria  all located in north Bihar.         
	New Delhi based Rollocon won the bid to run the Lohat mill, while Darbhanga (Bihar) based SS Infrastructure has bagged the Rayani mill contract. These deals, said Nitish Mishra, would fetch Rs 300 crore to the government.        
	The money would be used to settle workers dues in the closed mills and to settle statutory dues.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 5: Air India employees today threatened to strike work on March 18 to protest non-implementation of their demands.        
	The warning came as the state-run carrier received its fifth Boeing 777-200 long-range aircraft, christened Haryana, to be deployed for non-stop flights to the US.        
	In a notice to Air India, eight unions representing nearly the entire range of employees said they would go on a work-to-rule and hold gate meetings from Friday and walk out for two hours on March 12 as a build-up to the strike.        
	The notice said several domestic and international routes of the airline were either being curtailed or withdrawn in a systematic sabotage of the national carrier.        
	Air India officials said the unions were being called for negotiations and talks would go on to avert any protest action by the employees.

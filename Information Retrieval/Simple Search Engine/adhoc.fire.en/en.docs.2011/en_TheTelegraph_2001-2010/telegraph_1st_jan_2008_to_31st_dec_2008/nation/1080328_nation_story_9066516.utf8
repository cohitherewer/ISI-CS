  - lsquo;China tour put off not for diplomacy reasons rsquo;
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A Tibetan child plays at a school in Dharamsala. (AP)                                        
	New Delhi, March 27: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said diplomatic reasons had nothing to do with the rescheduling of his China trip, complementing efforts by officials to delink his itinerary from the Tibetan clashes.        
	Kamal Nath sought to set at rest speculation that his visit to Beijing was cancelled in an apparent bid to express disapproval at China summoning Indian ambassador Nirupama Rao at an unholy hour to register protest over the security breach on its embassy premises in New Delhi.         
	We have to cancel the trip for the time being, we will seek fresh dates, the minister told reporters, asked whether the change had anything to do with any strain in bilateral ties over Tibet.         
	Government sources said any suggestion of a strikeback through the visit postponement should be taken with a pinch of salt as it does not fit the larger picture of Sino-Indian relationship, that too days after the Chinese Communist Party invited Rahul Gandhi to Beijing for a landmark event.        
	Beijing has made elaborate plans to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Rajiv Gandhis historic visit to China, which transformed the relations between the two Asian giants.        
	Li Jinjun of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China had extended the invitation for the event to Rahul.         
	My trip has not been called off because of any diplomatic reasons, my trip has been cancelled because of problems in dates, Kamal Nath said.         
	Some dates were fixed, they were changed, again fixed and again changed. My trip has been called off because of my engagement here and because of the engagement of the Chinese minister, Nath explained.        
	The commerce minister was scheduled to visit Beijing for a meeting on April 2 to review progress made on the negotiations for a regional trade agreement the two countries had decided to put in place. The minister said Indias trade with China continued to be healthy. We are looking forward to achieving a record level of trade with China in the current year, he added.        
	Chinese ambassador Zhang Yan today met home minister Shivraj Patil to discuss security during the relay of the Olympic torch in India.         
	Zhang was with Patil for about 30 minutes, during which they are understood to have discussed measures to ensure the Olympic flame passed through India safely on April 17, sources said.         
	China apprehends security problems from Tibetans and the concerns have increased since a group of protesters stormed its embassy here.         
	Home ministry sources said the ambassador expressed appreciation for the steps taken by the Indian government to provide protection to the Chinese diplomatic and consular premises.        
	The home minister assured the Chinese envoy of continued co-operation of the government in this regard.

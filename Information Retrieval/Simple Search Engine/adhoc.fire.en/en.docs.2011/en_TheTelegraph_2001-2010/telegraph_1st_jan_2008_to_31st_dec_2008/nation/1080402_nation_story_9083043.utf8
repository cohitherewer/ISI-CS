                                                                                                               Weeklong toast to tourists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 1: The state is leaving no stone unturned to make Utkal Divas (2008) an occasion to remember for the tourists.         
	The state-run Orissa Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC) has decided to whet tourists appetite, literally, by offering a platter of Orissa special dishes at the 22 government-run Panthanivases from today.         
	We wish to make the day special for travellers  both domestic and foreign  with our special cuisine, said the marketing manager of OTDC, Alok Mishra.         
	The move was given the go-ahead by the state government first, while the OTDC took it up later. The Orissa special spread would be available at the hotels thrice every day.         
	Now breakfast in any Panthanivas would include traditional pancakes (read pithas) such as chakuli pitha, chunchipatra pitha, kakara pitha  to name just a few  and the mouth-watering chhena jilipi. Besides, one can also ask for the traditional dalama.        
	Lunch and dinner would include kanji, ghee rice, poori, besara, sagabadi bhaja and machha (fish) besara.        
	This weeklong offer would also include special packages wherein guests would be welcomed with flowers and fruit juices. This apart, a special discount of 10 per cent would be available for visitors.         
	We have noticed that tourists like to have pure Oriya cuisine once they are here and that too at a reasonable rate. We hope that this weeks scheme would click with our guests, said Mishra.         
	For now there has been a strong response, said Sasmita Rath, an OTDC official.         
	OTDCs festival offer comes against the backdrop of the corporation registering a 21.5 per cent rise in turnover this fiscal. Its profit before tax went up from Rs 1.54 crore in 2006-07 to Rs 2.1 crore in 2007-08.         
	The average occupancy rate also increased by 46 per cent.         
	The corporation now plans to add about 100 more AC rooms in all Panthanivas across the state by April end.

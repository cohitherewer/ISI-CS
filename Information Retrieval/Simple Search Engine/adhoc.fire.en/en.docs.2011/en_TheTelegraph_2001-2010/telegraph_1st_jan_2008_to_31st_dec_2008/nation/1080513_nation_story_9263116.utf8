                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lalu kin seeks damages for free land 
          NALIN VERMA                           Family trouble revisits Lalu Prasad                                  
	Patna, May 12: The controversy over Gulab Rai, the brother of railway minister Lalu Prasad, stalling a railway project intensified today, as whispers of the land being obtained for free grew stronger.        
	The 80 decimal land in question belongs to Gulab Rais wife, Kunti Devi. She acquired it in 2004 when Rabri Devi was the Bihar chief minister. The Phulwaria block office allotted the land meant for the land-less, when Kunti Devi pleaded that she was land-less and was below the poverty line. Be it by a coincidence or by design, Indian Railways acquired the same plot to build Lalu Prasads pet rail line linking Hathua and Dewaria besides Selarkala and Phulwaria  ancestral villages of Rabri Devi and Lalu Prasad, respectively.         
	Gulab Rai yesterday stopped work on this particular plot complaining that his wife was not paid compensation for it.         
	Its a queer situation. I remember visiting Gulab Rais house in 2004. I was put up in a double-storeyed house. Gulab Rai was then the Phulwaria block head and owned a car, said JD(U) general secretary and party MP Shivanand Tiwary.         
	How could the name of an occupant of a double-storeyed home, a co-owner of a car and the spouse of a block unit head, enter into the BPL list. And how was she given a piece of land free? Tiwary wondered.        
	Tiwary was a cabinet minister in the Rabri Devi ministry. He demanded immediate dismissal of officials who bracketed Gulab Rais family in the BPL list and allotted government land meant for the poor and land-less to Kunti Devi.         
	He further demanded stern action against Gulab Rai for stalling railway work and manhandling officials at the construction site. Gulab Rai allegedly beat up an official while stalling work.         
	Lalu Prasad repeatedly charges the Bihar government with the latters non-co-operation in matter of acquiring land for railway. But now its for everyone to see whose family is stalling rail work and demanding compensation for land that actually belonged to the government, he added.         
	Gopalganj district officials, mum on the issue till yesterday, conceded today that the land had been allotted to Kunti Devi in 2004.         
	Contacted, chief minister Nitish Kumar said: The government has taken note of the situation. It will take appropriate action in the matter.

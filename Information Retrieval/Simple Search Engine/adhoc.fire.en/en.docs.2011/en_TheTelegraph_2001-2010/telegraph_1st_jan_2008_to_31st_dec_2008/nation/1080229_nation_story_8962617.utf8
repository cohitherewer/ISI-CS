  - On-screen debut for vibrant pattachitra characters          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          A grab from the animation. Telegraph picture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 28: Pattachitra, Orissas indigenous school of painting, which still remains the best buy for millions of tourists visiting the state, is now being animated.         
	Thanks to the young talents of Peoples Academy of Cinematic Animation and Design (Pacard), this rare synergy is set to turn into a reality.         
	The energetic motifs of pattachitra along with its vibrant characters, bold lines and bright colours can now be viewed on-screen, moving and talking.        
	The characters and backgrounds with properties and costumes have come alive in Dasavatara, an animated content developed on classical patta painting styles.        
	This is animation with an Oriya touch. The characters, the motifs and the environment reflect the nuances of pattachitra. We are trying to stick to the fine points and details as much as possible, says Ranajit Mohanty, the chief creative officer, Pacard.        
	Dasavatara presents a concept of the three idols of the temple  lord of the universe Jagannath, his sister Subhadra and his elder brother Balbhadra  during the night when all 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu are engaged in various activities.        
	The animators have depicted various religious subjects in a sharp-featured ritualised form. The outlining faces and jewellery have been made in detail and accentuated with a background matching a pattachitra style.         
	Pattachitra is the best thing we could relate to for their strange and fantastic pictorial conceptions and the deliberate wayward colour schemes. Also, these paintings depict a compromise between folk and classical elements opening up wider range of options for us to experiment with stories and scripts, said Mohanty.                                       
	Apart from Dasavatara, the team has already used the motifs such as moving clouds, fishes and waves for separate contents.         
	The animation from our state should have a uniqueness and we are slowly trying to implement all that so that it lends us an identity in the long run, said Mohanty.         
	One of the major constraints that the animation industry in Orissa faces is the shortage of hands. Pacard, which has now tied up with T Cube Solutions, a leading software company, to help this rich cultural heritage go global.         
	The skilled hands of traditional painters of pattachitra at Puri, Raghurajpur, Paralakhemundi, Chikiti and Sonepur must not be wasted. Instead, the painters must reach out to the world by adding novelty to their art. Some training in animation for the artists future generations could be great. We would definitely help this rich cultural heritage go global, said Sabyasachi Patnaik, the managing director of T Cube Solutions.        
	The topics chosen for the animation in the forthcoming projects would mostly be mythological, religious stories and folklore, where the motifs would be used in the best possible way. Besides more on Lord Jagannath, we might also go for themes on Radha Krishna, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, they said.

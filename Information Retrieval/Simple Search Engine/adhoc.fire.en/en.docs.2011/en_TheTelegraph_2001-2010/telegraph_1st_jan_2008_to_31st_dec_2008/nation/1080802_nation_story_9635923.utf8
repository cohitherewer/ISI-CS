  - Physically challenged trio among victims, short circuit suspected										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    One of the charred coaches of the Gautami Express, (above) YSR Reddy inspects the train. (PTI)                                               
	Hyderabad, Aug. 1: A fire swept through an express train hurtling along in the dead of night, charring to death at least 32 passengers of whom three were physically challenged and one an expecting mother.         
	Many of those who died on board the Gautami Express were asleep when the flames engulfed them, giving them no time to escape. Others died of suffocation.        
	Around 15 people are being treated for injuries in a Warangal hospital.         
	The blaze was apparently sparked by a short circuit around 1.30am, a short while after the train had left Warangal, and was approaching Mahbubabad, 240km from Hyderabad.         
	The popular overnight express had begun its journey at 9.15pm from Secunderabad and was bound for Kakinada, a distance of 400km.        
	The fire is believed to have begun in a sleeper 3-tier coach, S-9. Fanned by the speed of the train that was travelling at 100kmph, the blaze quickly spread to adjoining coaches, S-10 being the worst hit. At least 13 bodies have been recovered from the coach.        
	Warangal police superintendent V.C. Sajjanar said the brute blaze had engulfed five bogies. Unless we examine all the bogies thoroughly, we will not be able to say anything on the total number of deaths, he said.        
	Officials said there were at least 32 dead, but feared the toll could rise as a heap of skeletons, skulls and burnt flesh remained to be cleared. Each sleeper coach can accommodate 72 and the bogies were packed, said railway sources.        
	Many of the bodies had been charred to the bone, making identification difficult. We cannot say anything about the number of dead as all we are able to recover are just skulls and bones, bodies burnt totally, said a railway spokesman.        
	Railway officials said a DNA test would have to be carried out on the charred remains to establish their identities.        
	Some travellers in coaches S-9 and 10 managed to jump out of the running train. Passengers in the adjoining bogies escaped death as an alert railway police constable, Srinivas, pulled the chain when he saw smoke billowing out of S-9. The train came to a stop in the middle of a forest near Kesamudram station, giving passengers time to get off even as the blaze tore in.        
	But for many, death was instantaneous. Among the dead were Manga (18), Shanta Kumari (16) and Satynarayana (40), three of a group of five physically challenged people in coach S-10. All of them are from Samarlakota near Kakinada and were returning home after a week-long training in operating STD booths and DTP work organised by an NGO in Hyderabad.        
	They and a pregnant woman died of burns as they could not rush out of the burning train. Two other physically challenged persons were also rescued.        
	One of them, Sombabu, recovering at the MGM hospital in Warangal, said it was a miracle that many woke up in the nick of time and escaped as almost all were in deep slumber. I dont know how, but the heat of the fire woke me up. I started screaming and crawled out of the train. I fainted but was rescued by someone, he said.         
	Also among the dead are Sarita (28), a doctor travelling to her home in Kakinada for a family gathering, and Bhagyalakshmi (45), a housewife returning after attending her sons engineering counselling course in the state capital. She died of suffocation when smoke filled coach S-10, said an official.         
	Relief work was delayed as rescue teams from Vijayawada and Hyderabad, blinded by rain and darkness, found it difficult to reach the spot in the dense forest area.        
	Preliminary reports suggested that a blanket used by one of the passengers in S-9 got caught in the ceiling fan, causing a short circuit. The burnt coaches have been brought to Kesamudram, the nearest railway station, for forensic investigations.         
	In New Delhi, railway minister Lalu Prasad ordered an inquiry to determine the exact cause of the incident, which he described as very sad and unfortunate. Till now no proof of sabotage or use of explosives has come to our notice.         
	He said the railway staff did not hear any explosion. They only saw thick smoke emerging out of the coach suddenly, the minister added. Andhra chief minister YSR Reddy said the blaze was the result of an electrical short circuit.        
	The staff disconnected 10 coaches from the front portion and nine from the back, preventing the fire from spreading further.        
	State forest minister Golla Surya Rao, who was in an AC coach five bogies away, escaped as he was among the hundreds alerted by the train coming to a halt because of the chain being pulled. I escaped narrowly in the nick of time when the flames swept into the AC coach. I could see people caught in the fire in other bogies and burnt alive, but I was helpless to do anything, he said.         
	Other passengers screamed and woke up others as the train halted. Many men and women jumped out leaving their belongings as the fire swept into other compartments after the train stopped, said a rescue worker.        
	Lalu Prasad announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a job to the next kin of those killed. Those seriously injured will get Rs 1 lakh each. The state government also announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each for the families of those killed.

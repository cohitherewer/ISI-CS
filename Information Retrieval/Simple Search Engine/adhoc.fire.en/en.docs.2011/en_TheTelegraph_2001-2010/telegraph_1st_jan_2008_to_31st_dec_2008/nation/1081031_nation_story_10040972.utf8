	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: The Orissa government today asked the state crime branch to probe in to the death of Father Bernard Digal, who was allegedly injured in the Kandhamal violence and passed away at a Chennai hospital on Tuesday.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, police director-general M.M. Praharaj said a case had been registered based on a complaint lodged by Father Joseph Kalathil, the vicar-general of the archbishops house in Bhubaneswar.         
	A post-mortem was conducted at the Capital Hospital here after the deceaseds body was flown from Chennai via Mumbai.        
	Kalathil said Digal, the treasurer of the Archdiocese, was at Sankarakhol under Tikaballi police station in Kandhamal on August 23 for official work. While he was on his way back, he was caught in the violence and his vehicle was set on fire.         
	Fearing further violence he took shelter in the jungle with his driver Sisiro Pradhan and finally reached Dudukangia village, where a mob armed with lathis, iron bars and weapons attacked them. While his driver managed to flee, Bernard was assaulted.         
	Finally, the mob stripped him off and left him for dead.        
	When the priest gained consciousness, he was unable to move, till his driver and a few villagers came back for him. The police and helpers rushed Bernard to a primary health centre in a police jeep. From there, the case was referred to district headquarter hospital at Phulbani and then to the SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack.        
	Much later, Bernard was shifted to Mumbai hospital where he recovered partly. Recently Bernard went to Chennei to meet a friend where he was hospitalised again. He passed away on October 28 at 8.50pm said ather Kalathil.         
	Father Digal hailed from Kandhamal in Orissa.

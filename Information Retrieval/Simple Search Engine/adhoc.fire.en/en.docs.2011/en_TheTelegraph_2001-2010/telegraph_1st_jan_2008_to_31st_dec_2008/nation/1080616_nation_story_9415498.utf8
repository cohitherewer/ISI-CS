          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 15: Federation of All Orissa Traders Association has decided to boycott the licensing system for essential commodities reintroduced in the state after six years.         
	Both wholesale and retail traders across Orissa will not submit applications for licences under the reintroduced system before the authorities concerned in their respective areas, the associations general secretary B.K. Mohanty told The Telegraph today.         
	The federations executive body took the decision at a recent emergency meeting here. A resolution demanding withdrawal of the licensing system was also passed in the meeting, Mohanty said.         
	The association has strongly opposed the reintroduction of the licensing system, which they claim to be the licensing raj and condemned setting up of the upper limit of stocking essential commodities.         
	The Federation had submitted a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik on May 7 in a bid to caution the government on the perils of licensing system.         
	The system should not be reintroduced in the larger interest of people of the state as they depend fully on stocks imported from other producing states, the federation had urged. But state civil supplies and consumer welfare department had gone ahead with its plans.         
	The association apprehends that if the licensing system is reintroduced by the UPA at the Centre to deal with spiralling costs, it boomerang in Orissa.         
	The state stands on a different footing as it is primarily a consuming state. The licensing system would only hamper free flow of essential commodities and lead to scarcity. Consumers will bear the brunt, he said.         
	The NDA government had abolished the licensing raj in 2002 to put an end to corrupt practices perpetrated by officials.         
	Reintroduction of the system would only revive the corruption, Mohanty argued.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Centre today appeared to have arrived at a general consensus, if not a decision, with the states on setting up a federal agency to fight terror.        
	States had earlier opposed such an agency over fears it would undermine their powers. There is general consensus, if not a decision. There is no question of stepping on their (states) jurisdiction as law and order is a state subject, Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta said after a meeting with chief secretaries and police chiefs.        
	The Centre suggested there could be concurrent jurisdiction to deal with major cases of terror and an automatic mechanism to save time otherwise lost to red tape.         
	A committee of state police chiefs, Intelligence Bureau officials, law officers, solicitors-general and others will be constituted to examine the feasibility of the plan.        
	The panel will decide the kind of cases to be taken up by the agency, Gupta said, stressing the federal body will have to combine investigation with enforcement. Such a system will include intelligence gathering. Till the time the arrangement is in place, the CBI can deal with cases in coordination with state police.         
	Todays meeting, called in the wake of the recent serial blasts, also touched on increasing police numbers and equipment, fake currency, gun-running and drugs peddling.         
	The Centre said it was working on a separate scheme to strengthen the intelligence apparatus in states. The contours of the scheme have been outlined and it will be announced within a month, Gupta said.         
	The Centre has also loosed its purse strings to beef up the India Reserve Battalion, a force that states also help maintain. The Centre and states agreed to improve intelligence, the lack of which often leads to terror strikes.

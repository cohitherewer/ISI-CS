  - Over a thousand activists   court arrest in Orissa        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, June 6: The dawn-to-dusk Orissa bandh called by the Left parties in protest against the price hike of petroleum products today evoked a mixed response even as police arrested several party workers across the state.        
	State home secretary T.K. Mishra said the response to the bandh call was partial. Government offices and banks remained open, but business establishments were closed at many places. Bus services were paralysed as private bus operators kept their vehicles off the road. Train services were disrupted, too.        
	The bandh passed off peacefully, though. No major untoward incident was reported barring a few stray scuffles, said the home secretary adding that there was no visible impact of the bandh on red hubs.        
	There was tension in Dhusuri, Betaligaon and Dhamnagar area in Bhadrak district, as bandh supporters tried to close down shops forcibly. The bandh call was given by CPI, CPM and Forward Bloc and was supported by JMM and Samajbadi Party.        
	The normal life in the state capital was partially hit. Shops and business establishments, government and semi-government offices and financial and educational institutions remained open.         
	Traffic on the roads was, however, sparse.        
	Workers of CPI, CPM and Forward Bloc and their frontal wings blocked roads in the morning and held picketing in front of the central government offices here protesting against the price hike of petrol, diesel and LPG. While few vehicles plied on the road, almost all petrol pumps across the state remained closed throughout the day.         
	The parties workers shouted slogans against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Murli Deora demanding immediate rollback of the recent price hike.        
	The bandh supporters took out a rally from the Master Canteen Square urging business establishment owners to down shutters. CPM state secretary Janaradan Pati and his CPI counterpart Dibakar Nayak claimed that the bandh was a total success.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 21: The peace bus between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad resumed service today after being stalled for a week because of the Amarnath land unrest.         
	A hundred passengers left for Muzaffarabad early this morning.         
	The fortnightly service was stalled on August 14, three days after Hurriyat leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz was killed in police firing while leading a procession to the Line of Control.         
	A hundred passengers, comprising 68 who had come to the Valley and 32 from our side, left in four buses today. Another 60 people are expected to arrive today from the other side of the LoC, said G.S. Manavalan, the regional passport officer.         
	Manavalan said the service would be on schedule from now. We are, in fact, trying to make the service weekly, he added.         
	The bus service between the two Kashmirs was thrown open in April 2005. Before August 14, the bus service was halted only once when a 187km stretch of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road got damaged in the October 2007 earthquake.         
	In the Valley, the three-day strike break ended today.        
	Tomorrow, separatists plan to hold a rally at Srinagars Idgah.        
	In Jammu, protests continued today and the family of former deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma narrowly escaped a mob attack on their car in Bhagwati Nagar locality. Some hooligans tried to gherao (the car) but our timely intervention saved them, Jammu police chief K. Rajendra said.         
	Day curfew in Jammu was lifted, but protesters set ablaze three vehicles and looted a Food Corporation of India truck.         
	The Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, the body spearheading the land agitation, today also started a civil disobedience movement. It has asked people not to pay taxes.

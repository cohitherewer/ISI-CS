          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 13: Kashmir continued to erupt in anger against an alleged economic blockade in Jammu and the death of Hurriyat leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz in police firing, with dozens of people injured in clashes today.        
	Three persons died of injuries suffered in two days of bloodshed, taking the toll since Monday to 23.         
	Late in the evening, the CRPF opened fire on protesters in a Pulwama village, 45km from Srinagar, injuring 30. Several of them received bullet wounds, and 13 were moved to Srinagar hospitals.        
	Several thousands poured into Srinagars streets at night, defying curfew, after reports that CRPF men were barging into homes and beating up residents.        
	In Jammu, the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti that is leading the agitation for land for the shrine board extended the 21-day shutdown till August 20. The group also plans to court arrest from August 18.        
	The curfew imposed after Azizs death on Monday was relaxed for 12 hours from 8am in Srinagar. Nine other districts in Kashmir also got a break from the curfew.        
	Sporadic violence was reported from Kashmir through the day, with the news of the three deaths fuelling tension.        
	Faisal Ahmad Dar and Mehrajuddin were injured in police firing yesterday on pro-Kashmir protesters at Kishtwar in Jammu. The third victim was Hafiz Ullah Baba, who received bullet wounds on Monday. Thousands raised pro-freedom slogans at their funerals.         
	Protests broke out at Bemina in Srinagar after a mob torched some huts of the Srinagar Development Authority. Forces used tear gas before opening fire. One youth was injured.         
	Clashes were also reported in the Fateh Kadal, Kani Kadal and Khanyar neighbourhoods.         
	Deputy commissioner Asfandyar Khan, speaking before the protests at night, said: There was relative calm in Srinagar.         
	Official sources said the fortnightly Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus would not run tomorrow, for the first time in two years.

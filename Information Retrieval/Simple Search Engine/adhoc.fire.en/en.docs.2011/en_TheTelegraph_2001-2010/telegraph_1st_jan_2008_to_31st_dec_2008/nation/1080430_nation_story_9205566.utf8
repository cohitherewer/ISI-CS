          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 29: Preparations are on at Damapur in Gajapati for the construction of a barrage on the upstream of the Mahendratanaya  an off shoot of inter-state river, Vasamdhara.         
	Technical advisory committee of the water resources department has zeroed in on Dampur for the barrage  an answer to the unilateral move of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh (AP) to build a reservoir on the rivers downstream, which may change the course of the river and cause a drinking water crisis in Parlakhemundi town.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who is scheduled to lay the barrages foundation stone tomorrow, told reporters today that he would leave for Gajapati in the morning to attend the function.         
	Naveen added that the barrage would benefit Gajapati farmers by providing irrigation facility to 4,000 hectares of agriculture land and supply drinking water to Paralakhemundi.         
	The barrage would be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 38 crore with funding from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. State planning and co-ordination department has been directed by the chief minister to include the project in the 2008-09 plan.         
	The decision to start construction was taken by the chief minister recently after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, laid a foundation stone for a reservoir at Regulapadu in Srikakulum district  that falls on Mahendratanayas downstream  on April 4 ignoring Orissas protest.         
	The Orissa government has stated that the Andhra governments unilateral construction move violated a 1962 inter-state agreement that states that any construction on an inter-state river should begin after receiving the consent of the Central Water Commission and its co-basin state (in this case Orissa).         
	Previously, Naveen had written to his Andhra counterpart opposing the move and stating that people living on the upstream would be affected. Patnaik had also sought to know if the Andhra government had got the go-ahead from the Central Water Commission.         
	Neither the commission nor the Andhra government gave an answer, he added.

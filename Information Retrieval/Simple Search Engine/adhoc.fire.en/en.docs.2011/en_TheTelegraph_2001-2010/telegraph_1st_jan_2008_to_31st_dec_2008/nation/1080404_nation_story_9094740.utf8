	Science hidden in headless chicken    
	A chicken whose head was chopped off managed to survive for a year and a half without a head. Is your head reeling? Slam the brakes and listen to Karl Kruszselnicki.    
	The Australian science commentator-cum-author, who recently toured India, explains that the chicken, called Mike, had enough brain stem left to live without a head.    
	The chicken had created a sensation for two years in the US city of Colorado. Known as Mike the headless chicken, the rooster was owned by a farmer who brought an axe down on its neck.     
	The story about the headless chicken never fails to arrest listeners and people learn a little bit of anatomy along the way, says Kruszselnicki, who often refers to the story to make learning science fun.    
	I tell an interesting story and sneak a science fact in between. It sustains interest as well as gives knowledge, says the author who hosts a TV show on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.     
	Jawan clears Rs 70-lakh test    
	For CISF jawan L. Venu, Rs 70 lakh was too paltry a sum to test his honesty.     
	Venu, posted at a Chennai airport, had found a demand draft of Rs 70 lakh that a businessman had lost.    
	Not only did the jawan return the demand draft, he also refused to accept any reward.     
	According to airport sources, Coimbatore-based industrialist Balasubramaniam had dropped the demand draft while showing his ticket to Venu.     
	Balasubramaniam was on his way to board a Coimbatore-bound Jet Airways flight when the jawan spotted it. He immediately alerted his higher-ups and an announcement was made on the public address system.     
	Balasubramaniam rushed back and was handed the demand draft after he proved his credentials. When he wanted to reward Venu for his gesture, the jawan politely turned him down, saying he was only doing his duty.    
	MLA plays with fire    
	A walk on fire at a temple festival may have appeased the deity, but DMK legislator L.P. Dharmalingam now better think of a way to avoid getting singed by his party boss.     
	For, M. Karunanidhi is believed to strongly disapprove of such religious rituals. The DMK patriarch had a few years ago given another MLA, Andhiyur Selvaraj, an earful for participating in the barbaric festival. MP Adi Shankar, too, had faced the music for sporting vermilion on his forehead, putting a blot on the Dravidian partys atheistic ideology.     
	Giving Dharmalingam company on the red-hot bed of charcoal at the Bannari Amman temple in Erode district on March 26 was Congress MLA Vidiyal Sekar.    
	The annual festival draws thousands of devotees, young and old, who walk across the fiery pathway to the shrine.        
	Metro morals    
	Delhi Metro is doing well, and its thanks to the employees moral values, rather than good business. So says E. Sreedharan, the architect of the train service that is fast becoming the capitals signature.     
	Sreedharan, the Metro managing director, said values such as punctuality, integrity and professional competence instilled in our employees had led to the success of the service.     
	As if to dispel any doubts that his statement might be more bluster than substance, Sreedharan announced he was launching a national programme to revive Indian values, along with Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata.     
	Spiritual leader Swami Bhoomananda Tirthaji will take part in the National Value Inculcation Movement.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              The Stewart School				                                 
	Cuttack, April 3: Stewart School, the lone Anglo-Indian institution in the city, has named a house after Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.         
	The new wing, christened Subhas House, has come into being from this academic session, which started from Wednesday. Student Sidhant Choudhury is the new house captain, while teacher Swarup Rout has been elected its convener.         
	The house has been introduced from this year to remember Bose, who happens to be an alumni, said principal A. Margaret Das in the new school diary for 2008-09, which was circulated among the students today.         
	The school celebrated its 125th year in 2007.         
	The official register on admissions states that Janakinath Bose got his son, Subhas Chandra Bose, admitted to the school on October 8, 1902, and had given January 23, 1897, as his date of birth.         
	He had attended no other school and in his case exemption from religious instruction was not claimed.         
	When he left school, after completing the academic session in Class VI, on December 31, 1908, his character was certified as very good, the record further reveals.         
	J. Young was the principal of the school during the six years that Bose attended classes and the institution was known as Protestant European School then.         
	The school had its inception in 1882, but was re-christened as Stewart School only in 1919 after its founder Dr William Day Stewart, a civil surgeon. The school was opened to Indian students in 1891.        
	The house system was introduced after Cambridge Syndicate sanctioned the opening of a centre for Cambridge Examinations in the school in 1926. The school was divided into five houses  Stewart, Bamfield, Young, Bigg and Roberts  all former principals. The Stewart House was, however, dropped in the mid-1970s.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 6: The Supreme Court has acquitted a swami accused of sodomising a Class IX student at Keralas Sri Siddaganga Mutt for lack of evidence.        
	The apex court observed that there were several infirmities in the case. One of them was the enmity that existed between the accused swami, Gowrishankara Swamigalu, and his senior who he was supposed to succeed. The suggestion was that he could have been framed.        
	Todays ruling by the two-judge bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and Harjit Singh Bedi reverses a high court order that had convicted Swamigalu. He was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and handed a fine. Earlier, a trial court had acquitted him.        
	The boy was prodded by his guardians into filing an FIR saying Swamigalu had abused him physically.

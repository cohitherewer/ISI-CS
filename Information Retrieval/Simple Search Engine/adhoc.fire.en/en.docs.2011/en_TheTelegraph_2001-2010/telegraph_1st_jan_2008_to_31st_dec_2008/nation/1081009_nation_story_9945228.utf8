The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Will I get my annual hike?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Will I get my annual hike?
                                          
	Answers to more questions on the global financial crisis.        
	 If the global economy remains in crisis, will I get my usual annual increment?         
	Indians have got the best increments in the Asia-Pacific zone over the last three years. Average increments have been around 14.8 in 2007, according to Hewitt Associates. Hewitts forecast for this year: 13.9 per cent. But if inflation continues to ride at 12 per cent, are you really going to get anything at all?        
	 What about the big expenditure I had planned on consumerables?        
	Stash the cash  possibly in a fixed deposit that pays over 10 per cent. Consumers have already started showing signs of putting off big spending. Real estate spending is down; car sales have slowed.        
	 Will my home loan and personal loan EMIs go up?         
	Many home loan companies have raised interest rates by one percentage point in the past year. As a result, borrowers have seen their EMIs going up by Rs 64 per lakh per month for loans of tenure of 15 years. With inflation expected to ease, it is felt that home loan interest should start coming down from 2009. Experts advise that if an individual is able to secure a property at a decent price, he could go in for a floating rate home loan even at current levels.        
	 Is it better to save now rather than spend?        
	During a financial turmoil, the smart set hang on to cash. Besides bank deposits, the experts are pitching for gold exchange traded funds (ETFs).        
	 Sometimes I hear that the rupee is falling against the dollar and it is a bad thing. Then I hear that the rupee is rising against the dollar and it still is a bad thing. What should I make of these claims?         
	It depends on who is talking  and how it impacts the persons fortunes. When the rupee hardens, importers are happy because they can buy all the stuff they need fairly cheap. When the rupee plummets, export earners like software companies are comfortable as almost 90 per cent of their revenues come from overseas markets. Last year, the technology giants were groaning because the rupee was firm. This year, they continue to groan  because the slowdown of the world economy means fewer contracts, which more than wipes out the gains from a weak rupee.

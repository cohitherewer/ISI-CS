                                                                                                               Row outlasts Stephens head
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Thampu                                  
	New Delhi, March 15: Reverend Valson Thampu resigned as acting principal of St. Stephens College today, ending a 10-month tenure during which his eligibility to hold the post was questioned by Indias apex minority education panel.         
	But the controversy swirling around the elite Delhi college since Thampu took over in May 2007 refused to die down, with critics questioning the appointment of the vice-principal as Thampus temporary replacement. M.S. Frank will head the day-to-day administration of the college till a principal is selected.         
	The nod to appoint Frank came at an emergency meeting of the college supreme council  the top decision making body of St. Stephens  in the afternoon, after Thampu put in his papers.         
	Frank, who teaches in the chemistry department, will not be referred to as principal or acting principal. He will be called the protem administrator, will report to the chairman of the supreme council and will have no policy-making powers.         
	But the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI), which had called Thampus appointment illegal, had also said those appointed by him must go.         
	The council said Franks appointment was based on seniority and the Constitution of the college.         
	The Constitution states that the most senior member of the faculty must take over as interim administrative head, provided he is a member of the Church of North India (CNI)  the parent body of St. Stephens.         
	S.V. Eswaran, head of the chemistry department, is the seniormost faculty member but is not a member of the CNI. Frank is next on the seniority list.         
	But critics said the CNI had let non-Christians run its institutes earlier. Although Thampus resignation was announced late in the evening, he had hinted at his decision earlier today while awarding prizes to final year students.         
	At the annual dismissal service, Thampu turned emotional, telling his audience he may not address them at the programme next year. Supreme council members thanked him for his contribution.         
	It was like a farewell ceremony. Reverend Thampu was clearly saying goodbye, a final-year student said on condition of anonymity.         
	Thampu was accused of failing to meet the criteria for the principals post. UGC guidelines say a principal of a college under a central university must have a PhD, which Thampu did not at the time of appointment. The NCMEI ruled his appointment illegal.         
	Thampu recently received a PhD in theology from the Allahabad Agricultural Institute (deemed university), but soon after that the supreme council said it would select a new principal.

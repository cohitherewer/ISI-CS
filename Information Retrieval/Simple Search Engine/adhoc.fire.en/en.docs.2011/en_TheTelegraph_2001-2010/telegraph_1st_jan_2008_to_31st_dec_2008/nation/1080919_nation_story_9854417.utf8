          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 18: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has set up a taskforce to examine the provisions of the bill on land acquisition tabled in Parliament, said its president K.V. Kamath.        
	Talking to reporters on the sidelines of its national council meeting here this afternoon, Kamath said the taskforce, headed by CII vice-president V. Srinivasan, would study the provisions of the proposed legislation in detail and examine as to whether it would be beneficial for the industry. He said the issues relating to land acquisition problem was debated in detail today at the meeting.        
	Our stand is very clear: there should be a dialogue before the land acquisition so that the whole process would be transparent and equitable, he said.         
	Underscoring the need for conducting study on sustainability of raw material, he said: Though identified natural resources reserve is a fraction of available potential, its now time to make a deeper study in terms of future needs.        
	Kamath said all the industries condemn terrorist attacks. But nobody feels threatened or cowed down, he said.         
	Decision on setting up a project would be decided based on the economic health, he said.

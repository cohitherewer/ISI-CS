          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Two buses stoned by BJP supporters in Bangalore on Saturday. (Bangalore News Photo)                                  
	Bangalore, May 31: Supporters of some BJP legislators who didnt make it to the B.S. Yeddyurappa council hit the streets in protest, embarrassing their partys day-old government in Karnataka.        
	More than 20 state transport buses were damaged in the past 24 hours by the stone-throwing cadre who also burnt three private vehicles.        
	In Bangalore, Anekal MLA Narayanaswamys supporters blocked the highway and threw stones at passing vehicles.         
	In Hubli, Jagadish Shettars supporters brought the north Karnataka city to a halt and even torched vehicles. They also created trouble in Bangalore.        
	In Mysore, supporters of MLA Shankarlinge Gowda staged a sit-in wearing black bands.         
	The day hardly brought any good news for Yeddyurappa. Governor Rameshwar Thakur asked the chief minister to prove his majority on the floor of the House before the governors customary opening address as the BJP was three short of the 113 majority mark in the 224-strong Assembly.         
	Yeddyurappa later said: The government has the required numbers. We also satisfied the governor before he invited us to form the government. Article 176 of the Constitution clearly states that the governors address comes first, but if he insists we will take the floor test first.         
	The BJP has already obtained the support of all six Independent legislators. Five of them have been made ministers.         
	A three-day special session of the Assembly is likely to be called on June 4.        
	Shettar, a known Yeddyurappa baiter, was offered the post of Speaker minutes before yesterdays swearing-in, but he refused.         
	A former state party president and revenue minister in the 20-month coalition government with the Janata Dal (Secular), Shettar today said the offer was an attempt to tie his hands.         
	If I am not made a minister, I can still work as a party MLA. I am not interested in being a Speaker which is normally given to those on the verge of retirement, he said.        
	In Mysore, Gowda, a four-time MLA who was also sure of getting a berth, sulked as he felt the region was under-represented in the council.         
	The 29 ministers inducted into the council yesterday will be allocated their portfolios only after the government passes the floor test, a BJP source said.

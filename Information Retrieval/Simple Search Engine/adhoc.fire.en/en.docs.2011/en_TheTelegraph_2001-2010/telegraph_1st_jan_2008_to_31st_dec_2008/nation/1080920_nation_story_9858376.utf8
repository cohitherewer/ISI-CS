	Sept. 19: State government departments were put on high alert with four coastal districts in the Mahanadi river basin bracing up to prevent being inundated by about 15 lakh cusecs to be released from the Hirakud dam late tonight.        
	All the departments have been geared up to tackle the situation, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik. We are monitoring the situation and taking all steps, he said, adding that two helicopters were engaged in evacuating people and relief operation.        
	Village heads were also authorised to start free kitchen and provide relief to the marooned people, said Patnaik.        
	State disaster management minister Manmohan Samal said 26 sluice gates of the Hirakud dam had been opened for discharge of water as the level has reached its maximum capacity of 630ft. By this evening, 14.85 lakh cusecs of water was being released at Munduli. The volume of water flowing through Munduli is expected to be 15.5 lakh by tomorrow morning triggering a high flood in the Mahanadi basin, he said.        
	Samal said high flood alert had been sounded in Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Puri districts.         
	Schools and colleges in the four districts would remain closed for the next two days, he said.        
	Evacuation operation has been launched on a large scale to shift residents of low-lying areas to safer places, he said, claiming that 30,505 people had already been evacuated from vulnerable places.        
	So far, the torrential rain and flood have claimed seven lives (two each in Jajpur and Angul districts, one each in Bhadrak, Keonjhar and Sambalpur).        
	Water resources department engineer-in-chief H.C. Behera said precautionary measures had been taken to protect the vulnerable points identified on various embankments in Mahanadi system.         
	In Cuttack, the situation was different today. People were seen thronging to the Ring Road area to watch the swelling rivers  Mahanadi and Kathajodi  even as the irrigation department officials were concerned how to drain out flood water from the city.         
	One of the irrigation department officials of eastern circle division said: When the Kathajodi is in spate, its water level rises to much higher than the citys land level. This virtually makes the storm water channel dysfunctional, as the sluice gates cannot be opened to release water.

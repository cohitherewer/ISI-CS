          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today conceded that rising food prices had made the task of reining in inflation difficult, but ruled out bringing back blind controls.        
	A steep rise in food prices will make inflation control more difficult. The constituency for economic reforms, so necessary to stimulate economic growth, will also diminish. Pressures will mount for restrictive trade practices, the Prime Minister told a meeting here.        
	However, he added: We cannot react to such a situation by returning to an era of blind controls.        
	The countrys inflation rate hit a three-year high of 7 per cent in late March on the back of higher food and metal prices.         
	Suggestions have been put forth that a price control regime be re-established to allow the government to intervene and set prices for key commodities. However, many economists and business leaders had said such controls could derail growth.         
	Singh echoed a perception that the original green revolution might be running out of steam. We are once again faced with a situation where rising demand for foodgrain and other food items is running into supply constraints  both domestically as well as internationally.

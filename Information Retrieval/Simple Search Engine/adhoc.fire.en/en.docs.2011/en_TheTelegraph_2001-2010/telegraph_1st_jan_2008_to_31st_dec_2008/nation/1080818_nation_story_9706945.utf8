          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Sonia Gandhi may have declared Manmohan Singh as the Congresss candidate for Prime Minister, but the party is unlikely to name its nominees for chief minister in states where elections are coming up.        
	Barring Delhi, where Sheila Dikshit is the reigning queen, the Congress is expected to trot out its usual line that it would like MLAs to elect their own leader in deference to our democratic tradition.        
	The real reason is the party is grappling with caste arithmetic, alliances and internal feuds.         
	Recent appointments to key posts in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, which unlike the other two is not going for elections now, reveal that the party is still trying to get its caste equations right.        
	In all three states, upper-caste leaders have been named state unit heads: C.P. Joshi and Suresh Pachouri, at the helm in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, are Brahmins, while Anil Kumar Sharma, in Bihar, is a Bhumihar.        
	General secretary Rahul Gandhi had wanted something radical by Congress standards, even if it was 18 years late: understand the forces unleashed by the Mandal movement and why his party couldnt co-opt the backward classes in the heartland, and then try to address that.         
	But the Brahmin lobby entrenched in the headquarters appears to have had its way again. They argued that keeping Brahmins in the frontline was the only way to unsettle the BJPs calculations.        
	The BJP had clinched victories in 2003, thanks to a combination of projecting non-Brahmin faces (the now-expelled Uma Bharti in Madhya Pradesh and Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan), giving all castes a balanced representation and the use of Hindutva.         
	Sources said this time, the Brahmins were upset with the BJPs over-reliance on the backward sections. In Madhya Pradesh, for instance, Uma was replaced with Babulal Gaur, who gave way to Shivraj Singh Chauhan, neither of whom is a Brahmin.         
	Ashok Gehlot and Digvijay Singh, former chief ministers of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, are unlikely to make the cut again, the sources said. Gehlot because of his backward-caste roots, and Digvijay because he is up against various power centres in his state.        
	Another reason for the Brahmin card is to woo urban, upper-class voters who the Congress believes are happy with the nuclear deal and the Sixth Pay Commission award.

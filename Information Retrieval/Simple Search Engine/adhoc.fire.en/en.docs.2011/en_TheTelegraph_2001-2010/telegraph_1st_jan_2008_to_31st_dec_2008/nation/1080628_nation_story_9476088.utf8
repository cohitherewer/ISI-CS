  -   Sonia calls meet, praises able PM
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia                                        
	New Delhi, June 27: Sonia Gandhi will meet party general secretaries tomorrow to gauge their mood on the nuclear deal stand-off with the Left.        
	This is Sonias first high-level consultation with the general secretaries on the subject. Such meetings are normally presided over by party treasurer Motilal Vora unless the agenda is unusually important.        
	Tomorrows discussions are expected to be followed by a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the partys highest policy-making body.        
	For Congress leaders looking for signals from Sonia, the latest issue of the Congress Sandesh, the party mouthpiece, had words that should reassure the Prime Ministers supporters.        
	I have no hesitation in extending to him on behalf of myself and all of you, congratulations for the achievements of the government. It is not often we have a leader who lets his work speak for itself rather than lofty speeches, she said in a letter to Congresspersons.         
	The contents of the letter were made public a few hours after another mouthpiece, the CPMs Peoples Democracy, published an article in which Prakash Karat blamed Manmohan Singh for the ongoing crisis.        
	It is unlikely that Sonia would have known what Karat was going to write but the coincidence and the sequence of events were striking.         
	The Congress, after reaffirming unqualified support to the Prime Minister and the deal officially and off-the-record, has signalled a subtle change in its position through a source believed to be close to the top leaders.        
	It is now being given out that when the CWC formally endorsed the deal twice, there was an understanding that it was up to the government (in effect, the Prime Minister) to secure a consensus with the UPA partners and the Left. Until that was accomplished, the deal would be put on hold.        
	The government and not the party signed the deal; so the government was mandated to take the allies and the Left along, the source said.        
	Asked to comment on the Prime Ministers iron resolve to push the deal, the source said: He said last October that his government was not a one-issue government. The Congresss priority now is to control inflation.        
	What if Singh put in his papers? We do not think he will do it. He is aware of his responsibilities and will not abandon a country in the throes of a financial crisis, the source said.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, too, spoke of addressing the concerns of different sections when asked about the deal.

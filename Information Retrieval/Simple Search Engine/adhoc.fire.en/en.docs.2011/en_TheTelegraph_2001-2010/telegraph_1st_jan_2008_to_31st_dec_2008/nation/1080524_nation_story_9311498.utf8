	Cuttack, May 23: Decks were cleared today for the Orissa Public Service Commission (OPSC) to conduct the Orissa Civil Service (Mains) Examination-2006 according to the schedule with the high court giving it the go-ahead signal.         
	Though the examination was scheduled to start from May 27 and continue till June 24, it had hit a roadblock with the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) directing the commission to recast the preliminary results and conduct the tests after three months.         
	OPSC had later challenged the tribunals order in the high court. Acting on it, the Vacation Bench of Justice M.M. Das today issued an interim stay order on the SAT direction while giving the green signal for the main examinations.         
	The result publication, however, would be subject to the outcome of the case, Das added, while posting the next hearing to June 17.         
	The preliminary tests were conducted on May 11, 2007, and nearly 35,000 candidates took the test. The OPSC had declared 3,485 candidates eligible for the mains for the 381 posts advertised by the government.         
	School system rejig        
	The reorganisation of the state school and mass education department would be effective from the current academic year. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by school and mass education minister Sanjib Sahoo today.         
	Sahoo said 90 district education officers would be appointed in all 30 districts to look after elementary, secondary and academic wings.         
	The officers would hold Class-I rank.

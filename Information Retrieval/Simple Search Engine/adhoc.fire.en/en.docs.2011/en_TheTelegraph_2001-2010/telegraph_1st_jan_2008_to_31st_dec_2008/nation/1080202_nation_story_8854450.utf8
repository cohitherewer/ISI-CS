	New Delhi, Feb. 1: The government has decided to open a Pandoras box on defence deals by re-negotiating the price of the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, three years after it was contracted for $974 million. 
    
	The decision to rework the Gorshkov contract, overruling objections from the navy, could have a cascading impact on other military hardware being procured by Indias defence establishment. 
    
	There are $14 million dollars worth of military equipment that India is ordering from or negotiating with Russia alone. It casts doubt on the sanctity of the contract itself. 
    
	Defence secretary Vijay Singh is to lead a team of naval officials to the Sevmash shipyard in Russia later this month where tardy work on the carrier has upset its delivery schedule. 
    
	Earlier price negotiations were very sketchy. They (the negotiators) did not anticipate the problems. Once the price is re-negotiated the new proposal will go to the cabinet again for approval, a defence ministry source said here today. 
    
	Re-negotiating the deal means a tacit admission by Delhi that the Russian demand for a higher price is at least partly justified. It largely invalidates the commercial contract to buy the Gorshkov signed in 2004 when George Fernandes was defence minister. 
    
	The chief of naval staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, had feared this possibility and spoken out against reworking contracts after the Russians raised a demand for an additional $1.2 million for the 44,500-tonne ship, re-christened the INS Vikramaditya. 
    
	India cannot afford to pull out of the deal right away as it has paid up nearly 60 per cent of the contracted amount. 
    
	The ministry source said Singh would be escorted to the shipyard and given a physical count of the number of workers employed for the ship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lazybones Delhi in arms rush
                                                                                                               Lazybones Delhi in arms rush
          SUJAN DUTTA                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: India will flex its fiscal muscle in the global arms bazaar it is hosting here from Saturday.        
	Ahead of and during Defexpo 2008 - the fair is held once every two years - Delhi is likely to formally sign and announce large arms orders that it will distribute among some of the largest military manufacturers of the world.         
	A contract with Lockheed Martin through a US government foreign military sales programme for six Hercules C130J would be highlighted by the defence ministry.        
	The deal had been in the works for a year and was finally signed last fortnight in what was one of the fastest military orders from the country. The contract would be for about $1 billion.         
	Usually contracts of such high value from India remain years in the making. The Herc deal demonstrates not only a willingness from India to source more platforms from the US, a non-traditional supplier, but also that the government can cut down on delays when it wants to.        
	This is in sharp contrast with the deal for 66 Advanced Jet Trainers from British Aerospace that had been 20 years in the making before being signed in 2004.        
	A second order for the US that the defence ministry is considering is a consignment of eight P8I spy planes for the navy.        
	The maritime surveillance aircraft, made by Boeing Integrated Defence Systems, are likely to be picked for endurance trials in India shortly. The aircraft are equipped with anti-submarine warfare systems.         
	Boeing says it has made the P8I specifically for the Indian Navy. The navy currently relies on its Russian-origin TU-124 and IL-38 aircraft for maritime surveillance. The P8I is a modification of the commercial Boeing 737 aircraft. An earlier negotiation with Boeing for P3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft had failed.        
	Pakistan has acquired the P3C Orion.         
	Boeing is in competition with the European Consortium EADS for the maritime surveillance aircraft orders. EADS says it has modified an Airbus A319 into a CASA Mission Aircraft. The Indian Navy opened the competition in 2005 but a sense of urgency began to creep into the ministry only recently with the IL38 aircraft nearing a phase-out. The deal could be worth more than $800 million.         
	A similar urgency is being demonstrated for orders of artillery guns. In the run-up to Defexpo, the army issued a tender for wheeled self-propelled artillery guns last week.        
	In the last week of January, the army also requested proposals from companies for ultra-light howitzers. The makers - BAE Systems that now owns Bofors and Singapore Technologies - are competing and will showcase their guns at the fair.        
	Another tender for up to 400 towed 155mm/52calibre guns is now due.

	New Delhi, June 15: Sonu and Vijay werent as ambitious as Bunty and Babli  they did the foreign tourist out of a mere Rs 10,000.        
	Instead of transacting a very tangible Taj Mahal, they virtually sold him the sepoy revolt. The tout and the taxi driver had buttonholed the American at Delhi airport on June 2 and, learning that he was going to Paharganj, warned him that there was a civil war on.         
	They drove him to a safe hotel in Karol Bagh, took from him $200 (Rs 8,600) and Rs 1,800 to arrange a room, and disappeared. Vijay has been arrested. Delhi High Court today denied Sonu anticipatory bail.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

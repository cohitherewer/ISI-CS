          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: The special court trying the Malegaon blast case today directed Maharashtra to reply to allegations of custodial torture levelled by sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, army officer Prasad Purohit and five other suspects.        
	Pragya, booked under the tough Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, had yesterday told the court that anti-terrorist squad officials forced her to listen to an obscene CD and threatened to strip her. Purohit and the others arrested for the September 29 blast also alleged torture by ATS officials.        
	Special judge Y.D. Shinde asked the state government to file a detailed reply at the earliest. Though the court did not specify a date, sources said the reply could be filed on December 3 when all the seven would be brought to the court for request for police remand. The judge had yesterday sent the suspects to judicial custody.         
	Purohits lawyers filed a set of documents before the court, including letters commending the abilities of the military intelligence officer. One letter was from the Maharashtra ATS, which had invited Purohit to a workshop for officers.         
	Another letter was from Nashik police commissioner Himanshu Roy. You (Purohit) have shared information of vital and sensitive nature with the police which has proved useful to both the organisations, the November 2006 letter says.        
	A 2001 letter by an army commanding officer praised Purohits daring and immediate action when a group of terrorists tried to infiltrate an area manned by the 15 Maratha Light Infantry.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          The demolished structure at Sahara Sahar. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: The Supreme Court today asked the Mayavati government and the Sahara group to maintain status quo in the demolition-scarred Sahara Sahar.        
	The Lucknow Development Authority will not demolish anything, nor will Sahara reconstruct anything, a two-judge vacation bench said. After hearing arguments from lawyers, notices on the demolitions were issued to all parties asking for further clarifications.         
	The state had demolished a wall surrounding the 270-acre Sahar in a late-night swoop on June 17-18, alleging encroachment on public land, prompting Sahara to go to Allahabad High Court and get a stay.        
	The wall was coming between the Ambedkar Memorial Park  the chief ministers pet project to showcase Dalit pride  and Sahara Sahar, the dream city of the business empires chief, Subroto Roy, said to be close to Mayavatis arch-rival Mulayam Singh Yadav. The township borders the park on its southern fringe near Gomtinagar.        
	The high court, responding to the plea by Sahara India Commercial Corporation on June 19, had directed the government not to carry out any demolition between 5pm and 9am. It had asked the state to pass a law to ensure no such action was carried out after sunset or before sunrise.        
	The court had not only pulled up the Lucknow Development Authority for the late-night demolition but also directed the government to restore the land to the company. The chief secretary was told to submit a compliance report within 24 hours and the company was allowed to carry out constructions to safeguard its property.         
	The state appealed in the Supreme Court but Sahara filed a caveat to ensure it was heard before any order was passed against it.        
	Today, the state, represented by senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan, defended the demolitions, saying Sahara had encroached on public land. These were illegal constructions.        
	But Saharas Mukul Rohatgi claimed the demolitions were done without issuing a notice as required by the law. A hospital was demolished forcing us to shift patients at night. This is unheard-of in civilised society.        
	Of the 270 acres allotted to Sahara in 1994-95, 140 acres were to be retained as a green belt while the rest could be used for residential and commercial complexes.         
	Now, the authority claims no map of the structures inside Sahara Sahar was ever submitted for its approval.         
	The state claimed the demolitions were necessary to make way for a 30-metre-wide zonal road and a 45-metre green belt, both of which are mentioned in the Lucknow Master Plan.         
	The road is said to be extending 500 metres inside the Sahara Sahar premises.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Performance pay on cards at IITs
                                                                                                               Performance pay on cards at IITs
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                       
	New Delhi, March 5: Faculty members salaries across the Indian Institutes of Technology may soon hinge on their performance, instead of pay packets fixed by government scales.        
	IIT professors will compete among themselves for the first time for the highest salary bracket under a government plan to retain top teachers and researchers at the institutes, senior officials said.         
	The move will push faculty pay closer to corporate scales than at present, they said.         
	The decision, officials at the human resource development ministry concede, indicates a desperate effort to stall the drain of top teachers from IITs to the corporate sector or foreign universities, which offer salaries several times higher than what the government pays.        
	The ministry has set up a committee under IIT Kharagpur director Damodar Acharya to determine the performance indicators and recommend the raise the best professors will receive.        
	Quality and quantity of peer-reviewed research and student feedback from classes are likely to be two crucial indicators, sources said.         
	The top faculty, who are often wooed by the private sector, will now receive differential treatment and will get salaries close to what they would in the corporate world, a senior official said.         
	At present, the faculty are paid a fraction of what fresh IIT graduates earn.         
	The faculty can offer services for a fixed number of hours a year to private companies as consultants, but have to return most of the money they earn to the IIT administration and their specific department. The ministry plans to combat its inability to offer corporate scales of pay across the board by offering higher wages to a select few who prove they are the best.        
	A separate committee will be set up to revise pay scales for all faculty members at the IITs and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs). But the revised scales will be no match for corporate salaries, officials conceded. The increments the Acharya committee recommends will be over and above the hike.

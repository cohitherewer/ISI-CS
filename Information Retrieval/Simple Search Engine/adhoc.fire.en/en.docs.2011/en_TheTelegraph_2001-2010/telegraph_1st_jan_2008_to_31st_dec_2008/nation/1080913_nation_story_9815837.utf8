	Continuing with the effort to popularise the collection, curation and propagation of cacti among the public, the centre would soon open a new cacti house.         
	The house is likely to be opened by the last week of this month, the centres chief executive officer, A.K Mahapatra said.        
	The centre already has a series of poly-houses covering an area of 20,000sqft. The new addition would house 500 t0 600 varieties of cacti, he added. Apart from collecting samples from different parts of the world, the centre has many indigenously developed varieties. Out of several varieties of cactus found across the world, Echinocactus grusonii, Gymnocalycium, Mammillaria, Melocactus, Ferocactus, Astrophytum, Sulcorebutia, Opuntia, Parodia and Hildwintera are prized possessions of the centre.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Aug. 24: A trainee National Security Guard (NSG) commando and his wife were found murdered in a field in Gurgaon early this morning.        
	Manoj Kumar, who was on leave, had gone out with wife Rekha last evening on his motorcycle, police said. Both were in their late-20s.        
	Passers-by spotted the bodies this morning and informed the nearby Faraknagar police station.        
	Both bodies bear bullet wounds. Investigations are on, Faraknagar station house officer Jitender Singh Rana said.        
	No arrests were made till late this evening.         
	Gurgaon police commissioner Mahinder Lal said the murders could be the fallout of a property dispute.         
	Kumars father had received threats earlier and was allegedly attacked by a group a couple of days ago, Lal added. But he did not give any other details.        
	We are investigating the matter. But it has nothing to do with anyone from the NSG. It is a plain case of murder in cold blood, the commissioner said.         
	The NSG is a force raised to handle anti-hijack operations, rescue of hostages and to provide support to the central paramilitary forces,whenever required, in anti-terrorist operations. It also handles the security of high-risk VIPs.        
	The police are questioning relatives and close friends of the couple and expect a breakthrough in a couple of days.        
	Both seem to have been shot in close range by someone who possibly knew them well, Rana said.        
	The police have set up teams to investigate the murders. We have sent the teams to Delhi and states adjoining the capital, Rana said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IT city remembered, thanks to more seats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           IT city remembered, thanks to more seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Krishna                                  
	Bangalore, May 5: The new economy may finally be inspiring a newer style of politics at its original home.        
	In the run-up to the May Karnataka polls, party manifestos are promising to improve Bangalores crumbling infrastructure by building expressways and metro links.        
	The change of heart, however, could be because the city will send 28 MLAs to the Assembly this time  an increase of 12 seats after delimitation.        
	Bangalores infrastructure has hit rock bottom since S.M. Krishnas exit as chief minister in 2004, eroding some of its global prestige as the home of Indias vaunted IT revolution.        
	The Janata Dal (Secular)s coalition governments, first with the Congress and then the BJP, paid scant regard to the problem despite the IT industrys threats to shift and the flak from the ordinary citizen. Faced with a perceived urban-rural divide, the states politicians watched their step.        
	But this time, the parties want the people to vote for a better Bangalore. The Congress has unveiled plans for a Rs 50,000-crore package while the BJP has spelt out a new vision for the city, complete with a directly elected mayor.        
	Krishna, a popular face to the upwardly mobile IT and BPO crowd, says the Congress owes it to those who put Bangalore on the global map.        
	Income-tax collections from the Bangalore region have gone up to Rs 30,000 crore in 2008 from Rs 3,000 crore in 1999. This is mainly because of the emergence of IT, biotechnology and other knowledge industries. Surely, any government should be proud of them and give them something in return, the former chief minister, one of the leaders of the Congress campaign, said.        
	The BJPs Karnataka minder, Arun Jaitley, said: With Bangalores global image taking a beating, the problems arising out of its unplanned growth have to be addressed. We must re-invent Bangalore.        
	After delimitation, Bangalores stake in the Assembly has gone up from 16 to 28 seats. That is one reason why every party is focusing on the city, chuckled V. Ravichander, formerly with the Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF), a public-private partnership that worked with the Krishna government.        
	The BJP wants people to directly vote for a mayor with a five-year term. Now the corporators elect a mayor every year from among themselves.        
	Among the partys other ideas are a metropolitan planning council made up of elected representatives and experts. (The) administration will be decentralised to improve service delivery and promote citizen participation. Public-private partnerships are the future, the manifesto says.        
	The Congress has something for Bangalores poor, too, with its promise of improving the slums along with the infrastructure.        
	Its Rs 50,000-crore plan includes elevated roads, widened roads, a metro rail link to all parts of the city and implementation of the circular railway project. It also wants a dedicated expressway to the new airport at Devanahalli, now blighted by connectivity issues. The party hopes to develop 500 slums with national urban renewal mission funds.        
	During his four-and-a-half-year tenure, Krishna had dreamt of turning Bangalore into a Singapore and had involved the BATF. But the model was stymied by his party colleague Dharam Singh who took over as chief minister with the help of the JD(S), whose leader H.D. Deve Gowda takes pride in calling himself a farmer.        
	Two years ago, when then Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy had offered suggestions on improving the citys infrastructure, Gowda had questioned his companys contribution to the state. It led to Murthy quitting as chairman of Bangalore International Airport Ltd.        
	The JD(S) has so far been content resting on its laurels, claiming credit for bringing the IT industry to Bangalore and developing roads, power, water supply and e-governance.        
	Even Gowda now says: Everyone knows what we have done, (but) we need to do more.

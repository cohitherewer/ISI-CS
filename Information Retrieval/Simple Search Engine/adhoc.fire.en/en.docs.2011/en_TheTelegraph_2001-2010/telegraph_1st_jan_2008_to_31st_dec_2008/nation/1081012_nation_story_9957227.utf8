	Port corridor in troubled waters            The Y.S.R. Reddy regime appears to be fishing for trouble with plans to take over a coastal stretch home to fishermen.    
	The fishermen in the coastal districts of Guntur and Krishna are worried about a port-industry corridor plan that threatens to wipe out at least 13 seaside villages.    
	If the Vadarevu-Nizampatnam Port Industrial corridor gets off the ground, 1,300 families that know nothing other than fishing would be on the streets, says Coastal Fishermens Union president Yallamgari Yanadi.    
	With their protests going unheard, the organisations opposing the project are planning to open a website to drum up support from civil society groups across the world.    
	The land-acquisition process for the project, which requires 10,000 acres, has begun. The government is promising a reasonable rehabilitation and resettlement plan but the families suspect they will get a raw deal.    
	The fisherman received a shot in the arm when the state human rights commission recently directed the government not to resort to forcible acquisition of land from them.        
	Shorter court queues in sight              
	Delhiites can hope for a shorter wait in the capitals courts.    
	The state cabinet recently cleared a proposal to create over 1,000 posts, which will include slots for 160 officers, for the Delhi Judicial Service to deal with pending cases    
	The new jobs will also cover Dwarka and Saket district courts, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the meeting where the new posts were given the approval. The two courts are among those that have been set up in recent years as the capital has grown in size and people.    
	The staff increase is likely to help overcome problem of cases pending for years and ensure smooth functioning of judicial system in the capital, Dikshit said. This should benefit both litigants and the overburdened judiciary.        
	Power less, diesel more              
	Powerstarved Chennai appears too hungry for diesel.    
	The Tamil Nadu government has said it could ask the Centre to increase its monthly quota of fuel. Chief secretary L.K. Tripathy was told at a recent meeting of state officials and oil company executives that demand for diesel had increased up to 35 per cent over same time last year.    
	The companies have increased their quota by 15 per cent but claim they cannot give more. The high demand has been caused by increased use of diesel by the industry to run generators because of power shortage, which is up to 800MW in peak hours, Tripathy said.    
	Any such request will mean asking the Union petroleum ministry for more than the 4.2 lakh kilo litres of diesel a month, the states current consumption. As one of the options, we are considering pressing for an increased supply, Tripathy said.    
	Chennai has had to live with load shedding even at night with power officials saying generation had fallen steeply. The state has also had to cope with less wind power.            
	Stray bill              
	Catching strays is trouble enough and caging them expensive.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has handed out Rs 2.83 crore to four voluntary organisations (NGOs) that take care of the cows caught during its anti-stray drives.    
	The money was released as grants-in-aid recently for the upkeep of the shelters where the cattle have been kept. According to acting mayor Divya Jaiswal, the four NGOs have been looking after a total of 6,552 such cattle.

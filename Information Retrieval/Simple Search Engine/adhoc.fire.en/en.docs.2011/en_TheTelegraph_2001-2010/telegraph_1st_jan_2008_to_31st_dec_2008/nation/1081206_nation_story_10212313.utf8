          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: Maoist scare today gripped the Assembly with a ruling BJD legislator receiving a threat letter purportedly from the rebels.         
	He has sought immediate security cover from the government. Drawing attention of the House during zero hour today, BJD MLA from Pipili, Pradeep Maharathy said: I have received a threat letter from the Maoists. Late last night, I saw a few CPI(ML) cadre moving near my residence.        
	Stating that he had earlier received a few Maoist posters about a month ago, Maharathy said he had handed over all the material to the Speaker. Speaker Kishore Kumar Mohanty said he had referred the matter to the home department for inquiry. Later, chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters outside the House that the matter was being investigated.

	Lahore, Dec. 5: By Indian accounts, Markaz-e-Taiba is the dragons lair  the headquarters of the Pakistani militant group that slaughtered 171 people in Mumbai last week.        
	The reality, when The Times visited yesterday, appeared rather more civilised. A lunch of spiced chicken, rice and bread was laid out across 10 round tables in an immaculate rose garden inside the complex on the outskirts of Lahore.        
	Polite young men with long beards handed around bottles of mineral water as a spokesperson held forth in impeccable English. The gunmen who normally patrol the 75-acre grounds were nowhere to be seen. Welcome, said a smiling guard as he frisked a visitor at the gate.        
	This was the friendly face of the Islamist movement now at the centre of the investigation into the Mumbai attacks.        
	Markaz-e-Taiba is the headquarters of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity that says it does only peaceful social work. Indian officials insist that it is a front for the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	The Dawa, anxious to profess its innocence, invited reporters on a rare tour of its facilities near the town of Muridke in the central province of Punjab.        
	All the allegations against us are baseless, Abdullah Muntazir, a spokesperson for the group who used to speak for the Lashkar, told his visitors. You can see what we do here.        
	India says that the case against the Dawa is clear cut: its leader is Mohammed Hafeez Saeed, the founder of the Lashkar and one of the 20 people whose extradition was demanded from Pakistan by Delhi this week. He left the Lashkar shortly before it was banned for the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001.        
	Some Indians have called for a military strike on Markaz-e-Taiba, which Saeed founded in 1994 as a teaching centre for the Wahabi branch of Islam. But the tour illustrates how difficult that could be for a weak civilian government in a country of 165 million people, growing numbers of whom support the Dawa.        
	First, the group condemns the Mumbai attacks and denies any involvement. Second, it says that it does nothing illegal: its professed aim is to provide academic and religious education to Pakistani boys and girls neglected by the state.        
	Its complex includes two schools where 513 boys and 487 girls are taught the national curriculum, according to Rashid Minhas, the school principal. It is imperative that Muslims should learn science, he said. The complex also contains a mosque, an Islamic seminary, a hospital, a carpenters workshop, a guesthouse and residential blocks.        
	Behind this respectable veneer, however, security officials and experts say that the group continues to recruit for the Lashkars campaign in Kashmir. Some suggest that it does so with the complicity of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence, which founded the Lashkar as a deniable proxy to fight India in Kashmir.                    THE TIMES, LONDON

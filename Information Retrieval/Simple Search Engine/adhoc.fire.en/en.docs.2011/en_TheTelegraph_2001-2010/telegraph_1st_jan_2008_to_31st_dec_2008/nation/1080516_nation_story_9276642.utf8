          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: A day after actress Bidhusmita Mantri lodged an FIR with the Mahila police station here over the smut MMS issue, album actress Leslie Tripathy today complained to the men in uniform about receiving threat calls on her mobile phone.        
	Leslie, who met the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Himanshu Lal, has said that she received the first call around 8.30pm last night.         
	According to her, the caller identified himself as a politician first, but by the end of the sixth call she had identified the voice to be that of Raja, she has alleged.        
	Leslie reportedly received eight messages from the same number throughout the night.        
	She, however, refused to divulge the contents of the SMSs or the calls, as the matter was under investigation.        
	The allegation that Raja Acharya managed to make calls from the Jharpada jail managed to raise eyebrows today.        
	Leslie visited DCP Lals office along with Bidhusmita and model and album co-ordinator Jubuli Sunderray today.        
	However, the three lodged no FIR. We have guns on our heads. However, we are sure that the Orissa government and police will take care of us, Leslie said to the reporters, after meeting the DCP.         
	Police commissioner B.K. Sharma said her charges were under verification. We are verifying the facts and necessary action will be taken if her allegations are proved to be true, he added.         
	Meanwhile, prison officers have decided not to shift the gangster out of the Jharpada special jail.

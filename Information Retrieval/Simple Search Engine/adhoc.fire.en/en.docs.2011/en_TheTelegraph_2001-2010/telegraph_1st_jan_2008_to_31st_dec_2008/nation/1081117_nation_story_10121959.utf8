          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The CPM-led Kerala government today rejected the resignation of Kerala Sahitya Academy president M. Mukundan, who had raised a storm with alleged comments backing one feuding party boss over another.        
	The novelist was quoted by a Malayalam magazine as describing chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan as an outdated saint and his party rival, CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, as a better leader in changing times.        
	Mukundan, a cult figure in Kerala, has claimed that his remarks on Achuthanandan, 85, had been distorted but the issue created a huge controversy in Kerala.        
	Mukundan had then text-messaged his resignation to culture minister M.A. Baby, who had said the author should not have made such comments.        
	However, Baby today said the government would not accept the resignation and that both the chief minister and Vijayan wanted Mukundan to continue in the post.        
	The power struggle between Achuthanandan and Vijayan has been extraordinary for a regimented party like the CPM, which last year temporarily suspended them from the politburo.        
	The current controversy peaked when Achuthanandan countered Mukundan by accepting he was old-fashioned. Its true that I am 85 years old and belong to the old school of thought based on an ideology that began in 1848, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 30-day relief for Sarabjit
                                                                                                               30-day relief for Sarabjit
          NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                          Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur in Delhi. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	March 19: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has deferred Sarabjit Singhs execution by a month, officials said today.        
	Prison official Javed Latif said Sarabjit, who has spent 18 years on death row and was due to be hanged on April 1, has been told about the postponement but refused to divulge what the Indians reaction was.        
	A senior official in the Punjab provincial government told The Telegraph that a notification staying the execution had been issued.        
	The President has been pleased to stay the execution of condemned prisoner Manjit Singh alias Sarabjit Singh, son of Solakhna Singh, for a period of 30 days up to April 30, 2008, the notification said.         
	News of the stay had been informally communicated to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, spokesperson Sanjay Mathur said.        
	Sarabjit, a 35-year-old from Amritsar, was jailed in Pakistan in 1990 on charges of spying and involvement in five blasts in Lahore, Kasur and Faisalabad that killed at least 14 people. His family says he had accidentally strayed into Pakistani territory.        
	The 30-day breather followed Indias formal appeal for clemency yesterday, the Punjab provincial government official said, adding that it was not clear what decision the government would take after a month.        
	Pakistans caretaker human rights minister Ansar Burney, too, had urged Musharraf yesterday to let Sarabjit live out his days in jail. He had said that execution after being on death row for so long would amount to double punishment and murder of human rights.        
	Delhi today said it would continue with its efforts to save Sarabjits life.         
	We have achieved partial success and we will continue to carry on our efforts, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told Parliament.        
	Sarabjits daughter Swapandeep hoped her innocent father would be set free. We are happy.... I am hopeful that my papa will be released and comes back soon, she said.

Go to bedroom
  - From Oct, smoking limited to homes, open space amp; special zones        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ramadoss                                        
	New Delhi, July 11: The area in India available for smoking is set to dramatically shrink from October 2 as revised tobacco control rules announced today by the health minister Anbumani Ramadoss will come into force.        
	The new rules will allow people to smoke only inside their homes, in completely open spaces such as streets or in special smoking zones in restaurants and hotels with seating capacities of 30 or more.         
	Smoking will be banned in public and private buildings, Ramadoss said. Health officials have indicated that the ban in private buildings is specifically aimed at addressing smoking at workplaces.         
	Smokers can have a puff at the risk of their health, but in private in their bedrooms, Ramadoss said. Health officials and anti-tobacco activists have in the past pointed out that private homes can be considered workplaces for workers such as maids.         
	They said the revised rules, in principle, would allow staff  whether a maid in a private household or a waiter in a restaurant  to demand that their workplace remains smoke-free.         
	Health officials have revised the five-year-old tobacco control rules that many activists believed have been ineffective in some ways.         
	For instance, the rules had prescribed special smoking zones in restaurants with 30 or more seats. While restaurants have delineated smoking zones, there are usually no physical barriers separating the smoking and no-smoking zones.         
	This exposes people to second-hand smoke despite the rules, said Monika Arora, director of Hriday-Shan, a non-government agency in New Delhi that has been promoting health education among youth and campaigning for tougher rules to discourage smoking.         
	The rules prohibit smoking in places with large congregations of people such as railway stations, stadiums or bus stops. The revisions will force restaurants to install smoke barriers such as floor-to-roof partitions or exhaust vents.         
	The rules have now become very clear and explicit, said Arora. While smokers could be fined for violations, even owners and supervisors at workplaces could be held responsible for the violations, she said.

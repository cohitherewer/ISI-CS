          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The army will recruit more officers on short service commission to overcome a shortage after the Centre accepted a proposal to restructure the officers cadre, defence minister A.K. Antony said in Parliament today.         
	Army headquarters has proposed that the intake of permanent commissioned officers be reduced and a new scheme to recruit non-technical officers on short service commission be introduced, Antony said. The Centre has granted in-principle approval to the suggestion.         
	Officers on short service commission have the option of quitting service after 14 years or taking permanent commission if medically fit.         
	Last month, the Centre also announced that it was framing new rules to grant women permanent commission in non-combat wings of the armed forces.         
	In a separate answer to a question in Parliament, Antony said: The shortage of officers in the three services is largely attributable to changes in the socio-economic environment and the resultant change in career preferences, better employment opportunities in other sectors, tough selection procedures and service conditions required for the armed forces, etc.         
	Statistics released by the minister showed that there was a shortage of over 11,000 officers in the army alone (see chart) despite a drive in the last three years to increase recruitment.         
	The defence minister said the armed forces had detailed their grievances with the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission.         
	He said no officer of the navy or air force had sought premature retirement on the ground of dissatisfaction with the Sixth Pay Commission report.         
	However, in the army, since March 2008, a total number of 584 officers (less army medical corps/army dental corps and military nursing service) have applied for premature retirement/resignation on ground of non-empanelment, compassionate ground, low medical category, failure to acquire minimum technical qualification and better employment in civil life. However, from this it cannot be ascertained that they have sought an exit because of resentment against the Sixth Pay Commission report, Antony said.

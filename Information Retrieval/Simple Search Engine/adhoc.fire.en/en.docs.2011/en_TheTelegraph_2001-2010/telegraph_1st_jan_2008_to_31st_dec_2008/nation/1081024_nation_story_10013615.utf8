The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Children die in blast at illegal cracker factory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Children die in blast at illegal cracker factory
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Crackers lie on the ground after the blast at the Bharatpur factory on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Jaipur, Oct. 23: Twelve children and 13 adults were killed when explosions ripped through eight homes where crackers were being made illegally in a Rajasthan village late last night.        
	More than 10 other children and several adults suffered severe burns in the blasts in Darkutta, a village 200km from Jaipur where cracker-manufacturing has become a cottage industry, police said.        
	The injured are in hospital in Deeg, the nearest township.         
	Sources said the dead and injured children were suspected to be child labourers but Anand Kumar, the collector of the district, Bharatpur, denied this.         
	Police officers said that at least 12 families were involved in making crackers in Darkutta, working in hazardous conditions and using their homes, which adjoined one another, as a single makeshift factory. The money they earn during Diwali forms the biggest chunk of their annual income.        
	Sources said explosives had carelessly been left strewn across the floors where the crackers were being assembled. A fire must have broken out for some reason and, because the explosives had not been covered, set off one powerful blast after another, bringing down eight homes.         
	Bharatpur superintendent of police Rohit Mahajan said six bodies were pulled out of the rubble today apart from the 18 recovered late last night.        
	Of the 20 injured, one died in hospital today. The main person (behind the factory) was also killed, he said.        
	Ashok Khandelwal, a child rights activist and member of a labour union, the Dakshin Rajasthan Mazdoor Union, said the state had the third-highest number of child labourers in India, behind Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.        
	Khandelwal estimated that 35-36 lakh child workers formed part of the states labour pool. Many of them have migrated to other states, such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where they work at textile and tobacco-processing units.        
	In Rajasthan, most child labourers are engaged in agriculture, carpet and bidi manufacturing, and in the gem and jewellery industry.        
	Khandelwal regretted the lack of state government measures to curb child labour.        
	The Centre has issued a protocol for rehabilitation of child labourers but it is being followed in only six districts of south Rajasthan. It will, however, be implemented in all districts soon, he said.        
	Rehabilitation means putting the children into schools and repatriating them to their states. But this is only an interim measure and not enough has been done in this field. This protocol is already working in Maharashtra.        
	Jyotsna Lall, state co-ordinator for Aajjeevika, an NGO working with migrant workers, said the state labour department had on August 20 met organisations with experience in the field for a survey on the number of child labourers in Rajasthan.        
	The NGOs refused to do just a number survey because the government had not put forward any clear plan for rehabilitation of the child labourers, Lall said.        
	There is no point in conducting just a number survey and then doing nothing about it.

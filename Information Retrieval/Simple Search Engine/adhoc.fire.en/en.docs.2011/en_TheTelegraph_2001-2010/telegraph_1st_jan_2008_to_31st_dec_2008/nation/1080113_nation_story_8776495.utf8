     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: The army, air force and Airports Authority of India answered Writers SOS with five high-capacity, jet-fitted fire extinguishers, but the government sent no one to coordinate with them.
    
	Two air force extinguishers and one from the AAI reached the site around 11.45am, but officials accompanying them stood helplessly with no one from the fire services to brief them. After about 10 minutes, the officials asked the firemen to fill up their extinguishers tanks.
    
	The army sent two extinguishers from the Panagarh unit around 2.30pm. They had to wait for over half an hour.
    
	The citys firefighters worked on their own while army, IAF and AAI men waited for instructions. There was none to brief them about the lanes and streets, said shop-owner Anil Jaiswal.
    
	Ten personnel from the BSFs National Disaster Response Force, too, were seen standing and watching. No one is seeking our help, a jawan said.
    
	Senior fire services official Anil Kumar said everyone was busy trying to douse the flames. Coordinating with them might have taken time, he said.

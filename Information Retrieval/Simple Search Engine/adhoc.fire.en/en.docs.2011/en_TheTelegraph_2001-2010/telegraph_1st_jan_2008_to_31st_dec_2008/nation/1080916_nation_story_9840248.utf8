          SANJAY K. JHA                          Modi                                        
	Bangalore, Sept. 15: The tussle for primacy among the BJPs second-rung leaders seems over with Narendra Modi tearing through the maze of intrigues to take pole position.        
	This was underlined at the September 12-14 Bangalore national executive where the Gujarat chief minister evoked frenzy among party workers and reverence among the delegates. Even senior leaders treated Modi with awe, almost as if he was the partys real centre of power.        
	Modi is the BJPs hero, theres no doubt about that, said a Rajya Sabha member and L.K. Advani aide.        
	Asked if there was a conscious attempt to project him as number two after Advani, the MP said: Modi is probably the only leader in the entire Sangh parivar today who does not need any projection. Every party worker in the country is looking to him to take the BJP to greater heights.        
	Younger BJP members, who have grown under Advanis tutelage, are anxiously waiting for Modi to take over. One of them, an official at the party headquarters in Delhi, said: Advaniji is being given his due, but the true leader is Modi.        
	The official added: Modi will do wonders for the party. Any talk of objections from the allies and problems within the party is humbug. Modi is unstoppable now.        
	Even Advani has begun treating Modi with extraordinary caution. He respectfully refers to the chief minister as Narendrabhai and often describes him as a source of strength instead of a subordinate.        
	No other chief minister is given such importance. Advani used to give much importance to Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Venkaiah Naidu, but the equations have changed.        
	Over a dozen senior leaders spoke at the national executive, but only Modis speech was officially released by the party apart from the customary distribution of the addresses of the party president and the shadow Prime Minister. The media, too, were alerted sufficiently in advance about Modis speech.        
	Advani, while listing the BJPs achievements, cited the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Modi in addition to the partys success in turning a Congress-dominated polity into a bipolar system.        
	He did not mention any of the other BJP chief ministers work.

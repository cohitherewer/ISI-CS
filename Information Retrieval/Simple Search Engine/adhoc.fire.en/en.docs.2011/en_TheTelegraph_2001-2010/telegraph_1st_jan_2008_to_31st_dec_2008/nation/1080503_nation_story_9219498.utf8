          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR AND AGENCIES                          Dalai Lama                                   
	Shimla, May 2: Two special envoys of the Dalai Lama left India today for talks with Chinese representatives on the Tibet crisis.        
	Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen are due to reach China tomorrow for what the Tibetan side called informal talks.        
	Chhime R. Chhoekyapa, the secretary to the Dalai Lama, gave no further details of where or when the talks would take place.        
	After a crackdown on protests against Chinese rule in Tibet, an international diplomatic chorus earlier this year had urged dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Beijing abruptly announced on April 25 that it intended to meet his aides.        
	The Dalai Lama had sent a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao on March 19, offering to send emissaries to Tibet to calm down tension following Beijings crackdown.         
	During this brief visit, the envoys will take up the urgent issue of the current crisis in the Tibetan areas. They will convey His Holiness the Dalai Lamas deep concerns about the Chinese authorities handling of the situation and also provide suggestions to bring peace to the region, said Chhoekyapa.        
	This is not the first time that the Dalai the Lama is sending his envoys for talks.         
	Six rounds of talks have taken place till 2007, without a breakthrough.        
	We are hopeful that the Chinese are willing t address the Tibet issue realistically, Tenzin Taklha, a spokesperson of the Dalai Lama, told Reuters.        
	Despite the offer of talks, China has accused Tibets exiled spiritual leader, who fled Tibet after a failed 1959 uprising against communist rule, of manipulating opinion and governments in the West.        
	It remains to be seen if the Olympics present a genuine opportunity for progress, or if China is merely trying to deflect criticism ahead of the games by appearing open to dialogue.        
	Tibetan government spokesman Thubten Samphal said the talks were being held on an informal level because we cannot do business as usual when the situation in Tibet is so grave.        
	The crisis in Tibet should end before formal discussions.

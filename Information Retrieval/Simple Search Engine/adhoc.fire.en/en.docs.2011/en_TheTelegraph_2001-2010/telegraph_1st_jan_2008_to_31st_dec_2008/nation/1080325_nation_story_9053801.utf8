          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: The Centre has asked telecom service providers to quickly install security measures to monitor email sent through BlackBerrys, which it confirmed will not be banned.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) is talking to BlackBerry service providers Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Reliance Communications to see what monitoring device can be found.        
	DoT officials have suggested that the companies hand in a summary of information, including data on the server and decoding key, to the intelligence agencies. A decoding key is required to decipher messages travelling on the Blackberry service.        
	The government had earlier moved towards banning the popular hand-held device because security agencies cannot monitor its email content, which is in an encrypted form with the servers located in Canada and other foreign countries.        
	It had said the device, made by the Canada-based Research in Motion, posed a security threat since terrorists could use it to exchange information.

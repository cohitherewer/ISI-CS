     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Dhanbad, Jan. 7: Medicinal plants cultivated in abundance in the coal belt have aroused the interest of Swami Ramdevs Yogpeeth at Kankhal. 
    
	Authorities of Yogpeeth have written to the divisional forest department of Dhanbad division pledging support to cultivate the medicinal plants.
    
	The divisional forest officer (DFO), Sanjeev Kumar, said a lot of medicinal plants are grown in Dhanbad and many villagers are employed to maintain them, but marketing them was a problem.
    
	Dhanbad soil has been good for medicinal plants. We have a nursery but no channel to the market. Hence I wrote to the centre at Kankhal and got a positive response, the DFO said.
    
	Yogpeeth would get the plants grown by villagers and then extract medicines from them. The institute would also tell the villagers what to cultivate. The greener pastures of Dhangi hills along the Dhanbad-Govindpur road would be used to grow about 1.25 lakh plants worth Rs 10 lakh. This would be in additional to the stretch after Gadi Tundi nursery, which has a huge collection of plants.
    
	The DFO said the coal belt soil can nourish any variety of plant easily but a lot of medicinal plants grown in the remote village areas go unnoticed. 
    
	If the plants are grown here the returns of the business, would be fruitful for the place and the government, he added.

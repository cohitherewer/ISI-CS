	Srinagar, June 8 (PTI): Pakistani film Khuda Kay Liye has found few takers in Kashmir, with only 15 persons turning up for its first screening here.        
	This was the first Pakistani film to be screened in Kashmir in 40 years.        
	It is disappointing. The response continues to be poor even though we get good openings for an average film, said Noor Mohammad, the manager of Neelam cinema which is screening the film.        
	Khuda Kay Liye has set box office records in Pakistan and earned accolades from around the world.         
	Neelam is the only cinema hall open in the Kashmir valley since militancy broke out in the late eighties.        
	Most other cinema hall owners shut shop after militant groups enforced the closure of cinema houses, liquor shops, bars and beauty parlours.

	Pune, Aug. 19 (PTI): A former Maharashtra minister fled from a Pune hotel today after learning that a sessions court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea in a chinkara poaching case.        
	Forest officials have launched a search for Dharmarao Baba Atram of the Nationalist Congress Party.        
	Atram had resigned after allegations of his involvement in a chinkara hunt. He may have left for Mumbai immediately after Justice D. Waikar dismissed his plea, a forest official said.        
	We searched the hotel premises where he was staying when he arrived in Pune for the final hearing on his anticipatory bail application but could not trace him, said Hanumant Dhumal, the investigating forest official. Our men have been instructed to check vehicles on the Pune-Mumbai highway to trace Atram.        
	According to eyewitnesses, Atrams car, fitted with a red beacon, was seen in a protected forest area in Baramati-Purandar on the night of June 14 when a chinkara was killed. Six persons have been arrested in the case.

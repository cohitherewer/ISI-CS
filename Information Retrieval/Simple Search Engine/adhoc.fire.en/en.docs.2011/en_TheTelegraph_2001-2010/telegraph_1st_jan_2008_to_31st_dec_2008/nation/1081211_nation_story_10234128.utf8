          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 10: An alleged Rs 200-crore spurious drug racket rocked the Assembly today with the Opposition demanding an inquiry by the lokpal or a sitting high court judge. It has also sought enactment of a special legislation to prevent the sale of substandard medicines.        
	Even the ruling party members conceded that spurious drugs were being distributed across the state and suggested for setting up of a corporation on the lines of Orissa State Beverage Corporation, which regulates the sale of liquor here.        
	Lambasting the government for its laxity, deputy leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra said the spurious drug racket was first detected in Kantabanji of Bolangir district last year.         
	But no action was taken against those involved in the manufacture and sale of spurious drugs.         
	Finally, the high court intervened in the matter and asked the Bolangir superintendent of police to inquire into the matter and submit a report. The then Bolangir superintendent of police had submitted a report in the high court stating that the allegations on widespread sale of spurious drugs in the district were not correct. However, his successor had conducted raids on various medicine shops and a huge stock of spurious drugs was seized, said Mishra.         
	Subsequently, raids were conducted at various places and spurious drugs were found dumped in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, he said.        
	Coming down heavily on the government for taking the matter casually, senior Congress member and former minister Nalinikanta Mohanty said the health minister had admitted that only 22 and 11 prosecutions were launched during 2007-08 and 2008-09.         
	How can the drug control administration be effective when it has remained headless since the past eight months and 14 drug inspector posts are lying vacant, Mohanty asked.         
	Denying the allegation about government inaction, health minister Sanatan Bisi said 33 prosecutions were launched and 87 seizures were made during the past two years.        
	He also admitted manpower crunch in the drug control administration with several posts lying vacant.

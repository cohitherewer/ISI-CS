          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 6: Delhi High Court has issued a notice to Mayavati on an appeal by the Centre challenging the Income Tax Appellate Tribunals decision not to tax her on gifts worth Rs 64 lakh.        
	Mayavati, now the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, allegedly received Rs 2 lakh in cash in the 2003-04 assessment year. She was also gifted two properties, worth Rs 40 lakh and Rs 22 lakh, by her supporters.         
	The bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and V.B. Gupta has asked the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief to submit her reply by September 19, the date for the next hearing.         
	On November 30 last year, the tribunal ruled that the gifts given to Mayavati were a token of her supporters love and affection and did not fall in her taxable income.         
	These gifts are made out of natural love and affection by (the) donors the tribunal said.         
	The Centre appealed against the decision in the high court, contending that the cash and property gifted to the BSP chief should be part of her annual taxable income.         
	It also alleged that Mayavati had tried to evade payment of tax.         
	The assessing officer has clearly shown that purchases as well as the gift transactions were sham which had been performed only with the intent to evade payment of tax, it said.         
	The income-tax department, however, has a problem. The rule that makes gifts from people other than blood relations taxable was introduced only on September 1, 2004. Before 2004, gifts were not taxable. This means the department would have to prove that the rule can be applied with retrospective effect.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Antony. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 21: The defence ministry has asked the armed forces to make promotions in the services more transparent after controversies following allegations of out-of-turn or impolitic choices.         
	The defence ministrys advice to the armed forces has come in the form of counsel by defence minister A.K. Antony to the Indian Air Force at an air force commanders conference that began here today. Antony said all personnel should get timely redress.         
	The promotion boards should be transparent and objective, Antony told the air force commanders.         
	Since air force commanders deliberate on the personal profiles of officers in the zone of consideration (for promotions), I would like to suggest that you should keep various aspects related to the profiles, keeping their meritorious record in view, so that there are no inconsistencies while grading the officers. Cases of supersession should have sufficient justification which should be clearly pointed out, Antony said.         
	His advice comes a week after the chief of staff of the northern command, Lt General Katoch, went on leave after Lt General P.C. Bhardwaj, junior to him, was appointed northern army commander.         
	Earlier, Lt General H.S. Panag had protested against army chief General Deepak Kapoors order to move him to the central command from the northern command. While the Centre upheld the army chiefs prerogative to post and appoint senior officers, Antony gave Lt General Panag a patient hearing.         
	There are nearly 10,000 cases pending in courts relating to officers and soldiers complaints on promotions. An armed forces tribunal that is scheduled to be constituted in June is to be put in charge of all these cases.         
	The steep hierarchy in the armed forces inevitably leads to heartburn among officers and soldiers because the higher they move, the fewer the offices that are available to them.         
	Reward assurance         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today assured the armed forces, which have complained of serious anomalies in the pay commission report, of proper reward.        
	I would like our civil and defence services to be properly rewarded. I also believe that the tax payers will not grudge anyone of us better remuneration as long as we are serving the best interests of our people, most efficiently, he said at a programme to mark Civil Services Day.

	Srinagar, Aug. 3: Fears of a communal flare-up forced Jammu officials to clamp curfew in more areas and seal offices of two television channels for alleged provocative coverage.         
	The government extended the curfew to Rajouri, Udhampur and parts of Doda. These areas had witnessed little violence earlier, but the government did not want to take chances. Jammu and Samba districts are already under curfew, and the army has been deployed.        
	The Amarnath land row has polarised the region and several people in the Muslim-majority Rajouri district were on the streets on Sunday following reports of assault and arson across Jammu. Several houses were torched in RS Pora and Samba of Jammu.         
	Separatists have called for an agitation in Kashmir and the Muslim-majority districts of Jammu on Monday to protest the alleged victimisation of the members of minority community.        
	In Jammu, the authorities sealed the offices of two local news channels, Take 1 and JK. Police used force to disperse reporters from different news channels, who were on the spot to cover the incident. Two journalists of two national networks were injured in the police action.         
	Protesters defied curfew and fought a pitched battle with the police which lobbed tear gas shells and wielded the baton to disperse them.         
	Jammu district commissioner Mandeep Bhandari said the channels were told not to broadcast news because of provocative coverage and spreading half-truths about the situation.         
	Under Sections 5 and 6(I) of the Cable Network Act, we have asked the channels to stop transmitting news content. Take-1 and JK Channel have a variety of channels, including entertainment. We have asked them to stop beaming only news because their coverage was provocative and they were showing half-truths, said Bhandari. The ban was lifted in the evening.        
	The authorities also suspended text messaging services to check the spread of rumours.         
	The administration has asked the Shri Amarnath Sangrash Samiti, spearheading the campaign against the revocation of the land allotment order, to vacate its office.         
	The samiti has extended the Jammu bandh by another five days, he said. A strike was observed in Jammu for eleventh consecutive day today.         
	In Srinagar, chief secretary S.S. Kapoor said the government had sought the armys help to bring the situation under control in Jammu and restore the supply of essentials to Kashmir through the 300km Srinagar-Jammu national highway.         
	Kapoor said 172 trucks carrying supplies entered Kashmir today. Pro-Amarnath land agitators in Jammu had enforced an economic blockade of Kashmir.

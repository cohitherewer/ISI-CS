                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP washes hands of Brajesh nuke flip-flop
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Brajesh Mishra                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: The BJP leadership today made a subtle attempt to denounce former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra for changing his views on the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The party lamented that Mishra had begun to speak the language of the governments emissaries who had tried to persuade the BJP with some incredible logic and not facts.        
	Mishra had said in an interview that India must sign the deal with the Bush regime if it wanted to avoid a terrible loss of face in the global community.        
	However, the party is clearly not prepared to openly confront Mishra, who was the main architect of the NDA governments foreign policy and handled strategic affairs in his capacity as national security adviser and principal secretary to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.         
	Jaswant Singh and Arun Shourie, who briefed reporters today, repeatedly stressed that the party was not rubbishing what Mishra had said but was issuing a general foreign policy statement.        
	The statement did deal with other issues like China, Tibet and Nepal, but its main purpose was to quell speculation about rifts in the BJP after Mishras advocacy of the nuclear deal.         
	Jaswant dissociated the BJP from Mishras views. He argued that the bureaucrat, assigned a task by the BJP-led government, was not the spokesperson for the party.         
	He was an excellent IFS officer. He has lots of experience and he did the job given to him quite well. We have conveyed this to him on various occasions, he said.        
	Asked if Mishras statement had embarrassed the BJP, Jaswant said it didnt. He is free to have his views. The BJPs views are different.        
	But Arun Shourie, not a politician by training, revealed the anguish in the party over Mishras volte-face.         
	He asserted that all meetings held by senior BJP leaders to discuss the nuclear deal had been attended by Mishra and the statements drafted with his consent.         
	At one meeting at Ataljis residence, Mishra asked us if we need to revise our opinion in the light of a letter written by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. All the senior leaders, including L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh, said there is nothing new in the letter that warrants a change in our perception.        
	Since then, every new statement, every single flutter about the deal and every meeting by emissaries have been discussed by the party. Nobody gave us any new facts, Shourie said.        
	He expressed outrage at some incredible ideas  like why does the BJP not take credit for the deal and why should the Congress and the BJP not join hands on the deal?  the emissaries had come up with.        
	Apart from these incredible, far-fetched arguments, no emissary gave any new fact. Now we see Brajeshji repeating some of those arguments, he added, hinting that Mishra had fallen into the governments trap which the BJP had skirted.         
	But the BJP is treading with caution as Mishra might have lots of beans to spill and put the party in trouble.         
	Asked if Mishra was talking nonsense, both Jaswant and Shourie flared up. Dont put words in our mouths, they said, adding that the party regarded the former national security adviser highly.        
	The statement issued by the duo said the Prime Minister had endangered the India-US bilateral relationship by reducing it to a single issue.

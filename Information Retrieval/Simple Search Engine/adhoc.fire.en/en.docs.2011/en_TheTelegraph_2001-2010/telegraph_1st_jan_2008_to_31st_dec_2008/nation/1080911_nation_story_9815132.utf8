	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 10: The state government would conduct a study on zero unemployment right from the block level by a professional agency.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday to review the implementation of self-employment programmes in the state.        
	Assessment of job potentials would also be entrusted to a market research agency, said officials present at the meeting. Focus is being given on the success of self-employment schemes this year in view of coming elections. The government set up an employment mission to draw up and monitor programmes for creation of self-employment opportunities for educated unemployed youths.        
	Naveen has been laying stress on employability and urging the industrial houses to set up industrial training centres at least one in each block.         
	So far, 37 industrial training institutes were set up by the government, while 352 industrial training centres are being run by private institutes.        
	Training was given to 4,516 youths during 2005-06, 7,700 youths in 2006-07 and 13,266 youths were trained by the institutes during 2007-08, while 8,972 youths are undergoing training during the current fiscal.        
	It was revealed from the review that bank credit to the tune of Rs 2,839 crore had been provided to as many as 3.53 lakh youths for self-employment since 2006-07. A target has been set to create self-employment opportunities by various government departments for 2.94 lakh unemployed youths during the current fiscal.        
	The state employment mission has been organising self-employment fair since 2006-07. About 78,366 unemployed youths had participated in the fair in 2006-07, last years fair was attended by more than 2.1 lakh unemployed youths, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gaya panel warns violators
                                                                                                               Gaya panel warns violators
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, March 6: Gaya Municipal Corporation has served an ultimatum to 12 (and more) Bodh Gaya-based international monasteries for violation of construction norms and Master Plan.        
	With notices being served, demolition threat looms large over Thai and Korean monasteries, conceded municipal commissioner S.K. Tiwari.         
	Gaya district magistrate Jitendra Srivastava convened a meeting of monasteries representatives midweek and explained to them the legal hassles and threat.         
	According to the commissioner, three types of rule violations had come to light. Some monasteries were built in the special area where no construction is permissible. Some were built without prior approval of their building plan by competent authority.        
	In the third category of violations  some monasteries have deviated from the approved plans.         
	It has been planned that a special camp would be organised on March 9 and 10, 2008, to consider the legal feasibility of regularisation of some of the less serious violations of the plan.         
	Afterwards, monastery management would be given 10 days (March 20) for voluntary demolition. After the deadline, the municipal corporation would start demolishing illegal structures.         
	Srivastave allegedly, gave the impression that the administration would be tough on violators. Ever since the shrine was included in the list of the world heritage sites, Unesco has been pressing for a detailed master plan for conservation and maintenance.

	Patna , Jan. 1: Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan tendered an unconditional apology to the people of Bihar and Jharkhand saying that he would always remain indebted to them for making him the star that he is. 
 
	Expressing dismay and shock at the Bihar and Jharkhand Motion Pictures Producers Association banning the release of his forthcoming films in the two states, the star stressed that he has been misunderstood and was a victim of film politics. 
 
	The association has banned two of Kishans releases in the two states, where he enjoys a cult following. 
 
	The association had taken a strong objection to Kishan supporting Mithun Chakraborty, who after a payment dispute with a Bihar-based producer, decided not to shoot any Bhhojpuri films in Bihar or Jharkhand. Kishan had reportedly supported his move. 
 
	Talking to The Telegraph over phone from Mumbai, Ravi Kishan today said: Let me make it clear that I have never supported and never will support either the All India Film Employees Confederation or any federations decision to not shoot films in Bihar and Jharkhand.
 
	Even if my people want an apology for something I have not done, I am still ready to say I am sorry, just to make them happy. I believe that Bhojpuri films should be shot in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh to render realistic touches to the films, said the actor. 
 
	He, however, lamented: Bhojpuri ko aage lane wale ladke par aaj log tohmat laga rahe hai, sikrana kshetrawad ke naam par (people are targeting the boy (Kishan) who has taken Bhojopuri forward, in the name of narrow regionalism. 
 
	He said it was a matter between two people and should have been settled right there without stretching it this far. 
 
	Kishan has 30-odd Bhojpuri films lined up, 15 of which would be released one after the other, soon. The actor is also working on seven Hindi films, one of which is to be directed by Shyam Benegal. Some Rs 150 crore of the film industry rests on my shoulders mdash; naturally some people are not too happy with that, said the actor. 
 
	The association secretary Amit Sen, however, maintained: Unless Ravi Kishan tenders a written apology to us, the ban on his films would continue. The association has over 1,500 distributors as its members. 
 
	Sen said: Bhojpuri actors owe it to Bihar and Jharkhand and must not abuse the people and places making them a star. 
 
	He added that Ravi Kishan has been changing his statements ever since the controversy began. 
 
	Sunil Kumar, a JD(U) legislator from Biharsharif and a producer and distributor said: Though it all started with the payment dispute between Mithun Chakraborty and I, actors rallying behind Mithun made matters worse.

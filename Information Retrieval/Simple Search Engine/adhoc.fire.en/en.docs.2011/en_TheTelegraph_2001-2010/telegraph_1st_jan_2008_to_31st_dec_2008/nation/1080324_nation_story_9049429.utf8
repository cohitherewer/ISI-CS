                                                                                                               Bachchan wades into Raj row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bachchan: Random                                  
	Mumbai, March 23: Amitabh Bachchan has waved off Raj Thackerays claim that he did more for Uttar Pradesh than for Mumbai as a random charge meriting no attention.        
	Random charges are random. They do not deserve the kind of attention you wish me to give them, the star told a tabloid, breaking his silence on the allegations that had snowballed into a tirade against north Indian migrants last month.        
	Asked if Rajs attack had affected him and his family, he said: This is a free country and everyone has the liberty of free speech. The law of the land and its Constitution are supreme. Every Indian should be affected by that.        
	Raj, the chief of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, had said Bachchan made his fortune in Mumbai but endorsed his home state, fought elections from there and referred to himself as chhora Ganga kinarewala.        
	The tirade had sparked violence in Mumbai and led to an exodus of north Indian migrant workers. Raj was arrested on the charge of making provocative statements and disrupting peace.        
	Bachchans remark has come two days before Rajs first big rally after the row. Police had gagged him from making public speeches till March 3 and his party had remained silent even after because of school exams. Rajs son was taking his SSC exams.        
	There are apprehensions that Raj could rake up the migrants issue at tomorrows Shivaji Park rally and also react to Bachchans comments, the timing of which has been dubbed peculiar.        
	The police said gag orders would be slapped on Raj again if he said anything provocative.        
	Attack on migrants        
	Five north Indian men have filed a complaint at Santacruz police station that a group of suspected MNS supporters attacked them unprovoked with hockey sticks at Juhu beach after Holi celebrations.        
	Displaying injury marks on his back and limbs, a complainant said: They asked where I was from. I told them I was from Bihar. They started beating me. They hit me on the head and on the back. I had to run away to save myself.

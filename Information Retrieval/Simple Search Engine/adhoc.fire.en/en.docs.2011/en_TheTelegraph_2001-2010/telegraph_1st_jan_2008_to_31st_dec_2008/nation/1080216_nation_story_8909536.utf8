The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DMK message to sniping allies
                                                                                                               DMK message to sniping allies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Feb. 15: The DMK has asked the Congress to respect coalition dharma to reciprocate the cooperation it has been getting at the Centre.        
	The message was conveyed through a political resolution adopted at a meeting of the partys administrative committee chaired by M. Karunanidhi.         
	It was also meant for other allies, like the Left and the PMK, but the focus was on how the party felt let down by the Congress.        
	The objective of the unity call was ostensibly to prevent communal forces from gaining the upper hand but the real reason seems to be to send a warning to the allies.        
	A sore point is the Congresss silence in the Assembly when Jayalalithaa accused the DMK regime of giving the LTTE a free run.        
	The DMK is also upset that the Congress high command did nothing when the Centre ordered an ASI survey on the Ram setu, widely seen as a ploy to stall the Sethusamudram project under pressure from the BJP.         
	The frequent salvos of the CPM and the PMK against the government have been a source of resentment, too.        
	The four-page resolution made little effort to hide the anguish. Unless the spirit of fraternity and a constructive approach to coalition politics is adhered to by every single constituent of the political coalition, the challenges... facing the nation cannot be met.         
	The resolution recalled that the DMK and its allies had swept all 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and catapulted the Congress to power in Delhi.        
	As an ally at the Centre, the DMK iterated that it had abided by coalition dharma, with its ministers extending full cooperation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and not embarrassing the Congress publicly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP gears up for polls with ally
                                                                                                            BJP gears up for polls with ally
          SUBRAT DAS                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: The ruling BJP may be preparing its cadre fiercely for the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, but it does not seem that they would be battling it out without their ally BJD.        
	The party is slated to bring in star campaigner and BJPs Prime Minister candidate L.K. Advani and senior BJP leaders during the polls.         
	Despite the star move, the BJD-BJP alliance remains strong, as was evident from the presence of Vinay Katiyar, BJPs general secretary in-charge of Orissa, who attended the BJD state executive meeting that concluded recently.         
	Katiyar, after the meeting, said the BJD-BJP electoral alliance would continue in the coming elections. The BJD-BJP coalition government is successfully ruling the state for the second term now and the alliance will continue in the future, too, he said.        
	He, however, evaded questions on the possibility of a change in the seat-sharing formula though it has become imperative in view of the Centres decision to implement the recommendations of the Delimitation Commission.        
	Out of the total 21 Lok Sabha constituencies in Orissa, Deogarh has been abolished and a new constituency (Bargarh) has been carved out of it. Similarly, 15 of total 147 Assembly seats have been abolished and 19 new constituencies have been carved out. Change in reservation status of the Assembly constituencies has affected the political future of several leaders.        
	Chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik recently met L.K. Advani at New Delhi and reportedly discussed the changes in the seat-sharing formula. But, the leaders dont wish to disclose it as yet.        
	Our main enemy is Congress and we will jointly fight with the BJD to keep it away from power, said Katiyar. The BJP state-unit president, Suresh Pujari, confirmed the BJP plan to launch a state-wide campaign against the UPA Centres neglect and apathy.         
	Party chief Rajnath Singh had also castigated the UPA government at the partys first pre-poll rally at Sambalpur on January 23 for its neglect and apathy towards agriculture and farmers.         
	In order to consolidate Hindu votes in Orissa, the BJP state executive lambasted the pseudo-secularist Congress and the Left for their minority appeasement policy.

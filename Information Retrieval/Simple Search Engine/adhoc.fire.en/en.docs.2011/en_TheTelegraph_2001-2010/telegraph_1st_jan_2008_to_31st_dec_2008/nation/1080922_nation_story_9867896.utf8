  - Karnataka miscreants strike again despite tighter security, murder breaks brief lull in riot-torn Kandhamal        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Rajarajeshwari Nagar church near Bangalore that was stoned before Sunday prayers.

	Bangalore, Sept. 21: The attack on Christian institutions today spread to Bangalore and its outskirts, despite tougher security measures put in place after a central warning to rein in communal forces.        
	Early-morning intruders raided two churches, damaged a statue and broke into a prayer hall.         
	No injuries were reported in the attacks that prompted BJP chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to go into a huddle with senior members of his cabinet and top police officers.        
	The raids came two days after the Centre invoked Article 355  a step away from a provision used to dismiss state governments  to warn Karnataka and Orissa, where dozens of Christian homes have been burnt since a Hindu leader was murdered last month.        
	Miscreants climbed the compound wall of a church in Rajarajeshwari Nagar on Bangalores outskirts and threw stones at a statue that PTI said was of Infant Jesus. The two-foot-tall statue tipped to one side after the attack.        
	Local residents said it was the third attack on the church  it was first targeted in 2005 and again a year later when it was still under construction.        
	In the second attack in the city, miscreants entered a church in Hebbal through the back door and smashed everything in sight.        
	Father J. Menezes said the church was locked at night and the attackers broke open the door and destroyed holy water canisters, literature, furniture and friary clothes.        
	City police commissioner Shankar Bidari, who visited the two places, told reporters that investigators had lifted 10 sets of fingerprints from the Hebbal church and seized a bunch of keys and some papers that may have belonged to the attackers. We have detained some persons. We are investigating both cases, he said.         
	Outside, as news of the attack spread, around a thousand people gathered and burnt an effigy of the chief minister and blamed the BJP and its affiliates for the raids.        
	The third attack late at night, on a prayer hall in Siddapura, 220km from here, left furniture broken, police said.        
	Yeddyurappa said vested interests were trying to vitiate the atmosphere and take mileage.         
	Kerala attacks        
	Two churches have been vandalised in Kerala, but police are yet to found out who was behind the attacks.         
	Windowpanes of a Jacobite church were found broken and a statue of Jesus at the cemetery of a Roman Catholic church damaged when priests arrived for Sunday morning mass. Both incidents took place in Nedumbassery, about 30km from Kochi.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left out, Red Flag flies high
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, Aug. 9: Exactly a month after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh publicly told George W. Bush in Toyako that he was very pleased with the state of our relationship, which has truly acquired the characteristic of a genuine strategic partnership, Indo-US defence ties will scale new heights during the next 14 days.        
	On Thursday, Indian Air Force SU-30 fighter planes arrived at the Nellis Air Force Base near the nuclear test site in the Nevada desert for Red Flag combat training exercises that will mark an unprecedented level of engagement between the defence forces of India and the US.         
	The Red Flag exercises from today till August 23 will also have South Korean and French air forces participating in this phase in addition to India and the US. Actual flying for this phase will begin on August 11, according to the public affairs office at the Nellis Air Force Base.         
	Days after Singh won a vote of confidence in Parliament and parted ways with the Left, 30 US Special Forces personnel are in Mizoram for joint counter-terrorism exercises codenamed Operation Vajraprahar at the Indian Armys Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School at Vairangte that are ongoing and will last till the last week of August.         
	These training exercises, now into their fourth year, have so far drawn about 250 American Green Berets to Vairangte, but there were doubts earlier this year about the status of the programme in 2008 in view of the political crisis over ties with America.         
	And defence minister A.K. Antony is expected to be here in September on a visit that was repeatedly delayed after he was invited to Washington by US defence secretary Robert Gates, when they met in Singapore at a global strategic conference in June last year.         
	Antony has been reluctant to travel to Washington lest it should expose him to criticism from the Left. He is particularly vulnerable on this score in Kerala, his home state and a Left bastion.         
	But the defence ministers visit, if it comes about next month, will ginger up defence industry groups and their lobbyists who are critical to the delicate timetable for pushing the nuclear deal through the US Congress during its current life.         
	The Coalition for Partnership with India, which has been reactivated here following last months vote of confidence in the UPA government, has a large defence industry component. This coalition is in the forefront of pushing the nuclear deal here.         
	The Red Flag exercises, which will take place not far from the gambling paradise of Las Vegas, are significant for two reasons.         
	The exercises, created in 1975 to deal with the unacceptable performance of the US Air Force in the Vietnam war has so far been restricted to US allies. India will be taking part for the first time as a non-Nato partner and as a country not formally aligned to America. Secondly, the Americans are excited about Indias decision to join forces with their SU-30s in air-to-ground exercises with US Air Force F-15s, South Korean F-15Ks and French Rafales fighters.         
	The US Air Force, it is learnt, has never engaged the Russian SU-30s  that too their latest MKI version  in direct combat or exercises and the Red Flag will give the Americans a rare opportunity to confront this brand of Russian equipment in action.         
	Indian Air Force IL-76/78 planes will be used for air refuelling exercises by KC-135s from units as yet undetermined, according the public affairs office at the Nellis base.         
	Indias participation in Red Flag for the first time may be the precursor of a plan to set up an advanced test range on the Nellis model at IAF bases either in Gwalior or Kalaikunda, according to defence ministry sources in New Delhi.

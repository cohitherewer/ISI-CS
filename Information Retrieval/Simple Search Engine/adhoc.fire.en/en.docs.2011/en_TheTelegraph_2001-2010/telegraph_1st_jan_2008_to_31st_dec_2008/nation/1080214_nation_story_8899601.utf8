                                                                                                               Lalu gets taste of train food
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Feb. 13: Dishing out substandard food to Lalu Prasad, that too when his stomach is rumbling, can cost you dear.        
	Four senior railway officials got a taste of their bosss wrath after Lalu Prasads trip to Tumkur, 70km from Bangalore, ran into rough weather.        
	Bangalore divisional railway manager Mahesh Mangal, senior divisional commercial manager Anwar Hussain, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation area manager S. Chandra and chief security commandant of the Railway Protection Force, Bangalore division, L.K. Mishra were sent transfer orders yesterday.         
	Lalu Prasad had gone to inspect ongoing works at Tumkur station. A crowd of around 100 stopped him and demanded that Kannadigas get priority over outsiders for Group D jobs in the railways.        
	When they refused to budge after half an hour, the minister turned around and left for Chitradurga, 120km from there.        
	On the way back to Tumkur - it was well past noon - the convoy ran into another hurdle. This time, it was a train that had chosen an inopportune moment to pass. The minister, held up at the level crossing for 10 minutes, was furious that the stationmaster had not been informed of his visit. When they reached Tumkur, the protests were still raging.        
	Lalu Prasad got on a special train to Bangalore, where he was served rotis, chana, dal and vegetables. One look at the lunch packet and the ministers temper touched boiling point. You cant even arrange for a proper lunch. This is nothing but sub-standard food, he thundered.         
	The minister refused to eat till he reached Yeswanthpur station in the evening. He later took a flight to Delhi.

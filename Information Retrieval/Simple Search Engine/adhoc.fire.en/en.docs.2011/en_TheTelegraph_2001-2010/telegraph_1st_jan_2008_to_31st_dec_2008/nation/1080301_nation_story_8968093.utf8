The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Who got what from PCs purse
                                                                                                               Who got what from PCs purse
                                          
	Defence gets more amp; less   
	More is less for defence.   
	Military expenditure has crossed Rs 100,000 crore for the first time. Finance minister P. Chidambaram announced amid the thumping of desks that he was allocating Rs 105,600 crore  10 per cent more  for defence.         
	The figure represents more than twice the combined spending on education (Rs 34,400 crore) and health (Rs 16,534 crore) in what is probably an election year. It is more than five times the amount the Centre proposes to spend on irrigation (Rs 20,000 crore) in a country where falling water tables drive farmers to penury and even suicide.         
	Even the biggest giveaway in the budget  the farm loan waiver of Rs 60,000 crore  looks small.        
	But the booming applause in Parliament hardly echoed in South Blocks defence ministry. Generals quietly worried that for the first time in recent memory, allocation as a share of the gross domestic product has dropped below 2 per cent.         
	Pakistan is estimated to be earmarking 4 per cent of its GDP for defence.        
	To add to the worries, A.K. Antonys regime has for the second year running returned funds allocated to it.         
	We have returned about Rs 4,200 crore from the allocation for 2007-08 (Rs 96,000 crore), said Commodore (retired) Uday Bhaskar, a defence analyst.               
	Setu cash        
	 The government has put its money where its mouth is, trebling the allocation for the Sethusamudram shipping canal project from Rs 524 crore to Rs 1,580 crore.         
	The budget announcement coincided with the Union shipping ministrys appeal to the Supreme Court to vacate the stay on the project.              
	Girl power        
	 Its a good time to be a girl in India.         
	The Conditional Cash Transfer Scheme  under which the government will pay the parents of a girl up to the age of 18  is likely to kick off soon with Rs 60 crore allocated for it.         
	Working women should get more hostels with Rs 18 crore allocated for the purpose, almost a four-fold jump.        
	Chidambaram also set aside Rs 720 crore for womens nutrition, over 20 per cent higher than last year.               
	Anganwadi        
	 Rashida Bis voice carried excitement.         
	The veteran anganwadi worker has, along with hundreds of colleagues, been demanding better working conditions for the community responsible for the health and nutrition of Indias youngest children.         
	Chidambaram today announced an increase in the workers monthly pay from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500. Under the Integrated Child Development Programme, each anganwadi must have a helper to assist the worker. The salary for the helper has been doubled  from Rs 500 to Rs 750 a month.         
	At least, hes heard some of our pleas, Rashida said.         
	The allocation for the child development scheme has gone up from Rs 4,779 crore to Rs 5,665 crore.        
	The Integrated Child Protection Scheme, conceived to check child abuse, could also kick off in the next few months. The budget has reserved Rs 180 crore for it.              
	Save Tiger        
	 The number 1,411 should ring alarm bells. That is the number of tigers in India, Chidambaram said, before announcing a Rs 50-crore one-time grant to raise, arm and deploy a special tiger protection force.         
	Project Tiger officials said the grant was significant because it would help develop a dedicated force to prevent poaching. But a senior wildlife scientist cautioned that decentralised protection forces spread across the states would be more effective than a central force.         
	The exact nature of the force is yet to be worked out, said Rajesh Gopal, director of Project Tiger.         
	Ulhas Karanth, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society India Programme, Bangalore, said an effective anti-poaching system would have to involve tribals, forest watchers recruited from communities living in the forests, and state employees at the lower levels of forest management.        
	A rapid deployment force is unlikely to work, Karanth said. But if the money goes into rejuvenating the ground-based system, it could be very useful.              
	Man in space        
	 A Rs 125-crore grant will allow India to start the studies and technology development required for manned space missions.         
	The total outlay for space is Rs 4,074 crore  a 23 per cent increase over what was spent last year, and the largest share of funding across science and research.         
	Were on track now, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said. The funding will be used to initiate studies on advanced technologies India will need to develop for manned missions.         
	While Isro has not yet sent a formal proposal to the government, scientists have been examining the requirements to indigenously put a man in space by 2015.               
	Minority boost        
	 Funding for minority benefit schemes has been trebled  from Rs 363 crore last year to Rs 1,014 crore  with most of it going into education and health. A merit-cum-means scholarship scheme for professional and technical courses has received Rs 112 crore, another for pre-matric students Rs 71 crore and a plan for post-matric students Rs 90 crore.         
	A multi-sectoral development programme in selected districts, under which schools, hospitals and jobs are to be created, has been allotted Rs 485 crore.               
	Tax holiday        
	 A five-year income-tax holiday has been announced for two-, three- or four-star hotels that come up between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2013, in specified districts that have Unesco-declared world heritage sites.              
	Games gift        
	 Sheila Dikshits government had a Rs 624-crore reason to smile when Chidambaram announced the allocation for its pet project  the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The ministry of sports has been given Rs 224 crore to upgrade stadiums.

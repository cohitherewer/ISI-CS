The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left lines up nuclear strategy meet
                                                                                                               Left lines up nuclear strategy meet
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, March 8: The Left parties are likely to meet on Wednesday to hone their strategy to contain the government from proceeding with the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Left sources said they wanted a clear idea about the governments intention before foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee leaves for the US on March 23-24.        
	Mukherjee is expected to meet US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice with the draft of the IAEA safeguards.        
	We want the government to convene a meeting of the committee in the context of media reports that the draft is ready. And we expect the government to make clear to us its intent on the Indo-US nuclear deal at the meeting. But the obvious urgency is Mukherjees visit to the US and we want a clear answer from the government before that, a senior Left leader said.        
	The sources hinted that the next meeting of the UPA-Left committee would be held in the middle of next week.        
	They said the Congresss intent, including the extent of their immediate public posturing, would be better known by the time the Left parties meet on Wednesday.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to address a budget rally tomorrow. The Congress parliamentary party is meeting on Tuesday.        
	The CPM made it clear that irrespective of the outcome of the safeguard talks, the party would oppose the nuclear deal.        
	The IAEA safeguards dont mean much. We are opposed to the Hyde Act in which the 123 Agreement is anchored. The government should remember that the majority in Parliament is against the deal, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.        
	He added that instability of the government had never been on the Lefts agenda and it was opposed only to the deal.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           early burden                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Children may help stop child labour in their own homes if schools accept a proposal from the Central Board of Secondary Education.        
	The countrys largest school board has written to all affiliated institutions to get students to pledge twice a week during assembly to stop child labour in their homes.        
	 The law bans children under 14 from working, an age limit that the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights says should be raised to 18.         
	Children can ensure that no child below 18 years is employed in their own homes, said the CBSE letter dated October 29, of which The Telegraph has a copy.        
	Over 9,600 schools across India  private schools forming the largest chunk  are affiliated to the central board.         
	The CBSE letter did not suggest the children report to the authorities any violation of child labour laws by their parents. The idea is to inculcate in children a culture that will see them opposing their parents if they try to hire children as domestic labour, a government official said.         
	After a trial period, the initiative could be expanded to include the homes of (the childrens) close relatives and friends and even the neighbourhood, the letter said.         
	The plan, officials said, is to follow the model under which schoolchildren had been educated against firecrackers, and which has apparently helped reduce pollution in metros during Diwali.         
	Countering domestic child labour is hard because (attempts to do) it often involves breach of privacy, a labour ministry official said.        
	Labour inspectors, trained to catch violators of the child labour laws, enter homes on the basis of tipoffs from neighbours. But most neighbours never report on each other because they dont want to spoil the atmosphere in which they live. In some other cases, neighbours complain just to harass someone they dont like, the official said.         
	The 2001 census counted 12.6 million child workers, including about two lakh domestic labourers. Activists say many of the children working in homes are victims of trafficking, and a large number of them are from Bengal.        
	Activists are hoping the CBSE initiative will help debunk an argument often used to justify hiring poor children as domestic help  that employing them is a form of social service.        
	Children can relate easily to children. Once educated at a young age about the exploitation other children go through, they can question the notion that some children have the right to study and play while others need to work, said Shireen Miller of Save the Children, an international NGO. Also, once these children grow up, they are unlikely to employ child labour themselves.

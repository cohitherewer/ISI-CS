	Patna, Jan. 21: Even as residents demanded a CBI probe into the Kahalgoan (Bhagalpur) police firing, the government tried to soothe tempers with 24-hour electricity supply to the Bhagalpur town. 
    
	Residents, who otherwise had put-off protests after a meeting with additional director general of police Abhyanand and Bhagalpur commissioner H.C. Sirohi last evening, have taken exception to the fact that the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar did not visit Kahalgaon even after the police brutality in which three people lost their lives. 
    
	Additional forces were removed from the town after the public asked the police to move out. 
    
	Five jawans of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) escaped public wrath yesterday due to Abhyanands timely intervention and carried out a peace march last evening. The CISF jeep, however, was torched. 
    
	The chief minister has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident with a sitting high court judge leading the probe team. The Opposition, however, has called a Bihar bandh on January 24 and 25 to protest the police highhandedness and the governments failure to resolve the power crisis. 
    
	Talking to The Telegraph, Satyajit Dubey, the functionary of Nagrik Sanghrash Samiti (NSS), said: We have put our protest on hold. But we fail to realise how the government is able to supply 24-hour electricity to the town now, as against the two hours just a few days ago?
    
	Dubey said the dozens of people who had given their lands to the NTPC and were constantly bearing the plants pollution, however, received no benefits. 
    
	We are not interested in knowing if the NTPC or the state electricity board can give us power, we simply want our fair share, which has been allotted to us, said Dubey, asking for a CBI probe into the firing. He said his organisations chairman Sunil Paswan had already forwarded demands for the CBI probe. 
    
	The police firing, he alleged, was a reflection of the negative attitude of the police. The sub-divisional officer B.N. Jha and deputy superintendent of police A.N. Srivastava had tried to bully the public and rightly faced suspension alleged Dubey. The new SDO and DSP are yet to join office. 
    
	Kahalgaon police station officer in charge Ajay Mishra was also suspended for not dealing with the situation, effectively. Normality is slowly returning to the NTPC plant town. Among all the police officers, only Kahalgaon police station officer in charge N.S. Chauhan is in town to take care of the situation.

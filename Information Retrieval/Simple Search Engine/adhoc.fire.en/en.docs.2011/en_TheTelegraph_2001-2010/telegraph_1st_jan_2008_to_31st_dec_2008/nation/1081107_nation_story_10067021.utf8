The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left economist set to miss UN bus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left economist set to miss UN bus
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: Former RBI governor Y.V. Reddy is understood to have edged out Marxist economist Prabhat Patnaik as likely choice for a UN task force on the global financial crisis, though the replaced man said he wasnt aware of the move.        
	I would rather not enter into any speculation on this subject, Patnaik said.        
	The alleged shuffle came days after Patnaik attended a meeting at the UN headquarters on October 30 and addressed the General Assembly with other members of the panel headed by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.        
	I think the very idea of a UN panel for establishing a more stable global economic order is a great idea, he said.        
	It has my full support irrespective of whether he (Stiglitz) makes any further use of my services or not. I would not like it to be clouded by any speculation.        
	But angry Left leaders said they saw no reason why Patnaik should have been edged out by the pro-reform Reddy.        
	Professor Patnaik was invited to the UN panel because of his sound Marxist economic alternatives. And I see no reason why he should be replaced, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told The Telegraph.        
	When contacted, Stiglitz maintained that the task force had not been finalised. I can tell you that the members of the task force have not yet been set, he said in an email reply.         
	Although Patnaik doesnt need official endorsement from the government to be part of the UN panel, the Left suspects Prime Minister Manmohan Singh informally floated the name of Reddy, who is said to have had a good personal equation with Stiglitz.         
	Patnaik, known for his traditional Marxist outlook, has been a consistent critic of Singh and had, on several occasions, openly criticised pro-reform policies initiated by the Prime Minister.        
	Reddy, on the other hand, is a hardcore pro-reform economist and had been Indias representative to the International Monetary Fund.        
	It is definitely true that the current government would not be comfortable with Patnaik being a member of the UN high-power task force, said Marxist economist C.P. Chandrasekhar. But I cant say whether the Prime Ministers Office was behind it.        
	The panels job is to review the international financial system and suggest steps towards a more stable economic order.        
	The task of the Interactive Panel on the Global Financial Crisis also includes reviewing the role of the World Bank and the IMF in the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

                                                                                                               Best possible Vienna update 
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today updated CPM leader Sitaram Yechury on the IAEA talks, a day before the negotiating team returns from Vienna.        
	Sources said the prolonged fifth round of talks had led to the best possible safeguard text for India and what remained was a matter of political vetting from New Delhi.        
	The negotiating team of Ravi Grover, the director of strategic planning in the atomic energy department, and Saurabh Kumar, the ambassador to Austria, is expected to land with the draft tomorrow.        
	The sources said Indias demands for fuel supply assurance, uninterrupted fuel supply for civilian reactors and the right to take corrective action if fuel flow is interrupted have been taken care of in the best possible manner.        
	It was a hard negotiation. We passed many hurdles step by step, a source said.         
	The draft text will be placed before the UPA-Left committee on the nuclear deal for approval. Yechury and Mukherjee are likely to meet early next week.        
	In Washington, US secretary of state Nicholas Burns said India would not be able to get a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group without American help. This blunts the argument for de-Americanising the deal to ensure Left support for nuclear cooperation with Russia or France.        
	The Indian government is not suggesting this, but in your worst-case scenario, if there was an attempt to say, well, were going to forget about the deal with the US but go forward, it could not happen because the NSG wouldnt make the decision in that case, Burns said.

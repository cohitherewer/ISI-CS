	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 21: Lambasting the UPA government for the growing terrorist attacks in the country, the BJP today demanded early general elections simultaneously with the Assembly polls due in a few states like Rajasthan.        
	They might have won the confidence vote, but they lack the trust of the people, said former BJP president Venkaiah Naidu here today.        
	People are angry over the failure of the UPA government. The price of the essential commodities has skyrocketed. There have been frequent terrorist attacks across the country and thousands of farmers are committing suicide, he alleged.        
	Naidu, who spoke to the reporters during a stopover at Biju Patnaik Airport here, said better the UPA government should resign and go for a simultaneous poll with the Assembly elections.        
	Claiming that more than 1,000 people were killed in 102 terrorist attacks during the UPA regime, the BJP leader said the UPA government had no moral right to continue in power. Castigating the UPA government for its inaction and lacklustre performance, he said: The government has no policy, the Prime Minister is making parrot-like statements. Its said the PM presides and madam decides.        
	If the home minister has to go for the failure in tackling terrorism, the Prime Minister also should go, said the BJP leader. Flaying the UPA government for abolishing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota), Naidu said BJP would bring back the law with more stringent provisions if it came to power in the coming elections. While the UPA government lacks political will to act against terrorists, its pointing accusing fingers at Orissa and Karnataka. What has happened in Orissa and Karnataka should be seen in totality. You cant ignore the attack on Swami Laxmananda Saraswati in Orissa and distribution of leaflets against Hindu gods in Karnataka, he said.        
	Referring to the warning issued by the Centre against Orissa and Karnataka governments to invoke Article 355, he dared the Union government to proceed further and face the consequences.

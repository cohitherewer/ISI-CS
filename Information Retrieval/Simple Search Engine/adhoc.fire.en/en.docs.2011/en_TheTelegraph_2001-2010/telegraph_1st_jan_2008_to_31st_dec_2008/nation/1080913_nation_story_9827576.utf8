          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Yasin Malik being taken to hospital in Srinagar. (Reuters)                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 12: Two persons died and several, including separatist leader Yasin Malik, were injured in fresh clashes between security forces and pro-freedom protesters across the Valley.        
	The Hurriyat-led co-ordination committee had announced a new round of rallies after 12.30 this afternoon. Thousands took to the streets after Friday prayers, shouting azaadi slogans, in response to the call.         
	One person died in police firing at Goal Chakri in Shopian. Police chief Javed Ahmad claimed the protesters had pelted his men with stones, triggering the firing.         
	The security forces tried to quell the mob by using lathis and firing smoke shells. One person died when the forces opened fire, Ahmad said.        
	The police claimed one of the protesters had snatched a rifle from a CRPF jawan and fired at him. The jawan is said to be in critical condition.        
	Another protester, Manzoor Ahmad, was killed in Baramulla.        
	The two deaths have taken the toll in the three-month-long freedom campaign to 45.         
	Among the over 50 people injured today was Malik, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman. The separatist leader had defied house arrest, which he has been under since August 25, to lead a march to Srinagars Lal Chowk.        
	A contingent of the police and the CRPF swooped on the protesters, wielding batons and lobbing teargas shells.         
	A JKLF activist said Malik fell unconscious apparently after being hit by a teargas shell. Hospital sources said he had a leg injury.         
	The separatists have declared a month-long resistance programme that would culminate in a march to Srinagar on October 6.         
	Moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq today urged people to boycott the forthcoming Assembly elections in the state. Nobody should participate in the polls, he told a gathering at Srinagars Jamia Masjid.

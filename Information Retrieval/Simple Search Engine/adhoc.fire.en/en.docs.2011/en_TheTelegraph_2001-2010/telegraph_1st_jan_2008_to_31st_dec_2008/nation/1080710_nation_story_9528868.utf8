The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Split income cutoff for job amp; education: Arjun
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Split income cutoff for job amp; education: Arjun
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI       
	New Delhi, July 9: Education minister Arjun Singh has proposed separate OBC creamy layer income ceilings for jobs and education, arguing for a higher cutoff for students, government sources have said.         
	But the social justice ministry has decided to seek cabinet approval for a common income ceiling, settling for the Rs 4.5 lakh per annum figure recommended by the backward classes commission, the officials said.         
	A cabinet note seeking to raise the cutoff annual income slab from the current Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 4.5 lakh has been circulated to all ministries, social justice ministry sources said.        
	The proposed hike is likely to be taken up by the cabinet before the end of the month, they added.         
	Days before the academic year kicks off, Singhs human resource development (HRD) ministry has argued that OBC students need a higher income cutoff to help the most needy among them benefit from quotas launched this year.         
	In its April 20 notification to implement OBC quotas, the ministry had said the same definition of creamy layer would apply to education reservations as the one followed for government jobs.         
	But once we realised that the income ceiling was being reviewed, we revisited the issue. We feel that a common ceiling for jobs and education would hurt the aim behind the governments reservation policy, an HRD ministry official said.         
	The latest statistics collected by the personnel department show that only 6 per cent of government jobs are held by members of OBC communities despite the 27 per cent quota in place since 1993.         
	The HRD ministry has argued that poor education is to blame for the absence of adequate OBC candidates to fill quota seats, a ministry source said.         
	If education quotas are available to more people than the corresponding number for jobs, it will ensure that the best among them will fill the 27 per cent job quotas, the official said.         
	But the National Commission for Backward Classes, given the task of reviewing the creamy layer income ceiling, has suggested a common cutoff for jobs and education, the social justice ministry sources said.         
	There may be a valid case for different ceilings for jobs and education but, at the moment, we believe it would create confusion, a ministry source said.         
	The commission has, however, suggested that other criteria for screening out OBC candidates in jobs and education  such as the amount of irrigable land they hold need to be re-evaluated, the source said.         
	There have been significant changes in the value of irrigable land. The creamy layer definition needs to be such that the value of the maximum land allowed for quotas is comparable with the income cutoff of Rs 4.5 lakh, the source said.

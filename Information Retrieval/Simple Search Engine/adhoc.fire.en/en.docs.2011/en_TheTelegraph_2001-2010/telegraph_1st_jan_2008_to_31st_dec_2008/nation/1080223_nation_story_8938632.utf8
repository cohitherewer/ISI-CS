The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Forward Bloc lone-ranger test in Tripura today
                                                                                                               Forward Bloc lone-ranger test in Tripura today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Agartala, Feb. 22: The Forward Bloc will break a 30-year convention and contest the Tripura Assembly election independently of the CPM tomorrow, offering the Bengal Left Front a sneak preview of what the partner has threatened to repeat in the panchayat polls.        
	The Bloc has fielded candidates against the CPM in 12 of the 60 constituencies in protest against its allys big-brother attitude on sharing seats. In Bengal, the Bloc is opposed to the CPMs brand of industrialisation.         
	The Left Front, which holds 41 seats in the outgoing Assembly, has been in power in Tripura without break since 1993. This time, too, its prospects are considered far brighter than those of the Opposition Congress. The result is expected by March 8.        
	In Tripura  like in Bengal  the Bloc has remained in government. The outcome of the elections is expected to decide whether this arrangement will continue.        
	The Blocs poll manager in Tripura, Hafiz Alam Sairani, said the partys decision to contest some seats independently was thrust on it by the CPM.        
	It will be a neck-and-neck fight in Tripura tomorrow and the CPM should not hold us responsible (for it), he added.         
	A CPM leader said it was unfortunate that the two parties were up against each other in an election after three decades of partnership. But the Blocs walkout will have only marginal impact.        
	The Bloc drew a blank when it contested panchayat polls on its own in 2004.         
	Since 1978, the CPM-dominated Left Front has been leaving a solitary seat  Town Bardowlali  to its ally. When the Bloc leadership demanded three seats this time, the CPM refused to budge.         
	But both CPM and Bloc leaders describe this as temporary estrangement rather than divorce. Left Front insiders are confident that the Bloc will return to the fold after the elections.         
	The election department has insured each of the requisitioned personnel against Rs 2 lakh.        
	The Jampui Jala Colony booth in the Takarjala constituency has hogged the limelight for an unlikely reason.        
	Seven polling officials and 16 jawans will be at hand to help all four registered voters exercise their franchise. The booth has been notified as one of the 108 very, very vulnerable polling stations.

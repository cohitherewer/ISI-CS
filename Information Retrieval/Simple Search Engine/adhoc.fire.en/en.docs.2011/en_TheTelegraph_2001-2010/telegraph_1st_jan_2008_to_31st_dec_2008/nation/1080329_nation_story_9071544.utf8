	Dharamsala, March 28: China today chose not to invite any Indian diplomat to join a group of foreign envoys touring riot-scarred Lhasa.        
	In a hastily arranged visit, China escorted a group of foreign diplomats to Lhasa to showcase its version of the events in the Tibetan capital. The Indian embassy did not receive any invitation, sources said. Diplomats from 15 countries, including the US and Britain, were reportedly among those taken to Lhasa.

	Patna, Aug. 25: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today sent an SOS to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking relief for the marooned people.        
	I will meet the Prime Minister in a couple of days to apprise him of the situation and demand adequate relief, said the chief minister, requesting political parties to shun politics, when people are battling with the worst-ever flood situation.         
	The breach in the Kosi embankment that is yet to be plugged has led the river to change its course and spread over an area of 325km, instead of the earlier 250km.         
	Before the breach, the river beginning from Sunsari district of Nepal passed through Bhimnagar barrage, Birpur, Supaul,, Saharsa, Nawhatta and Chandrain before terminating in the Ganga at Kursela in Purnea near NH-31 that connects Bihar, Bengal and Assam.         
	After the breach that occurred on August 18, the river changed its course and now it passes through Dhundhgarh, Lali (Nepal), Birpur, Bhimnagar, Chhota Ghat, Lalpur, Parsa, Chhap, Sitapur, Gulmi Kishenpur (all in Supaul district of Bihar), Araria, Bokharaha, Sonharsa and Sursand before merging into the Ganga at Kursela.                                       
	After Bihars river of sorrow changed its course, the worst-hit district has been Supaul that is on the verge of losing its existence, said a member of a team carrying out an aerial survey today.         
	We have pressed four helicopters and 100 motorboats into service to ferry men and material, said Nitish Kumar, adding: More helicopters will be requisitioned.         
	The chief minister admitted that over 10lakh people in Bihar are battling the flood fury and surging waters have swallowed homes in Supaul, Saharsa and Madehpura.         
	The marooned have taken shelter along railway tracks, embankments and national highways beyond Kursela.         
	Administration is yet assess the flood toll, but reports of boats capsizing at Supaul and Madhepura have been received.         
	The government has urged the Indian Embassy at Kathmandu to rope in the Nepal government to rush in men and relief to assist state engineers engaged in plugging in the breached embankment at Kusaha.         
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad who carried out an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas yesterday, blamed the Bihar government for not approaching the Centre to seek assistance to repair the Kusaha embankment.         
	He suggested that the state government approach the Centre to seek help to rescue those marooned.         
	Nitish Kumar, however, refused to be dragged into a blame game.         
	I will not indulge in a blame game with Lalu Prasad in the hours of crisis. We are working overtime to save the people, he sumemd up.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anita Durrani                                   
	New Delhi, June 18: The CBI today detained Anita Durrani, family friend of dentist Rajesh Talwar, amid signs she could face a lie test in the Aarushi-Hemraj murder case.         
	Anita came under the scanner as she was also a partner in Talwars clinic and alleged to be having an affair with him.         
	The agency ran a polygraph test on Vijay Mandal, the detained domestic help of a neighbour of the Talwars.         
	Vijay was the fifth person to undergo such tests in the case. The Talwar couple, Durranis domestic help Rajkumar and compounder Krishna went through it earlier.        
	Krishna was taken to a bank where sleuths checked the transactions that took place in his account in the past few weeks. The details have given the officers something that will require him to be interrogated further. A CBI team could also been sent to his Nepal home soon to see the familys standard of living.        
	On Tuesday, the agency had claimed it had a confessional statement from Krishna on his role in the murders.        
	The agency is figuring out the link that the ring of domestic helps  Hemraj, Rajkumar and Vijay  could have had with Talwar. On the minds of the sleuths is a possible blackmail angle where Hemraj was privy to some information and using it against Talwar, sources said.

	Srinagar, Nov. 16: Malegoan blast accused Dayanand Pandeys alleged links with former governor S.K. Sinha has become the newest poll plank in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	On the eve of the elections, Farooq Abdullah and Mufti Muhammad Sayeed have claimed the seer, arrested from Kanpur in connection with the September 29 blast, was close to Sinha.        
	Sinha was in the centre of the Amarnath land allotment row that set off huge protests and left dozens dead in police and CRPF firing, and he is seen as a villain here.         
	Sources said National Conferences Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Partys Sayeed appeared to be playing up the Sinha plank, possibly in the hope that this would get them more votes.        
	Pandey was a guest of Gen. Sinha in the state. Since he has been arrested on terror charges, there is need to probe the relation between the two, Sayeed said. Abdullah has asked Sinha to clear the fog on his relations with the seer.         
	Sinha said: I dont know him. I never met him.        
	Pandey, the self-pro claimed shankaracharya of the Sharda temple in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and head of the Sharda Sarvagyapeeth in Jammu, had played a key role in the Amarnath agitation.

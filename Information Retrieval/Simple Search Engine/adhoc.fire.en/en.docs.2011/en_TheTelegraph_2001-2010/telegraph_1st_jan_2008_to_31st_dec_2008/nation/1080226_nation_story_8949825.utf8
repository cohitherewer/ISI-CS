          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Manmohan Singh government doesnt appear keen to fire the nuclear deal to a new pitch as the crucial budget session of Parliament gets underway.         
	The unexpected extension to ambassador Ronen Sen  one of the architects of the 123 Agreement between New Delhi and Washington  had fuelled speculation in political circles that the government was preparing to give a final push to the deal, even at the risk of premature elections.        
	The move in Washington may be tied into the UPAs expectations on wrapping up the deal, but the government may not be seeking precipitous confrontation with the Left yet.        
	The UPA will have to take more than just the nuclear deal into account in settling for a showdown with the Left on the issue. We will have to take into account the overall political climate and the timing of elections because it is fairly certain the Left will not go with the government on the deal. That political accounting has not taken place yet, a Congress strategist said.         
	At the same time, the pro-deal lobby in the Manmohan Singh government is keen that efforts to seal the deal are not abandoned. This may explain why Sen has been persuaded to stay on as envoy in Washington.        
	President Pratibha Patils address to the joint session today made only a passing and low-key reference to the deal, expressing the hope that civil nuclear cooperation with the USA and other friendly countries will become possible.        
	The President didnt extol the deal, nor did she speak of any new determination in her government to see it through. The mention was, in fact, a single line embedded in para 59 of her speech which spoke of improving ties with major world powers, including Russia and the EU.        
	The governments stated position on the nuclear deal met with stated opposition from the Left. The government thinks the deal is good for the country, we think it is bad, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said today, adding that there was a written understanding that the government would get back to the UPA-Left committee after the IAEA talks.         
	Last week, an influential group of US senators visiting India had emphasised the need to close negotiations with the IAEA and the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, saying New Delhi would not get a similar deal if it passed up this opportunity. The group comprised Joseph Biden, John Kerry and Chuck Hagel.         
	In a meeting with Prime Minister Singh, the trio said India should try and approach the US Congress for a vote on the deal by June, failing which it would have to be renegotiated with a new administration which will take office next January.         
	CPM sources saw nothing new, or troubling, in President Patils reference to the deal, saying it was only an expression of hope. The government knows very well that we are not for the operationalisation of the nuclear deal and there will be no change in our position, the sources said.         
	The Congress made its own reiterations, without baiting the Left anew. We are for the deal, said AICC spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi.

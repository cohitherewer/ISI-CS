	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: Kalimati Road, one of the oldest roads in the steel city, would soon wear a new look. 
    
	As the road-widening project picks up in the city, Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (Jusco) has shifted focus to Kalimati Road. According to the plans mooted by the Tata Steel subsidy, the entire 1.5km stretch would now be turned into a four-lane thoroughfare. 
    
	Jusco has decided to carry out a road widening and city beautification project across the city in phases and the work is scheduled to be completed by 2009, said Rajesh Rajan, the chief of corporate communications, Jusco. 
    
	Work on the proposed four-lane thoroughfare has already begun. 
    
	While elaborating on the project, sources at Jusco, said: Kalimati Road has always remained one of the busiest roads in the city as it connects Sakchi to Bistupur, Golmuri, Nildih and Telco. A part of the road also leads up to the works where heavy vehicles ply very frequently. Therefore, traffic congestion is a major problem here. Thus, we decided to convert it into a four-lane road. 
    
	The road would however have a separate lane for cycles and two wheelers. Also, there would also be enough space for pedestrians. Our major concern is to ensure safety for citizens. Thus, wide footpaths will be constructed on both sides for the pedestrians, said an official. 
    
	This stretch will also have a central verge, which means that almost two feet high road dividers would be used to bifurcate the lanes. 
    
	The turning in front of the Sakchi Gurudwara would now be closed and a proper demarcation will be made from here till across the road. 
    
	The turning was a major bottle neck and also accident prone zone. Hence, we have decided to block the roadand planned on a new roundabout near Sagar Hotel, said an official. 
    
	Estimated to cost around Rs 50 lakh, the road would stretch from the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) island to the R.D. Tata Technical Institute roundabout and would be completed by April. 
    
	Recently, the company converted the stretch from B.H. Area in Kadma to TS Flats into a three-lane road. 
    
	We are now looking at other areas where similar projects could clear traffic bottle necks, said an official. 
    
	On the cards is a mini Transportnagar or parking space for trucks and heavy vehicles near the Tata Tubes Division gate, Burmamines.
    
	Tab on traffic
    
	The district administration is contemplating banning the entry of heavy vehicles and trailers in the steel city.
    
	For this, the administration has shot off letters to all the companies including Tata Steel, Tata Motors whose trailers operate inside the city. 
    
	We have given the companies a time frame of seven days in which they have to come up with their opinions. If they do not get back to us in that time, we would implement the ban, said Nitin Madan Kulkarni, deputy commissioner, East Singbhum.
    
	Officials pointed out that, these companies have been asked to construct an overbridge which would help in creating a separate route.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | September seal hope for deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     September seal hope for deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The 123 Agreement could be signed during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the US later this month if Congress passes it by then, ambassador David Mulford said here today.         
	The agreement will come up before the US Congress in a few days for its approval, Mulford said, at the same time ruling out a nuclear deal with Pakistan.        
	We are now in the final phase. The 123 Agreement is to be presented before the US Congress. That process is ongoing. We hope to do it in the next few days and then hope for action (by Congress), he said.         
	Mulford said the bipartisan support for the deal that was there in the US Congress last year still existed and hoped for an early approval.         
	White House spokesperson Dana Perino echoed him: I would say that signs for it to be able to pass are good, given the bipartisan support its enjoyed. So if they are able to get anything done, this could be one of them.        
	If Congress does not clear the agreement during the session ending on September 26, a lame-duck session is possible after the November presidential polls, Mulford said.         
	Asked about the requirement of a 30-day notice for introducing any document in the US Congress for approval, he said there is a precedent for this being waived.         
	The Bush administration yesterday began the process of consulting key legislative committees and staff to bring the US-India nuclear pact before Congress for a final vote.         
	As we speak, we have people working on that package that is required by the so-called Hyde amendment, the Hyde Amendment Package, state department spokesperson Sean McCormack said in Washington yesterday, adds PTI.         
	Senior Congress members, including the House foreign affairs committee chair Howard Berman and the Senate foreign relations committee chair Joseph Biden, have been contacted to push the deal, he said. Were going to do everything we can to hold up our end of the bargain.        
	Mulford said the NSG waiver was a clean document that had to be seen in consonance with the Hyde Act, the 123 Agreement, the separation plan and the India-IAEA safeguards agreement.         
	Securing the waiver required the biggest diplomatic effort he has ever seen, Mulford said. The US President, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and undersecretary of state William Burns were hugely active and made direct phone calls to leaders of NSG countries, he said. The waiver is very, very significant.        
	On the possibility of the US entering into a similar deal with Pakistan, Mulford said: I dont think there is one.         
	Nuke commerce        
	The nuclear energy business in India would be in the order of $100 billion (Rs 400,000 crore) in 10 years after the nuclear deal comes through, said US assistant commerce secretary David Bohigian, who is in India, adds PTI.              Picture by Rajesh Kumar       
	The CPMs Sitaram Yechury speaks to the media after the Left and a truncated UNPA met President Pratibha Patil on Tuesday, demanding immediate convening of Parliament.   
	They accused the UPA of abdicating its responsibility to Parliament, besides concealing information on the nuclear deal.   
	However, a fizz about a larger non-Congress, non-BJP coalition, built up during the July trust vote, was missing with parties like the RLD, AGP and the INLD not being represented in the memorandum submitted to Patil.   
	While the INLD has no member in Parliament, the AGP is going with the BJP in Assam. The RLD seems to be keeping options open.   
	There are various serious issues which are to be debated like the nuclear deal, runaway inflation, attack on Christians in Orissa and others. (But) the government has cancelled one session. Common man is waiting for the governments reply, Yechury said.

             project boost to the state 
                 
	Bhubaneswar, March 3: Orissa will get an additional share of 20 per cent power generated from Machhkund inter-state hydro power station, located at Jalaput in Koraput, bordering Andhra Pradesh. 
    
	This was agreed upon at a meeting held in Hyderabad today. Orissa energy minister Surya Narayan Patro and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Samir Ali Ahmed attended the meeting. 
    
	Till date, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa had been sharing power on a 70:30 ratio. There were disagreements between the two neighbouring states over payment matters. 
    
	We therefore decided to refer the matter to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. We will abide by the commissions verdict, said Patro while talking to The Telegraph over phone from Hyderabad. 
    
	The two states would have to share renovation, main tenance and capacity expansion costs of the 63-year-old project equally. 
    
	Orissa has also proposed for a 114MW capacity expansion of the Machhkund project, which has six units. Machhkund hydro power project had been jointly commissioned by Orissa and Andhra Pradesh way back in 1945 at a cost of Rs 18 crore. 
    
	Andhra Pradesh had borne an expenditure burden of Rs 12 crore, while Orissa had provided Rs 6 crore. The two states at that time had agreed to share the power generated from the hydro power station on 70:30 basis. 
    
	Subsequently in 1978, Orissa decided to purchase 20 per cent share of the station. 
    
	The decision was taken by the former chief minister, Nilamani Routray, and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chenna Reddy. 
    
	However, the decision was not implemented. 
    
	Again in 1992, chief ministers of the two states decided to go in for equal share yet again. That decision, too, was dropped, as a dispute over the selling price persisted. 
    
	While Andhra Pradesh demanded Rs 47 crore to sell its 20 per cent share, Orissa offered Rs 17 crore for it.

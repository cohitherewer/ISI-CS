The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Atal haunts BJP again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atal haunts BJP again
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, July 12: He may be ill and tired but not yet retired, at least in his partys mind. Atal Bihari Vajpayees long shadow returned to dog the BJP today when its central election committee met to pick Lok Sabha candidates for Uttar Pradesh.        
	The BJP has officially settled the leadership question in favour of L.K. Advani, but many leaders still wondered how Vajpayees absence might impact the partys poll prospects in the key state.        
	Some went to the length of asking if the former Prime Minister (in picture) was in a position to contest. The dominant view was that this was impossible.        
	Vajpayees health does not allow any political activity, and it would be strange if he is fielded from Lucknow just for effect. After all, he cannot contest as an ordinary candidate when Advani has been declared the partys shadow Prime Minister.        
	But just the fact that the party had not yet settled the matter, and even top leaders had to formally debate it at an election committee meeting, left many bewildered.        
	Some said the Lucknow candidate must be a high-profile leader and be presented as Vajpayees emissary. The party is keen to signal that Advani is leading this electoral battle with Vajpayees blessings.        
	Some leaders had hinted yesterday that the Uttar Pradesh list would be released today, but the BJP woke up to the risks of doing this just before the Lok Sabha trust vote. After all, those denied tickets might vote against the party. So the list was withheld today.        
	The meeting saw differences over about 18 seats. Preparing the list is proving difficult for Arun Jaitley because of the presence of veterans like Rajnath Singh, Kalyan Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi and many others in the state who continue to pull strings to keep their own fiefs intact.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, April 18: Rahul Gandhis two-day Bundelkhand visit has left a trail of red faces in the Madhya Pradesh Congress.        
	District Congress presidents of Tikamgarh, Chattarpur and Panna are running for cover as they have no explanation why they were kept out of the loop.        
	I am glad he came and spent time among tribals. But politically we have not gained because we were not told about his visit, Tikamgarh district Congress chief Ravindra Adharvyuv said.         
	The Congress general secretarys visit was spread across districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh because Bundelkhand straddles both states.        
	Adharvyuv, 54, said: My disappointment has little to do with my political aspirations. How do I mobilise votes for the party when we are not even informed about the high-profile visits? What do I tell my people?        
	He said he had reached the spot where Rahul was staying on Tuesday night but was asked to leave by Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi. This was in sharp contrast to Indira Gandhis visit in 1978-79 when the region suffered from acute drought. But the day Indiraji came, it rained. And the slogan Indiraji aaeen varsha laeen (Indira came, brought showers) was coined.        
	Jai Prakash Patel of Panna was more cautious, attributing the slight to security considerations. Rahulji is a VVIP. I have no complaints as he is trying to directly strike a rapport with the voters, he said.         
	But like Adharvyuv, Patel could barely hide his disappointment when asked about the political dividends from the visit. Of course, in an election year, things would have been a lot different if we were kept in the know, he said, pointing that the party had drawn a blank in the district in the 2003 Assembly elections.         
	Jagdish Shukla of Chattarpur had a question: Even if someone says Rahul Gandhi is on a familiarisation trip, can we deny that it was aimed at creating a favourable political climate for the party that he is leading and us?         
	Shuklas poser failed to get a response from senior party leaders, including state unit chief Suresh Pachauri, who were kept in the dark. Pachauri rushed to Bundelkhand after hearing that Rahul was touring the region.         
	Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal put up a feeble defence: Rahulji is consciously avoiding the party apparatus during his visits. He is getting valuable feedback and a feel of the real situation. Experience has shown that when partymen are informed, they vie for attention and complicate things, he said.         
	Rahul today concluded his three-day visit, during which the MP spent a night under the open sky on a charpoy in Panna and another at the home of a tribal in Tikamgarh where he had puri, vegetable and pickles for dinner.

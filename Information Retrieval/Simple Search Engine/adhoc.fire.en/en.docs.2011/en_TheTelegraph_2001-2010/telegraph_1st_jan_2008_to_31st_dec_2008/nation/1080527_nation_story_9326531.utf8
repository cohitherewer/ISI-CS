          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 26: The Centre is said to have again turned down Mayavatis request for Special Protection Group cover, provided only to serving and former Prime Ministers.        
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, who now enjoys Z-plus security, had claimed grave threat to her life while making the request a few months back. She had made a similar request earlier, too.        
	The refusal came a week after Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh was granted Z-category security. The decision was taken a day after he attended a dinner hosted by Manmohan Singh to celebrate four years of UPA rule.        
	Amar Singh told the Prime Minister he perceived a threat to his life from Mayavati and accused her of getting her rivals eliminated.

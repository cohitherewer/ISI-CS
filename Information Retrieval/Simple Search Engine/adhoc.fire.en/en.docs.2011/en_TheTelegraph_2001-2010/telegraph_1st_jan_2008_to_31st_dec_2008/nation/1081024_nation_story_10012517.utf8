The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India called to crisis high table
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     India called to crisis high table
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                           Singh arrives in Beijing on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	Beijing, Oct. 23: George W. Bushs call for a G-20 summit next month to discuss the deepening global financial crisis has lent a new sense of urgency to the Seventh Asia Europe Meeting summit (ASEM-7) which begins here tomorrow. It has also increased the significance of Indias debut at this particular forum that brings together two continents caught in the undertow of Americas man-made tsunami.         
	Arriving in the Chinese capital from Tokyo this evening, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed the hope that tomorrows meeting of minds between Europe and Asia will produce a solution to many global problems, including the international financial crisis.         
	While that might be a tall order, the forum is certain to facilitate brainstorming and help India present its case to the 45-nation grouping which includes a range of developed, developing and under-developed economies.         
	Official sources said India had not formally responded to Bushs invitation to the G-20 summit scheduled to be held on November 15. But the Prime Minister will be meeting a lot of key European and Asian leaders over the next two days and these meetings will help formulate Indias response, senior government officials said.         
	Apart from the multi-lateral meeting, Manmohan Singh will also hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani, and Chinese President Hu Jintao among others.         
	India is a late entrant to the ASEM, which was set up back in 1996 to serve as a framework for linking Europe with East Asia. Initially, its membership was confined to the 15 EU member states, the then seven-member Asean, China and Japan.         
	The forum has steadily expanded and the Sixth ASEM Summit two years ago decided to include six new members  India, Mongolia, Pakistan, and the Asean secretariat from Asia; and Bulgaria and Romania from Europe.         
	India s late entry  along with relatively marginal global players  may give the impression that ASEM is just another talking shop, adding to the lengthening list of acronyms that make up contemporary international diplomacy.         
	But the US-origin financial crisis, which is fast spreading to the real economy of western nations, has suddenly propelled India to the high table of crisis-management  a role, officials say, New Delhi is still wary of.         
	Even before the financial meltdown hit the headlines, Indias stature in international forums had been on the rise, officials point out. In fact, the ASEM Summit will be Indias first major international outing since it secured the NSG waiver and formally joined the nuclear club.         
	Indias nuclear status apart, its latest foray into space has also made the world sit up and take notice. The Chandrayaan launch, for instance, was the lead story in todays edition of Japan Times and figured on the front page of several international dailies.         
	But respect for Indias nuclear or space technology rests on the strength of its economy  and how far India is able to resist the financial crisis and its attendant economic recession.         
	Without sounding too complacent, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to repeat at Beijing tomorrow what he told Tokyo yesterday.         
	Pointing out that India had taken several measures in the last few weeks to ensure adequate liquidity and confidence in the financial system, Singh told a gathering of top Japanese businessmen: The short-term outlook is somewhat cloudy but I am confident that the Indian economy has the resilience to sustain its growth momentum in the medium run.         
	His words were echoed by Asian Development Bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda who, in an interview to Financial Times today, said Asia is still going to achieve relatively robust growth  around seven per cent across Asia, excluding Japan.         
	Asian leaders are likely to use the ASEM forum to co-ordinate their strategy in such a way that they are not needlessly dragged into a mess created by the richest nations of the world. At the same time, they  particularly India and China  know they must be part of the solution and the ASEM Summit could provide pointers on working out this difficult dialectic.

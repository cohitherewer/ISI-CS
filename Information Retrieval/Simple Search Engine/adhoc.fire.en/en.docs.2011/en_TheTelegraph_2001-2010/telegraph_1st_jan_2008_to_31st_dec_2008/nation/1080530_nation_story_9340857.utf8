	Rain check to fight flood fury    
	 A month ahead of the monsoons official mid-June arrival, Mumbais civic bodies are bracing for tidal flooding.     
	 Over 108 closed-circuit cameras at traffic junctions will double as private eyes to monitor water levels at flood-prone spots.    
	Civic officials held talks with mobile service providers to seek co-operation in spreading information on flooding through messages. Water warnings will be provided on FM radio and TV, too, besides railway stations.    
	A clean-up of sewers and the Mithi river, which often floods low-lying areas in the western suburbs, has started. The monsoon vigil has been stepped up since the cloudburst of July 2005 that led to the great deluge. The city had received a record 944mm of rain in 24 hours.     
	The swelling Mithi river had forced a shutdown of the airport for three days and killed more than 400 people. Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray had to be rescued in a boat and taken to nephew Raj Thackerays house, in downtown Dadar, after his Bandra bungalow was flooded.

	Patil fumbles, cop squirms    
	He might command the men who keep a hawks eye on our borders but his boss doesnt appear to have recognised him well enough to name him correctly in public.    
	BSF chief A.K. Mitra, in office long enough for people to know and spell him correctly, was left red-faced at a recent event when home minister Shivraj Patil repeatedly referred to him as A. K Mishra. On a more personal note, he even called him Mishraji. The ministers slip not only left the BSF director-general uneasy with embarrassment but also left the audience, several of them Mitras colleagues, squirming in their seats. In all, Patil made the gaffe four times in 20 minutes.    
	In the end though, as he was concluding his speech, a quiet word from his aides prompted the minister to set the record straight. Eventually, the BSF chief was on safe ground.

	Boom time for teachers    
	If you thought only IT professionals in Cyberabad were laughing all their way to the bank with their dizzy salaries, just take a look at teachers.    
	Science teachers in Andhra Pradesh are being offered salaries on a par with that of some IT professionals. The boom is the outcome of the growing demand for teachers in corporate and private junior colleges catering to the mushrooming technical colleges. Pay packets of Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 per month arent rare for them, depending on their teaching and technical skills. The gurukul schools are set up jointly by companies and the government in public-private partnerships. The pay packets for teachers in the brand new concept schools range from Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000.    
	The most sought-after appear to be those who can teach chemistry and mathematics, with some company-sponsored schools and colleges ready to shell out up to Rs 10 lakh annually to keep them.    
	The government, to keep pace with the competition, is now offering up to Rs 35,000 for these teachers.        
	Filth rap    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has had to watch Rs 25 lakh go down the drain  as penalty for waterlogging.    
	The Delhi consumer commission this week asked the civic body to cough up the amount as fine for the waterlogging of July 2006 that had led to unseen traffic chaos.    
	It was blamed for triggering the problem by failing to clean sewers and maintain other basic civic amenities. The civic bodys contention that its work didnt fall within the definition of services was rejected.

	Srinagar, April 2: An army officer has been arrested for his wife Captain Megha Razdans death, which had rattled the forces and prompted defence minister A.K. Antony to promise a thorough probe.        
	Razdan, of the 113 Engineers, was found hanging from the ceiling of her quarters at Kunjwani army camp near Jammu in July last year.        
	Last night, Jammu police arrested Captain Chaitanya Bhatwadekar, whom Razdan had married in September 2006, months after they met.         
	Captain Chaitanya had forced his wife to commit suicide and we have arrested him. Now we are looking for his police remand, Jammu police chief Parminder Singh said. He was subjected to narco-analysis, where he has confessed to abetting his wife to suicide.         
	Investigators had found that Chaitanya had an affair with a girl from Pune. The Pune girl is a childhood friend and a relative from his mothers side. He would call or SMS her 100 to 200 times in a day and when his wife protested, he damaged the SIM. But we have traced the call details that show he was in frequent touch with the girl, Jammu South SP Zahid Manhas said.         
	Chaitanya, also of the 113 Engineers, has been charged with abetment to suicide and cruelty and harassment.         
	The probe has found that he helped his wife hang herself. The lady threatened him that she would commit suicide that evening, and the husband said he would follow her. In fact, he helped her tie the knot, Manhas said. Chaitanya left the room and when he returned, he found her dead.         
	The army is holding a separate probe. Defence spokesman S.D. Goswami said: Our court of inquiry is also on and we are awaiting the report of the narco-analysis.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 14: The government today announced its intention to deliver a pentavalent  or five-in-one  vaccine free as part of an effort to re-engineer the universal immunisation programme.         
	Health officials said an expert panel had recommended the vaccine that protects children against diphtheria (D), pertusis (P), tetanus (T), Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) and hepatitis B. We want to re-engineer our universal immunisation programme, health secretary Naresh Dayal said.        
	The existing programme does not immunise against HiB and hepatitis.         
	The pentavalent vaccine, which would replace the DPT vaccine, will be administered at six, 10 and 14 weeks, with a booster dose after 18 months.        
	If all goes according to plan, we could start giving this vaccine by the end of 2008, said drug controller general Surinder Singh.

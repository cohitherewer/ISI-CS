The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kashmir start to old oil hunt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kashmir start to old oil hunt
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, May 6: Indias hunt for old oil and gas, an emerging alternative to the fast depleting young oil reserves, has begun from Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Old oil refers to petroleum from very old rocks, aged over a billion years, which till a few decades ago were not thought to contain oil. Most of the worlds known petroleum deposits are in newer rocks, and this oil is called young oil.        
	Now Jammu Universitys geology department has tied up with Italian oil and gas company Eni and the Maghreb Petroleum Research Group of the department of earth sciences, University College London, to search for old oil across the country.        
	We are beginning the hunt from Reasi district in Jammu and Kashmir. Our field research will start in July this year. Its an honour for the state that this project has gone to our university, said G.M. Bhat, the all-India project co-ordinator and a geology professor with Jammu University.        
	In the first phase, the survey will cover parts of Rajasthan along with Reasi. Rock samples will be collected from both places and sent to Indian and foreign laboratories, Bhat said. The project will be sponsored entirely by Eni.        
	South Asia is now waking up to the concept of old oil and ours is a beginning. Although old oil reserves have reportedly been found in Pakistan, it is doubtful whether it is really old oil or young oil, Bhat said.        
	Experts said young oil is found in shallow rocks around 65 million years old. Young oil is found at a depth of 1-3km  sometimes around 7km. But old oil is found around 10km below the earths surface, a Jammu University teacher said.        
	Scientists had realised that the deeper and older infra-Cambrian rocks, too, contained petroleum after giant oil deposits and gasfields were discovered in these rocks in places such as Siberia, North Africa and Oman.        
	Our rocks are similar in character to these hydrocarbon-yielding infra-Cambrian sequences, Bhat said.        
	Jammu University had been trying to woo leading global experts to the region and start explorations here. The current project follows an international workshop at the university last February, attended by 150 scientists from 16 countries, including the US, Australia, England, Germany, Iran, China, Nigeria, Canada, Libya and Pakistan.        
	The workshop on geology and hydrocarbon potential of the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian basins in India, Pakistan and the Middle East drew participants from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Columbia and Adelaide.        
	Jammu and Kashmir has to import oil, gas and power to meet its growing energy needs. Government sources here said that ONGC had started exploring for young oil reserves at Suransar and Mansar in Jammu but later abandoned the project.        
	They could not go deeper because they lacked the required technology. But Eni has the technology to drill deeper, Bhat said.        
	A possible discovery of old oil reserves will boost the energy sector in the state, which buys Rs 1,800 crore worth of power a year from NHPC Ltd.

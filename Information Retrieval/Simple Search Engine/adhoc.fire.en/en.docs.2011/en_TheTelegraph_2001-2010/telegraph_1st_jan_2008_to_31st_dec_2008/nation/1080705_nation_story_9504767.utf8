          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 4: Research firm Omtek has hit upon an energy-saving measure by planning to replace old, copper chokes being used for lighting for 75 years now and use electronic ballast in the state.        
	This way, the firm claims, up to 25 to 30 per cent of the present energy consumption may be saved.         
	The mega plan envisages the installation of electronic ballast with higher wattage for street, flood, stadium, petroleum industrial and commercial lighting and for use in the railway, airports and national highways, explained Subodha Chandra Rath, the managing director of Omtek.        
	Orissa produces 2,900MW electricity. Twenty-one per cent of the total power (609MW) is utilised for lightening. With proper management and audit and use of updated ballast, the state can save up to 25 per cent of the total power  around 152MW. Taking the cost of generation, transmission and distribution as Rs 12 crore for 1MW of power, an amount of Rs 1,824 crore can be saved by the replacement.        
	Orissa can save several crores by using the electronic ballast. Besides, the state improves its environmental performance, Rath added.         
	Omtek secured the patent for 14 energy saving, HID electronic ballast used for operating metal halide, sodium vapour and other gas discharge lamps up to 2,500 watts.         
	Energy saving and low voltage operation are the added advantage of the products, explained Rath.        
	The company has been manufacturing the products at Mancheswar Industrial Estate Bhubaneswar since 1996. The ballast is currently in demand and is preferred by public sector units and private enterprises alike. We also have orders to supply the products to Hungary, Turkey and Munich, he added.         
	Besides, reputed players from the electrical sector have also evinced interest for an OEM arrangement. The company has seven other patents in pipeline with 27 low-energy products such as air conditioners, domestic appliances, pumps and other inductive loads.

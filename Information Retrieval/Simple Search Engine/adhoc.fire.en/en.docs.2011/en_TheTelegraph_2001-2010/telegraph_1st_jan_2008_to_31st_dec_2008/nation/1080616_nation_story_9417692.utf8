	New Delhi, June 15: Once an accused dies, the case involving him should close unless it affects his property that has passed on to his legal heirs, the Supreme Court has clarified.        
	For instance, an appeal against a jail sentence should end (become infructuous) if the accused dies.        
	But if the case involves a possible fine, which is to be paid out of the property inherited by his heirs, they would be allowed to contest the case, a two-judge bench said quoting from earlier judgments.        
	The principle on which the hearing of a proceeding may be continued after the death of an accused... (is) the effect of the sentence on his property in the hands of his legal representatives, the court said.        
	If the sentence affects that property, (the) legal representatives can be said to be interested in the proceedings and allowed to continue it.        
	But the same logic would not apply to a case involving a government servant who was under suspension during the trial. Once he dies, the case should close, the court said.        
	The bench rejected the argument that if the conviction of such an accused were set aside, his heirs would be entitled to receive full pay for the period of suspension.        
	It said setting the conviction aside would not automatically entitle the legal representatives to the salary.        
	The ruling came as the apex court heard a plea by the widow of Shankar Prasad Ghosh of Bihar. The widow wanted to continue with an appeal against the conviction and sentencing of her husband, who died while the case was pending.        
	Ghosh had been convicted under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, along with sections 5(1) (d) and (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. He was jailed and fined.         
	He appealed against the CBI courts verdict before the high court, which upheld the conviction and the fine but altered the jail sentence, saying the period Ghosh had already spent in prison was enough.        
	Ghosh then challenged the upholding of the conviction and the fine in the Supreme Court. He died on May 15, 2000. Five years later, his widow filed the application to continue the case.        
	According to the apex court, since the case involved a fine it could continue. However, the judges rejected the plea on a different ground.        
	They said the plea was filed too late  the time prescribed for filing such appeals is only 30 days, as prescribed under Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

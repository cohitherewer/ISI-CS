	Bhubaneswar, July 22: Grandparents of Ninu Mishra have been running from pillar to post to get the six-year-old cured of an abnormally large abdomen.        
	The senior couple travelled all the way from Jalchatra in Nimapada area of Puri district with their grandchild to meet chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the grievance cell on Saturday.         
	Ninu was like other girls of her age till a year ago when her abdomen started swelling.         
	Her parents, daily wagers, could not afford to get her treated forgoing their work. Therefore, the aged grandparents took the responsibility of carrying her to Bhubaneswar. We dont have enough money for her treatment. So we contacted the chief minister to get some help, said Kunja Bihari Meher, the 80-year-old grandfather.        
	Meher and his wife Minati waited for eight hours for the meeting. Some officers came and jotted down something and asked us to leave, said Minati.        
	Carrying Ninu has not been an easy task for the old couple. The girl has gained over 40kg after her condition worsened.         
	Ninu was admitted to Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar today. A battery of tests was conducted.         
	Initial reports have shown a huge mass inside her abdomen. We have asked for the radiology and ultrasound tests. We can diagnose only after the reports come in, said Nirmala Dei, the head of paediatric department of the hospital.

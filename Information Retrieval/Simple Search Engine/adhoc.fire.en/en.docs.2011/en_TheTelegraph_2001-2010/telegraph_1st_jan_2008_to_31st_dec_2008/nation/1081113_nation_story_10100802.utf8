          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 12: Orissa High Court closed hearing today to determine whether the Lokpal Act  that makes a Lokpal ineligible for further appointment after retirement  covers engagement as head of a commission of inquiry for a judicial probe.         
	The dispute is the first involving appointment of a former Lokpal to be heard by the court as well as its first review of Section 5 (3) of the Lokpal Act.         
	The case arose when Jyotsna Rani Patra, the secretary of Utkal Christian Council, filed a petition challenging the appointment of Justice S.C. Mohapatra as head of the one-man commission to conduct a judicial probe into the killing of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four others on August 23 and the incidents violence in the aftermath.         
	Patra sought quashing of the appointment of Justice Mohapatra, a retired high court judge, on the ground that he was a former Lokpal.         
	The division bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice B.N. Mohapatra heard the arguments of the UCC counsel and the advocate-general, but refused to grant stay on the proceedings of the Justice Mohapatra Commission.         
	The court, however, directed both parties to submit written arguments by Friday and fixed November 17 for delivering the judgment.

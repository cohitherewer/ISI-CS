The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Parent call drives schoolgirl to suicide
                                                                                                               Parent call drives schoolgirl to suicide
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 4: A sixteen-year-old schoolgirl who had been fretting about her poor results shot herself with her fathers licensed revolver this morning after being told to bring her parents for a guardian-teacher talk.        
	Police said Tanvi, a Class XI student of DAV Model School in north-west Delhi, put a bullet through her head at her home while her parents waited for her to get ready.        
	Close friends of the family claimed Tanvi had been upset with her results for the past few days and had talked about ending her life. But her family never took her seriously.        
	Neighbour Prashant Lamba said Tanvi told her father, a rich farmer in Haryana, that she would be ready in a few minutes. The next thing they heard was a loud bang. They thought something fallen in the kitchen. It was only after they went to Tanvis room that they realised she had shot herself.        
	Another neighbour, Gaurav Lamba, said Tanvi, who hadnt done well in two papers, may have taken the pistol at night and slept with it next to her. She was supposed to get the results on Friday, but the class teacher had asked her to come today with her parents.        
	The results were to be declared on Friday but the students already knew how they had fared. Tanvi, her neighbours said, found it easier to put a pistol to her head than let her teachers tell her parents that she hadnt done well.         
	She was always an average student, Prashant said. There was no pressure from her parents either to do well. Perhaps, it was the thought of being singled out by her teachers that prompted her to take such a drastic step.        
	Ironically, school authorities called to ask why Tanvi had not turned up, only to be told that she had shot herself.         
	The school  which has posters of students selected to join Americas space agency Nasa  claims it is one of the top ten in the city.        
	In the afternoon, Tanvis body was brought back home in a police van.        
	The family will never recover from this, Prashant said as the silent house suddenly filled with uncontrollable sobs. She was so full of life. If you were depressed, all you needed to do was go sit with her.        
	Exam stress has claimed at least three students in the capital since last month, a PTI report said.

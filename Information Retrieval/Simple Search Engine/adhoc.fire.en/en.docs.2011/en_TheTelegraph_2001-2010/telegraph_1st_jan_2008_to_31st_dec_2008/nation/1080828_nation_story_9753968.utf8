          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 27: A Surat boy who saw his house being torched during the riots that followed the Babri mosques demolition masterminded the planting of bombs in the diamond hub that were as lethal as the ones used in the Ahmedabad blasts, police said today.         
	Police sources said Tanvir Pathan, a 23-year-old Industrial Training Institute graduate who worked as a mechanic, chose the sites where the explosive devices were placed.        
	He was helped by Zahir Patel, 30, who earned a living selling clothes on Surats sidewalks, the sources added. Both have been arrested.        
	Pathan was arrested from Mumbai, where he had fled after giving Ahmedabad police the slip. Patel was caught from Surat.        
	As many as 29 live bombs were recovered from Surat in the aftermath of the July 26 blasts in Ahmedabad that killed 57. None of the Surat bombs, however, went off, sparking a flurry of theories ranging from the devices being red herrings to being a warning by terrorists on what they were capable of.         
	The bombs were mainly planted in Varachha, the nerve-centre of the diamond trade, spreading panic and triggering a shutdown of business for several days.        
	Gujarat director-general of police P.C. Pande today disclosed that the bombs planted in Surat were as potent as those that exploded in Ahmedabad.         
	J.M. Vyas, director of the Forensic Science Laboratory in Gandhinagar, was present at the news conference to offer a scientific explanation to why none of the bombs went off in Surat.         
	What saved Surats residents were the faulty integrated chips in the devices that lacked current for explosion. The bombs planted in Ahmedabad had timer devices.        
	Announcing the breakthrough, Pande said Sajid Mansuri, one of the alleged key conspirators behind the Ahmedabad explosions and former zonal chief of student outfit Simi, had disclosed the name of Tanvir during interrogation.         
	Tanvir, who has no criminal record and is not known to be an active Simi member, was close to Mansuri, also a resident of Surat. Sources said as a child of eight years, Tanvir had seen his house being torched during the 1992 riots that followed the Babri Masjids demolition.         
	The police claimed Tanvir oversaw the planting of bombs in Surat for which he employed four youths from the city and two from outside.         
	Surat police commissioner R.M.S. Brar said 10 bombs were planted on the night of July 24 and 25 and the rest early on July 26.

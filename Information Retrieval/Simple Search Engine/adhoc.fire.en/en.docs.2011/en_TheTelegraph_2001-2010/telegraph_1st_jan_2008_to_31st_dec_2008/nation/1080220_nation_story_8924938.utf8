          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: A man being questioned by immigration officials for carrying a suspicious passport has fled from an airport detention centre.        
	The man, who had a passport in the name of Watangi Shafi Ahmed Gafar, arrived from Doha by Qatar Airways Flight QR 200 on Sunday morning.         
	Immigration authorities smelt a rat when they saw that the date of birth mentioned in his passport was 01-06-1970, though he looked older, and also found some visa entries to Pakistan. The passport was issued in Bangalore, and the place of birth on the document showed Belgaum.        
	The bald and stout man looked around 50 years of age, though his passport put it at 38. His photograph in the passport did not match his face.        
	Suspecting that the man was travelling on a fake passport, the immigration authorities handed him over to Qatar Airways officials, who detained him in their first floor office in the departure section.        
	Officials said according to civil aviation rules, the man had not entered Indian soil, so the airline concerned had to send him back to the place of origin. But before he could be put on a flight to Doha, the man escaped from the airline office yesterday.        
	The Qatar Airways office at the international airport refused comment.         
	This evening, the Sahar police station lodged a complaint against the man for forgery, cheating, escape from lawful custody, criminal conspiracy and under the foreigners and passport acts.         
	A crime branch official dismissed any suggestion of a possible terror link. We suspect he was a labourer who was frightened and ran away.        
	Anti-terrorist squad chief Hemant Karkare said his department would look into the matter. The ATS is currently interrogating alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba operative Faheem Ansari arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police. Ansari had revealed that he had done a recce of the Bombay Stock Exchange around three months ago. The anti-terror unit is investigating if Ansari was in touch with possible sleeper cells in Mumbai.

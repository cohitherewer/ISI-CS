                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Curry king Noon relives terror night
          AMIT ROY                                     
	London, Nov. 27: Gulam Noon, the well-known tycoon from London, today described his night of terror, trapped inside room 361, the elegant Elephanta suite, in the old wing of the Taj Mahal Hotel, along with two western businessmen.         
	The maximum casualties were in the Taj because the firing began in the lobby, said Noon, who is on a weeklong trip to Mumbai, his native city where he had taken Bob Carnell, a Briton, and Peter Dilance, an American, two senior directors of Kerry Foods, to acquaint them with investment opportunities in India.         
	Asked whether the outrage would have an impact on foreign investment, Noon, now 72 but who grew up in Mumbai before emigrating to Britain in his twenties, responded angrily: The bastards have spoiled my beautiful city.         
	Although the identities of all the dead and injured have yet to be confirmed, Noon, a regular guest at the Taj on his frequent business trips to Mumbai, told The Telegraph: I believe 70 people were killed or injured inside the Taj. The dead include four chefs and some other Taj staff. From my room I could see the dead or injured being taken out.         
	Noon, who is known as Britains curry king after he introduced chilled Indian meals via Sainsburys and other supermarkets, said: Normally, I would dine in one of the Taj restaurants but on this one night, I decided to eat home food brought into my room by my family.         
	Also trapped in the room were his brother, Abbas, and two other relatives. Shortly before 10pm, when gunmen broke into the Taj, they took most of the hostages from the restaurants. Normally, I would have been there. We jammed our room though through the peep hole we could see one of the terrorists racing along the corridor with a gun.         
	Guests were warned to remain in their rooms. Right through the operators functioned through the night. Facing the Taj from the front, I was on the extreme right by the Gateway of India. We panicked when the fire broke out on the sixth floor. Although the fire was on the extreme left of the building, smoke began to seep into our room which we jammed with wet towels.         
	Noon described his nightmare of leaving the room by unconventional means: We were not rescued until 6am when firemen and commandos broke our window and took us down on their ladders. The worst thing is I suffer from vertigo.         
	He and his colleagues have since relocated to the President Hotel. But our passports and belongings are still at the Taj.         
	Next month Noon is bringing out his autobiography, Noon, With A View (Whittles Publishing; 16.99), in which the Indian-born tycoon charts his rise as a Bombay boy from a modest background to a multi-millionaire, hobnobbing with Prime Ministers and senior politicians, going to Buckingham Palace to collect his knighthood and standing on the edge of a peerage when his world comes crumbling down.         
	In his book, Noon gives his version of what happened in the cash for honours scandal and his dealings with Lord Levy, Tony Blairs principal fundraiser.         
	Noon has devoted an entire chapter, Cash for Honours  The Full Story, to the subject, according to advance publicity material for the book.         
	He spoke today of last nights room with a view: I am going to speak to my publisher to see if I can add a last chapter about what happened at the Taj.

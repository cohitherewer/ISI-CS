          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 7: The Bengali population in Bihar took out a rally today seeking citizenship rights denied to a population of 17 lakh by the Centre and the state governments.         
	The rally was taken out by a city group, Bharatiya Banglabhashi Mahasabha, which also held a two-day convention that concluded in Patna today.         
	The groups president, Captain Dilip Kumar Sinha, said the national-level convention aimed at drawing the Centre and state governments attention towards Bengali-speaking people, some of them resettled refugees.        
	The refugees, the protesters alleged, are yet to receive their citizenship and caste certificates and be granted the full possession of the lands granted to them during rehabilitation. Delegates from 19 states, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh took part in the convention to air their grievances.         
	Over 15,000 Bengalis today carried a march from Gandhi Maidan to Bailey Road.         
	An open session with guests was also held at SK Memorial hall here.        
	Prominent people who attended were Congress MP from Andaman and Nicobar Islands Manoranjan Bhakt and Uttar Pradesh MLA S.D. Roy Choudhary. Bihars urban development minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey, who participated on the opening day, assured the group to give houses to Bengalis at Bhagalpur and name a road between Kotwali Chowk to Dak Bangla Sqaure in Patna after Rabindranath Tagore.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, the groups media secretary, Debashish Bose, said: At least 3,000 Bengali families in Bihar are unable to avail government benefits because of not being a citizen. The state government must pursue the matter with the Centre.         
	He said the Bengalis at Bhagalpur, Purnea, Araria, Kisanganj, Katihar, Motihari and Chapra play a deciding role in electing MPs and MLAs, but remain outsiders without ownership of land and not being able to get enrolled in the BPL list.        
	He added that the Bihar government must lay provision of appointing Bengali teachers in schools with sizeable Bengali-speaking students.

	Baripada, Oct. 26 (UNI): When the country gears up to welcome the festival of lights, the Kudumi community in Orissa celebrates the three-day festival by worshipping cattle.        
	The extravaganza reflects the communitys respect and gratitude for their cattle by honouring them. Lakhs of Kudumi mohantas, mainly inhabiting Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Jajpur districts, celebrate this agriculture-centred festival with great pomp and revelry.        
	During the festival, better known as Bandhna, the community offers prayers to the cattle. The festival has many similarities with the Santhals Sohrai festival. It begins with a purification ceremony when people take part in ceremonial ablution. On the concluding day, villagers assemble at the grazing ground, where the cattle are flocked together. The villagers move around the flocks of cattle and sing and dance, to which are added the catchy tunes produced by the ringing of the ghungroos tied to the necks and legs of the cattle.

          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          Vohra: action at last                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The security freeze imposed on the Valley late last night was long coming, and means a repudiation of the detached bystander stance favoured so far by governor N.N. Vohra and his Track-II advisers.         
	The immediate human cost of the clampdown, as todays toll of deaths and injuries suggests, may be high. But it was increasingly evident that stern action was the only way to contain the drift towards secessionist anarchy and restore order and the primacy of the state.         
	There is a problem in Kashmir that needs to be sorted out, a senior Kashmiri bureaucrat said over telephone from Srinagar. But they will have to be negotiated politically. For that to happen, the chaos of the Kashmiri street first needs to be taken in hand.        
	He conceded that containment of the azaadi upsurge will take time and tough, unpopular measures but argued that the administration had no option left.         
	Our hope, quite mistakenly, was that the separatists would exhaust themselves and the agitation would collapse without a shot being fired. There was no sign of it. On the contrary, the separatist rallies were growing in numbers and shrillness, he said. No state can allow such protests against it beyond a point. A crackdown had to come, perhaps it has come late, perhaps it will cost Kashmir more.        
	It isnt clear at what point the administration made the crossover from its soft, hands-off approach to a hard, hands-on one. Some are suggesting that national security adviser M.K. Narayanans one-day reconnaissance trip to Srinagar last week may have had to do with the change in tack.        
	Huge sections of the civilian and security set-up in the Valley have been opposed to allowing free run to well-known separatist elements but they were quiet because governor Vohra had a radically different approach. With Narayanan here, some of those pent up opinions may have been voiced, a top police official said.        
	The security forces, an integral part of day-to-day state mechanics in the Valley, had two critical problems with Vohras soft line. One, that the morale of the jawans in the trenches was getting a daily knock, and two, that the secessionists, some of them openly pro-Pakistan, were surging unhindered.         
	Over the last ten days, the azaadi demonstrations mushroomed across the Valley as if on booster doses of tonic.         
	The security forces were on strict standby orders, there were no restrictions on movement or assembly, no curfews.         
	The separatists were quick to take their cues and mounted one show of strength after another  the last one, an enormous pro-independence display that swept through Srinagar like a squall and ended with rousing resolutions for more protests at the Idgah grounds in downtown.         
	Vohra, formerly a central interlocutor on Kashmir, is known to have impressed upon sections in his administration that were getting anxious that he was confident his strategy would succeed.         
	He wanted to avoid confrontation and bloodshed while he worked on old friends Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik  both moderate Hurriyat protagonists who have now been put under arrest along with hardliner S.A.S. Geelani  to slowly rein in the secessionist uprising.         
	But events of the past week offered little evidence of the Vohra plan getting anywhere. It could well be true that the governor has had private communication channels open with his friends in the Hurriyat all this while. But it was becoming more and more evident that the moderate Hurriyat leaders could not control the azaadi tide even if they wanted to.         
	The moderate Hurriyat leaders were, in fact, admitting privately that they were being pushed to take extreme positions by the raging street mood. Sometimes I feel we are not in control of this, we are not leaders of this crowd, we are being led by it, one of them had said.         
	He referred, as an illustration, to the invasion of the Mirwaizs Nigeen mansion by a mob on the day of slain Hurriyat leader Sheikh Abdul Azizs funeral. Perhaps the Mirwaiz had been advised not to go out in view of the bleak security situation, but the crowd just would not listen, it snatched him out of his house and made him lead the procession.        
	Last weeks rallies  to the UN offices on Monday and the Idgah on Friday  were also proof that stridently secessionist and pro-Pakistan elements led by Geelani were taking over the movement; the Mirwaiz and Malik stood clear of the Pakistan demand at both occasions. But their voices were drowned in the vociferous cries of the fringe that did not merely stop at Pakistan  Aayi, aayi, aazaadi, Hizbul waali aazaadi, Lashkar waali aazaadi (Behold Independence! Indpendence of the Hizbul and Lashkar kind!) was among the slogans openly raised at both demonstrations.         
	A senior army officer in Srinagar had spoken strongly of his anger and frustration at allowance given to such voices last week.         
	To permit democratic protest is one thing, he had told The Telegraph, But to allow secession and open promotion of terrorist groups and of a country with whom our troops are daily engaged in skirmishes along the borders is something beyond understanding. Why do we have a government and security forces in Kashmir at all then? Where has the Indian state been these past days and what is it doing?         
	Today may have provided him a few answers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Outsider in MP ranks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Outsider in MP ranks
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Dec. 29: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has given one of his Uttar Pradesh MLAs an unusual assignment: head the party in Madhya Pradesh.        
	The appointment of Deep Narain Yadav, the legislator from the Gharota seat in Uttar Pradeshs Jhansi, has triggered resignations by almost the entire Samajwadi Party unit in Madhya Pradesh.        
	But Deep Narain has defended Mulayams decision and denied he is an outsider. Im not an outsider, my wife is a legislator from Niwari in Madhya Pradesh. I and my family reside there, he said, while acknowledging there were several able leaders in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Narain Tripathi, the outgoing chief who lost the recent Assembly polls, did not speak against the move publicly. I will continue to work as a soldier of the party.         
	An insider, however, said the choice was triggered by realpolitik: Deep Narain has a running feud with Chanderpal Yadav, the party MP from Jhansi, which borders Madhya Pradesh.         
	By easing Deep Narain out of Jhansi, Mulayam has obliged Chanderpal, he said. He added, though, that Deep Narain, a former head of party wing Lohiya Vahini, was well-versed with Madhya Pradesh politics.        
	The appointment of a perceived outsider coincides with a decline in the partys fortunes in Madhya Pradesh, where its tally of MLAs has fallen to one from eight in 2003. Its vote share slipped to 1.74 per cent from 3.74 per cent.        
	The lone winner this time was Deep Narains wife Neera, whose election was supervised by her husband.        
	Samajwadi Party leaders said Mulayam, upset by the partys performance, decided to appoint Deep Narain to send out a strong signal to his cadres in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Deep Narain said the Samajwadis did not do well because they could not spread the partys message.        
	 We had an agenda of fighting for the justice of the deprived and backward classes but we were not able to reach out to the people.        
	Sensing Mulayams unhappiness, most office-bearers of the Madhya Pradesh unit, including vice-presidents Damodar Yadav and Amit Verma, and general secretary Dinesh Yadav, have put in their papers.

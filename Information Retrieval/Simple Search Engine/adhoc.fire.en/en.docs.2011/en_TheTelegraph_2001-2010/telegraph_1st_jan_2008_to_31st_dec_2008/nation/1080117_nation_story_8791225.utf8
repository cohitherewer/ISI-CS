	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: The authorities of the Bhuvaneshwari Temple Devasthan have decided to start a Vedic learning project by laun- ching informal classes in Jamshedpur. 
    
	Experts from the Northeastern states would come down to the steel city to disseminate knowledge on Vedic learning and its application in the contemporary world for people attending these classes. 
    
	We would get experts from a host of cities who would take turns to impart lessons in the Vedas to interested candidates. Initially, we would begin classes only on a rather informal basis. Gradually, however, our efforts would be to get youngsters interested in the subject and join, said Govind Rajan, the chief priest and head of religious affairs at Sree Bhuvaneshwari Temple Devasthan. 
    
	In the beginning, the Vedic learning centre would take into consideration the application of the ancient manuscript in the backdrop of the contemporary world. 
    
	The informal classes would be held inside the temple premises in the form of lectures and seminars with Vedas being the subject matter of discussion. Though, the temple authorities are yet to earmark a specific plot of land on the campus, there are talks of finalising the corridor to the open courtyard housed inside the temple premises in Telco for the lectures and seminars.A major problem is to bring experts of the language and convince them to stay back in the city to disseminate knowledge. But we can always make a modest beginning with informal classes in our temple premises, said Rajan. 
    
	Authorities said the classes would be held for a short period and the response would determine the feasibility of the project in the city. 
    
	The authorities are hopeful of starting with the classes in a months time.

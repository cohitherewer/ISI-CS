          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           People light candles in front of the Taj Mahal hotel on Monday in memory of those who died in the attacks in Mumbai . (AP)                                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The terrorists who attacked Mumbai had cruised to the city through an unguarded sea lane as the protectors looked the other way, government officials have said.        
	The navy, the BSF and the coast guard were holding a joint exercise in the Arabian Sea, around the Kori Creek and Sir Creek that face towards the northwest of the Gujarat coast, while the terrorists sailed through the southeast.        
	This has been a perennial problem with Indias sea forces  they have seldom shifted their gaze from one part of the sea around Gujarat. Coastal security concentrates on Sir Creek, through which the international border passes, while a parallel  and vital  sea lane is not secure.        
	We have always looked northwest for danger, but the southeast of the sea is left completely unguarded, a senior government official told The Telegraph.        
	The home ministry said it had on November 18  the day the terrorists left Karachi port  sent a specific advisory to the coast guard to keep watch on all sea routes. Yet, there were no efforts to shield the lane the terrorists took.        
	It took three days of mayhem and 173 deaths in Mumbai to jolt the government awake. Shivraj Patil, who stepped down as home minister yesterday, met the navy chief, the army vice-chief, the Intelligence Bureau director, the home secretary and the coast guard director-general on Saturday. It was decided that a joint mechanism would be set up for better co-ordination between the forces and to monitor all sea lanes.        
	After a detailed briefing from seniors in Karachi, an advance party of some 16 terrorists, loaded with ammunition and explosives, is believed to have reached Mumbais Sassoon Dock undetected on November 19, intelligence sources said.        
	They are believed to have cruised along a 220km free commercial zone, which usually has a skeletal presence of forces, the sources added.        
	They did not use the Sir Creek area, special secretary (internal security) M.L. Kumawat said.         
	The seizure of two vessels  the M.V. Alfa and fishing trawler Kuber  on Friday is attributed to the presence of vessels for the November 24-28 joint exercise and not to regular patrolling.         
	A fishing trawler from Karachi can reach Mumbai in 12 hours if it sails non-stop.         
	Kumawat conceded that Pakistani fishermen did make forays into the Gujarat coast and protests had been lodged with the Pakistan Rangers. However, little has been done on the ground to beef up security.         
	There are at least a dozen unsecured, and vulnerable, ports along the Saurashtra coast between Jamnagar and Kandla that can be used by infiltrators to land on Indian territory. Porbandar and Diu are also ports where, unlike in Sir Creek or the Sunderbans, water levels do not disrupt landings.         
	The BSF has proposed securing the Sunderbans, which is protected by a Bengal police contingent attached to the coast guard.

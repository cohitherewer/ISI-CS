	 New Delhi (PTI): The Central Bureau of Investigation is creating a national data bank to trace the source of fake currency and its areas of circulation. The move came after a recent seizure of Rs 8 crore in fake notes.                  
	 Bahraich, UP (PTI): The only witness in the Madhumita Shukla murder case was shot at and beaten up in his village in Kaiserganj on Monday, police said.

	 Alappuzha (PTI): Water tourism in the Alappuzha-Kuttanad belt has come to a virtual halt because of an indefinite strike by houseboat workers for higher wages.

	New Delhi, Oct. 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court today upheld the power of St Stephens College to appoint its principal, saying minority educational institutions had the right to choose their heads.         
	Its a valuable right guaranteed under Article 30, otherwise you are encroaching upon it, a two-judge bench of Justices R.V. Raveendran and J.M. Panchal observed.        
	The bench dismissed Delhi Universitys appeal against a Delhi High Court order granting the college absolute right to appoint its principal.        
	The apex court said the right of a minority institution to appoint heads could not be taken away by any rule, regulation or state enactment even if it received 100 per cent aid.

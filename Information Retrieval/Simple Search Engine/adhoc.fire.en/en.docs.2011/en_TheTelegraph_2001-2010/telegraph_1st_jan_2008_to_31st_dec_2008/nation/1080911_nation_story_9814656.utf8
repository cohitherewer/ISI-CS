          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 10: In an unprecedented order, Orissa High Court has asked the state board of secondary education to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 for the goof-up that led to the release of a marksheet with 43 marks less than what a student had actually secured.        
	The court imposed the penalty on the board yesterday while disposing of a petition filed by Rabindranath Panda whose son had passed the High School Certificate-2008 examination in first division. Panda had sought judicial intervention after his efforts to get his sons answer script rechecked ended in a naught.        
	When HSC-2008 examination results were declared, Pandas son Akhaya of Ananta Gadibrahma High School at Badagaon of Balikuda block in Jagatsinghpur district had received a marksheet with just 30 marks in the English paper and an aggregate of 550 marks.        
	While hearing the petition, the two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and M.M. Das had ordered for submission of the script in the court. During scrutiny, the court found to its satisfaction that Akhaya had actually secured 73 in the English paper, but only 30 marks had been reflected in the marksheet released by the board.        
	The court has further issued direction to the board to release within a week a corrected marksheet reflecting 73 marks in English, said petitioners counsel Rabindranath Prusty.        
	Earlier, the board had issued a revised merit list of 100 candidates for the HSC-2008 after checking answer scripts and re-adding marks of applicants. Ironically, the revised matriculation merit list had eight new names among the top 10 ranks  pushing seven students out of the list.        
	When the HSC-2008 results were declared on June 25, the results of 9,262 students was withheld as their marks in different subjects were missing at the time of final tabulation.

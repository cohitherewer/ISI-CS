          RASHEED KIDWAI                          A protester blames Asaram for the deaths of two students of his ashram school in Ahmedabad. File picture                                  
	Chhindwara, Aug. 3: A Class IX student has been arrested over the murders of two children at Asaram Bapus ashram here, but police could not come up with a credible motive.         
	Jabalpur zone inspector-general M.R. Krishna said the accused was mentally disturbed and was keen to leave the ashram hostel and school, where he and the dead boys studied.         
	The police said the teenager, who belonged to rural Chhindwara, had committed the crime to achieve his goal of having the school shut down.         
	According to them, the boy had carried out the crime so that he could exploit the furore over the deaths of two students near Asarams Ahmedabad ashram last month. Asaram is the spiritual guru of Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani.        
	Many residents found the theory bizarre, wondering how the boy could have known about the Ahmedabad deaths when the hostel didnt even have a TV.         
	It was not uncommon for a homesick teenager to want his school closed but that did not mean he could carry out serial murders to achieve the objective, they said.        
	Senior officials suggested the accused was often taunted and laughed at because of his built and mature look, but couldnt establish if the two nursery students found dead had ever mocked him.        
	Raj Kumar Dikshit, the arrested boys father, cried frame-up, saying his son had been held to protect some high and mighty. Dikshit, from Chhindwaras Loharbatri village, arrived here yesterday. Chhindwara, in Madhya Pradesh, is 130km from Nagpur.        
	In Ahmedabad, the family of the boys found dead  the two, aged 10 and 11, were cousins  and others in the neighbourhood had blamed Asaram and taken out protests against him. So far, the families of the children killed in Chhindwara have not blamed the ashram.         
	Officers sought to refute Dikshits allegations by saying tooth marks had been found on the shoulder of the accused, implying a struggle before the children were killed. The accused will be produced in a juvenile court tomorrow.        
	Ram Krishna, 4, was found dead in the ashrams bathroom on July 29 while Vedant, 5, was found dead with his head submerged in a bucket of water on July 31.        
	Chhindwara DIG K.T. Vaife said the blood and hair samples of victims and the accused had been sent for forensic tests. The Class IX student was arrested after leads from a teacher, a maid and three students picked up on Friday.         
	The controversy has sparked an exodus from the hostel. The school has declared a weeks closure as the police question more inmates and authorities.

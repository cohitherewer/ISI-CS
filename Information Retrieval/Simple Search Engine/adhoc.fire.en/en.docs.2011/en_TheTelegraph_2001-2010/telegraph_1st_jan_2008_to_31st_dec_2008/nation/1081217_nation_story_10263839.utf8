	New Delhi, Dec. 16: If governments were decided by a game of cricket, the BJP would never be out of power. Thats what Lal Krishna Advani believes. Unless, of course, his party is out hit-wicket.        
	A day after India chased down a formidable fourth-innings target, shadow Prime Minister Advani used cricket jargon as his party worked on a strategy to confront the government on the cash-for-vote scandal and the inadequate response to terror.        
	Although it has decided to support the governments initiative of setting up a national investigation agency, sources said the party would highlight deficiencies in the legal framework that could render the new agency toothless.        
	The BJP feels the parliamentary committee, which cleared the Congresss Ahmed Patel and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in the trust vote bribery scandal, had done a brazen cover-up job.        
	Party general secretary Arun Jaitley today said it was obvious that guilt or innocence had not been determined on material evidence but on the basis of parliamentary majority.        
	The certification of innocence has been given by the UPA, not by Parliament, he said, arguing that the government had paid back the debt it owed to the Samajwadi Party for helping it survive the July confidence vote.        
	I am sure this mistake will be corrected at the appropriate time on this forum or any other forum, he added, hinting at the possibility of a legal battle.        
	Another reason for the BJPs anger is the parliamentary panels recommendation of a probe into the alleged role L.K. Advanis aide Sudheendra Kulkarni played in the scandal. The committee said Kulkarni facilitated the giving of bribes by masterminding the purported expos.        
	Today, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee forwarded the cases of two main suspects  Sanjeev Saxena and Suhail Hindustan  along with that of Kulkarni to the home ministry.        
	While BJP leaders geared up to take on the Congress, Advani urged his party not to get demoralised by the defeats in Rajasthan and Delhi. The former BJP chief, who gave the go-ahead for the fight against the government, said the Congress had not won the two states on their own strength but benefited from the BJPs mistakes.        
	No bowler in the Congress is capable of bowling out the BJP. The possibility is only of a hit-wicket like it happened in some states in the Assembly polls, Advani told a parliamentary party meeting this morning.        
	He said the BJPs failure in Delhi was primarily because of selection of wrong candidates while internal contradictions scuppered its chances in Rajasthan.        
	The cash-for-vote scandal, he suggested, could be presented before voters to remind them of the Bofors scam. Advani added that terrorism was one of the core issues his party would raise in the run-up to the general election.        
	Sources said the party would study the bills that were introduced in Parliament today as measures to combat terrorism.

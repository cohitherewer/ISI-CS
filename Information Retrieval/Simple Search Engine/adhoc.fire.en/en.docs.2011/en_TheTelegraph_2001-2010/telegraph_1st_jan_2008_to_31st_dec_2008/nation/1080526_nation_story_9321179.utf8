The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varsity for cops, eye on terror
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Varsity for cops, eye on terror
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, May 25: Decks have been cleared for setting up a National Police University as cops across the country grapple with several unsolved cases of terrorist attacks.         
	On May 2, the Union cabinet gave an in-principle approval for the varsity.         
	Within a fortnight, the home ministry was on the job, giving final shape to the concept, perhaps worried by the many terror attacks  the last one on May 13 in Jaipur.         
	An expert committee of the home ministry has readied a blueprint for the universitys architecture and a draft legislation as well as a detailed project report are being prepared.         
	The university is likely to be in Haryana.         
	The degree courses will be for policemen who take time off from their jobs to train here. The diploma course will be for those not in uniform.        
	We have three areas of focus: research, postgraduate courses and graduate courses, said a home ministry source. Diplomas will be granted to those without uniform, expected to come mostly from private security agencies that are starved of qualified personnel.         
	The ministry will get a consultant to give shape to the universitys curriculum. A search for a vice-chancellor will begin soon, the sources said.         
	 Maybe five or seven years hence, state and central forces will ask their men to undergo a course before being promoted, said a home ministry source.

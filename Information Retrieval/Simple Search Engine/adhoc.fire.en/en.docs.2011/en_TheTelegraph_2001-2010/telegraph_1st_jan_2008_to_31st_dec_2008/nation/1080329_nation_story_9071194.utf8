The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jalashva terms not unique: US
                                                                                                               Jalashva terms not unique: US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 28: The US has transferred a warship to the Indian Navy on the same terms it has for military sale of other vessels, a senior US defence official said today.         
	He was responding to an observation by Indias Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that there was a restrictive clause that prevented the INS Jalashva being used for offensive deployment.         
	There is no such unique term or language associated with the transfer of the warship (called the USS Trenton when it was with the US Navy), US Navy secretary Donald C. Winter said today.         
	He is in India to visit the navys western headquarters in Mumbai and for a briefing from the navy on its security perceptions in the Indian Ocean region.         
	No limit or restriction has been put on its use, said Winter. This contradicts the observation of the CAG that specifically said there was a restrictive clause on its wartime deployment and that the navy had bought the ageing vessel after relying too much on information provided by the US Navy.

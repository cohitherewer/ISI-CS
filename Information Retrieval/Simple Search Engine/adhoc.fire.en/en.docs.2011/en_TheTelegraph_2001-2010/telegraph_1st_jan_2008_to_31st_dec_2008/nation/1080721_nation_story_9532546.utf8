          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 20: Orissa, the state that recorded a high incidence of infant and maternal mortality, has also notched up the top spot in terms of institutional delivery, according to a study conducted by the UK governments Department for International Development (DFID).        
	This was revealed at a recent meeting held by health and family welfare minister Sanatan Bisi after a brief visit of DFID officials.        
	Bisi said the United Kingdom team had expressed their satisfaction over Orissas progress in the field of institutional delivery  that helped reduce infant and maternal deaths in the state.        
	According to DFID numbers, incidence of institutional delivery had jumped from a 35 per cent to more than 61 per cent over a period of a year. This has been possible because of the involvement of accredited social health workers, auxiliary nurses and paramedics, Bisi said.        
	Between 2001 and 2006, the infant mortality rate in state declined by 19 per cent, a number three times higher than the rate of decline (6 per cent) in the preceding five years (1996-2001) and the highest in India.        
	Similarly, during 1998-2006, Orissa recorded an impressive improvement in child nutrition, immunisation and feeding practices.         
	Malnutrition in India has showed little progress and in many states the condition has worsened.         
	In Orissa, though, malnutrition has declined from 54 per cent to 44 per cent between 1999 and 2006.        
	State health secretary T.K. Pandey said the DFID would be providing Rs 400 crore over a period of five years for strengthening Orissas health sector plan.         
	The United Kingdon aid agency has already released Rs 42 crore during 2007-08. The money would be in form of grant-in-aid, he said, adding that the amount would be utilised as budgetary support to the health budget.        
	In a bid to strengthen the health sector, Pandey said the government would appoint 1,162 ayurvedic and homeopathic doctors within a month.         
	In order to bring transparency in the procurement system of drugs, the government is going to adopt a system adopted by the Tamil Nadu government.         
	The concept is to develop a mechanism to procure the drugs, he said, adding that the new system would save Rs 60 crore (approximately) in procurement of drugs and equipment.        
	Besides, steps would be taken to streamline drugs control administration. The Orissa Public Service Commission has been requested to fill up 20 posts of drug inspectors immediately. The drugs controllers office in districts would be strengthened for effective enforcement, said the health secretary.        
	The drugs testing laboratory located at Mancheswar will be upgraded and another micro-biology testing centre will be set up.

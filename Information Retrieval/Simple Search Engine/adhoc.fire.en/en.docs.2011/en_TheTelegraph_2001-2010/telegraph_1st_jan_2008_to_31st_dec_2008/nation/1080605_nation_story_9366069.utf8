          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 4: The BJP central leadership stands trapped in the leadership logjam created by the party rebels who are seeking the removal of Sushil Kumar Modi as their state leader.        
	Sources revealed that party bosses, particularly Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley, have been worrying over who to choose after Modi.         
	Though the 30-odd rebels have made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than a replacement, they have not been able to choose Modis heir. Anyone other than Modi is acceptable to us, said Ramnaresh Chourasia over phone from New Delhi.         
	Fact remains whereas rebels have not decided who should lead them, BJP high-command seems to have no faith in the political capability of anyone apart from Sushil Kumar Modi who has served as an effective link between Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and the party.        
	Modi, a soft spoken and suave leader belonging to the business community, has been the BJPs poster boy in Bihar for almost a decade now.        
	Party MLAs see him as the guardian while dealing with the Bihar chief minister and the BJP high command  as the cadre-based BJP leadership generally interacts with the MLAs through its middleman, Modi.        
	Instead of working as a neutral leader, he (Sushil Kumar Modi) acted on his whims and got performing ministers dropped from the Nitish council on April 13, said MLA Awanish Kumar, explaining that it was hard to work with a biased leader.        
	Right in the middle of the rebel acts there is Nandkishore Yadav and Ashwini Kumar Choubey  both with strong RSS backgrounds.        
	According to party sources, the Brahmin lobby, led by Murli Manohar Joshi, have been opposing Modi for his acquiesce to the Nitish Kumar government. Choubey represents this lobby.         
	Nandkishore, too, is said to be mulling a way to replace Modi as a leader and put himself in his place. He has the backing of the Brahmin lobby in this regard.        
	Already the BJP bosses have formed a four-member committee, headed by president Rajnath Singh, that has been talking to the rebels camping in New Delhi. The last four talks in the past two days failed, said Ram Naresh Chourasia, reluctant to move from his oust Modi campaign. However, the leadership is still not sure that Nandkishore is cut out for Modis job. How can the party utilise Modi after he is removed from his posts. In the run up to the Lok Sabha elections due within a year, he may be BJPs biggest loss in Bihar, said a top leader at the condition of anonymity.

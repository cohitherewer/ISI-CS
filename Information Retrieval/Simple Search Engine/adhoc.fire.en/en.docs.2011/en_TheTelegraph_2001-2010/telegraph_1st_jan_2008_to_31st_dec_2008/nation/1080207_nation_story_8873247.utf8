The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party to PC: focus on poor 
                                                                                                            Party to PC: focus on poor 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Forget GDP, focus on the garib.        
	The Congress today told finance minister P. Chidambaram to be extra-sensitive to the expectations of not so much the aam aadmi (common man) as the garib (poor) as elections cannot be won on GDP growth or a booming sensex.        
	With a little over a year left for the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, several party veterans asked Chidambaram to rein in prices of essential commodities.        
	The finance ministers customary pre-budget meeting with office-bearers and a few ministers at the party headquarters lasted nearly three hours and yielded several suggestions.        
	The proposals ranged from a Rs 1-lakh housing loan at a low interest rate so that the urban and rural poor could own houses under the Indira Housing Scheme to knocking off LPG subsidy for those who earned at least Rs 4 lakh a year.        
	Sources said petroleum minister Murli Deora, who also attended the meeting, was told that a fuel price hike would spell disaster for the Congress and its allies.        
	Asked by reporters what he planned to do, Deora said: What is there now? Nothing will be done now.        
	A fuel price hike does not figure on the Union cabinets agenda for tomorrows meeting and it seems the Centre has put off a decision for now.        
	Among those who took on Chidambaram on price rise were V. Narayanaswamy, R.K. Dhawan and M. Veerappa Moily.        
	Whats the point of flaunting a 9 or 10 per cent growth rate if prices of essential commodities keep increasing? The world has recognised us as a superpower but, domestically, expenditure levels are not on a par with incomes, a general secretary was quoted as telling the finance minister.        
	Chidambaram said the Centre would soon evolve a mechanism to supply essential commodities at subsidised prices to the poorest of the poor.        
	Nobody sought the governments intervention to lower interest rates on housing loans except in the context of subsidised shelter programmes for the poor.        
	Earlier, the Congress had toyed with the idea of prioritising this on its demand list. But the sources said the leaders felt that the government had done enough for the aam aadmi (broadly, the salaried classes) by responding promptly to fluctuations in the stock market, and it was time to focus on the poor  the Dalits and tribals, who formed the partys core.        
	Some of the other budget-related proposals were:        
	Special employment programmes for youths (Rahul Gandhis thrust area) and schemes to bridge the income gap between educated and skilled youths        
	National scholarships for Dalits and backward castes        
	Incentives for states doing well on the Centres flagship schemes.

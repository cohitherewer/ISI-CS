	Dharmendra success tip    
	Ask Dharmendra whats the secret to his success, and the one-time Bollywood leading man would say ghee.    
	It was no surprise then that the Bollywood hero, who spent his childhood in rural Punjab, chose to become the brand ambassador for a pure ghee brand in the capital. Having grown up in a farmers family, I have had the opportunity to partake of things like pure ghee and milk to the fullest. When I was a child, my father made sure I had a glass of pure milk every day and a lot of butter, he said.    
	Today, what I have achieved is largely because of consumption of these things, which is amrit to the human soul, Dharmendra said while launching the brand of ghee.    
	He said when the food company approached him with the offer to become its brand ambassador I immediately agreed as I felt that it was a noble endeavour to bring to the future generation pure milk and ghee products, which has over the last few decades become a rarity.

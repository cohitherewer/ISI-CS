The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wanted for South Pole: lady skier
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wanted for South Pole: lady skier
  - Expedition leader lists qualities she is looking for among members of all-woman team to Antarctica         AMIT ROY                                  (from top)The  tent  in  which  the  women  have  to  sleep  during  the  expedition; Felicity  Ashton, and  a  picture  from  one  of her  previous  Antarctica  expeditions                                
	London, July 27: Felicity Ashton, one of Englands most adventurous women with immense experience of Antarctica, has told The Telegraph what she wants in the Indian woman who would join her all-female expedition team for the South Pole.         
	Someone with a real thirst for adventure, Felicity, 30, summed up, speaking on a 29 Celsius summers day, from her home in Kent in the garden of England.         
	A little skiing ability would be an advantage, she acknowledged, but it was not essential as the ability to traverse essentially flat terrain on skis would be imparted to eight team members when they train in Scandinavia in spring next year.         
	The expedition will take 30-50 days to ski 500km in 30 Celsius. She hopes to reach the South Pole on New Years Day 2010.        
	Initially, after interviews which Felicity will conduct in Delhi on August 30, two Indian women will be picked.         
	They will go through the training camp but, finally, only one will join her colleagues from Cyprus, Ghana, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, New Zealand and Jamaica under the leadership of Felicity, representing the finest in British womanhood.         
	Although Felicity is a brilliant scientist herself, having graduated from University College London with a degree in physics and astronomy and then working from 2000 to 2003 as a meteorologist at Rothera Research Station on the Antarctic Peninsula on Ozone levels and climate change, she is leading the Commonwealth expedition to demonstrate that women from different countries and backgrounds can get on.        
	Felicity has certainly had a lot of fun on ice. She has led a team, the Pink Lady PoleCats, in a Polar challenge, and another, the Arctic Foxes, on a 1,200km journey across Greenlands inland ice.         
	Now she wants a foxy Indian lady.         
	When it is all over, she hopes that the Commonwealth women will return to their own countries and tell others of the wild but threatened beauty of Antarctica, which is not a place of black and white, but of pink and purple hues with hidden and sudden dangers.         
	The perils, come not from polar bears but crevasses, which are rifts hard to detect because they are covered with soft snow that could be 100ft wide and hundreds of feet deep.         
	Into this darkness, it is possible for explorers to disappear forever, which is why the Indian woman will be roped to her colleagues and equipped with global positioning equipment.         
	The eight will gather at Punta Arenas on the southern tip of Chile.         
	They will be split into two groups of four each and flown forward to the edge of Antarctica by aircraft, with one lot beginning the march to the South Pole from the Ross Ice Shelf and the other from the opposite end on the Fichner Ice Shelf.         
	Hopefully we will all meet at the South Pole on New Years Day 2010  when the Indian flag will be planted there at an altitude of 10,000ft, said Felicity.         
	She laughed as she explained that since the women will sleep four to a tent, she will try to pick personalities not prone to cat fights.         
	Each woman will have to pull a sledge full of food, fuel and equipment weighing 80kg. So spoilt Bollywood stars or neka Bengali women need not apply.         
	Food will be pure carbohydrate or protein but the Indian woman will be able to treat her colleagues to the occasional biryani while there is a blizzard blowing outside.         
	If conditions are good, the women could cover 30km in a day, but they have to stay put if snowstorms render movement impossible.         
	British schoolchildren are brought up on the legend of Scotts disastrous South Pole expedition of 1912 when a team member, Capt. Lawrence Oates, rather than hold up his colleagues with his illness, walked to his death in a blizzard with typical English understatement: I am just going outside and may be some time.         
	The winning candidate from India will be able to say something like: I am just going outside to catch the Metro from Belgachhia and may be some time.         
	Of course, Felicity promises to return the woman, safe and sound and, perhaps, a little fairer complexioned, to her mum.                 
	The closing date for applications is August 15, 2008.

	New Delhi, June 10: Militants have been sneaking into the Valley in larger numbers, raising concern among security agencies ahead of elections due in three months.        
	The reminder that the security apparatus needs to be strengthened came during last months hostage drama that claimed eight lives and injured several others in the Samba sector. Seven hardcore militants who had crossed over into the Valley were behind the incident. Army sources said their aim was to fan poll violence.        
	The CRPFs numbers suggest the increase in sneak-ins has kept the force busier than they have been in the past 18 months, when militant attacks were almost negligible.        
	In the first three months this year, the paramilitary force killed 28 militants and apprehended 32, most of them from dreaded outfits like the Lashkar and Al Badr.

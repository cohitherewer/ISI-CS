          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 24: Thousands of Andhra Pradesh expatriates in America are being bombarded with safety tips after five students from the state were murdered in the US in the past one year.        
	The precautions suggested by NRI groups in America and students families in Andhra, through a concerted email and text message campaign that began last week, are:        
	Do not live alone        
	Maintain relations with your neighbours        
	Keep neighbours informed of your movements        
	Never go anywhere alone but in the company of known persons        
	Always keep your mobile phone switched on        
	Save the numbers of your local police station.        
	We have approached the Telugu Association of North America (Tana) and American Telugu Association (ATA) to co-ordinate the efforts to build confidence among Indian students and technocrats in the US, Syam Sunkara, a Telugu community leader in the US now visiting India, said in Hyderabad today.        
	He has requested Tana and ATA officials in several US cities to spread the message among Telugu expats, especially students living alone. He said nearly one in four Indian students and professionals in the US is from Andhra.        
	Students from the state have been shot dead in their campus hostels or flats, or found murdered in their cars on highways. Last week, a Telugu engineering student, Pulluru Shashank, survived an attempt on his life at the University of Middle Tennessee.        
	We are asking Telugu student associations to conduct awareness campaigns about personal safety. We have asked these associations to ensure that the students are networked into groups and remain in touch with one another over the phone, in person or through mail, and call their parents at frequent intervals, said K. Srinivas Rao, another expat Telugu.        
	The Andhra minister for NRI affairs, Mohammad Ali Shabbir, has urged Tana and the ATA to mount pressure on the US government to ensure proper investigations into the deaths of the students.        
	A group of MPs from the state, cutting across political lines, recently met foreign ministry and US embassy officials with the same demand.        
	Officials here say parents of those studying in the US have flooded the Indian embassy in Washington with requests to look after their childrens safety and are asking relatives and friends in America to keep in touch with their wards.        
	The regional passport officer in Hyderabad, Bala Bhaskar, said he received over 100 requests from parents in the past two months.        
	All we can do is advise the Indian embassy and alert the students to be careful about what sort of friends they make on foreign soil, Bhaskar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LJP opts for minority trader 
                                                                                                               LJP opts for minority trader 
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 13: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) last night announced Shabir Ali as its candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls slated for March 26.         
	The move is being seen as a coupe for LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan as it would keep his detractor and LJP vice-president Ranjan Yadav at bay and would counter Nitish Kumars minority card.         
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad also succeeded in persuading the Union chemical and fertiliser minister to field his partys candidate with the support of the UPA partners, including the RJD.         
	Paswan succumbed to the persuasion that offers a windfall in the shape of an assured Rajya Sabha seat to his party, which has barely 10 MLAs in the Assembly.         
	The only compromise that Paswan had to make was to ignore Ranjan Yadav whom the former had tipped to enter the poll fray, earlier in the day.         
	After the failure of his repeated efforts to let Paswan and LJP, a partner of UPA, support the RJD that has 54 MLAs in Bihar, the railway minister sacrificed his partys claim, surrendering the fifth seat to the LJP chief.        
	Sources revealed that Lalu Prasad also got the UPA chairman Sonia Gandhi and some top Left leaders to exert pressure on Paswan to field any candidate other than Ranjan Yadav and ensure unity of the UPA at the polls.         
	Our leader (Lalu Prasad) has made the supreme sacrifice of our partys claim to ensure the unity of the UPA, said state RJD president Abdul Bari Sidiqui, explaining: It was necessary to ensure the unity between Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan in the run up to the coming Lok Sabha polls.         
	The RJD and UPA continue to be the natural choice for the minority communities, Sidiqui said, adding: The NDA is just giving some sops to some groups to extract votes. Everyone would eventually gravitate towards the UPA as it had been their natural choice for long now.         
	The exercise to woo in Muslims voters has proved beneficial for the community. Now there are three leaders from the community in the biennial poll fray  Ejaj Ali and Harun Rashid from the JD(U) and Shabir Ali from the LJP.        
	The agreement between Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan has nearly ended all possibilities of a biennial poll.        
	There are six candidates (four from NDA and two from UPA) in the race against the six vacancies in the Rajya Sabha.

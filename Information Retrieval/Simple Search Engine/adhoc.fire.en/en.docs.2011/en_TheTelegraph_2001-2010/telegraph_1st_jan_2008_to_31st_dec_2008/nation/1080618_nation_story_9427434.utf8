	New Delhi, June 17: The government today said it would extend Bharat Stage IV emission norms for four-wheelers to 11 cities and bring the entire country under Bharat Stage III norms from April 1, 2010.        
	The places where the Bharat Stage IV norms will become operational are the National Capital Region (Delhi), Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Kanpur and Agra.         
	At a meeting of the consultative committee of MPs, T.R. Baalu, the Union minister for road transport and highways, said the department would notify the rules soon.        
	Besides emission norms, the consultative committee also discussed road safety norms.        
	Baalu said the expansion in road network, motorisation and urbanisation in the country had been accompanied by a rise in road accidents and the government would take all steps to improve road safety in the country.        
	In 2006, there were around 4.6 lakh road accidents in India that killed 1,05,749 people and injured close to 5 lakh, the minister said.         
	These numbers translate to one accident every minute and one death every five minutes in the country.

	Raipur, Aug. 4: A chopper booked for the Jharkhand visit of BJP President Rajnath Singh has gone missing on the borders of Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.         
	According to sources, the chopper of Hyderabad-based Ran Air Services limited was booked by the Chhattisgarh government to take home minister Ram Vichar Netam to Jharkhand today for functions in Ranchi and Daltonganj.        
	The minister was to take Rajnath to different places in the chopper during his Jharkhand visit on Tuesday. Sources said the helicopter took off from Hyderabad yesterday afternoon and was scheduled to land in Jagdalpur (Bastar) for re-fuelling en route to Raipur, from where it was to fly for Ranchi this morning with Netam.        
	When it did not land in Jagdalpur till evening, the officials raised an alarm and started the search operation after establishing contacts with Hyderabad office of the company, a senior police officer said. But there was no information about its whereabouts, the official added.        
	Three different search parties today launched a massive operation to trace the missing chopper. Besides an Indian Air Force helicopter, the Chhattisgarh government pressed its chopper hired for anti-Naxalite operations. Till Monday evening, the search parties failed to get any clue, the official said, adding that bad weather was hampering the operation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal aide for Nagaland governor
                                                                                                            Bengal aide for Nagaland governor
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Former Bengal chief secretary Manish Gupta and former Andhra Pradesh police chief Swaranjit Sen will be advisers to the governor of Nagaland during Presidents rule.        
	Sources said the Centre had chosen the names after consulting allies of the ruling UPA. Officially, however, a search is still on.        
	Gupta and Sen have had long experience in handling law and order. Gupta was Bengals home secretary before becoming its chief secretary while Sen achieved considerable success against the Maoists in Andhra.        
	Sen will advise governor K. Sankaranarayan on security issues while Gupta, an old hand at development, will assist him on development and financial matters, the sources added.         
	Nagaland came under Presidents rule this week.         
	The state unit of the Congress had demanded the dismissal of the Neiphiu Rio-led ministry after the Speaker failed to count three Independent votes against the government in the Assembly.        
	Sen is said to be capable of dealing with diverse groups.         
	An alumnus of Doon School, Sen had graduated from St Stephens with some of the present leaders of Nagaland.        
	His name had done the rounds last year as a possible replacement for Lieutenant General (retd) R.V. Kulkarni, chairman of the ceasefire supervisory board (for NSCN-Khaplang) and the ceasefire monitoring group (NSCN-IM). But the rebel groups were more comfortable with Kulkarni.        
	The situation seems to have changed now. A senior NSCN-IM leader said from Dimapur: If the advisers to the governor are good, there should not be much of a problem.        
	Gupta is likely to provide a clear perspective on development and keep the Left, which is generally opposed to Presidents rule, happy.         
	 Any visible improvement in the situation could help the Congress in the February Assembly polls. Opposition leader I. Imkong said his party wanted the polls to be on schedule.         
	An official announcement on the advisers appointment is likely next week. Neither Gupta nor Sen could be contacted for their reaction.

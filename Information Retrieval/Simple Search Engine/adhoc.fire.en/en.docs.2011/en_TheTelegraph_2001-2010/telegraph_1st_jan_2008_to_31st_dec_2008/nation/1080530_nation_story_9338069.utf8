The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court bar on civic body poll roll 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Court bar on civic body poll roll 
  - Jeypore Municipality under scanner        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Streets in trouble                                        
	Cuttack, May 29: After Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC), Jeypore Municipality has courted controversy over preparation of electoral rolls for the civic polls.        
	In both cases the state election commissions order for the revision of electoral rolls was challenged in view of the ground realities in a population composition following ward delimitation.        
	The present term of the councils of 96 municipal bodies in Orissa, including the municipal corporations of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, ends in September 2008. The election commission had issued a notification in February directing civic bodies to prepare electoral rolls for municipal elections.        
	While Orissa High Court has already clamped an embargo on the electoral roll revision by the CMC, the Jeypore Municipality has been directed by the court to submit all documents related to the revision.        
	High court sources today said though notices had been issued, the case of Jeypore Municipality would be adjudicated after the court reopens next month after the summer vacation.        
	The voters list prepared by the Jeypore Municipality had come under scrutiny after a petition alleged irregularities with far reaching outcomes last week.        
	R.P. Panda, with three other citizens, in a writ petition last week had sought judicial intervention in the discrepancies in the revised roll in contrast to the actual voters.        
	When the last civic polls were held in the state in September 2003, there were 25 wards within the Jeypore Municipality area. The number of wards had since been increased to 28 under the delimitation process.        
	Citing anomalies, the petition said there were at least five wards where the population was less than the number of voters in the new electoral roll.         
	In case of Ward No. 11 and 15, where the population was 3,209 and 2,774 respectively, 3,637 and 2,978 voters had been enlisted.        
	Similarly, in the case of Cuttack Municipal Corporation a writ petition was filed challenging the commissions order after an interim stay order was issued by the high court on ward delimitation and reservation of seats.        
	Since the impugned delimitation notification of the state government on wards in CMC is liable to be quashed, the election commissions order for revision of electoral rolls is premature and therefore, should be quashed, the petition had argued.        
	Chiranjay Sahu, a corporator, had filed the petition. Acting on it, the high court last month had issued a stay on further action on roll revision of the civic body.        
	Meanwhile, the high court on May 15 had quashed the final notification on the increased number of wards within redrawn boundaries under CMC and changed reservation status.         
	The court, while acting on a petition filed by three corporators, had further directed the state urban development department to hear objections of the parties in due consultation with the CMC authorities and resolve the issue within 15 days.

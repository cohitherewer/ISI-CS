	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 18: Four months after the murder of wonder boy Budhias coach Biranchi Das, police today submitted a chargesheet against Raja Acharya and his accomplice Chagala.         
	The coach was murdered on April 13. The Bargarh police, probing the murder, have hinted at a love angle as the motive. The police have filed chargesheets before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate naming Raja and Chagala as the accused.         
	A spectrograph of Raja threatening to kill the coach recorded during a telephone conversation with Bidhusmita Mantri has been submitted as evidence.         
	In the call recorded on March 20, Raja threatened Bidusmita, a friend of Leslie Tripathy and an actress herself, that he would kill the coach as he was a hurdle between him and Leslie.

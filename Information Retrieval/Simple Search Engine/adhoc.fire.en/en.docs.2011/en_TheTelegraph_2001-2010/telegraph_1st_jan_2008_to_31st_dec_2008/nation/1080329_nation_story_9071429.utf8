          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nand Lal at a news conference on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, March 28: The tussle between the Maharashtra election commissioner and MLAs continued today, with Nand Lal moving Bombay High Court against his arrest and the legislators adopting a resolution saying the Assembly would not respond to any court notice.         
	Poll commissioner Lal, who has been at loggerheads with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh since 2006, was arrested last evening after the Assembly passed a breach of privilege motion against the former bureaucrat.         
	The motion, moved by a Congress MLA two years ago, alleged that Lal had issued a notification for elections to local self-government bodies ignoring a law that authorised the state government to hold these elections.         
	Lal was released around 9.30 this morning from Arthur Road Jail and filed a petition in Bombay High Court challenging his arrest on the breach of privilege charge. The petition will be heard on April 1.         
	The Assembly today passed a resolution by voice vote, saying the House would not respond to any notice from the high court. Shiv Sena and BJP legislators protested against the resolution.         
	Lal had described his arrest as political vendetta by Deshmukh. He alleged that Deshmukh had tried to influence the ongoing delimitation process relating to his home constituency Latur, which is likely to become a reserved seat.         
	Lal, known in bureaucratic circles as an upright officer and a stickler for rules, had told the Assembly that the state election commission was a constitutional body, and it was necessary for the government to co-operate with it and treat it with the same respect as the Election Commission.         
	In a letter to the Assembly secretariat on January 4, 2008, he had cited the judgment in T.N. Seshan vs Union of India, which referred to the responsibility of the Election Commission under the Constitution to hold free and fair elections.         
	Administrative exigencies cannot be allowed to override the constitutional prescription of free and fair elections. The state government must and shall do everything that is necessary to co-operate with the mandate of the SEC (state election commission), the letter said, adding that Article 243 (3) recognises the independence of the state poll panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delay aborts flight to NY
                                                                                                               Delay aborts flight to NY
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 27 (PTI): The crew of an Air India flight to New York refused to fly apparently because of the delay in getting three passengers off the plane at the last moment.        
	The crew claimed that the delay was so much that it would have stretched their duty beyond the scheduled time limits.        
	All but three of the 298 passengers, stranded after the refusal, have been put up in hotels.         
	According to airport sources, the three passengers said they were feeling uncomfortable inside the aircraft, which was being refuelled at the time of boarding.        
	It began with one of them saying he wanted to disembark because he couldnt bear the smell from an oil leak during the refuelling.        
	Later, two more, citing similar reasons, told the crew that they needed to disembark.        
	Their luggage had to be taken out of the cargo hold of the Boeing 747, which apparently took a long time. The flight (AI 111), with a London stopover, was to leave at 7.20am.        
	Passengers spent several hours at the airport before being shifted to the hotels. Some of them could be sent abroad tonight.

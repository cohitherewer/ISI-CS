          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The Centre has finalised the location for the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore and urged the Madhya Pradesh government to quickly acquire land ahead of Assembly elections.         
	The human resource development ministry has speeded up the process amid fears that inability to launch the IIT this year could hurt the Congress in the polls, officials said.         
	The site is 22km south of Indore, at a village called Simrol. It falls between Indore and Khandwa on state highway No. 27 leading to the Maharashtra border and is barely 10km from Tincha Falls, a popular trekking site.         
	The institutes in Indore and at Mandi in Himachal Pradesh are the only ones among the eight promised IITs that were not launched this year. Both states are ruled by the BJP.         
	The HRD ministrys refusal to launch IIT Indore had led to the state accusing education minister Arjun Singh of delaying the project. State officials, including technical education minister Nagendra Singh, went to Delhi to plead Indores case, but in vain.         
	With the Assembly elections expected in the next two months, the HRD ministry is keen to counter any charge that the Centre discriminated against the state, government sources said.         
	The state government may try to portray the Centre as discriminatory towards Madhya Pradesh. The charge, though baseless, could work as the IIT in Indore has not been launched yet. We want to take the bull by the horns and push the project over the next couple of months, an official said.         
	In a letter, the HRD ministry has urged the state government to acquire between 500 and 600 acres at Simrol for the IIT. The letter says the plot must face the highway.         
	Each of the eight new IITs is to be started under the tutelage of a mentor IIT as specified in the blueprint drawn up by the Centre.         
	The six IITs in Patna, Gandhinagar, Bhubaneswar, Punjab, Hyderabad and Rajasthan started this year are respectively mentored by the institutes in Guwahati, Mumbai, Kharagpur, Delhi, Chennai and Kanpur.        
	IIT Roorkee, the mentor for the Himachal IIT, told the ministry it could not launch the institute this year as it was burdened with the responsibility of organising the 2008 joint entrance examination.         
	IIT Bombay, the mentor for the Indore institute, said it could only launch one IIT  Gandhinagar  this year.

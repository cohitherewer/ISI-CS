The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya to Maya: Rs 695 case a cheap stunt
                                                                                                               Jaya to Maya: Rs 695 case a cheap stunt
          OUR BUREAU                          Jaya Bachchan                                   
	Bhopal/Lucknow, April 1: Jaya Bachchan today accused Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati of targeting her husband Amitabh just to gain cheap publicity.        
	Speaking in her hometown Bhopal, Jaya suggested that Mayavati was personally behind the registration of a case that charges Amitabh with cheating her government out of Rs 695.        
	Its just cheap publicity. You will take Amitabh Bachchans name and your name will come when the allegations are made, so you will get publicity. She (Mayavati) says so many things but does not make headlines daily, but if she will attack Amitabh Bachchan, she will hit the headlines, the Samajwadi Party MP said.        
	Jaya, who later travelled to Betul to campaign in a Lok Sabha by-election, said Amitabh, a self-made successful person, was paying the price for his success.        
	There are concerted attempts to seek the limelight by dragging his name. Some do it with flattery while others try it by attacking or indulging in cheap gimmicks.        
	Yesterday, a court in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, heard a complaint alleging Amitabh had saved himself Rs 695 in stamp duty by undervaluing land where a school named after his daughter-in-law, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, is to come up.        
	Hours after Jayas allegation, Mayavati was concerned enough to issue a statement denying any role in the matter. The case was initiated by a tehsildar in the (Barabanki) district; how can the chief minister be responsible for that? she asked.        
	Barabanki authorities have said the cost of the land was Rs 843,639 but it was undervalued by Rs 6,000. Mayavatis statement explained that the plot had 155 date palm trees and one peepal tree, whose value was not taken into account.        
	In Bhopal, sitting by Jayas side, Samajwadi leader Amar Singh scoffed at the Mayavati government. Amitabh can pay Rs 6 lakh  Rs 695 is nothing for him. Such a case against a megastar is ridiculous and an attempt to defame Indian art, he said.                        Mayavati    
	Amitabhs lawyer Pradeep Roy has already threatened a defamation suit.        
	Asked if the actor was being harassed at the Gandhi familys bidding, Jaya and Amar kept silent.        
	In Lucknow, Mayavati seemed eager to quell suggestions that the case was a way of targeting the actor after the reprieve he received yesterday from the Supreme Court.        
	The apex court had rejected an Uttar Pradesh government plea for a probe into another of Amitabhs land deals in Barabanki, where he was accused of fraud. Mayavati suggested the timing was coincidental.        
	The (stamp duty) case came up in the (Barabanki) court in the normal course of the law. It had originated on March 7, 2008, her statement said. It did not originate with the Supreme Court refusal to accept an appeal of the state government against Bachchan.

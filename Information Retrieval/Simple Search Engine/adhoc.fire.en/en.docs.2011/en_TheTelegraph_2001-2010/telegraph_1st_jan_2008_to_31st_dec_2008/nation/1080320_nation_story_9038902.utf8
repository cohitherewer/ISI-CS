                                                                                                               Hub blast rips Kashmir calm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, March 19: A powerful explosion outside Jammu and Kashmir High Court shattered five months of calm and left a person dead.         
	The blast took place at 5.50pm at Jahangir Chowk, Srinagars administrative and commercial hub. The site is metres away from the civil secretariat and the Assembly.        
	Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul Mujtaba said an IED had been placed on a rough patch on the citys only flyover, which is near a police post. Nobody was inside the post when the explosion took place.        
	The dead person was identified as Abdul Hamid Bhat, a resident of the citys Chadura area. The blast also left 17 people injured, some critically.        
	The parapet of the flyover caved in and fell over vehicles below. The falling bricks and rubble caused most of the injuries, Mujtaba said.         
	The Hizb-ul Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the explosion and said it was aimed at a CRPF vehicle. We are sorry for the civilian injuries, Hizb spokesperson Khalil-ur Rahman told local news agency KNS.        
	The blast seems to be a reply to the police chiefs statement on Monday that civilian killings and grenade attacks in the Valley have come down by 85 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively.

	New Delhi, March 20: Astronomers today announced they had found methane in the atmosphere of a planet outside the solar system, the first sign of an organic molecule associated with life on Earth from an extrasolar world.         
	Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and other institutions detected signatures of methane which, in the right conditions, can play a key role in chemical reactions necessary for the formation of life.         
	But scientists have ruled out any biological link with the methane on the planet named HD 189733b, a world so close to its star that its atmosphere is at a sizzling 900 degrees Celsius, but so far from the solar system that its light takes 63 years to reach Earth.         
	The planets atmosphere is too hot for even the hardiest of life to survive  at least the kind of life we know from Earth, said Giovanna Tinetti, an Italian physicist who spotted the methane signatures, a member of the team that reported its finding in the journal Nature Today.         
	But this raises hope that we might find similar signatures of organic molecules on a planet less hostile to life in the future, Tinetti told The Telegraph over the phone.         
	The goal is to eventually find biology-related molecules on planets that lie within the habitable zones of their stars, said Mark Swain, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.         
	The astronomers used the 18-year old Hubble Space Telescope to observe HD189733b as it moved in front of its star. As light from the star passed through the atmosphere of the planet, gases in the atmosphere influenced the starlight, leaving their distinct signatures on light from the star. The starlight had signatures of both water and methane.         
	Scientists have previously discovered methane on most of the planets in the solar system, but never on an extrasolar planet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prompt probe orders to no avail
                                                                                                               Prompt probe orders to no avail
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                                           
	Cuttack, March 6: The Naveen Patnaik government has constituted commissions for judicial inquiry for most issues that rocked Orissa. But most of them are yet to submit their reports.         
	Case in point: In January 2001, after a clash between police and members of Puri Bar Association, chief minister Naveen Patnaik ordered a probe. The inquiry is into its seventh year now.         
	Similarly, a commission was set up to probe the December-2001 police firing at Raigarh in Nowrangpur that killed four tribals. That probe, too, is in its seventh year.        
	The government has, so far, appointed as many as 14 judicial commissions. Seven of them are yet to submit reports.         
	Justice C.R. Pal Commission was appointed in 2004 to probe the alleged irregularities in the recruitment of Grade-III staff in the Assembly secretariat, purchase of computers and installation of computerised systems for monitoring attendance and entry of visitors. The commission is still making inquiries.        
	The Opposition believes a commission is a ruse to take the heat of a defensive government. This government promptly orders a probe just to diffuse the issue and bide time, said Orissa PCC president Jaydev Jena.        
	The government, which is entitled to provide financial and manpower help, along with documents and papers that judges need, does not help honestly and impartially, rued a retired judge on condition of anonymity.         
	However, ruling party leaders strongly defended the probes.         
	Whenever a major incident takes place the Opposition opposes administrative probes or police investigat- ion. The government is forced to appoint judicial commissions to ensure a free and fair probe. Whats wrong with that? said BJD secretary-general and former minister Damodar Rout.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 20: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat called on Jyoti Basu today to fine-tune the agenda for the partys forthcoming congress.        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was present when Karat met the party patriarch at his Salt Lake home.        
	The nonagenarian Basu, who has had to skip recent politburo meetings in Delhi, will not attend the Coimbatore party congress, scheduled to begin on March 29.        
	According to CPM insiders, Karat also sought Basus opinion on probable politburo members from the Bengal unit.         
	Elevated to the post of Citu general secretary following the death of Chittabrata Mazumdar, Bengal labour minister Mohammed Amin is almost certain to find a berth. It has been a CPM norm to include leaders from its labour and farmers wings in its highest policy-making body.        
	However, the party is still undecided on a replacement for the late Anil Biswas. Karat, his wife Brinda and Sitaram Yechury  considered the most powerful triumvirate in the CPM central leadership  are known to back Nirupam Sen. But his workload as industries minister, which would tie him down to Bengal, may pose a barrier. In that case, Citu state secretary Shyamal Chakraborty could be picked.

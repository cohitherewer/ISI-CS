The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brokers fear Singur land price crash
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Brokers fear Singur land price crash

	Singur, Oct. 4: Subhas Hazra wonders if any Calcutta businessman will ever come to buy land in Singur.        
	In Khasherbheri, Singherbheri, Talabhomra and Rupnarayanpur, land deals were struck for Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh a bigha. In most cases, the farmers were paid a part in advance so that they could get working on the land documents, Subhas said.         
	Now, neither would the businessmen be keen to spend such an amount, nor would the farmers be ready to part with the advance amount they have received. In between, brokers like us will take the worst beating.        
	Just wait for a few more months he said, and you would see the number of suicides rising in Singur.        
	Before the Tatas came with the Nano project, the price of land ranged between Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000 a bigha. Once the car plant was announced, it spiralled to Rs 6 lakh a bigha.         
	The farmers made money, but so did Subhas of Gopalnagar and fellow brokers Gopal Chakrabarty and Simanta Patra of Joymollah.         
	When we brokered land deals for a company called Aparna opposite the Tata project, the land sold at Rs 2.5 lakh a cottah. Later, the price shot up even higher, said Kalipada Das of Singur.         
	Many benefited by striking a deal with us. Rita Ghorai, a widow from Horhoria, made Rs 19 lakh by selling her 10 cottahs, he said. But now, no one will be interested. The price of land will crash.        
	Debaprasad Das, who is a member of one of the 22 syndicates supplying construction material to the plant but dabbled in brokering land, said: The money from the land deals came as a support when we didnt receive payments from the contractors. But that wont happen now.         
	Those planning to return to farming on their locked land in Singur are in for trouble, too, particularly after industries minister Nirupam Sen said that despite the Tatas pullout, the land acquired would not be returned to the farmers.         
	Land acquired for the Nano project by the government cannot be returned to the farmers in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act. We shall use the land for industrial purpose, Sen said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VIP bother: extra steps at airport
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           VIP bother: extra steps at airport

	New Delhi, April 27: Having to walk 10 steps more could trigger VIP tantrums at Delhi airport.        
	The Delhi International Airport Ltd has shut down the VIP car park in front of the arrival lounge to expand and upgrade the terminal. The new terminal will be ready in three months if deadlines are met.        
	Till then, VIPs flying in to Delhi will not be able to access their cars as easily as they have been doing and will have to take the arrival lounge exit like ordinary people.        
	The car park was shut down recently, a source said. This could become a big problem as VIPs are touchy and dont like being put through any sort of discomfort.        
	Airport authorities, however, brushed off the matter saying VIPs would be allowed to park anywhere.        
	Asked what that meant, a source said: People with beacons on their cars dont listen to anyone, so they have the freedom to park anywhere. Who will have the guts to stop them?        
	The source said airport authorities had already had trouble with bureaucrats who had grumbled about the bother. Others who will be inconvenienced are chief ministers, governors, cabinet ministers, high court judges and other dignitaries.        
	It has only been two days since the parking has been closed. Airport authorities hope to be able to find a solution in the next week, the source said on Friday.        
	Security agencies have said the car park closure could have safety ramifications for VIPs.        
	They will have to walk out of the arrival hall and mingle with people waiting outside. That could be a security threat, an airport official said.        
	It has been suggested that Delhi police post officers outside the arrival lounge exit but no steps have been taken yet.        
	Airport officials said the car park had merely been relocated, not completely shut. There is space for them (VIPs) to park on the other side of the arrival terminal, a spokesperson said.

	Cincinnati, Jan. 7 (AP): An Indian rhino expected to give birth to the worlds first Indian rhino conceived by artificial insemination has delivered a stillborn female calf, Cincinnati Zoo officials said.
    
	The 16-year-old mother, Nikki, went into labour around 5.30pm on Saturday and delivered the calf just before 11pm, zoo officials said. 
    
	Zoo veterinarian Mark Campbell worked for 20 minutes to resuscitate the calf, but was unsuccessful.
    
	She never drew a breath, said Terri Roth, the zoos vice-president of conservation and science. This is devastating news, but it wont change our programme. Well try again as soon as Nikki has some time off.
    
	Indian rhinos sometimes give birth to stillborn calves, especially when it is their first delivery, said Monica Stoops, the reproductive physiologist who worked for five years to develop the technique that impregnated Nikki.
    
	There was nothing abnormal about the 16-month pregnancy that could have warned officials of the stillbirth, Roth said. Also, the calf did not have any congenital defects. 
    
	It all leads to the conclusion that there was just some mechanical problem on the way out, she said.
    
	In November 2004, semen was collected from Himal, a male Indian rhino at the Wilds preserve in south-east Ohio. Cincinnati Zoo workers then designed the equipment to harvest the sperm and deposit it in Nikkis uterus.
    
	The team succeeded in inseminating Nikki in its fourth attempt in August 2006. The zoo announced the pregnancy in July.
    
	Nikki was the first rhino impregnated with sperm that had been frozen and stored.
    
	Zoo officials will wait about six months before trying to make Nikki pregnant again, Roth said.
    
	Indian rhinos, native to northern India and southern Nepal, weigh up to 2,700 kg when fully grown.
    
	Before tough preservation laws began to be stringently enforced in the 20th century, there were only 200 Indian rhinos left, experts said. Now there are an estimated 2,500 animals in the wild.
    
	Rhinos can have a hard time breeding naturally because they can be aggressive and fight rather than mate.

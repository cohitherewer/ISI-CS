          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The explosives kept in jars. (PTI)                                  
	Chandigarh, Dec. 9: Six labourers carrying explosives were arrested from an inter-state bus terminal early today.         
	Police said the six, originally from Nepal, worked as labourers in Rohru, Himachal Pradesh, and were going to Uttarakhand.        
	Chandigarh has already been high on the intelligence list of probable terror attacks and with the second Test between India and England scheduled in Mohali from December 19, security has been beefed up in the twin cities following todays arrests. Both teams will stay in Chandigarh.         
	We cannot expect to lower guard now and are keeping a close watch for suspicious elements, a senior officer said.        
	Chandigarh SSP S.S. Srivastava said the six, including a minor, were carrying 12 gelatine sticks, two sticks of high-intensity explosives, six detonators, 7 metre fuse wire, 18 steel ball bearings and two mobile phones. We are interrogating them, he added.        
	We are still not clear about their motive, a crime branch officer who is part of the investigation team said.         
	We are investigating how they procured the explosives and for whom. They all belong to Rulpa in Nepal.         
	The police are expected to send a team to Nepal to ascertain their background.

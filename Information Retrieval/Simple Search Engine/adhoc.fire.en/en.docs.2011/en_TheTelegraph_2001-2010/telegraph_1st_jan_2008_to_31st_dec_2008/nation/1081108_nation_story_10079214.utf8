	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The Supreme Court today described as unfortunate the recent attacks on lawyers defending terror suspects and also the practice of bar associations asking the legal fraternity to boycott such accused.         
	It is very unfortunate, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said, hearing a petition seeking the courts intervention to check the growing attacks on lawyers.         
	The petition was filed by four lawyers  Mohammed Shoaib, Jamal Ahmed, Noor Mohammad and Surendra P. Gadling  attacked recently by colleagues for attempting to defend terror accused.         
	It is the statutory right of every advocate to defend the cases of any citizen, it said.        
	The petition said the attacks, along with resolutions passed by some bar associations asking lawyers not to defend terror accused, violated the fundamental rights of citizens.         
	The resolutions also violate the rules of the Bar Council of India and the standards of professional conduct and etiquette, the petition, filed through lawyer Colin Gonsalves, said. They also discourage advocates from appearing in criminal cases where the charges relate to terrorist offences, it added.        
	The situation has become so extreme that advocates are being assaulted on the court premises and in their chambers. The constitutional right of the accused in the serial bomb blast cases is also being violated as it is the right of every citizen to have recourse to judicial process it is the right of every accused to have a legal defence, it said.

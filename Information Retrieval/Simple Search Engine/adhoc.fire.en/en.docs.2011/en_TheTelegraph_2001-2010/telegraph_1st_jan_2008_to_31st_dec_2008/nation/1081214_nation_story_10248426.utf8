	Ranchi/Giridih, Dec. 13: In an orgy of Maoists-inspired violence at least eight persons were killed in Gumla and Giridih districts last night, while two suspected Naxalites were lynched after villagers retaliated when they were threatened with levies.        
	In Gumlas Kurkura village under Kamdara police station limits, some 70km from the state capital, four persons were gunned down by Maoists. According to police reports reaching Ranchi, around seven armed men entered the village around 7.45pm and ordered one Sufal Surin to lead them to the house of Jiten Surin.        
	As soon as Jiten opened the door, they riddled him with bullets, killing him on the spot. By then, Sufal had begun to flee, but the rebels fired at him as well. He was injured, but died this morning.        
	Two passersby, one of whom was identified as Uday Surin, also died in the firing.         
	Today, angry villagers of Kurkura staged demonstrations with the bodies of the victims and demanded that chief minister Shibu Soren visit them to take stock of the situation. One person died today due to excessive bleeding. He could have been saved provided the villagers informed the police last night. Two among them were criminals, said Gumla superintendent of police Baljeet Singh.        
	In Giridih district, around 8.30pm, Maoists gunned down three men identified as Gulab Ansari, Mansoor Ansari and Matin Ansari in Dudhania village under Pirtand police station limits, around 150km from Ranchi.         
	According to villagers, the rebels believed them to be police informers, but Pirtand officer-in-charge H.E. Siddiqui maintained they were daily wage labourers and had nothing to do with passing on any type of information to the police.        
	One Keshar Yadav was shot dead near the Chaki railway station under Saria police station limits in Giridih district. Details were sketchy, but the police said the victim had a criminal background.

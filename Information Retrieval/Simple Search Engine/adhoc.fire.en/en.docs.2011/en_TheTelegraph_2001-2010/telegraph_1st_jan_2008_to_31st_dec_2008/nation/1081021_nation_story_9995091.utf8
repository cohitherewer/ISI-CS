          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 20: Revolutionary progressive parties and mass organisations today held a convention here expressing their solidarity with an agitation launched by those displaced because of major industrial projects.        
	About 36 million people, who have been or might become victims of such a mad industrialisation, would not tolerate this design of imperialist forces by remaining just mute spectators, said leaders of CPI-ML, CPI-ML (Liberation), CPI-ML (New Democracy), SUCI, Lok Shakti Abhiyan, Samajwadi Jan Parishad and Lok Pakhya.        
	The peoples movements in Orissa would like to tell everyone in clear words that any undemocratic move to evict them from their land and livelihood will be opposed tooth and nail, they said.        
	Revolutionary and progressive political forces would continue to support their struggle for survival, justice and dignity, said the leaders. They called upon all conscientious citizens of the state to be critically aware of the growing pro-company and anti-people steps to advance corporate interests and demolish genuine struggles of the suffering people.        
	If they dont support the struggles now, tomorrow they will be nowhere, said one of the revolutionary leaders. Hundreds of project-affected people, mostly tribals, participated at the mass convention and dharna.        
	They included oustees of major industrial projects promoted by Posco, ArcelorMittal, Vedanta Group, Tata Steel, Utkal Alumina and other industrial houses. The project-hit people reiterated their vow to carry on their struggle at the cost of their life.        
	Jitu Jakasika, a Dangaria Kandha youth who has been spearheading the agitation against bauxite mining and alumina refinery project of Vedanta Group on Niyamgiri Hills, said: We will carry on our struggle to save Niyamgiri at any cost.        
	Jakasika said that Dangaria Kandha youths had formed Niyamgiri Suraksha Yuva Bahini for this purpose.

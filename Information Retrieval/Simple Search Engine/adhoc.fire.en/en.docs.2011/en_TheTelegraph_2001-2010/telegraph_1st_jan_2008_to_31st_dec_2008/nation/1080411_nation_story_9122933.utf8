	New Delhi, April 10 (PTI): An MP who allegedly called a pilot a glorified driver may be sued for defamation by the Indian Commercial Pilots Association.        
	The association has accused Muslim League MP Abdul Wahab of barging into the Air India planes cockpit on Tuesday and said this amounted to breaching security and endangering flying operations.         
	The Rajya Sabha member had to step off the Kozhikode-Kochi flight after the pilot refused to fly with him on board, accusing him of arriving late and delaying take-off. Wahab has denied entering the cockpit.        
	Whatever Captain Rajat Rana has done was within his right to do so..... We want the MP to apologise, ICPA president Kapil Raina said here.

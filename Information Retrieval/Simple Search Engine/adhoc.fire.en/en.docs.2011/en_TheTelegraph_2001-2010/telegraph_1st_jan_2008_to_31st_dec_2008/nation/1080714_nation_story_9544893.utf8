  - Foreign minister showers praise on Basu, keeps door ajar        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee outside Jyoti Basus residence on Sunday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Calcutta, July 13: If Prakash Karat courted Mayavati in Delhi today, Pranab Mukherjee eulogised Jyoti Basu in Calcutta.        
	The foreign minister today called on the CPM patriarch to fulfil, according to Mukherjee, a professional as well as personal obligation.         
	In the process, he sent a political message, too, by arraying Karats anti-Congressism in sharp relief against the peace initiatives undertaken by Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet.         
	Mukherjee described Basu and Karats predecessor Surjeet as the two architects of the Left-UPA coalition that was shaped four years and two months ago.        
	I have come to meet Jyotibabu for two reasons. He was one of the architects of the Left-UPA coalition. When I took over as the leader of the coalition in the Lok Sabha, Jyotibabu asked me to see that the coalition works. So it was my moral responsibility to explain to him why the coalition could not be continued and where we failed. Today, I explained this to him, Mukherjee said. But he did not list the failures.        
	I have also come to pay my respects to him as he turned 95 on July 8. Despite our differences in political ideology, I believe Jyotibabu has made an immense contribution to the nations political life, Mukherjee added.        
	Perhaps it was a coincidence but the other high-profile guest at Basus home today was also someone who has differences with Karat: Somnath Chatterjee. The Congress has been suggesting that the party is not averse to Chatterjee continuing as Speaker.        
	Whether the government will survive or not will depend on the vote, Mukherjee said after meeting Basu.        
	The comment prompted some CPM leaders to claim that the Congress was jittery and Mukherjee had met Basu to ensure that the UPAs bridges with the Left were not burned.        
	During the one-to-one meeting at Indira Bhavan, Basu was learnt to have told Mukherjee that he had already been briefed by Karat on the reasons for the break-up between the Congress and the Left. Basu heard out Pranabbabu and told him that the decision of withdrawal had come as no mutual understanding could be reached, an aide to the CPM veteran said.        
	CPM leaders feel that Mukherjee, known to be close to the Left, had a personal point to make through his visit to Basus house. He underlined his personal rapport with the Left in the hope that the equations may be different after the general election and his contacts will be helpful for the Congress to approach us, a CPM central committee member said.        
	Mukherjee later visited information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who is now recuperating in a city hospital from a heart ailment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pappu Yadav                                  
	New Delhi, July 17: The CPM appears to believe that a jailed MPs vote is tainted, unless he votes for the Lefts candidate.        
	The CPM politburo today attacked the Congress for seeking the support of convicted MPs in the trust vote lined up on July 22.        
	Among those the party referred to are two Rashtriya Janata Dal members, Pappu Yadav and Mohammed Shahabuddin, both of whom voted for UPA-Left nominee Pratibha Patil in last years presidential poll.        
	While legally they (the convicted MPs) may get the right to attend Parliament and vote, there is a question of political morality involved. The Congress leadership will be seen by the entire country as taking recourse to convicted criminals for sustaining their government, a politburo statement said.        
	Apart from Pappu, convicted of the murder of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar, and Shahabuddin, the statement named Lok Janshakti Party MP Suraj Bhan.        
	When reminded that Pappu and Shahabuddin had voted in the presidential election, CPM leader Nilotpal Basu said his party was only talking about convicted MPs.        
	We will check whether the situation was the same during the President election as it is now, he told reporters.

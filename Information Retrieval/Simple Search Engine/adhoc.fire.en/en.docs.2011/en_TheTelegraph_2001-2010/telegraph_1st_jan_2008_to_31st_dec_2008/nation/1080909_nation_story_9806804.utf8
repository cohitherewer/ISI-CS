          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Congress has told the Samajwadi Party that the two could fight 90 per cent of the Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh jointly and have friendly contests in 10 per cent.        
	The formula  proposed by Rahul Gandhi, Digvijay Singh and Rita Bahuguna Joshi when they met Amar Singh and Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party  was evolved after the Congress realised forfeiting the 10-odd seats it listed as prestigious to the Samajwadis would be politically untenable.         
	Some of these seats are held by the Samajwadi Party but we cannot ignore the claims of our senior leaders at the same time, said Joshi, the Uttar Pradesh Congress president.        
	The seats in question include Farukkhabad, which Joshis predecessor Salman Khurshid nursed for the past four years, Rampur, Moradabad, Salempur, Pratapgarh and Domariaganj. The Samajwadi leaders said they would speak to party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and get back.

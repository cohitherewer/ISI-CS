	New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): Delhi High Court today equated the Centres move to dismiss a railway hospital doctor without giving him a hearing with that of a kangaroo court.        
	This is a classic case of injustice done by the government authority. Its like court martial where you have taken action without giving an opportunity to the affected party to be heard. Its like a kangaroo court, a division bench headed by Chief Justice A.P. Shah said.        
	The court was hearing a government petition challenging a single-bench order that had directed it to reinstate Dr Manoj Singhania who had been working with Northern Railway Central Hospital.        
	We find the action was completely arbitrary and needs to be set aside. What would happen to his career? You should have fairness in the inquiry, the bench said.        
	The government counsel, however, expressed reservation on the impression the judges had formed and said there had been several complaints against the doctor.        
	We have formed the opinion after going through the records, and if a judge does not get impressed after seeing the records then he is not fit for the office, the bench said.        
	The government counsel again contended that many patients and doctors of the hospital had filed complaints against Singhania. The action was taken against the doctor after a fact-finding committee found the allegation against him was true, he said.        
	The bench, after going through the records, found that the inquiry committees proceedings were not transparent. Show us just one complaint filed against the doctor. If he is not fit, then there has to be some proper procedure to take action against him. But in this case you conducted inquiry without involving the affected party, the court said.        
	The bench proceeded to dismiss the petition but agreed to hear the case after the Centre said it would allow Singhania to practise in the hospital till the case was pending.

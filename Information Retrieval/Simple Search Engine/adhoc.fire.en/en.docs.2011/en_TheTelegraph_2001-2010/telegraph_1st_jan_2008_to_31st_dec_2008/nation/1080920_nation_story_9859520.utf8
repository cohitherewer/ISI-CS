          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Papia Ghosh                                  
	Patna, Sept. 19: The trial court today awarded death sentence to one of the five convicted in the murder of Patna University professor Papia Ghosh and her maid in December 2006.        
	While Shankar Sahu would go to the gallows, Manohar Kumar, Asish Kumar and Anil Oraon  held guilty under Sections 396 and 412 of the Indian Penal Code  have been awarded life term in jail.        
	Judge Omprakash also gave advocate Ramchandra Mahto  guilty under Section 414 of the IPC  two years of rigorous imprisonment. But the advocate prayed for bail, which the court granted.         
	Lawyers said that the courts usually consider the bail petition of a person awarded punishment for two years or less to let him challenge the verdict in higher courts.        
	The cold-blooded murder of Papia had evoked strong reaction in the academic circle across the country.         
	Papia, unmarried, was living with her maid Malti Devi in the house built by her late IAS officer father Ujjwal Kumar Ghosh in Pataliputra colony here.         
	Her two sisters are settled abroad while the third sister, Tuktuk, is the officer-on-special-duty to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.        
	The verdict in less than two years in the sensational case drew wide praise for the police and judicial process today. The prosecution did a praiseworthy job by picking the real offenders, senior lawyer Rajniti Prasad said.

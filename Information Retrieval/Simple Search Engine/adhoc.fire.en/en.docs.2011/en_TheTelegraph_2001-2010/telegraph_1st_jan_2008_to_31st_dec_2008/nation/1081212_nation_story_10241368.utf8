The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gaya goes to techie for treatment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gaya goes to techie for treatment
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Dec. 11: Not many would imagine an engineer playing a doctors role and treating patients or taking care of the health of half-a-million people in a township.         
	However, evidently the Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) can, as the civic body has appointed a mechanical engineer as its medical health officer.         
	Ever since former health officer B.N. Sharma retired, Ashok Singh, a mechanical engineer has taken up the mantle of maintaining public health.         
	As Jai Kumar Palit, the former Gaya MLA, explained, the job of the health officer includes conducting health check-ups and immunisation drives, treating corporation employees, maintaining sanitation norms and preventing the outbreak of epidemics along with issuing birth and death certificates.         
	Usually, medical graduates with specialisation in preventive and social medicine (at a degree level) are qualified as health officers.        
	Gaya Municipal Corporation imposes a health tax on 40,000 (approximately) households in lieu of providing them health services. This money is also supposed to be spent on maintaining public health and for salaries of health officials.        
	When contacted Gayas deputy mayor Mohan Srivastava confirmed that post-retirement the civic body had appointed an engineer to the post of the medical and health officer.         
	But, we have taken up the matter with the government and a regular officer would be appointed soon, he said.         
	Municipal commissioner Rai Madan Kishore, too, assured that the apparent incongruity would end soon and said the urban development department has decided to depute the district additional chief medical officer as the health officer.         
	He also said that a notification to this effect would be issued shortly.        
	Talking to the reporter, Ashok Singh, the techie-cum-caretaker admitted that he was only performing a part of the officers job and was only monitoring towns sanitation norms.         
	The birth and death certificates are being issued by the municipal commissioner. Food samples and hygiene are being tested in public eateries by the civil surgeon, Singh said.        
	Despite Singhs assurance of not really being in-charge, some residents, such as Shree Bhagvan of Mustafabad, believes that 40,000 households are being cheated of their right to healthcare despite paying up taxes.         
	The health officer could perhaps recommend an iron-rich diet of nuts and bolts he added, as an afterthought.

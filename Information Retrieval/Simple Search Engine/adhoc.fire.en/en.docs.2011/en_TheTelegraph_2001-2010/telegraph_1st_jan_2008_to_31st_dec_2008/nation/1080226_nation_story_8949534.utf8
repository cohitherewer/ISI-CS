The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Guard glare on Valley leaders
                                                                                                               Guard glare on Valley leaders
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                         Ghulam Nabi Azad            Farooq Abdullah            Mufti Mohammad Sayeed            Omar Abdullah      
	Srinagar, Feb. 25: The five most heavily protected leaders in Jammu and Kashmir are accused of keeping their security officers on the edge by frequently risking their lives.        
	Elections are scheduled in the state this year.        
	Officers say chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, his predecessors Farooq Abdullah and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and their political heirs, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, mix with crowds and hold public meetings in a way where they could be targeted far too easily.        
	They are among the most well guarded in the country, too.        
	The list of protected men has been growing ever since militancy erupted in Kashmir in 1989. The previous government, of the National Conference, created an elite commando force, the Special Securities Group, for the states VIPs.        
	With offices at Jammu, Srinagar and Delhi, the group has now grown to a 600-strong force tasked with protecting the five politicians.        
	In most rallies, they participate in roadshows, mingle with people or go on surprise visits despite clear-cut directions against doing these things.        
	They are supposed to give us advance information about their rallies so that we can sanitise the area, but they intimate us at the eleventh hour, a senior SSG officer said.        
	Of the five, the chief minister is involved in more than 50 violations a year but that number is the lowest.        
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti commits a breach every second day. This is happening despite intelligence reports that attacks on politicians will increase ahead of elections.        
	Mehbooba denies breaking the rules.        
	If I have to go to four adjoining villages, I mention one because it is not possible to furnish the names of all. Even when I am talking to people in my constituency, they call it a roadshow but I do not know what they mean, she said.         
	SSG officials insist all details must be furnished. If we have sanitised one village, something untoward can happen in another, an officer said.         
	Last year, the PDP chief gave her security personnel a slip and travelled to Anantnag district, merely to rebuff Azad who had challenged her party leaders to give up security before demanding troop reductions in the state.        
	Others also give their protectors the jitters.        
	Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah often slips past security to play golf or walk in the middle of Srinagar, an official said.        
	Chief minister Azad, in addition to the SSG cover, is about to get National Security Guard protection. The move follows intelligence reports that militants could target him at public rallies.         
	True to the fears, the violations have proved dangerous sometimes.        
	Omar Abdullah was attacked twice in the past two years  in Anantnag and Handwara.        
	On both occasions, the officers claim they werent given advance information about his programmes.         
	Headed by an inspector-general of police, the special securities group force is fully equipped with modern gadgets and sophisticated jammers for the protection of the vulnerable five.         
	We have eight jammers, three of which have been given to district police. But at times they dont travel with these devices, the official said.

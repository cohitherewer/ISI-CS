	Mangaldoi/Guwahati, Dec. 23: An official of a tea estate owned by McLeod Russel was shot dead by suspected militants in a garden near the India-Bhutan border in Assams Udalguri district today.         
	Gautam Kotoki, 45, deputy manager of Coramoor tea estate, was shot at point-blank range around noon. His body was found on a wooden bridge with bullet injuries in the head. The killers took away his bike.        
	Kotoki leaves behind his wife and two children.A company official said he was not aware of any extortion demand. I dont know why they killed Kotoki, he said.        
	Coramoor, about 180km from Guwahati, is one of six gardens owned by McLeod Russel, one of the largest tea producers in the world, in Udalguri. The company, which has 47 gardens in Assam, produces about 70 million kilograms of tea every year.         
	McLeod Russel has been expanding its business in Assam for the past few years.        
	Kotoki is the second McLeod Russel executive to have been killed by militants in Assam. In the early 1990s, the manager of Romai tea estate in Dibrugarh district was shot dead by suspected Ulfa militants. The estate has since changed hands.         
	Udalguri superintendent of police A.K. Tiwari said Kotoki was shot while he was returning from an awareness meeting on cleanliness held for the labourers in Section 1 of the tea estate. He was probably stopped by gunmen near the wooden bridge on a garden road and shot from close range, Tiwari said. Two employees of the garden, P. Tirki and S. Basumatary, who were moving ahead of Kotoki, heard gunshots and turned back to find him lying blood-splattered.         
	Tiwari said the police had no clue about the killers.         
	Sources said the Adivasi National Liberation Army could be behind the incident since it had a presence in these areas.

	Mumbai, May 3 (PTI): Abu Salem was taken to hospital today for a check-up after he complained of a backache. The gangster, who faces terrorism charges, cannot be taken out of prison except on medical grounds.         
	Salem is accused of supplying arms to others involved in the 1993 Bombay blasts and participating in the conspiracy to carry out the explosions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stop-work threat to airports again
                                                                                                               Stop-work threat to airports again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TROUBLE BREWING?                                  
	New Delhi, March 10: Airport Authority of India employees have threatened to stop or delay work from March 12 unless plans to shut down the old Hyderabad and Bangalore airports are deferred by three months.        
	We have decided not to cooperate... that means we wont be working from midnight tomorrow (Tuesday-Wednesday), P.K. Tyagi, the vice-president of the airport employees union, said.        
	The decision followed a deadlock in talks between government officials led by civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla, union representatives and Left leaders.        
	The workers have called for a non-cooperation movement from March 12, Dipankar Mukherjee, the CPM MP and union leader who led the employees in the negotiations, said.         
	Citu leader M.K. Pandhe and CPM MP Amitabha Nandi were also present during the talks.        
	Key operations like air-traffic control, aviation engineering, security, ground handling and baggage are not in the AAIs hands but since its employees are in charge of maintenance, the protest could lead to filthy airports.        
	Government officials tried to explain that there was no shutdown plan, though commercial flights would have to use the new airports built with private investment.         
	The old airports, run by the government-owned AAI, would be used for private flights, engineering and other aviation-related purposes after the new ones were opened, the officials added.        
	Minister Praful Patel called Left leaders to explain the governments position, a civil aviation ministry official said.        
	The employees said they had no option but to resort to a strike under a different name  possibly to avoid court glare  after the government refused to budge from its plan to stop commercial traffic to the old airports. The new ones will open on March 14 and 16.         
	The AAIs turf has been shrinking over the years. It does not run Delhi and Mumbai airports, two of the busiest in the country, and any strike or protest elsewhere does not impact the two hubs directly.         
	On February 25, the airport employees union had put off its planned strike after Patel promised to hold more rounds of talks on their problems, including those related to Hyderabad and Bangalore.        
	Last week, a parliamentary committee on transport suggested to the government that the old airports in the two cities should not be shut down.         
	The recommendations were seen as a shot in the arm for the AAI employees. The panel said the government should renegotiate with private players to scrap or modify clauses that allow shutting down of airports.

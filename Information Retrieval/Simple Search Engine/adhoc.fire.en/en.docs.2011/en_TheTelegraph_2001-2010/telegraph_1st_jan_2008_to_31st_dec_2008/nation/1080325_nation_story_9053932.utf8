The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cheat charge stares at Dalmiya
                                                                                                               Cheat charge stares at Dalmiya
  - BCCI ex-boss diverted 1996 Cup funds for personal use, say cops        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Dalmiya and Pawar                                       
	Mumbai, March 24: Police are set to file a chargesheet against former cricket boss Jagmohan Dalmiya over alleged misappropriation of funds pertaining to the 1996 World Cup played in the subcontinent.        
	The economic offences wing of Mumbai police today said it had evidence that Dalmiya diverted money from a BCCI bank account in Calcutta meant for paying legal fees towards other expenses, including footing personal phone bills.        
	The wing was acting on an FIR filed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in March 2006 alleging siphoning of Rs 21.74 lakh from the bank account, which was opened when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka jointly hosted the 1996 World Cup.         
	The probe shows the money involved could be more.         
	We have ascertained there has been cheating of over Rs 2.9 crore which includes phone bills worth Rs 85 lakh. We will file a chargesheet against Dalmiya and two others on Wednesday, joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria said.         
	The two others to be named in the chargesheet are Gautam Dutta, owner of a firm S.K. Traders, and Dalmiyas secretary Kishen Choudhary. Neither could be reached for comment.        
	The wings officials said their two-year investigation showed that Dalmiya had paid bills for eight telephones from the account (No. 1223) at the Bhowanipore branch of Indian Overseas Bank. Three of these belonged to Dalmiyas business firms, and a fourth was registered in his mothers name. Telephone bills totalling Rs 85 lakh were paid from this account, they said.        
	The probe further showed that payments worth Rs 39 lakh were made to S.K. Traders floated by Dutta for the purchase of stationery and supply of taxis for the cricket board, but the firm could not support the expenses with any documents. Neither did it have papers to establish that it was indeed a firm that supplied stationery or transport.         
	Though the officials refused to give details of other expenses, they said the rest of the amount was spent on Dalmiyas personal travel, hotel bills and transport.        
	The former cricket boss refused to comment on hypothetical statements. I will revert if a chargesheet is filed and a copy of it is served on me, he said in a media release.        
	A PTI report quoted Dalmiya as saying it was an old game by his adversaries to settle scores. Whenever something happens in cricket politics, they resort to such action to settle scores with me, he said.         
	BCCI chief Sharad Pawar denied the charge. I have been in public life and personal relationships are always cordial. If someone does something wrong, then the law has to take its course, he said in New Delhi.        
	The FIR, lodged with the Marine Drive police station by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah on March 16, 2006, had alleged that Dalmiya and his associates  former secretary S.K. Nair, treasurers Kishore Rungta and Jyoti Bajpai, Kishen Choudhary and some bank officials  had colluded to siphon off Rs 21.74 lakh from the BCCI account. The FIR charged them under Sections 420 (cheating), 408 (criminal breach of trust), and 120-B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.        
	No evidence has so far been found against the others, the wings officials said.        
	According to the FIR, the account was operated single-handedly by Dalmiya till it was closed on February 4, 2006, though he was removed as the authorised signatory on January 23 that year.         
	It mentioned that Dalmiya had given a break-up of the amount of Rs 21.74 lakh. The FIR says Dalmiya had claimed to have spent Rs 9.37 lakh on travel, Rs 7.26 lakh on hotel bills, Rs 2.11 lakh on telephone charges, Rs 2.29 lakh on transport and Rs 70,000 on sundry expenses.         
	The FIR said BCCI rules did not allow its members expenses for conveyance, telephone, lodging and boarding. Hence, Dalmiya had committed misappropriation, it alleged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gaming billionaire pleads guilty
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gaming billionaire pleads guilty
          AMIT ROY                                           Dikshit: In trouble          
	London, Dec. 17: Anurag Dikshit, who founded PartyGaming with his IIT Delhi   batchmate, Vikrant Bhargava, in 1995, yesterday agreed to pay a fine of $300 million   in three instalments to the US department of justice (DoJ) after admitting he had   broken American laws which prohibit online gambling. 
    Dikshit rsquo;s lawyers did not contest the morality of the laws although America   wallows in gambling and holds up Las Vegas as the symbol of the ldquo;get lucky, get   rich quick rdquo; culture. 
    Many critics of the laws believe that the US authorities are not so much against   gambling as outsiders making money from something which they consider to be   exclusively their province. 
    ldquo;However, Anurag Dikshit has agreed to settle because he wants the DoJ off his 
  back, rdquo; said an insider. 
    
	By agreeing to pay the fine and appearing contrite, Dikshit, who lives in Gibral
  tar for tax reasons, hopes to avoid a two-year jail sentence. In any case, the sentence 
  has been put off for two years so there does appear to be a good chance he will avoid 
  going to prison. 
    Although no longer a director in the UK-listed PartyGaming, probably the 
  world rsquo;s most successful online gambling company, he remains its biggest share
  holder with a 27 per cent stake. He has become rich in the process with Forbes mag
  azine putting an estimate on Dikshit rsquo;s personal wealth last year at $1.6 billion. 
    He made pound;420 million when the company was floated in 2005 and a further pound;65.7 
  million when he sold another batch of shares the following year. He also received a 
  dividend of $64 million that year.
    PartyGaming says the decision taken by Dikshit after a two-year battle has no 
  relevance for the company which is conducting a separate set of negotiations with 
  the DoJ. It is hoping to settle the dispute by paying a fine but a smaller one than that 
  agreed by Dikshit. 
    
	The department of justice seems intent on making an example of Dikshit, who 
  covered himself metaphorically with sackcloth and ashes when he appeared in the 
  Southern District Court of New York yesterday. 
    Dikshit read out his statement: ldquo;I came to believe there was a high probability 
  that the company rsquo;s business was illegal under US laws. I acknowledge my actions 
  and have come to believe that what I did was wrong. rdquo; 
    
	Afterwards neither a smiling Dikshit (the Financial Times once remarked he 
  ldquo;always smiles a lot when he talks rdquo;) nor his lawyer Mark Pomerantz would make 
  any comment. 
    
	Dikshit, who has already paid $100 million, will pay another $100 million within 
  three months and the final instalment before September 30, 2009. He also agreed to 
  co-operate with the department of justice. 
    
	Judge Jed Rakoff set his sentencing date for two years from Tuesday and could 
  penalise Dikshit with up to two years in prison and a year of supervised release. US 
  prosecutors indicated they might eventually submit a letter to the judge asking for 
  leniency at sentencing. 
    In a statement to the stock exchange in London yesterday, the company said: 
  ldquo;The company rsquo;s discussions with the DoJ have made good progress and it is cur
  rently negotiating the final terms of a possible settlement with the DoJ. Whilst 
  these discussions are at an advanced stage, the terms of any settlement have not yet 
  been finalised and there can be no guarantee that an agreement will be reached be
  tween the company and the DoJ. rdquo; 
    Online gambling was made illegal by the US Congress two years ago. Some of 
  the reasons seem sensible. 
    There is concern that children will have easy access and that it is difficult to 
  check whether the operators are always honest. There is worry, too, about whether 
  online gambling will become addictive. However, gambling flourishes in the US 
  and betting on horses is allowed online. 
    
	Many think the real reason for banning online gambling has more to do with 
  the fear that the money that the US authorities make by taxing gambling will plum
  met if more people do so on the Net. In the industry, there is scepticism about 
  whether the US authorities can prevent online gambling. 
    ldquo;They are putting the responsibility on the financial services sector who make 
  the actual payments but 400 billion cheques are made in the US every year mdash; you 
  can make your payments into an account which passes on the money to the online 
  gambling company mdash; it rsquo;s very difficult to control, rdquo; one industry source pointed 
  out. 
    PartyGaming rsquo;s online gambling operations are run from Gibraltar where it is 
  licensed and regulated while the proprietary technology behind its games is developed in India.

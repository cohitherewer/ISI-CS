          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 15: Chief minister M. Karunanidhi today ordered a judicial probe into the alleged tapping of the Tamil Nadu chief secretarys phone amid Opposition claims that the purported transcript had revealed a plot to target Jayalalithaa.        
	The transcript, published by a newspaper yesterday, purportedly shows the official advising a top police officer on how to go about probing the ADMK leaders alleged share transactions in a tea garden.        
	The DMK government had yesterday denied that state intelligence had tapped L.K. Tripathys phone. Today, as the Assembly opened after a holiday, the Opposition was in uproar. Karunanidhi said a retired high court judge would probe who had taped the purported conversation and how it had reached a newspaper.        
	The chief minister argued that anyone, even a man of unstable mind, could tap a phone today thanks to scientific advancement.         
	He added that the reported conversation related to routine administrative matters.        
	The alleged conversation between Tripathy and additional director-general S.K. Upadhyaya is about an encroachment case against Kodanad tea estate, but relates to an angle involving Jayalalithaa.        
	The ADMK leader is said to have sold her shares in the garden before the May 2006 Assembly polls  so she would not have to show them in her nomination papers  and then bought them again.        
	According to the transcript, Tripathy tells Upadhyaya, who heads the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption, to ask the income-tax department to look into the source of funds in Jayalalithaas alleged cash transactions.        
	Karunanidhi said: Even assuming someone has taped the conversation the contents are not anti-national or illegal or detrimental to the states interests.

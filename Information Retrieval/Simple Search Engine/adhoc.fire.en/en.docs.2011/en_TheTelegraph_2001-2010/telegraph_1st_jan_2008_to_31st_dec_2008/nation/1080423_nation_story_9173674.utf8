	Patna, April 22: The Bihar unit of Imarat-e-Sharia, a body that regulates the ethics of the Muslim community, has asked newly nominated excise minister Jamshed Ashraf to get his department changed when the latter went to seek the Sharias blessings.        
	Kalam Paak (Quran) does not allow a Muslim to deal with liquor, said chief cleric Haji Mohammad Nizamuddin, adding: Aap waqif hain ke sharab Islam mein haram hai (You are aware that liquor is a taboo in Islam).         
	Ashraf, who became minister for the first time, is finding it hard to relinquish his prize throne. He, however, has communicated the clerics diktat to Nitish Kumar.        
	Bihar chief minister is said to have furnished his own logic.         
	Ashrafs department is called the excise and prohibition department. Therefore, he will be enforcing what his religion professes. If the minister helps the government to raise revenue, he will help the poor. This, too, will be keeping in with the Islamic tenet to help the poor, he said.        
	Ashraf seems more inclined to work according to his chief ministers wishes rather than clerics diktat.         
	Nitishji is my leader. Islam also prescribes that a faithful must respect his leaders command. I am duty bound to do what my leader desires, Ashraf said, in his defence.

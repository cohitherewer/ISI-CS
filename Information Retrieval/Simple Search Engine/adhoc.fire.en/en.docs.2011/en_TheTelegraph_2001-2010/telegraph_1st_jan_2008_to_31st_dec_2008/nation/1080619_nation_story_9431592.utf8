          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, June 18: A day after the ouster of the panchayat presidents, the Congress today alleged that it was politics and not poor progress that led to their removal.         
	People of Gunderdehi, Rajpur and Nawagarh nagar panchayats yesterday created history by toppling presidents of their respective civic bodies by exercising the rights bestowed under the Nagar Palika Act to recall elected representatives.         
	Under Section 47 (recall of the president) of Chhattisgarh Nagar Palika Adhiniyam-1961, elections may be sought to recall representatives if three-fourth of the total number of corporators write to the collector stating that their president has lost their confidence.         
	In Durg and Sarguja blocks, corporators of three panchayats launched campaigns against the presidents in the name of progress.         
	Corporators blamed the presidents for obstructing development works and affecting progress, a senior official with the state poll panel told The Telegraph.         
	Due to provisions in the act, authorities were left with no option than to accept the proposals and conduct elections to recall the presidents. But at the ground level, perhaps it was politics and not progress that played the decisive role.         
	The two women presidents, Bharti Sonkar of Gunderdehi and Khoren Khalko of Rajpur Nagar Panchayat, had the backing of the Congress, the main Opposition in the state.

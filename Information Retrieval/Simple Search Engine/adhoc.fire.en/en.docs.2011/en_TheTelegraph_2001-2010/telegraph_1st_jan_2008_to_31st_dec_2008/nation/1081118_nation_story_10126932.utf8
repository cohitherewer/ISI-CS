	 Mumbai, Nov. 17 (PTI): Bombay High Court today revoked the showcause notice issued to actress Sushmita Sen in a Land Cruiser import case, saying there was no evidence about her involvement in any scam.           
	Sushmita bought the vehicle in 2005, but soon the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai sought a penalty of Rs 23 lakh for allegedly evading customs duty.                  
	Bhopal (PTI): A body has been found with its head severed near the under-construction Shiv Hanuman temple, raising suspicion of human sacrifice.

	Bangalore (PTI): Karnataka labour minister B.N. Bacchegowda said on Monday he has been receiving threat calls after he made certain allegations against former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and his sons. Bacchegowda had held Deve Gowda responsible for dividing the Vokkaliga community and desertion of front-ranking leaders from the party.                  
	 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has directed the Maharashtra home secretary to give a hearing to the producers of Deshdrohi, banned by the state government, and pass a fresh order by November 20. The ban on the film, produced and directed by actor Kamaal Khan, had been banned on the ground that it could create unrest.

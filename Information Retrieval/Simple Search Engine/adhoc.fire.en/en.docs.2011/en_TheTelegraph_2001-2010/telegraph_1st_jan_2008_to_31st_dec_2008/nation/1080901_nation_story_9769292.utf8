  - No one to drive high-tech vehicles for clearing Cuttack garbage          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Garbage being removed at a hospital, but Cuttack is yet to see such drives                                        
	Cuttack, Aug. 31: Thirty high-tech pick-up vehicles, including 22 auto tippers, five trucks with hydraulic tippers, two skid-steer loaders and a backhoe loader meant for transporting garbage have been sitting idle as the civic administration has no one to operate them.         
	Orissa government had provided them to Cuttack Municipal Corporation last year for collection and smooth disposal of solid waste.        
	The inactivity surfaced in Orissa High Court during a scrutiny of an affidavit filed by Cuttack Municipal Corporation authorities after an order was issued at a PIL hearing in the past week.        
	While the court ordered for the affidavit to be kept on record, Cuttack Municipal Corporation counsel S.K. Nayak was asked to appoint operators on casual basis for the use of the vehicles and equipment before the court takes up the PIL for hearing on September 4, 2008.        
	This arrangement shall continue till necessary approval is accorded by the government for appointment of operators on a regular basis, stated the two-judge bench of Justices Laxmikanta Mohapatra and Indrajit Mohanty in an interim order.        
	Presently, Cuttack Municipal Corporation manages to collect less than 60 per cent of the nearly 500 tonnes of the citys waste generated in a day and dumps them in 62 locations along the citys fringes. A large load is disposed into the Mahanadi.        
	What enraged the court further, was the dilly-dallying over the decision to put into effect a single-point garb- age yard by the civic administration. On March 5, the high court had fixed April 30 as the deadline to decide on a single-point system. The civic body was expected to adopt a centralised system from May 1.        
	Though the Cuttack collector had allotted 30 acres at Chakradharpur in Barang block for this purpose, Cuttack Municipal Corporation is yet to use it because of difficulties. Taking note of the problems, the high court postponed the deadline to September 20 for the construction of a boundary wall and warned that there would be no further extension of time.        
	Initially work was not possible due to opposition from residents. But a part of the boundary wall has since then been constructed. It would need another month to complete it, said mayor Nibedita Pradhan.

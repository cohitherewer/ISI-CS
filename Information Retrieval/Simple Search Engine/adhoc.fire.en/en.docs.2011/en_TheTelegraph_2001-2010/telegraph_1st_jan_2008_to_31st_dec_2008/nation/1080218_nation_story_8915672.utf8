                                                                                                               Kidney kin in custody
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The CBI today arrested Jeevan Raut, the brother of alleged kidney-racket mastermind Amit Kumar, in the heart of the capital.        
	The 36-year-old Raut, apparently a medical degree holder, is accused of using contacts in hospitals to get clients for the organ transplant racket.        
	He is also accused of bribing police officers and striking deals with local strongmen to keep his brothers cross-country operations free from trouble with the law.        
	Raut was arrested from near the India Habitat Centre on Lodhi Road and taken to the CBI headquarters less than a kilometre away.         
	It was not clear how the CBI tracked Raut down but the agency has been working on his parents and other relatives to convince him to help the agency.        
	Rauts brother Kumar was caught from a jungle resort in Nepal on February 7.         
	Reports of a second man fleeing had fanned speculation that Raut may be hiding in Nepal.         
	But Kumar told police that his brother was still in India. An Interpol notice was in circulation to facilitate the arrest of Raut.        
	The two brothers are now likely to be made to answer questions face to face to help the CBI piece together how the transplant racket started and thrived.        
	A senior Delhi police officer associated with the case before it was handed over to the CBI said: His interrogation is likely to assist in identifying many others in the police or even in politics who helped Kumar and his friends evade the law.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, May 27: Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury today threatened legal action against top Uttar Pradesh police officers for allegedly defaming Noida schoolgirl Aarushi Talwar, who was found murdered in her home.         
	Chowdhury said she would ask Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati to punish the police officers for character assassination of a girl who is not even alive to defend herself.         
	Explaining possible motives behind the twin murders of Aarushi and household help Hemraj, inspector-general, Meerut, Gurdarshan Singh had said the girls father had found the two in an objectionable but not compromising position.         
	Brij Lal, a senior officer of the Uttar Pradesh special task force, had also in a media briefing indicated that Aarushi and Hemraj were involved in a relationship. Aarushis father Rajesh Talwar is the prime accused in the case.         
	Choosing the controversial words used by Singh to attack the police officer, Chowdhury said: I find his behaviour both objectionable and compromising.         
	Speaking to reporters at her residence this evening, she said her ministry was considering charging Singh under Indian Penal Code Sections 499 and 509 concerning defamation of a deceased person.         
	Earlier in the day, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights faxed a letter to the director-general of Uttar Pradesh police, asking for an explanation for his juniors comments. The apex child rights panel has given the top cop 15 days to reply.         
	We, as a commission, are shocked that such language was used by a senior police officer on television against a minor girl... that too, someone who is dead, Sandhya Bajaj, a member of the child rights panel, said.         
	Chowdhury clarified her ministry would not interfere in the investigations. But we will not allow people, especially police officers, to get away with such language. I find it despicable. Our intervention is not just about Aarushi, but for all children and women, she said.         
	Chowdhury said she was confident that Mayavati, as a woman, will not tolerate this kind of behaviour.         
	The CPMs womens wing, the All India Democratic Womens Association, also wrote to Mayavati today demanding action against the police officers.

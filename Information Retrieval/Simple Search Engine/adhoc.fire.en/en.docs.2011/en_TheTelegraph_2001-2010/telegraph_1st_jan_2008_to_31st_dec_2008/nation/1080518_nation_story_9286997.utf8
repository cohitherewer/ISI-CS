The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tyson the tragic hero at Cannes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tyson the tragic hero at Cannes
          AMIT ROY                          Tyson at Cannes on Friday                                  
	Cannes, May 17: Mike Tyson, the 41-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion, looked visibly nervous last night when he appeared before a warmly appreciative audience at the Cannes film festival where a documentary on his troubled life, Tyson, was screened in the Un Certain Regard competition.        
	Standing next to the documentarys director, James Toback, who has made a sympathetic film using 30 hours of interviews with the boxer, Tyson appeared moved by the sustained applause when he came on stage both before and after the screening.        
	Once nicknamed Iron Mike and The Baddest Man on the Planet, his voice now was soft as he said simply: I am humbled.         
	The big man, who seemed to be almost as broad as he was tall, looked as though he meant it. Tyson, who now has a Maori tattoo around his left eye, had flown to the French Riviera from his suburban Las Vegas home with a sizeable entourage for the premiere of Tyson.        
	Perhaps the documentary could inspire similar films on sports personalities who are hugely talented but also deeply flawed in some way.         
	When it comes to being the bad boy of Indian cricket, Harbhajan Singh, banned for five ODIs for slapping S. Sreesanth, is not quite in the same category as Tyson, but he could do worse than get hold of a DVD of Tyson.        
	There could be redemption yet for Bhajji, for the audience in the large Debussy theatre appeared to be with Toback when he described Tyson as a complex and iconic and noble human being.        
	In fact, the documentary could serve as a model for other sports giants, for Toback allows the boxer to tell his own story, mixing the interviews with carefully selected footage of the highs and lows of a remarkable career.         
	There is no reason why some enterprising filmmaker should not make an ever better documentary called, say, Sachin or The Prince of Calcutta.        
	Tyson stood on stage last night, wearing a buttoned-down shiny grey suit. He was escorted in by heavies as though he was entering a ring but for the boxer this was all unfamiliar territory. Im an athlete and this is totally out of my field here  its kind of intimidating, he admitted at one point.         
	Normally, Tyson has allowed his fist to do the talking but last night he had to make a little speech and it was obvious his words came straight from the heart.        
	I greatly appreciate the welcome I received here, began Tyson. I havent ever had an experience like this in my whole career  I was on my way to rehab, an AAA meeting and James called me and told me how this could be a really great work. I never believed it.        
	He said: I had no idea that it would come to this kind of spirit for a film. I had a great deal of trust and I believed in James and once we decided to do this programme, I decided to be totally honest with him and thank you very much for coming today.        
	Toback, who had Tysons confidence because he has known the boxer for many years, explained: Its a Greek tragedy in the sense you have somebody who starts with nothing, from very humble origins to put it mildly, who goes on to reach heights that are inconceivable, and then crashes through his own hubris.

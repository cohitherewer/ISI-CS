  - Chief proud of responsible policeman          SUBRAT DAS                          Pandas body being taken for post-mortem                                        
	Nayagarh, Feb. 17: A pall of gloom has descended on the residence of 48-year-old havildar Satrughna Panda, who died on Friday night while putting up a brave fight against Maoists.        
	His 43-year-old widow is inconsolable. I cant live without him, she said with tears rolling down her cheeks.        
	Panda has left behind his wife, son and a married daughter, who were staying with him on the Police Training School campus, about 2km from Nayagarh town.         
	His son is unemployed and his daughter has been staying with them after she had marital discord, said the family members.        
	Havildar Chaturbhuja Sahu, a long-time colleague of Panda, said he was on duty along with Panda on that fateful night. We were on the duty post and talking with each other, when we heard a bang. We saw a minibus knocked the main gate and entered into the campus. A group of people jumped out of the vehicle and started firing at the duty post. We retaliated immediately.        
	A few minutes later, bullet hit him and he collapsed. After the bullets were exhausted, I ran for cover. But I was surrounded by some rebels who asked me to lie down and surrender, said Chaturbhuja, who bore injury marks on his body and bloodstains on his khaki trouser.        
	We have worked together for many years. Now he will be no more with me, said Chaturbhuja.        
	Reserve inspector Juria Behera said Panda was a dedicated policeman. He never shirked from his responsibility. I am proud of Panda and three other colleagues who fought bravely, said Behera.        
	The three others were drill sub-inspector Somnath Swain (55), havildar Rajkishore Pradhan (43) and recruit constable R. Ekka (22).

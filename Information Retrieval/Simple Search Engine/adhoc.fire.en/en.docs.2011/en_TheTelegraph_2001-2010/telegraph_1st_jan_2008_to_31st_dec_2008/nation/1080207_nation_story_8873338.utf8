          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Amitabh with Aishwarya at Jaipur airport on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Feb. 6: B the boss to AB  ignore the stupid allegations.        
	Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray today sprang to Amitabh Bachchans defence and advised him to ignore the accusation of bias for home state Uttar Pradesh.        
	The allegation, levelled by nephew and breakaway Sena leader Raj, was nothing but stupidity, Thackeray said in a statement. Amitabh is Amitabh. He should ignore such allegations.        
	The 82-year-old leader said Amitabh was a family friend. The friendship goes back 40 years. Bachchan has always expressed his gratitude to Mumbai for giving him fame.        
	The comments capped a bad day for Raj, who saw over 200 workers of his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) go back to their parent party, handing the rebel leaders estranged cousin Uddhav the upper hand in their public relations war.        
	The exodus came on a day Mumbai police told Raj to restrain his cadre or face arrest over the violence unleashed across Maharashtra following his comments against outsiders.        
	In Delhi, home minister Shivraj Patil asked the Vilasrao Deshmukh government to stop the arson and mayhem under the son-of-the-soil banner. Sources said the chief minister had been summoned to the capital.        
	The police suspended two sub-inspectors and ordered a probe against ACP, Thane, B. Bhange for not taking action against MNS workers.        
	The 200 workers of the MNS, which Raj launched in March 2006 following a personality war with his cousin, went back to the parent outfit at a durbar presided over by Uddhav, Sena boss Bal Thackerays son. Sena spokesperson Vinayak Raut said they had been forgiven and taken back. MNS leaders, however, said they were not party workers but supporters.

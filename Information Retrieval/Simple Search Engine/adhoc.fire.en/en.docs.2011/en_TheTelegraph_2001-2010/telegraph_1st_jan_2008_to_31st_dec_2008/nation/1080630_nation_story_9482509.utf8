          FARHANA KALAM                              
	Gaya, June 29: Magadh division officials connected with the preparation and revision of electoral rolls have been given seven days to dispose of the nearly one lakh pending applications for inclusion of names in the voters list, name deletion and corrections in the electoral list.         
	Chief electoral officer Sudhir Kumar Rakesh gave the order to officials after reviewing the progress of electoral roll revision and related works today. The review took place in the office of Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah.        
	During the review it was found that on 25 June, about one lakh applications were pending with the electoral registration officers.        
	There were 48,000 pending applications from Gaya district alone. Jehanabad district threw up no less than 27,000 applications while the figure stood at 14,000 for Nawada district.        
	The chief electoral officer has fixed July 6 for the final disposal of pending applications.         
	Most of the pending applications pertain to the inclusion of names in the electoral roll. Officials attribute the high number of pending applications in Gaya district to the process of urbanisation and growing awareness about the exercise of voting rights.        
	The chief electoral officer said that limited rationalisation of the polling stations would also be ensured for smooth and fair elections.         
	Explaining the concept of limited rationalisation, he said that in the rural areas polling stations having more than 1,500 voters would be split and new poling stations created in the nearby revenue village having adequate infrastructure for the conduct of elections.         
	In the urban areas, one building will not have more than four polling stations, he said. Special care was being taken to facilitate the exercise of franchise by members of the weaker sections of society in a free and fair manner. For that, new polling stations would be created even if the number of vulnerable voters was as low as 300.         
	But officials have to be convinced about the genuineness of the apprehensions of the weaker sections, said the chief electoral officer.        
	Referring to the issue of deletion of names of those missing for more than six months from the electoral roll, the chief electoral officer said that the law will take its own course without resorting to what he called the glamourisation of the deletion exercise.         
	The electoral registration officers do not have the list of such persons and nobodys name can be struck off from the electoral roll without following the due process of law including serving notice on the person whose name has to be deleted. But electoral registration officers would not be lenient towards such persons, he added.

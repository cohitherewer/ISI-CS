     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Feb. 3: Riyajul Haque (43), the husband of a Bhagalpur ward councillor, was shot dead by unidentified assailants at Pataliputra Colony here last night.
    
	The incident took place at 8pm yesterday when Riyajul was returning from Patna Medical College and Hospital with his wife, Reshma Begum. Reshma, a dentist, is a councillor of Bhagalpurs ward 24.
    
	Riyajul was facing over a dozen cases of extortion and murder and was a key accused in the murder of Bhagalpur muscleman Pappu Khan at Phulwarisharif. He had been living in flat 707 of the apartment with his wife, son and daughter after a recent bomb attack on him in Bhagalpur recently.
    
	After Riyajul got down from his car with his wife near Lotus apartment and started walking towards the lift, four armed criminals started firing at Riyajul, who was declared brought dead by doctors of a private hospital at Raza Bazaar. 
    
	His wife, who was a few metres behind her husband, escaped unhurt.
    
	Riyajuls guard Anil Singh, who accompanied the couple, started a counter-attack but the criminals escaped unhurt. Riyajuls family suspected the involvement of Pappu Khans men behind the killing. 
    
	Riyajuls son Prince, who was at the flat at the time of incident, claimed to have seen the killers fleeing away leaving behind a motorcycle. A case of murder against unidentified persons has been registered at Pataliputra Colony police station.
    
	Office-bearers of Lotus apartment said that they did not know Riyajul had been staying in the apartment. The flat in which Riyajul  who was considered a land Mafioso  lived with his family belongs to an acquaintance of Riyajul.
    
	Patna superintendent of police Anwar Hussain said: It looks to be a clear case of gang war. The police has recorded statements of Reshma and Prince and might question relatives of Pappu Khan. No arrest has been made so far.

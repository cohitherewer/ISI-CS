	Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 31 (PTI): Mayavati today said her government would enact a quota for the weaker sections in the private sector.
    
	Addressing a BSP rally here, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said the Other Backward Classes, Dalits and the upper caste poor would each get 10 per cent reservation. 
    
	The state has decided to provide reservation for the upper caste poor in government jobs, too, Mayavati said. 
    
	An amendment to the central act is needed to implement this and the state has already written to the Centre, she added.

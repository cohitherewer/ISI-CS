The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plea for cell to speed up sex-assault trials
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Plea for cell to speed up sex-assault trials
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          One of the cabbies convicted of raping and murdering the Australian tourist                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Australian tourist Dawn Emilie Griggs was raped and murdered by two cabbies within hours of her landing here in 2004. She got justice last week.        
	Four years too late? Then consider this: thousands of women in the capital, many of them abused as little girls, have lost count of the years they have been waiting to see their tormentors punished.        
	The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has come up with a proposal to bring justice to these women faster. It has recommended to Delhi High Court that a special cell for rape victims be set up to investigate and fight cases in court apart from providing counsel.        
	The DCW has a cell of its own but the problem, according to commission members, is that it has to depend on the long-drawn-out court process.        
	This means the victim is traumatised again and again before she finally gets justice. The police, claiming they have other things to worry about, do not give priority to rape cases. They take as many as six months to investigate a case. The special cell that we have recommended to the high court will ensure the verdict is out in two months, said Barkha Singh, a member of the commission.        
	Statistics for 2006, released in January this year by the National Crime Records Bureau, reveal that every hour, 18 Indian women become victims of sexual crimes, of which rape is the fastest growing. In a quarter of the rape cases, the victims are minors.        
	According to official figures, 121 rape cases have been registered this year and about 210 incidents of molestation reported from across the city.         
	The DCW, which set up its Rape Crisis Cell in September 2005 to offer legal aid to victims, says that by the end of 2007, it had registered 588 rape cases but only 22 offenders were put behind bars.         
	However, during the same period, more than double the number (57) got acquitted, mostly because victims or witnesses turned hostile or became untraceable.         
	However, convictions in old and new cases became faster this year. Till now, the cell has registered over 880 cases and claims to have sent 40 per cent of the offenders to jail.        
	The special cell will speed up trials since it will have qualified lawyers, doctors, psychologists, counsellors and policemen dedicated to help the rape victims. They will not be involved in other cases. We will also be able to divert a lot of cases lying with the DCW rape cell to this special cell, Singh said.         
	The commissions recommendations have found support from several organisations.        
	A traumatised rape victim finds it tough to stand up to the courts scrutiny. When such a vulnerable person is further exposed to a battery of embarrassing personal questions, she will naturally feel a psychological pressure, said Raj Mangal Prasad of Pratidhi, a Delhi-based NGO.        
	 Thats why we have so few rape convictions in India. Most victims either end up withdrawing their cases or reaching an out-of-court settlement. This way (through the cell), they will be able to fight the system.        
	Criminal lawyer Majeed Memon, however, feels that courts have now become more sensitised to rape cases and have taken cognisance of the rise in sexual crimes.        
	The hearings are held mostly in-camera and lawyers are made to take the victims age into consideration while cross-examining her. But to get a higher conviction rate, the cop registering the offence has to be sensitised. He is the person the victim contacts first during the legal procedure and he shouldnt scare her or her family away, Memon said.

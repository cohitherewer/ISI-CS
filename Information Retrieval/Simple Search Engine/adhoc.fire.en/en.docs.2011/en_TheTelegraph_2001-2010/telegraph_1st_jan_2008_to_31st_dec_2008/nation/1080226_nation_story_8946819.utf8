          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rabri in Lalu rescue                                  
	Patna, Feb. 25: Opposition leader of Bihar Rabri Devi today alleged that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government had been putting words into R.S. Gavais mouth to defame the Opposition.        
	She said the RJD never used the word Marathi while protesting against the governors speech on the opening day of the ongoing budget session.        
	Talking to reporters outside the Assembly today, the former chief minister said: We opposed the governor and sought his recalling was because he was a representative of the government policies there. We never opposed him because of his Maharashtra roots.         
	Earlier, chief minister Nitish Kumar had expressed the governments unhappiness over what happened in the Assembly.        
	Rabri Devi clarified that the Opposition simply wanted to mention the Mumbai incidents in the Assembly and remind all about how people of Bihar were forced to leave Maharashtra.         
	Sharply reacting to the Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackerays reaction to the Gavai incident in todays Saamana, Rabri Devi said: No one will support the anti-national politics of Thackeray. Maharashtra and Shivaji belong to every Indian and not just to the Thackerays.        
	An article in Saamana, the mouthpiece of Shiv Sena, read: Lalu Prasad is the reason behind the caste-based distinctions and discriminations in Bihar.         
	It accused the RJD of opposing a Marathi governor on one hand and its chief Lalu Prasad falling at the feet of a foreigner in New Delhi on the other.         
	Defending her husband Rabri Devi said: We in the RJD dont need a certificate from the likes of Bal Thackeray. Everyone know Laluji is the number-one minister at the Centre.        
	The Saamana piece also took a dig at former RJD minister Shakuni Choudhary.        
	It said: Shakuni-mama, who made anti-Gavai statements, should not meddle with Maharashtra affairs.         
	Rabri Devi also defended fellow leader Shakuni Choudhary today.        
	Choudhury had asked the governor to intervene in the Mumbai violence.         
	Defending Choudhary Rabri Devi said: One can check Vidhan Sabha records. There is no mention of the word Marathi.

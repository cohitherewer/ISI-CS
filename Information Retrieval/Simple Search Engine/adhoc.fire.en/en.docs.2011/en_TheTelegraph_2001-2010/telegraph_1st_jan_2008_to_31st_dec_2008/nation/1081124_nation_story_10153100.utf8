          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Raj and Bal Thackeray				                                 
	Mumbai, Nov. 23: Raj Thackeray today met uncle Bal Thackeray for the first time since leaving the Shiv Sena three years ago, the talks setting off speculation about a possible reunion.        
	I went to meet him today to return some of his old books I had with me. We spoke about cartoons (and) old memories, Raj said after the one-and-a-half-hour meeting.         
	The apparent thaw in personal ties comes at a time Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena is seen to have hijacked the Shiv Senas son-of-the-soil plank with its campaign against north Indians.         
	But a Raj aide suggested he had only gone to see an ailing uncle and to share a lot of undemonstrated love the two have despite being rivals.        
	Last evening, Balasaheb fell ill. Age is catching up with him. He was nostalgic and called Raj saheb. They spoke for a while and then Balasaheb asked Raj to come and see him. They may be political foes but there is a lot of undemonstrated love between them, the aide said. The two had last met on January 23, 2006, Thackerays birthday.        
	Raj, other aides close to him said, cancelled his political meetings for the day and drove 10km from his Shivaji Park home to Matoshree, Thackerays Bandra residence. Thackeray is suffering from a serious kidney ailment and has been on a strict diet for sometime.         
	A Matoshree aide said there was no mention of politics at the meeting that was capped with a simple lunch. Thackerays son Uddhav and his wife were also present.        
	It was a simple vegetarian meal. But everybody was cheerful and cautious about not stepping on each others toes. There was no mention of politics, said the aide.        
	Raj had left the Shiv Sena in December 2005 after his uncle chose son Uddhav as his political heir and party president.        
	The decision had prompted the exit of Raj, who was seen by many in the Shiv Sena and in Maharashtras political circles as the true inheritor of Thackerays legacy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Foreign varsity bill back on table
  - Guarantee deposit plan for education providers setting up campuses in India         CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, July 27: India plans to ask foreign education providers to deposit guarantee money to set up campuses in the country in order to prevent institutions from pulling out after accepting fees from students.         
	The Foreign Education Providers (Regulation for Entry and Operation) Bill, that the Centre plans to introduce in Parliament in the upcoming monsoon session, will require institutions to deposit the money in a reserve account, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The ministry of human resource development has, in the draft bill, recommended that the deposit money be scaled according to the planned student intake in the institutions India campus, sources said.         
	A minimum of Rs 10 crore has been set, but officials said the bill did not mention any maximum cap on the deposit money that the government can seek.         
	The move to open up higher education to foreign players can potentially have disastrous effects, and we must protect against these effects, a senior HRD ministry official said.         
	Foreign universities are now forbidden from offering degree courses in India by the HRD ministry, although the commerce ministry officially allows 100 per cent FDI in the sector.         
	But nearly 150 foreign education providers are offering joint courses with Indian varsities under a twinning arrangement  part of the course in India, the rest abroad  that is allowed by the HRD ministry.         
	The bill, justified as necessary to remove the contradiction between the positions of the commerce and HRD ministries, has been opposed by the Left ever since it was proposed in 2005. Dependent on the Lefts support for the past four years, the UPA did not bring the bill to Parliament.         
	But with the government surviving the Lefts withdrawal of support by winning the July 22 trust vote, the HRD ministry has pulled the legislation out of cold storage and is now hurriedly thawing it.         
	Education minister Arjun Singh has said that the ministry will try and introduce the bill in the upcoming session of Parliament.         
	Under the proposed law, foreign institutions can apply for accreditation with the University Grants Commission (UGC) for a fixed period of time. The institutions can claim a refund of the deposited amount if they do not want to continue in India once the period is over, sources said.         
	Commerce ministry officials, however, said they were not convinced of the benefits of asking foreign universities to deposit money.         
	While we understand the HRD ministrys concerns, we fear the requirement to deposit money as a guarantee may not go down well with some varsities. It can act as a deterrent, said a senior commerce ministry official involved with investment in education.

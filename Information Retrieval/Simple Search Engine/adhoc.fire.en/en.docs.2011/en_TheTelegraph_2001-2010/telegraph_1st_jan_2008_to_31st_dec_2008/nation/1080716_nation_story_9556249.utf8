          JAYANTH JACOB                            Pranab in Delhi (PTI); Kamal Nath                                       
	 New Delhi, July 15: The July 22 trust vote has come in the way of attending important international assignments for two key ministers.         
	While Pranab Mukherjee is sending junior foreign minister Anand Sharma to Singapore for a ministerial meeting of the Asean Regional Forum, commerce minister Kamal Nath will miss at least the first two days of a crucial WTO meeting in Geneva.        
	Mukherjee, the governments key crisis manager and the Congresss leader in the Lok Sabha, was scheduled to attend the July 21-24 ARF meeting in Singapore, sources said.        
	Apart from the fact that the meeting would have helped Delhi ascertain its economic and diplomatic clout with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and East Asia, Mukherjee could have lobbied for the nuclear deal.        
	The foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the US  the dialogue partners of Asean  are also expected to be present at the ARF meet.        
	The dialogue partners also happen to be members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whose green signal is needed to activate the deal with the US.         
	If Kamal Nath is forced to skip the July 21-25 Geneva meet, Russia will miss him dearly.        
	Moscow has been hoping that India would back its claim for WTO membership in return for consistent support on Delhis bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

	New Delhi, July 31 (PTI): Pesky calls to unsuspecting cellphone users by telemarketing companies have not stopped despite the governments efforts, the Supreme Court said today and suggested introduction of a do-call register.         
	The court said some telemarketing companies were violating cellphone users fundamental right to privacy by calling them up though the names of the users featured in telecom regulator Trais do-not-call register.         
	A bench directed the Centre to introduce the new register. Telemarketing companies, the court said, would be allowed to dial only those users who wished to receive calls related to promotional schemes. The court asked the government to file a compliance report within six weeks.

 - Register or lose phone lines, Trai tells marketers

	New Delhi, Jan. 16: More than half the estimated 30,000 telemarketers in the country are yet to register themselves with the government, allowing them to continue making unsolicited sales calls.
    
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has warned marketers whose names are missing from the do-not-call registry that they could have their phone services disconnected.
    
	Trai, which issued regulations for curbing unwanted sales calls on June 5, 2007, had mandated that all telemarketers must register themselves with the department of telecom (DoT) within three months.
    
	However, till date, only around 12,000 telemarketers have registered themselves with the National Do Not Call (NDNC) registry that has been operational since October 2007. There are an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 telemarketers operating in the country, making over 1,000 crore calls every year.
    
	Ignorance about the system and a general sense of comfort that enforcement of penalty in India is weak are the main causes behind telemarketing firms not registering with the DoT, telecom analyst Mahesh Uppal said.
    
	Trai has proposed that telecom service providers and registered marketing firms be penalised if they fail to stop unwanted marketing calls to customers.
    
	If any telecom service provider fails to prevent unwanted marketing calls being made to its customers, it would be fined Rs 5,000 for the first non-compliance and Rs 20,000 for each subsequent non-compliance, said Trai officials. 
    
	Telecom service providers said there were some points that needed to be ironed out. 
    
	This is one way that Trai is trying to implement the NDNC system, it need not necessarily force marketers to register.... There are various nuances in the system which still need to be ironed out before the NDNC registry can be a success, a spokesperson for Idea said.
    
	Subscribers who want their numbers to be included in the do-not-call registry can do so by calling a toll-free number specified by their service provider. Trai has given service providers a maximum of 45 days (from the date of registration) to include a particular number in the registry.
    
	In case mobile service providers fail to registered a specific number with the NDNC registry within 45 days from the date of registration and that number gets a marketing call, the service provider would be held responsible and penalised, said a Trai official.
    
	More than 7.5 million phone users have put their numbers in the registry, according to Trai.
    
	The telecom watchdog also said telemarketers would be fined Rs 500 for every unsolicited call or SMS made to a registered customer. A second call to the same number would earn a fine of Rs 1,000.

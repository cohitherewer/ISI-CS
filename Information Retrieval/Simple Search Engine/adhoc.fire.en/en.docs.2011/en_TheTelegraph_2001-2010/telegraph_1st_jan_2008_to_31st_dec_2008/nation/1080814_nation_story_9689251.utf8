          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 13: The newly constituted one-man commission probing into the Kalinganagar firing held its first sitting yesterday, seven months after Justice A.S. Naidu Commission forced Orissa government appoint a new commission.         
	The commission, headed by retired high court judge P.K. Patra, is expected to carry out the residuary inquiry and complete the process within next six months.         
	The Orissa government had appointed the new commission on January 16 after Justice Naidu, a sitting judge of the high court, on December 9, 2007, had discontinued the inquiry.        
	The probe was stalled in the wake of a directive from the Supreme Court to terminate all inquiry commissions headed by sitting judges of high courts.         
	The Supreme Court bench of Justice Arijit Pasayat and S.H. Kapadia on November 27, 2007 stated that in no state, shall a sitting judge continue as the head of an inquiry commission.         
	Where the probe was at its end, the commission could continue until the report was submitted, the bench had however, added. But, Justice Naidu decided to discontinue the erstwhile panel probing into the firing incident.         
	Justice P.K. Patra Commission, entrusted with the residuary inquiry, in its first sitting in Cuttack, has decided to visit the firing site in Jajpur on August 17. The process assumes significance as the terms of reference has attained national importance.         
	Justice AS Naidu Commission had received nearly 150 affidavits from individuals and cross-examined 15, mostly government officials, in its 20 sittings.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 14: Four days after surrendering at a Jaipur court and procuring bail, suspended director-general of police B.B. Mahanti appeared before the state government today for the first time since he disappeared. 
    
	Mahanti, who returned to his official residence in Cuttack yesterday, drove to the secretariat this morning and met home secretary T.K. Mishra. Later, he received a copy of his suspension order and draft charges framed against him.
    
	The top officer, who sported a salt-and-pepper beard till yesterday, had shaved and looked calm. 
    
	He declined to speak to the media and made a gesture to indicate that god was there for him.
    
	Mishra said Mahanti received the copy of his suspension order and draft charges but refused to spell out the legal actions that could be taken against him. 
    
	On the next course of action, chief minister Naveen Patnaik reiterated: Law will take its own course and no one is above the law. 
    
	On December 10, the government had issued the final public notice through newspapers asking Mahanti to receive his charge-sheet and suspension order and appear before the Jaipur court. 
    
	Last month Mahanti had sent a representation to the government requesting two months time on medical grounds. However, he had not mentioned his whereabouts in the representation, which was rejected by the chief minister. Earlier, the state had issued a public notice through newspapers and public notices, pasted by Cuttack police, directing Mahanti to appear on or before the court of additional chief judicial magistrate in Jaipur by January 10.
    
	Mahanti had been placed under suspension by the government after he had repeatedly evaded arrest by a team of Rajasthan police. 
    
	Rajasthan police had registered a case against Mahanti at the Lalkothi police station in Jaipur under sections 130 and 120 of IPC on January 10 for allegedly aiding, abetting and harbouring his son Bitihotra, who jumped parole on December 4, 2006. 
    
	The DGP had reportedly signed a bail bond of Rs 50,000 for Bitihotras release on parole from November 20 till December 4. But the order and charges could not be served as he had absconded.

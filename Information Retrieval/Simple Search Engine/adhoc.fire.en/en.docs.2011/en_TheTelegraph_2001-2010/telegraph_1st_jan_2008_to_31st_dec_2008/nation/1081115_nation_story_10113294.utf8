          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 14: Orissa has permitted a rally in memory of a VHP leader whose killing sparked anti-Christian riots recently, ignoring a central advisory against communally sensitive gatherings.        
	State home secretary T.K. Mishra said the Bhubaneswar rally to pay homage to Laxmananda Saraswati had been allowed to respect the democratic rights of people. He confirmed the state had received the advisory.        
	The Centres advisory, sent earlier this week, had urged the state not to permit such public meetings as they could threaten communal peace.         
	Mishra, however, said a balance was necessary. On one side, we have to see that communal peace and amity are not disturbed. On the other, we have to respect the democratic rights of people. We cant deny an organisation permission to hold a rally peacefully.         
	Mishra said the authorities were assessing the situation. We discussed the matter with the DGP and the police commissioner today, he said.         
	City police chief B.K. Sharma confirmed the samiti had been given permission to hold the rally at PMG Square ground, near the Assembly. Over 40 police platoons, comprising 1,200 personnel, will be deployed across the city, Sharma said.         
	The gathering, organised by the Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Shraddhanjali Samiti, will be addressed by RSS central committee member Indresh Kumar, VHP national secretary Y. Raghavellu and Ram Janmabhoomi movement leader Ramvilash Vedanti.        
	Over a lakh people are expected to attend, said Ratnakar Chaini, the samitis president. Some Christian leaders have expressed fears that the rally could threaten peace.        
	On September 6, two weeks after Lakshmanandas murder, the state had barred the VHP from marching with his ashes in Bhubaneswar.        
	The VHP had then held a shraddhanjali sabha (homage meeting), despite curbs on gatherings. Several VHP activists and sadhus were arrested.

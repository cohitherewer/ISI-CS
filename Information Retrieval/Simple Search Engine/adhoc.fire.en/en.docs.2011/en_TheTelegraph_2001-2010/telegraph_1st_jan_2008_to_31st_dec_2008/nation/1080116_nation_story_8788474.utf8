 - US impatient for defence trip, but Delhi looks Left

	Washington, Jan. 15: Robert Gates likes A.K. Antony. The US defence secretary wants to visit the defence minister with whom he made an acquaintance in Singapore six months ago.
    
	But the UPA, worried that the Left parties might throw a fit over a Gates trip, is standing in the way of the proposed date in New Delhi. 
    
	So, to mollify the Pentagon and the American military industrial complex, which has been salivating over Indian defence deals for some years, the UPA government sent a gentleman by the name Shashi Kant Sharma to Washington this week.
    
	Sharma has the weighty title of director-general for acquisitions in the ministry of defence. Yesterday, he met officials of the Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the principal Pentagon body through which the US government channels its foreign military sales.
    
	But despite the niceties and lofty sentiments exchanged on Monday and Tuesday at meetings of the Indo-US Defence Procurement and Production Group (DPPG), which Sharma led from the Indian side, the Americans are far from satisfied.
    
	So, tomorrow, Vijay Singh, the defence secretary, will try to smooth things over with Eric Edelman, the US under secretary of defence for policy. The two men will meet under the guise of a meeting of the Indo-US Defence Policy Group (DPG), the apex mechanism for defence relationship between Washington and New Delhi.
    
	The Americans are clearly impatient. They want defence orders from India. But a visit to New Delhi by Gates in February is vital for them because they want to leave no stone unturned in their quest for military sales after the visit of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to India in less than 10 days.
    
	India and Russia are also due to hold key talks on some of their bilateral defence trade.
    
	The Americans have always been suspicious of the DPPG, the creation of which was a masterstroke by Pranab Mukherjee, when he was defence minister.
    
	When Mukherjee was here in June 2005, he was under intense US pressure from his then US counterpart, Donald Rumsfeld, to buy American weapons.
    
	Mukherjee, a veteran in bureaucratic stalling, offered Rumsfeld the DPPG, within the DPG, to consider buying of American weapons. The mechanism has largely gathered moss in the last two years  as Mukherjee envisaged then  but it has kept hopes alive in the military industrial complex here that big orders will soon come from India.
    
	But now the Americans are pulling their entire might into getting the better of France and Russia. They know the Left parties will not oppose the purchase of French or Russian weapons. Their sight is primarily set on bagging the order for 126 multi-role combat aircraft for America.
    
	The US-India Business Council (USIBC), which has the major arms producers on its membership, recently appointed Lt Gen Jeffrey Kohler, who retired as Director of DSCA, as a senior adviser to its board of directors. William Cohen, the former defence secretary, and board member of the USIBC, is leading the renewed charge for securing military orders from India.
    
	The UPAs efforts to keep the Left and the Americans happy would have been a classic comedy if it did not involve serious issues of policy and strategy. 
    
	When Gates was in Singapore in June, he wanted to meet his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia, three countries with whom the US last year conducted quadrilateral defence meetings. He met the Japanese and the Australians, but Antony, instructed by New Delhi, made excuses that he had another engagement and avoided the joint meeting.

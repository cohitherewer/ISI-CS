Stay in tents 
          MANDIRA NAYAR                              
	New Delhi, July 15: Tourists flocking to Delhi for the Commonwealth Games dont need to worry if they cant find a hotel room.        
	They could check into tents, thanks to the tourism ministry.        
	The ministry has decided to tackle the acute shortage of hotel rooms in the country by approving guidelines for states to encourage private investors to pitch tents for eco- and adventure-tourism destinations, pilgrimages and international events.        
	It has also made sure that tourists will not have to rough it out while staying in a tent.        
	Perfect for even non-adventurous visitors, these tents will not be merely canvas  they will have attached toilets, apart from rooms, a kitchen and storage.        
	The guidelines will act as a framework and ensure standards for interested entrepreneurs.        
	This is the first time guidelines for tented accommodation or campsites have been issued, said Swadesh Kumar, the founder member of the Adventure Tour Operators Association.

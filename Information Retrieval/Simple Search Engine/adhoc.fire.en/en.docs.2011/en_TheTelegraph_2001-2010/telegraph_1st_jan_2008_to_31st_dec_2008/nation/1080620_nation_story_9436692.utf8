                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Left banks on comrade Sonia
          JAYANTH JACOB                              Yechury (top), Lalu				                                 
	New Delhi, June 19: The Left is banking on Sonia Gandhi and the mature heads in her party to prevent the brinkmanship over the Indo-US nuclear deal from boiling over into a crisis and an early election.        
	Left sources told The Telegraph they hoped the Congress president and leaders such as Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, Arjun Singh and Ahmed Patel would save the situation.        
	The communist parties today reaffirmed they would withdraw support if the government took the safeguards agreement to the International Aomic Energy Agency. But they kept a channel of communication open, with CPM leader Sitaram Yechury meeting foreign minister Mukherjee for over an hour this evening.        
	The Left also kept up the effort to get the Congresss allies to put pressure on the government. Yechury met Rashtriya Janata Dal boss Lalu Prasad while CPI leader D. Raja held talks with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi.        
	Left sources said they believed Sonias priority would be to save the alliance with the Left. They hoped that senior leaders like Mukherjee would see the sense in our argument as well as the need to avoid an election in the backdrop of high inflation, which would help the BJP.        
	The CPM and the CPI are expected to talk to senior Congress leaders in the coming days.        
	But the Left sources added that if the pitch is raised in favour of the deal, portraying it as a matter of the Prime Ministers prestige and honour in relation to an international agreement, the situation could become difficult for Sonia.        
	Its all about playing the political game in the backdrop of an early election. Even the US is now saying there is time till January 20. We hope better sense will prevail, a CPM leader said.        
	He added that although no breakthrough was achieved at Yechurys meeting with Mukherjee, it was significant that both sides are talking to sort the issue out.        
	The government is sticking to its stand while we are not deviating from ours, he said. But the meeting itself shows that the channels of communication are on.        
	Mukherjee briefed Yechury on his talks with the allies and emphasised that the IAEA stage of the deal should be completed. The Left sources claimed that the UPA allies did not want early polls.        
	After the meeting with Yechury, Lalu Prasad told reporters: Government comes and goes. Nuclear power is a requirement and assets must be created for our next generation.        
	But he tried to allay the Lefts fears, saying that by signing the deal, we are not becoming a slave of America.        
	In the morning, Yechury had said: They have time till June 25 (the next meeting of the UPA-Left committee on the deal) and they have to make up their mind by then. If they go ahead, we will have to reconsider our support.

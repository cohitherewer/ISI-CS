 - Compensation on cards 
 for poultry farmers

	Cuttack, Feb. 4: Orissa government has decided to start the process of culling chickens in two districts  Mayurbhanj and Balasore  from day after tomorrow.
    
	The decision was taken at a meeting held in Bhubaneswar, late in the evening. Later, chief secretary Ajit Tripathy addressed the media and made public the decision.
    
	Earlier, at an afternoon meeting in Cuttack the Orissa government had formulated a plan to create a bird flu immunity zone comprising areas within 5km from the Bengal border to prevent an outbreak of the disease.
    
	But the latest decision to start the process of culling comes in the wake of a fresh order issued by Union government on February 1 to cull poultry in areas up to 5km near the Bengal border in Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand and Orissa.
    
	In fact, as a part of the previous plan we had started a massive vaccination programme across 65 gram panchayats in Mayurbhanj and Balasore, said Bishnupada Sethi, the director of animal husbandry and veterinary services department.
    
	But now even vaccinated birds would be killed to prevent the disease even as adequate compensation would be provided to farmers, who would be losing poultry. 
    
	We had adopted a R2B vaccine route due to the non-availability of bird flu vaccine. R2B vaccine is used for Ranikhet disease among poultry, Sethi told The Telegraph today.
    
	The vaccine can also kill Ranikhet disease strains which share some similar symptoms with bird flu, he said, adding that the government had last week urged the Central government to provide Rs 5 lakh for the vaccines. The Centre is yet to respond in this regard. 
    
	Nearly 17 lakh doses of the R2B vaccine have been administered among the backyard poultry population across 201 villages of Mayurbhanj and 68 villages of Balasore, Sethi claimed. 
    
	As a part of the plan round-the-clock surveillance to check intrusion of infected birds have been started in border areas. Around 80 teams, 42 in Balasore and 38 in Mayurbhanj, have been deployed. Apart from the official check gates, 44 other entry points (29 in Mayurbhanj and 15 in Balasore) are under round-the-clock vigil, Sethi said.
    
	So far, nearly 10,000 birds and chicks have been culled and destroyed after they were seized while being smuggled from Bengal. An official of the animal husbandry and veterinary directorate said the people of Orissa should not worry about the bird flu as of now because till date there has been no reports of even a single case in the state.

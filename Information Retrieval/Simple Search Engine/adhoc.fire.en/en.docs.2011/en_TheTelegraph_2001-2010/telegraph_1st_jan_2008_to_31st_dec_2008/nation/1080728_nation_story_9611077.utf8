	New Delhi, July 27: For foreigners Maureen Banda, Belinda, Rakhi Thapa and Sepi Song, life is about waiting  waiting for court dates.        
	Every time I get a date in court, all I get is a date two-three months later for another hearing. This has been the tale of my life for the past six years. I am just waiting for the courts to hear me. My kids will soon forget who I am, what I look like, says Maureen.        
	The 35-year-old Zambian had landed in India on June 15, 2002, for a tour of the country. Labelled a drug-carrier, she is now cooling her heels in jail No. 6 of the womens section of Tihar.        
	Number 6 is home to 456 prisoners, of whom 61 are foreigners. As many as 60 are undertrials, and only one has been awarded a sentence. Most of the women are allegedly drug-carriers.        
	In India, there are over 1.8 lakh undertrials in various jails and the government spends about Rs 361 crore a year  about Rs 55 a day per person  on them. What makes the plight of these foreign women worse is that they have no one to follow up their cases with lawyers.        
	Belinda, also caught with drugs six months ago while on a visit to India, has no idea where her case is going. Disowned by her family, the 26-year-old from Zimbabwe spends her time weaving.        
	I have written numerous letters to my family, but they have never responded. I have no one here and no one to find out what my lawyers are up to. I dont know when I will get out, she says.        
	Like Maureen and Belinda, for Rakhi, a 20-year-old from Nepal, hope and home seem far away.        
	I came from Nepal about seven months back to work as a maid. I was picked up by cops when they found charas in my employers house. I have no idea how I got involved in all this, says Rakhi.        
	What I now want is for someone to hear me out; if I am guilty, punish me, or just let me go. It is terrible to be in jail and not know what is going to happen.        
	If Rakhi or the others are found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.        
	Rakhi says the one thing that keeps her sane in Tihar is her weaving. Each inmate is paid Rs 25 for an article woven, whether it is a small carpet or a mobile case or something else.         
	The jails activity centre, where these women work for eight hours daily except on holidays and Sundays, is a picture of calm. Over 30 women work together, weaving on their wooden frames.        
	Sepi Song, a beautiful 47-year-old from Zambia, presides over these sessions. In jail for six years for apparently carrying drugs she doesnt even recognise, Sepi became a trainer three years ago.        
	I have three children back home. I write to them regularly, but its nothing like being there for them. What is frustrating is that I see no future for myself, she says.        
	There is nothing I can do to get out of here. But its nice at least to teach others how to weave. It gives me pleasure. Some of them learn really quickly, some take a lot of time.        
	The latest foreigners to have been put behind bars were Czech entomologist Petr Svacha and forester Emil Kucera.        
	The duo, who were caught with over 200 beetles, butterflies and other insects from Singalila National Park in north Bengal, were in a Darjeeling jail for almost a month.

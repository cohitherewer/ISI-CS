          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 8: Nirmala Devi will never forget the sight  the tail of a plane sitting atop her home, a hole blown through the roof, the room below strewn with aircraft wreckage.        
	A trip to a hospital had saved Devi and her husband when the two-seater training aircraft, a Cessna 152, crashed on their home at Sannatnagar today.        
	We had been visiting a sick relative. When we returned, I was shocked to see a portion of a plane on my roof, Devi said.        
	Husband Gopala Rao, who has retired from his job with an electrical company, had built the house five years ago and rented out a portion to a couple who run a laundry. The tenants had left for work when the 11am crash happened.        
	The adjacent house, its walls cracked by the rest of the wreckage that blew up on the ground, was vacant too. Its owners are rich farmers from the districts, neighbours said.        
	Sannatnagar had a harrowing day. Some residents had doused the fire after the plane blew up, but after that everyone fled their homes fearing more explosions. As they stood on the street, the police stood guard so that thieves and looters did not take advantage.        
	For hours after fire engines had extinguished the last flickers from the wreckage, residents  mostly middle-class with a few affluent families scattered about the colony  kept discussing the crash.        
	We had lived in fear for two decades, anticipating one of the planes from the airport would crash on us. Now it has happened after the airport was shifted, said Prabhakar Rao, a retired inspector.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajesh Talwar being taken to Dasna Jail, in Ghaziabad on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: A court today refused bail to Aarushi murder accused Rajesh Talwar after the CBI said they wanted to conduct another lie test on the dentist.        
	The designated court extended Talwars judicial remand by 14 days and ordered the jail superintendent to present the accused at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory tomorrow for the polygraph test.        
	The order came after the agency said experts had advised another lie test on the doctor  arrested on May 23 for the murders of his daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj  as the results of the earlier one had been inconclusive.        
	The day also saw a bit of a drama after the CBI whisked Talwar away from the court without letting him meet his wife Nupur. The court, however, intervened and ordered the agency to bring him back so that he could meet Nupur.        
	Yesterday, Anita and Praful Durrani, family friends and partners of the Talwars in their dental clinic, were put through a psychoanalysis assessment by a team of experts from AIIMS.         
	Their earlier statements had discrepancies, sources said, adding that more contradictions had emerged after their domestic help, Rajkumar, was put through a lie-detector test.        
	The CBI also questioned the two doctors who had conducted the autopsy on Aarushi.        
	The Talwars domestic help, Bharti, the first to reach their Noida house on May 16 when the murders were discovered, and driver Umesh Sharma, the last person to have seen the family together the night before, were also questioned.        
	The driver was taken to an HDFC bank branch in Noidas Sector 18 where the Talwars had an account. Nupur Talwar had withdrawn Rs 26,000 on May 14. When questioned about it, she said it was to purchase surgical equipment, said an official.

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: Orissa will probe the death of a priest who died in a Chennai hospital on Tuesday after allegedly being attacked during the Kandhamal riots.        
	The crime branch will investigate the circumstances leading to death of Father Bernard Digal, state police chief M.M. Praharaj said today, soon after a post-mortem. The body was flown here from Chennai this morning.        
	Praharaj said a case of rioting and murder had been registered based on a complaint from Father Joseph Kalathil, the archbishops vicar general. The inspector of Kharavelanagar police station in Bhubaneswar, Bishnu Charan Mishra, confirmed having received the complaint.        
	The post-mortem report will be out in a few days but conflicting versions have emerged on the exact cause of Digals death. Kalathil said Chennais St Thomas Hospital told him Digal had come with fever a week back but died of multi-organ failure, adding an external blood clot on his head was removed.        
	Yesterday, Christian leaders had said Digal died of injuries in the attack. Today, a PTI report suggested he had died of dengue. The Bangalore-based Catholic News Service in a report claimed that Digal died of dengue fever, the agency quoted a senior police officer as saying.        
	Digal was buried this evening in Bhubaneswar. Kalathil said the body wasnt taken to Raikia, the Kandhamal village where Digal was born, as the situation is improving and we didnt want disturbances.        
	Kalathil said Digal, treasurer of the archdiocese, was returning from an official assignment in Kandhamals Sankarakhol on August 25 when the violence broke out and his vehicle was set on fire. Scared, Digal fled into a nearby jungle with driver Sisiro Pradhan. The two were hunting for a safe place when a mob armed with sticks, bars and sharp weapons attacked them in the jungle near Dudukangia village, Kalathil said.        
	The driver fled but Digal was stripped, attacked and left for the dead with serious injuries on the head and other parts of the body. However, he regained consciousness and was spotted by the driver and other villagers.                    
	They called the police, who first rushed him in their jeep to the local primary health centre. From there, he was taken to district hospital in Phulbani and then to the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, Kalathil said.         
	Later, Digal was flown to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai He was discharged after his condition improved.         
	Digal then went to Chennai to meet an ailing friend but felt sick and got himself admitted to St Thomas Hospital, Kalathil said.

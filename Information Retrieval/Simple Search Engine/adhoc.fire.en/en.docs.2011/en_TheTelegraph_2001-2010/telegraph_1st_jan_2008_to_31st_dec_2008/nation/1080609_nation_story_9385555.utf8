                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gujjar talks with govt set to start
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, June 8: The Rajasthan government today agreed to the Gujjars demand for preliminary talks in Bayana but only if they agreed to the final rounds being held in Jaipur.        
	The talks are likely to begin tomorrow.         
	S.N. Thanvi, principal secretary and special envoy for the talks who has been camping at Bayana since trouble erupted on May 23, said: We are waiting for their written reply but have made it clear the Bayana talks can start only after they agree to the final rounds in Jaipur.         
	The government has formed a two-member team that will open the negotiations but hasnt disclosed the names.        
	Earlier, Kirori Singh Bainsla, who is spearheading the movement, had handed over the names of 45 negotiators to Thanvi.         
	The number has been cut to 40 on the request of the government, which felt it was too large a delegation.        
	The team mostly comprises Gujjars from Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh but the Rajasthan government wanted more state leaders to be brought in.         
	Mines minister Laxmi Narain Dave and transport minister Yunus Khan have been assigned the task of persuading the Gujjars to include more state leaders, sources said.        
	Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti spokesman Roop Singh accused the government of engaging in delaying tactics by first saying no and then yes to the talks in Bayana.         
	We were always open to talks and had agreed to the final rounds in Jaipur. Junior ministers have been commissioned for the prelimi- nary rounds, which shows how indifferent they (the government) are to our problems. But we hope the out-come of the talks will be positive.         
	As the blame-game over the delay in talks went on, the agitators decided to continue squatting along the railway tracks at Pilupura in Bayana and Sikandra Chowk in Dausa till the outcome of the rounds in Jaipur.

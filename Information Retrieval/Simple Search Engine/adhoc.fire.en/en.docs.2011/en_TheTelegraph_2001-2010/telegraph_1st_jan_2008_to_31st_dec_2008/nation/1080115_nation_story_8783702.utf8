 - Cong delinks demand from panel to carve out states

	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Congress has delinked the demand for a separate Telengana state from a proposal to set up a Second States Reorganisation Commission which would consider similar calls for other new states.
    
	M. Veerappa Moily, the party general secretary in charge of Andhra, said the committee being considered by the government does not include Telengana. Telengana stands alone and the Congress is very serious about considering the issue.
    
	Moily explained the standalone logic, saying the UPA was bound by the letter and spirit of the common minimum programme, the cornerstone of the alliance, which says the demand for a separate Telengana state  to be carved out of Andhra Pradesh  will be considered after due consultations and consensus, not through a reorganisation committee.
    
	The government had formed a panel, headed by Pranab Mukherjee, to evolve a consensus within the ruling coalition, but it made little headway. It led to speculation that the Centre might wriggle out of the Telengana problem with another committee.
    
	Last week, Moily confirmed in Hyderabad that the Centre was thinking of setting up a second state reorganisation panel but remained silent on Telengana.
    
	Congress legislators from the region  which comprises 10 districts and has 107 Assembly constituencies in the 294-member Andhra House  protested. They saw the proposal as a way of putting the demand in cold storage until the next Lok Sabha and state elections scheduled to be held simultaneously.
    
	Three Lok Sabha MPs, including party veteran G. Venkataswamy from Peddapalli in Telengana, threatened to resign if the committee was set up.
    
	Congress sources maintained that Moily was directed by the highest authorities at the Centre to test the waters in his party.
    
	The CPM, which is anyway opposed to a Telengana state, has made it clear that another reorganisation committee is not welcome. There is no need for one and the idea was not discussed with us, said politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury.
    
	RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, a member of the panel headed by Mukherjee, said committees were meant to sweep tricky issues under the carpet.
    
	Telengana is certainly one such issue and, perhaps, the government wants to buy time and peace by setting up a second reorganisation committee. Not only will it not resolve the problem, such a committee will open a Pandoras box.
    
	This is a view privately endorsed by Congress leaders from states like Karnataka and Assam, which have witnessed demands for separate states like north Karnataka and Coorg and Bodoland.
    
	But with support building for Telengana  barring the Left and sections of the Congress  and other UPA constituents backing the demand, the Congress was forced to treat it as a standalone issue.

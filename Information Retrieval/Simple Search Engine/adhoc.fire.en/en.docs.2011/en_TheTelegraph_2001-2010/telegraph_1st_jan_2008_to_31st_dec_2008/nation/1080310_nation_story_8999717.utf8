	Bhubaneswar, March 9: Naveen Patnaik presented an (almost) exact copy of his past promises made to farmers especially those in the Hirakud reservoir area at todays krushak samavesh (farmers rally) held at George High School ground in Bargarh.         
	Despite a bandh call made by Western Orissa Lawyers Association, more than 70,000 farmers gathered at the first-ever rally by the BJD for farmers.         
	Close on the heels of the AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhis whirlwind tour to western Orissa yesterday, the ruling BJD today organised the rally in a bid to neutralise the impact. Western Orissa has been witnessing peasant agitation over the allocation of water from Hirakud reservoir to industries.         
	The chief minister reiterated his earlier announcement that not a drop of water meant for irrigation would be diverted to industries.         
	Hirakuds water is for farmers and irrigation, he said adding that 2008 had been declared as the year of irrigation.         
	Todays rally was addressed by six BJD ministers and senior leaders of the party, including MP Prasanna Acharya.         
	Recently, the Opposition Congress had organised a similar rally at Sambalpur on December 2. AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi also addressed a few rallies in the region on the second day of his Orissa visit, yesterday. Rahul addressed a farmers rally at Berhampur today.

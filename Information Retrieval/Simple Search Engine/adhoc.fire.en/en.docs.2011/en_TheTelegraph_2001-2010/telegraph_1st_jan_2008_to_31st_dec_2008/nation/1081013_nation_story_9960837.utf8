The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Word play on terror
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Word play on terror
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Singh: Subtle semantics                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The T word could have spelt trouble, but E provided the perfect exit.        
	Under pressure to include terrorism on the agenda of tomorrows meeting of the National Integration Council, the government today opted for a more generic term  extremism.        
	Sources said the fresh agenda released by the home ministry had not only created space for the BJP to speak about Islamic militancy but also for criticism of both Right- and Left-wing extremism.        
	The change came after Narendra Modi and Vasundhara Raje Scindia, chief ministers of BJP-ruled Gujarat and Rajasthan, wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh protesting against the exclusion of terrorism from the meets agenda.        
	Sources in the government said the Centre, uncomfortable with questions on terrorism that have become synonymous with Islamist terrorism, had left out the issue as the BJP would have engaged in minority bashing at the meet. The last-minute change, they said, ensures at least a level playing field.        
	The integration councils meeting comes at a time the Congress-led government is under fire for its indecision on banning the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad over attacks on Christians in Orissa and Karnataka.        
	Although the Union cabinet and the home ministry have met several times in the wake of the attacks, the central coalition seems to have decided against banning the two outfits as many in the UPA fear it might prove counter-productive in an election season.        
	Some Christian leaders say tomorrows meet, to be chaired by the Prime Minister, is a sham.        
	Three council members  Archbishop Vincent Concessao, secretary-general of the All India Christian Council John Dayal and educationist Valson Thampu  have prepared a joint statement that will criticise the government for being unwilling to face the truth.        
	What is the use of this, said Dayal, who confirmed that extremism as a topic was made part of the agenda only today.        
	Apart from extremism, topics to be discussed at the councils 14th meet are caste and identity divisions, economic development and removal of regional imbalances, promotion of a feeling of security among minorities and other vulnerable sections, education among minorities and backward segments and communal harmony.        
	The council includes Union ministers, chief ministers, leaders of political parties, chairpersons of national commissions, well-known public figures and representatives from business, labour, media and womens groups.

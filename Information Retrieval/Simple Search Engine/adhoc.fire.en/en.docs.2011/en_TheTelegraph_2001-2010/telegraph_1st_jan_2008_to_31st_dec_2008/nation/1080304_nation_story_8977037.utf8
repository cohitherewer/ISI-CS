     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Chennai, March 3: A Sanskrit-versus-Tamil row yesterday led to police and priests pushing and shoving each other at the Nataraja temple in Chidambaram, one of Tamil Nadus most popular shrines.
    
	The priests had stopped devotional singer Arumugasamy from climbing up to the mukhamandapam, the elevated enclosure next to the sanctum sanctorum, to sing Tamil hymns. When the police came to the bards rescue, a scuffle broke out.
    
	The priests use the mukhamandapam to pray to the deity in Sanskrit. Hymns from the Thevaram anthology, part of the Tamil Saiva Siddantha tradition, are allowed in a lower enclosure.
    
	Arumugasamy has challenged the tradition in court, saying the temple should treat Tamil on a par with Sanskrit.
    
	We are not against the rendition of hymns from the Thevaram; the difference is only about which enclosure they should be sung from, a temple source said over the phone.
    
	Tamil enthusiasts say the Thevaram hymns should be sung right inside the mukhamandapam.
    
	Arumugasamy rode an elephant to the temple at the head of an army of fans, apparently armed with a favourable directive from the state governments Hindu religious and charitable endowments department.
    
	Police reinforcements had already been sent to the temple in the morning, and they allowed only 25 devotees to accompany Arumugasamy inside the temple.
    
	As the police and priests jostled after he was stopped, Arumugasamy succeeded in reaching the mukhamandapam and singing a hymn, some eyewitnesses said. They said the singer was then escorted down by officers and led outside. Others questioned this account.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Centre backs anti-Maoist armed vigilantes
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, April 15: The Centre has thrown its weight behind a band of armed tribals floated to counter Maoists in Chhattisgarh, shrugging off months of reluctance to be publicly identified with the state-backed group.        
	The Union government today opposed the disbanding of the Salwa Judum, the group armed by the Chhattisgarh government to take on the Maoists, but agreed to a probe into alleged human rights excesses committed by individual activists.         
	To assume that the Salwa Judum was an army of people with weapons and asking for it to be disbanded will be no more than asking for these people to be pushed out to be killed (by the Naxalites), additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court. The court is hearing a batch of petitions seeking to have the group dismantled.         
	This is the first time the Centre is speaking out in favour of the Salwa Judum. Neither the Centre nor the Congress had done so before.        
	Union home minister Shivraj Patil is on record saying the government disapproved of arming individuals to fight Naxalites. Ajit Jogi, the seniormost Congress leader from Chhattisgarh and former chief minister, too, has been an outspoken opponent of the Salwa Judum and wants the offensive called off.         
	Both the Centre and the Congress believe it is the job of the state to counter the Naxalites, not of individuals or groups. Human rights groups in the state have called the 2-year-old Salwa Judum a state-sponsored civil war in which hundreds of lives have been lost. However, the Salwa Judums campaign continues in the Bastar jungles.         
	At the core of the problem is Mahendra Karma, Congress MLA and leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. The Salwa Judum is his brainchild. Karma is a tribal leader from the Naxalite-affected Bastar and has made common cause with the BJP government in the state against the Naxalites.         
	Last year, Karma was summoned by the Congress high command to New Delhi and told to disown the Salwa Judum. Karma refused and dared the party to punish him. The Congresss hands are probably tied because Karma has built a strong tribal constituency around the Salwa Judum campaign and is in a position to hold the party hostage.        
	In the petitions to the Supreme Court, activists Kartam Joga, Nandini Sundar, E.A.S. Sarma and Ramachandra Guha have alleged widespread rights violations by members of the Salwa Judum. They have also sought an independent inquiry into the alleged human rights violations committed by the counter-insurgency force.         
	At the last hearing, the Supreme Court had criticised the government for arming citizens. How can the state give arms to some persons? The state will be abetting in a crime if these private persons kill others, the court had said.         
	However, when the hearing resumed today, the Centre said the situation was alarming and serious on the ground. No policeman worth his salt was even willing to venture into the jungle, Subramanium said.         
	He said the state government had only appointed a few special police officers to protect people who had been fleeing from the Naxalites and taking shelter in camps. But the petitioners alleged that 50,000-odd people had been displaced by the excesses.        
	Subramanium, however, agreed to a probe into the allegations of excesses and suggested one by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).         
	The court then directed NHRC, which had issued a notice to the Chhattisgarh government, to send a fact-finding mission to Bastar and submit a report. The case will come up for hearing again after eight weeks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 3: The ruling BJD today swept the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation elections, while a fractured mandate was registered in two urban local bodies in strife-torn Kandhamal.        
	According to the results declared today, BJD established its supremacy in the civic body polls by winning 40 out of total 60 wards in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, while its government alliance partner BJP bagged only nine seats.        
	In Kandhamal district, though Congress won the highest number of seats (five in 13-member Phulbani municipality and six in G. Udayagiri NAC with same strength), it has failed to secure majority.

	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Centre and the National Conference are believed to have reached a tacit understanding, effectively ending the six-year-old Congress-PDP alliance in trouble-ridden Jammu and Kashmir.        
	A key element of this unstated pact, brokered at both the political and official levels, is that the National Conference of Farooq and Omar Abdullah will play along with whatever date is chosen for Assembly elections in the state and participate in order to lend credibility to the polls. The quid pro quo: a political assurance that the NC will be aided to reclaim its pre-eminence in the Valley.         
	It is quite likely that for reasons of credibility, the NC will maintain a faade of political distance from the Congress; any alliance, or coalition, should it be required, will become apparent only after the elections.        
	Reliable sources have told The Telegraph that top Congress and NC leaders have been in constant touch since the downfall of the Ghulam Nabi Azad government in Srinagar to discuss a political rapprochement. Over the same period of time, Congress-PDP relations have deteriorated to a degree that no alliance exists in the state even though the PDP is still officially part of the UPA at the Centre.         
	It is known that the state Congress chief, Saifuddin Soz, is unhappy with the Congress-NC negotiations, but he has remained sidelined through the process, the sources indicated. Former chief minister Azad, on the other hand, has privately favoured a deal with the NC for long.        
	Another key player, they added, was former R amp;AW chief A.S. Dulat, who has previously been the Centres point man for Kashmir. Dulat is close both to key decision-makers at the Centre and the Abdullahs.        
	Omar Abdullahs vociferous support to the UPA in the trust vote in July, his subsequent NDA-bashing and Farooq Abdullahs refusal to attack the Centre for the recent roil in Jammu and Kashmir are being seen as indications of a new thaw.         
	The last time the two parties had aligned was in 1986, when Rajiv Gandhi and Farooq Abdullah shook hands and contested the 1987 polls together. They won, but that experiment went horribly wrong, essentially on account of Abdullahs identification with New Delhi; in 1989, militancy and the first azaadi protests erupted in the Valley and a long spell of central rule had to be imposed on Kashmir.         
	It is the negative play in Kashmir of any alliance with a national party that the Abdullahs may be trying to circumvent by keeping their deal under wraps.        
	Although the NC argued for a delay in its meeting with the Election Commission today, it is reliably learnt that were elections to be held on time  late October or November  the Abdullahs will participate.        
	It is perhaps significant that both Farooq and Omar  would-be chief minister and party president respectively  have favoured elections in their public statements over the past week.         
	Marking a contrast to the position his party took at the Election Commission today, Omar Abdullah had categorically told a national television channel yesterday, Yes, elections can be held, there shouldnt be a problem.         
	The NC stand at the Election Commission is being seen as merely a fallback attempt at fig-leaf credibility in the Valley, where the mood remains angered and opposed to elections.         
	The Abdullahs are trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hound, said a senior NC leader who wouldnt be quoted. They dont want to lose a chance to come back to power, but they dont want to offend the street mood either. But given the right assurances, they will go for elections, even though public sentiment seems against it.         
	Reflecting that sentiment, and eager not to lose ground in the Valley to the Hurriyat, Mehbooba Muftis PDP has spoken strongly against elections at the moment. Indeed, if elections are held before the winter, the PDP may turn more hard-line and take a position closer to the Hurriyat, whose demands for self-determination have become more strident following the Amarnath land row.         
	The NCs position, amplified at the highest levels in recent days, is radically different and apparently modulated to the demands of an alliance with the Centre. Unlike the PDP and the Hurriyat, Farooq Abdullah has lauded the Amarnath settlement between governor N.N. Vohra and the Jammu-based Sangharsh Samiti and believes it to be the end of the row. To the PDP and the Hurriyat, the settlement is an affront.         
	Son and party boss Omar Abdullah, on his part, has been decrying the demand for azaadi as not an option for Kashmiris. At the moment, though, it may sound fair to suggest that both father and son are on the wrong side of Valley sentiment. Precisely why they may be seeking a political comeback powered by New Delhi .

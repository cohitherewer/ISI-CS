                     Angry Nitish leaves celebrations
   
	Gaya, Jan. 16: A group of NDA workers played spoilsport to the eighth Buddha Mahotsava inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday evening. 
    
	Late in the evening the unscheduled departure of the chief minister by road, leaving his chopper standing behind, fuelled speculation about Nitish being unhappy with the arrangements. 
    
	But the matter began when Lalita Devi, the district BJP chief, occupied the front row meant for ministers and dignitaries. 
    
	Not to be left behind, JD(U) workers installed their district chief Devanandan Singh on another front row seat.
    
	As the organisers approached the leaders of the two parties with a plea to vacate the seats and go back to their original ones in the second row, workers began raising slogans against the organisers. 
    
	The programme was being organised by the department of tourism and the district administration. 
    
	At the time of trouble the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues were offering prayers at the Maha Bodhi Temple. 
    
	When contacted, district BJP chief Lalita Singh attributed the incident to nasamjhi (lack of understanding) between officials and workers. Not much should be read into the incident, she stressed. 
    
	Though organisers had prepared an elaborate seating plan, politicians made a mockery of it all and former MLA Jai Kumar Palit was seen occupying the seat meant for Atari MLA Kunti Devi. 
    
	As a result of the noisy scenes, Odyssy exponent Madhavi Mudgal terminated her performance mid-way and left the stage. The visibly upset dancer refused to speak to the media. Ghazal and Bhajan singer Anup Jalota, who took over after the dancers exit, took a dig by inviting those who could not find a place in the front row to share the stage with him. 
    
	Stories doing rounds in the wake of Nitishs unscheduled departure attribute several factors to his foul mood.
    
	The chief minister, it is being alleged, was irked to see that his directions to reduce access to the Bodhi Tree and protect the temple were being overlooked. 
    
	Moreover, many are treating the five minutes that were allotted to the chief minister and his colleague for their speeches  a faux pas. Also the fact that the CM got to see the invitation card when he reached the venue meant that the tourism department did not feel the need to sent a card off to him before this.

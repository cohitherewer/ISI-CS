The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strangers, dabbas suspect in diamond hub 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Strangers, dabbas suspect in diamond hub

	Mumbai, Aug. 2: In the by-lanes of Opera House, Mumbais diamond district, strangers are suddenly suspect.        
	Pancharatna, the grimy housing society that trades in more bales of sparkling diamonds than possibly any other single building in the world, has been turned into a fortress.        
	After the discovery of 20-odd unexploded bombs in various parts of Surat, the worlds biggest diamond-polishing hub, Opera House is palpably tense. Even a minor query on the location of a traders office subjects you to a quiz on what business brought you there.        
	Call it a coincidence or whatever, every time there has been a terror attack in Maharashtra or Gujarat, diamond traders have been targeted, said Naresh Mehta, secretary of Pancharatna Housing Society, which looks after the diamond hub.        
	The 1993 Bombay blasts, which killed 257 people, had seen a bomb placed strategically at Zaveri Bazaar, the diamond market adjacent to Opera House where most big traders in the city have their retail shops. The particular blast left 17 dead and 57 injured. The area was targeted again during the August 2003 blasts.        
	The July 11 bombings of Mumbais commuter trains claimed the largest number of victims from the Gujarati diamond-trading community, added Mehta, a trader himself.        
	So, right after the Ahmedabad blasts last Saturday, in which the Sardar Patel Diamond Market of Bapunagar was a target, alarm bells rang out in Opera House.        
	At a quickly called meeting on Sunday afternoon, industry bigwigs decided to reinforce security at Pancharatna where some 680 registered diamond traders conduct business every day.        
	Tiffin boxes brought by dabbawallas will be checked before they are let in. Some of the bombs in Ahmedabad were planted in tiffin boxes, Mehta said.        
	Tell him its a predictable response and that terrorists may not use tiffin boxes next time, he proudly points at six uniformed commandos manning the 24-storey building.        
	They are trained in disaster management. We are also restricting the parking of vehicles with police help. A database of people visiting the building will be maintained, which will include their photographs. We have already installed CCTV cameras and it is mandatory for every trader and employee in this building to carry ID cards, Mehta said.        
	After the Gujarat terror strikes, some traders in Pancharatna are keen to move to the new Bharat Diamond Bourse in Mumbais corporate district, Bandra-Kurla.        
	Till last month most traders used every excuse, every superstition in the book to delay the shift, said Vasant Mehta, vice-chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India.        
	The 2 million-square-foot Bharat Diamond Bourse is expected to provide modern facilities and better security. But old-timers prefer the old building and assert that its paan-stained look will not prevent them from grabbing business from the West.        
	They have some unlikely supporters in the Israeli diamond traders who consider it among the worlds safest.         
	Compare Mumbai to Tel Aviv, where a bomb explodes every two minutes, said Doron Arazi, who has been visiting the city once every three weeks for the past five years.

	Hyderabad, May 29: The Election Commission today registered cases against chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and five Telugu television channels for poll-related offences, reports our special correspondent.        
	Andhra Pradesh chief electoral officer I.V. Subba Rao said cases had been filed against Reddy and the channels at Hyderabad and in 10 districts where byelections were held today for 18 Assembly and four Lok Sabha seats.         
	They have been booked for violating Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, under which no public meeting can be held and processions taken out for 48 hours prior to the end of polling.         
	Rao claimed that the chief minister had violated the law by addressing a news conference yesterday at which he detailed his governments development programmes.         
	The TV channels have been hauled up for airing the news conference.

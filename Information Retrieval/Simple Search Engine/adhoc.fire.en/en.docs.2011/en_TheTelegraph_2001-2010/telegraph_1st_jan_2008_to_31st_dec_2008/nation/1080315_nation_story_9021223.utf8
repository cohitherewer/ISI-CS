The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC calls off tiger trip, cash down the drain
                                                                                                               PC calls off tiger trip, cash down the drain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 14: Bengal ran up a bill of Rs 6 lakh to prepare for P. Chidambarams weekend visit to the Sunderbans  only to be told at the last minute that the finance minister was too busy to come.         
	We received a message around 2pm today from his office that he is not coming because of some urgent programmes he must attend, minister for Sunderbans Kanti Ganguly said.        
	The two-day visit, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, was confirmed a month ago. The state was hoping that Chidambaram, who announced a Rs 50-crore fund to save the tiger in his budget, would dip into his purse to help develop the home of the Royal Bengal Tiger.         
	A brand new helipad was constructed at Moipith, another at Sagar Island was renovated and a helicopter was hired for Chidamabaram because the state government does not have one of its own.         
	A luxury launch was readied to take him on a tour along the riverbanks in South and North 24-Parganas, and four cottages were booked in the Tiger Camp at Gosaba for the minister and his team.         
	We had wanted to show him the socio-economic condition of the villagers and present a package for their overall economic development. The villagers of the Sunderbans badly need power, drinking water, strengthening of the river embankments, roads and other basic facilities. We were hopeful that after the visit, funds would be allocated for the development of the area, Ganguly said.        
	According to an official of the Sunderbans Development Board, Chidambaram was to visit Sagar, Ghoramara and Lohamara islands, Namkhana, G-Plot in Patharpratima and Kultali, all in South 24-Parganas. Ghoramara and Lohamara are gradually disappearing into the sea.        
	We had plans to show the finance minister the actual condition of the river embankments in the interior areas of the Sunderbans, and had hired the helicopter for that purpose, Ganguly said.         
	At least some of the money the government spent on preparing for his visit will go down the drain, thanks to the last-minute cancellation by the minister whose job it is to plug waste of taxpayers money.         
	Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia was in the Sunderbans on Wednesday and Thursday with his wife. He toured Gosaba, Sajnekhali and Sudhanyakhali by motor launch. Ganguly handed him a list of the villagers needs.         
	He hasnt given up entirely on Chidambaram too. He may be very busy now, but I am confident that he will visit us soon as he had given us his word and he is a perfect gentleman.

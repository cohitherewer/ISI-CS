The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gere gets relief, kiss cops get a scolding
                                                                                                               Gere gets relief, kiss cops get a scolding
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 14: The Supreme Court today stayed an arrest warrant against Richard Gere, slamming the obscenity cases against the Hollywood star as publicity-hunting.         
	Cases were brought against Gere for publicly kissing actress Shilpa Shetty at an AIDS fundraiser here last year.         
	This is nothing but publicity-hunting. By filing such cases and getting such orders, you are getting a bad name for the country, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan told a complainant. No offence is made out, the bench said, when the complainant insisted that the actor present himself before the court.         
	The court wondered how the magistrate could have issued an arrest warrant against the actor who did not live in the country.

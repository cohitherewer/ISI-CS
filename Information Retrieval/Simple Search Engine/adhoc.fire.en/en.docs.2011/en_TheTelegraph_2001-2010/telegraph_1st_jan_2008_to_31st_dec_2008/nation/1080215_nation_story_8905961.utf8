  -Token hike after 20 months
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Murli Deora                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Centre has raised the price of petrol by Rs 2 and diesel by Re 1 a litre on the logic that people can afford mineral water and Mercedes cars.        
	The increase - the first in 20 months - comes into force from Thursday midnight. The prices of cooking gas and kerosene remain unchanged.         
	Explaining the rationale behind the price increase, petroleum minister Murli Deora asked: If people can spend Rs 10 for mineral water and buy Mercedes car for Rs 38 lakh, which runs on diesel, why should we subsidise fuel prices for them?        
	The decision to opt for a token rise came after state-run oil companies complained that they were bleeding because of the widening gap between the high global and stagnant domestic prices. The gap or under-realisations had ballooned to Rs 71,808 crore.        
	The Left responded with the customary clamour for a rollback but hinted that the group was not too unhappy by patting itself on the back for limiting the rate of rise. The CPM claimed that the governments initial idea was to raise petrol prices by Rs 12-16 a litre, diesel by Rs 12, kerosene by Rs 5 and cooking gas by Rs 150 a cylinder.        
	 Analysts said that though the price hike was token, it could add to the inflationary pressure and dissuade the RBI from lowering interest rates.        
	In fact, the Rs 2 on petrol and Re 1 on diesel is no hike at all. We have simply partially restored what we had rolled back earlier, Deora said after a meeting of the cabinet committee on political affairs.        
	Fuel prices were increased last on June 6, 2006, by Rs 4 and Rs 2. But the prices were rolled back in two phases by Rs 2 and Re 1 each on both the occasions. The price of crude oil was at $67 a barrel then. Now it averages around $90 a barrel.        
	The government has been trying to partly compensate oil companies by issuing them bonds. However, as the government cannot run up debt beyond a point, it had been toying with the idea of the token hike, coupled with a tax cut on auto fuel, which could come in this months budget.

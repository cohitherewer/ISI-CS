          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chakraborty                                  
	Calcutta, July 14: In the middle of waging a war against America, Manmohan Singh and the Congress  not necessarily in that order  the CPM has been forced to confront a BJP barb from within.        
	The decision to vote against the government with the BJP contradicts our party congresss resolve to fight against the communal forces. We will have to answer people for years if we commit the mistake, Bengal sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said.        
	Chakraborty is known for making controversial remarks but his proximity to Jyoti Basu  who was described yesterday by Pranab Mukherjee as one of the architects of the now-collapsed Left-Congress relationship  lends the latest remarks resonance the party would find difficult to ignore.        
	The minister was evasive when asked if he had spoken to Basu about his reservations over the partys stance. Chakrabortys misgivings on voting along with the BJP may or may not echo Basus own sentiment but they are unlikely to make the patriarch unhappy.        
	CPM leaders were quick to dismiss the comments, saying the opinion didnt represent the party. According to Benoy Konar, the acting state secretary, what Subhas said is not the partys opinion.        
	Some leaders smelt a desperate bid by the Congress to save the government as it was uncertain of mustering 272 votes but declined to say how the party could have influenced a CPM state secretariat member.        
	Central committee member Mohammad Salim, inducted into the state secretariat along with Chakraborty recently, went as far as suggesting the ministers remarks reflected the Congresss campaign to mislead people and our (CPM) rank and file ahead of the July 22 trust vote.        
	Chakraborty was convinced, though, that voting with the BJP would be a mistake, a repeat of the 1996 historic blunder when the CPM didnt allow Basu to be Prime Minister.        
	Chakraborty claimed that a large section of the Bengal CPM shared his opinion. Not all can come out in public with their opinion but I always speak my mind.        
	The minister described himself as a subordinate party member in relation to Karat when he said he would write to the CPM general secretary to register his protest. Through the subordinate remark, he appeared to suggest that leaders like him were forced to toe the top brasss line.

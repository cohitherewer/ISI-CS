	Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): The Bhabha Hospital doctor who turned away a woman in labour during a doctors strike last week has been suspended.        
	Haridas Walke was the casualty medical officer on April 19 when Seema Bano went to the hospital. Walke and some nurses allegedly refused to admit her. Seema delivered a baby girl in a taxi that day.        
	We interviewed the woman and the doctor was identified, a municipal corporation official said.

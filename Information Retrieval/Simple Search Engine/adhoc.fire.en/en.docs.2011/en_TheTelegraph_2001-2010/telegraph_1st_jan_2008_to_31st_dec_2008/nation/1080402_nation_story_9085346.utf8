The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 1-yr split must for divorce
                                                                                                               1-yr split must for divorce
                            
	Mumbai, April 1 (PTI): Couples seeking divorce will not be able to untie the knot quickly with a court ruling that the one-year mandatory period of separation cannot be shortened under any circumstances.         
	Bombay High Court gave the ruling while dismissing the petition of a city- based couple, who challenged the constitutional validity of Section 13(b) of the Hindu marriage act and pleaded for legal separation within six months of their marriage.         
	Section 13(b) states that divorce through mutual consent requires that the couple stay separately at least for a year before any such plea is considered.         
	Tendency to take impulsive decisions are on the rise. But the ability to act faster in a modernised age must not result in instant decisions relating to delicate human relationships... a division bench of Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice J.P. Deodhar said in their recent judgment.         
	The period of one year is sine qua non. It is meant to be a healing time, to ponder over mutual differences, the court said, dismissing the petition.         
	Lawyer Uday Warunjikar, who argued for the petitioners, said the requirement was unreasonable, and it bore no relation with the objective behind the scheme of divorce by mutual consent.         
	But the high court said: If petitioners argument is to be accepted, then divorce petitions would be filed just a few days after the marriage.         
	There would be no attempt to even fairly understand each other and resolve minor differences which may appear as teething problems of married life.

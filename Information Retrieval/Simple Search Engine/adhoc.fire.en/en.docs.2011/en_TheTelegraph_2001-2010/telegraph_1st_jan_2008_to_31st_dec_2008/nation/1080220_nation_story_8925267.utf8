The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MLAs fight in House over rebels
                                                                                                               MLAs fight in House over rebels
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Orissa Assembly                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19: The Assembly today witnessed unruly scenes with members from both the Opposition and treasury benches exchanging blows.         
	The House met for only six minutes during the entire day, as it was adjourned five times for a period of more than four-and-a-half hours. Earlier, House proceedings were stalled for three consecutive days over the issue of Maoist attacks in Nayagarh on Friday night.         
	As soon as the Assembly met this morning, the Leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, sought permission for an Opposition-sponsored motion for a special discussion on the recent Maoist violence.         
	Speaker Maheswar Mohanty allowed the motion, but not immediately. When Patnaik assured all co-operation from the Opposition and sought permission yet again, the government chief whip Kishore Mohanty interrupted him. Opposition chief whip S.B. Sahu objected to the interruption. Trouble erupted when Opposition MLAs rushed towards Mohanty, as he asked Sahu to sit down.         
	An angry Nimain Sarkar (Congress) pushed three ruling party members one after the other. BJD legislator Dharmananda Behera fell down near the chief ministers seat. Fortunately, the chief minister was not there at that time.         
	Thereafter a scuffle ensued between the ruling party legislators and Sarkar.         
	At one point of time Sarkar and Independent member Saroj Padhi, who supports the ruling BJD in the Assembly, were seen exchanging blows. As the pandemonium prevailed, the Speaker adjourned the House for 30 minutes.         
	As the Opposition members continued their dharna in the Well in the afternoon, and kept insisting on a discussion, deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora adjourned the House for the day.        
	Fresh forces         
	No fresh cache of arms or ammunition were recovered nor was any body of Maoist rebels retrieved today, even as combing operation in forests was intensified after the arrival of additional CRPF forces.         
	While a senior police officer claimed that 35 rebels were killed in the four-day crackdown, there was no official confirmation. Police top brass remained tight-lipped for the third day today, waiting for the chief minister to make his statement in the Assembly first. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik did not make any statement in the House today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveens field day as rural farmer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Naveens field day as rural farmer
          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 8: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik for a few minutes today played the part of a farmer on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya.        
	Clad in spotless white kurta-pyjama, the elite farmer pushed a bullock-driven plough and threw paddy seeds on the field in the remote Nagiapasi village in Dhenkanal, around 200km from Bhubaneswar. In the morning, the chief minister flew to the village in a chopper and participated in a puja for a few minutes before performing the final ritual of sowing the seeds flanked by agriculture minister Surendra Nath Nayak and a host of department officials.         
	Naveen has been playing his down-to-earth role every year on this particular day, that is also celebrated as Krishak Divas ever since the BJP-BJD came to power in Orissa. Akshay Tritiya marks the beginning of the agricultural season and farmers worship mother earth and sow the first seeds on this day.         
	Naveens field move may appease the farmers  the largest vote bank in the state, but it has so far failed to please the Opposition who dubbed the day a gimmick to hoodwink voters. However, upbeat after his activities, Naveen dismissed the allegations and emphasised that his government was farmer-friendly and went on to list out the steps initiated by his government for the peasants.         
	The chief minister also congratulated the farming community for record food grain production (10 lakh metric tonnes) in the state this year. However, it has to be remembered here that the government has been facing a tough time dealing with farmers agitation in western Orissa over the diversion of water from the Hirakud reservoir.

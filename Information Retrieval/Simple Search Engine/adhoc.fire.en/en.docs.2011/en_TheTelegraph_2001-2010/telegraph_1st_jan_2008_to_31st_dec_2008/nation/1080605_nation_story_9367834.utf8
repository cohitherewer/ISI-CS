          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 4: The BJP has said the steep hike in prices of petrol, diesel and LPG was like unleashing economic terror on the nation.        
	It asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to apologise and quit instead of lecturing people on the savage increase.        
	Announcing nationwide demonstrations tomorrow, spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudi said the dangerous decision of Sonia Gandhis government would trigger economic chaos in the country.         
	All assurances of the Prime Minister have proved hollow. Now he is rationalising the hike and the inflation, too. We want to know whether Manmohan Singh is a representative of the IMF or Opec? Rudi said, describing June 4 as a black day.         
	This decision is the last straw for the UPA government and the last nail on the coffin of the common man, whose interests it claims to champion.         
	Rudi was evasive when asked about the alternatives before the government, but accused the Prime Minister of hiding under the garb of economic growth.         
	The dysfunctional government and the Prime Minister have again shown their true colours. They have messed up the countrys economy. They have belied the interests of the common man.         
	The Prime Ministers shallow claims of controlling prices have proved to be a hoax and the aam aadmi is its first casualty, Rudi said.        
	The BJP also targeted the Left parties, saying their crocodile tears only showed the duplicity of the communists.         
	They have supported the government and are equally responsible. The Left cannot insulate itself from the sinister game being played by the UPA government. The country is fully aware of their hypocritical action and they stand completely exposed, the BJP spokesperson said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Alva: Ally eased out                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Congress has sacked a veteran Dalit leader from the helm of its scheduled castes cell in what is being seen as summary retribution for supporting Margaret Alva.        
	The official reason cited by the Congress for easing out Yogendra Makwana, a 75-year-old Dalit leader from Gujarat, as the chairman of the partys scheduled castes department does not mention the Alva controversy.         
	The Congress said Makwana had been publicly criticising the partys policies and functioning for some time, amounting to gross indiscipline. Therefore, the Congress took a serious view of his conduct and sacked him instantly.         
	The action against Makwana came a day after Alva was stripped of Congress positions for alleging that Assembly tickets were sold in Karnataka.        
	Makwana, a former Union minister, dismissed the party action as pre-emptive because he had planned to put in his resignation today and the Congress had got wind of it.         
	After Alva accused certain central and Karnataka leaders of nepotism and selling tickets in the Assembly elections, Makwana was one of the few Congress veterans who endorsed the charges. Margaret Alva is a general secretary and she made a specific charge which the party should have probed instead of punishing her, he said.         
	Makwana said the names of the candidates he had proposed for the coming Assembly elections were never seriously considered.        
	The heads of the state SC departments of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had asked for tickets. But my requests for them were declined. It shows the SC department is a showpiece, Makwana said.         
	 Sources said Makwana could either float his own party or join the BJP. There was speculation of him teaming up with the BSP or the Samajwadi Party.         
	But considering hes from Gujarat, the sources said, it made better political sense for him to join the BJP which remains the states premier party.        
	The Congress was undecided on what it should do with R.L. Jalappa, a Lok Sabha MP from Karnataka who also supported Alva.         
	The MP has criticised the Congress several times. But the sources said that given the UPAs numbers in the Lok Sabha and the possibility of going in for a vote-on-account in February 2009, they didnt want to risk losing Jalappa. Alva and Makwana are not members of either House.

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 7: The superior-general of the Missionaries of Charity, Sister Nirmala, today asked the Orissa government to take strong measures to control the anti-Christian violence.        
	The situation is not good at all and it has to be controlled soon. Taking strong measures is important, she told reporters here after meeting chief minister Naveen Patnaik.        
	All of us have to support the victims through our prayer and peace efforts, she added.         
	For now, Sister Nirmala seemed satisfied with the steps the government planned to take. Im happy now. They (the government) should continue with these measures which are sterner than their previous measures, she said.        
	State police chief M.M. Praharaj said the main accused in the Kandhamal nun rape had been arrested. A police team headed by a woman inspector-general has left for Delhi to bring the nun back and persuade her to participate in the legal process.        
	We will give her all legal protection, Praharaj said.        
	Sister Nirmala, too, said the nun, allegedly raped on August 26, would certainly co-operate if there was a proper atmosphere of justice.        
	Reporters prodded her to comment on the allegation by the Hindu Jagaran Samukhya that Christians had conspired to murder Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Swami Laxmanananda. She replied: There can be all kinds of allegations. The truth has to be found out by the state crime branch, which is probing the matter.        
	Asked to comment on frightened riot victims reluctance to leave relief camps and go home, she said: They cant go back home unless the government settles the issue. It is the governments responsibility.         
	Sister Nirmala said she had discussed the refugees with the chief minister.        
	Opposition leader J.B. Patnaik today met the governor with 40 relief camp inmates. He alleged that some fundamentalists had told these riot victims they would be allowed to return home only if they were willing to convert to Hinduism.         
	Naveen said the government was taking all possible steps to bring back peace. He said officials would visit Kandhamal tomorrow to review the implementation of a special package announced on September 27.        
	The governor today sent a report on the situation to the Centre a day before the Union cabinet meets.

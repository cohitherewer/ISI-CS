	Chug along with chacha Rahul    
	If Rahul Gandhi wants to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, he seems to be on the right track.    
	Travelling on the Jhansi-Delhi Shatabdi Express on April 18, the young Congress MP played the perfect chacha to the children on board.     
	Some of them jumped on to his lap, an IPS officer travelling in the compartment said.    
	Rahul, too, happily interacted with them. He reminded us of Chacha Nehru, whose love for children is known worldwide, he said.    
	If the kids were happy, the parents were not let down either. Rahul exchanged pleasantries with all his co-passengers, the IPS officer said. Several families wanted to pose for photographs with him and he obliged with a smile.     
	Rahul had boarded the train at Jhansi after finishing his Bundelkhand tour.     
	Although police had thrown a security blanket around the coach, Rahul freely interacted with passengers.

	Feast to forge bonds    
	Too many cooks might be known to spoil the broth, but in a village near Chennai, they bind people.    
	The caste divide blurs over steaming plates of rice and daal at an annual feast to mark the Tamil New Year.     
	People from all communities  Naidus, Thevars, Sakkiliars, Vannars, Pariyaris, Brahmins, Muslims and Christians  gather in the small village of Varadharajapuram and each household contributes a kg of rice, 200 grams of pulses, and Rs 10 for grocery and vegetables. The purely vegetarian feast is cooked in the local mandhai (community ground).    
	The 100-year-old festival draws natives of Varadharajapuram village from across the country.     
	The feast gives an opportunity to relish food prepared by Dalits, Thevars, Naidus and other communities, Perumal, a retired teacher, said.    
	e added with a chuckle: Here actually, too many cooks add taste to the feast, defeating the proverbial too many cooks spoil the broth.

	Killer virus stalks jails    
	The HIV virus has crept into Andhra Pradeshs jails.     
	Official sources say 43 prisoners die of AIDS every year and nearly 15 per cent of the jail population is HIV-infected.    
	But the deadliest killer behind bars is the heart. According to Mir Ahmed, additional IG in the prisons department (administration), of 689 deaths in the states jails over the last six years, 279 were caused by heart ailments and 71 by tuberculosis.     
	However, he added, the number of suicides in custody has come down considerably. In the past six years, 689 suicides were reported.     
	Andhra Pradesh High Court has directed the government to provide better amenities to prisoners and keep the premises clean and disease-free.        
	Auto protest    
	Maharashtra will be a little less crowded for three days.    
	Approximately seven lakh auto-rickshaws across the state will go on a strike from Monday midnight to protest a proposal to introduce electronic meters.    
	The meters are as prone to tampering as the existing mechanical ones and in many ways are more delicate since they are prone to damage from dust and moisture, Sharad Rao, who heads the Mumbai auto members union, said.    
	The union has also alleged that the government had gone back on its word to consult the members before taking a decision.     
	We will also think if the strike should be extended further, Rao said.

	Gaya, June 10: Recurrent tremors felt in Gaya during the past fortnight have left chief minister Nitish Kumar a worried man.        
	Four shocks were felt on May 30, June 6 and June 9 in Gaya. After receiving information about a fresh tremor on Monday, Nitish Kumar contacted experts of Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi. The scientists, according to sources, assured Nitish that there was little cause for anxiety, still the chief minister have invited the experts to study the phenomenon and submit findings.         
	Experts from the Centre would be visiting Gaya in the next couple of days, said Gaya district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar. He added Mondays tremor measured around 3.3 on the Richter scale. The previous tremor (felt on June 6, 2008) was 4.7 on the Richter scale. Tremors with the intensity of 5 and more are regarded dangerous. That way, the June 6 tremor was close to the danger mark.         
	Scientists from Roorkie-based research institute are also likely to join the Centre team, sources said.        
	The chief minister also remained in touch with the district officials throughout Monday evening and directed them to get their acts together to create awareness and boost up public morale.        
	Principal home secretary Afzal Amanullah also talked to a US scientist on the issue of Gaya tremors.         
	When contacted Amanullah confirmed that they have assured there was no need to panic.

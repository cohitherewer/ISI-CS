     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 7: The Orissa government has decided to inquire into the alleged channelisation of funds from foreign-funded NGOs to the banned Maoist outfits. 
    
	When reporters drew his attention to the allegation that some foreign-aided NGOs were funding red outfits, which have been otherwise banned by the state, home secretary T.K. Mishra said: We will look into this aspect immediately. 
    
	He said Maoist hand was suspected in the armed mob attack on Brahmanigaon police station and a nearby village on December 26. The commission of inquiry, appointed by the state government, to probe into the clashes may inquire into the possible red angle, he stressed. 
    
	The police had earlier seized country-made guns and ammunition from the mob attack site in Brahmanigaon and the mob had targeted the police, especially the former Gajapati superintendent of police, who was present at the spot. This had bolstered the state suspicion. 
    
	Describing the Kandhamal situation as peaceful, the home secretary said no untoward incidents have been reported in the past 24 hours. While the curfew had been withdrawn from Phulbani town, it has been relaxed in four other sensitive areas across the district. 
    
	However, the deployment of central paramilitary forces will continue till the situation normalises completely, he added. Presently, seven companies of CRPF forces have been deployed in the sensitive pockets of the district. Some 126 persons have been arrested for alleged involvement and as many as 107 cases have been booked. And 49 peace-committees have been formed, which held 61 meetings till date to facilitate peace and harmony. 
    
	Labour intensive works under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have started in riot-hit areas to provide employment to the affected people, said chief secretary Ajit Tripathy. He, however, admitted that the incidents and agitation disrupted the programmes.

	Keeping an eye on the coming Assembly elections, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today announced the engagement of 1-lakh rural workers to be called Gaon Saathi who would assist junior engineers in NREGS implementation, Naveen told reporters today. Training would be imparted to selected candidates at block levels.

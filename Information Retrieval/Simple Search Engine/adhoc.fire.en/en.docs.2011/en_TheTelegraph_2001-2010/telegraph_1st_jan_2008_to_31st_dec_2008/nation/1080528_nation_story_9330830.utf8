The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tough Raje upsets BJP
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tough Raje upsets BJP
          SANJAY K JHA                                           Vasundhara      
	New Delhi, May 27: The BJP central leadership isnt happy with Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje but feels disturbing her now may prove counter-productive.        
	But it is unlikely that she will get the whole-hearted backing from the party in this hour of crisis. Sources said the leadership has taken a grim view of the Gujjar flare-up. Senior leaders feel the situation could have been handled with greater care and maturity.        
	Some are angry with the chief ministers attitude and blame her authoritarian mindset for the violence. The RSS has long been opposed to her style of functioning. Matters have got worse with the partys state unit not working in harmony with the government. The chasm became so wide that the high command had to replace the state unit chief a few months ago.        
	But, despite the problems, the leadership doesnt appear prepared to accept the demand of senior leader Jaswant Singh, who hails from Rajasthan, for Vasundharas removal. Sources said her ouster isnt on the agenda.         
	The situation is grim and few people are happy with her handling of the Gujjar protests. But the debate is not about removing her. We are discussing if she should be left to fend for herself or bailed out, a leader said.         
	The Delhi experience of 1998 is still fresh in the minds of many in the BJP. That year, Sushma Swaraj was made chief minister after removing Sahib Singh Verma months before the Assembly election. The party was routed.        
	Asking Vasundhara to step down will be unwise, too. A tough line against the Gujjars, doesnt weaken her too much, ahead of elections later this year. But yielding to the Gujjars will make Meenas, their rival caste, unhappy. Gujjars affect the outcome in some 20 Assembly seats, while Meenas hold the key in over 50.

                              Security officials examine the wreckage of a car at the site of the blast in Lahore. (Reuters)                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 26 (PTI): A shadowy pro-Taliban group has claimed responsibility for Wednesdays blast in Lahore, a day after media reports in Pakistan quoted unnamed security sources as saying at least one Indian had been arrested for the car bombing.        
	A man identifying himself as Toofan Wazir and claiming to be the commander and spokesperson for Ansar Wa Mohajir, called The News daily from North Waziristan claiming responsibility for the blast that killed a woman and injured four.         
	Wazir, who also claimed responsibility for earlier rocket strikes on Dera Ismail Khan city, threatened more attacks against security forces and government installations to avenge two recent US missile hits in North Waziristan in which several militants from Punjab province were killed.        
	The pro-establishment The News today carried a report saying it appeared obvious that he (Wazir) and his men are pro-Taliban and part of the Pakistani Taliban.        
	Media reports had said hours after the blast intelligence and security agencies in Lahore had arrested an Indian national hailing from Calcutta  identified as Satish Anand Shukla or Satish Anand Sharma  who purportedly worked in the Indian High Commission in London.        
	Geo News later reported the arrest of three more alleged Indian nationals on the basis of Satishs interrogation. A camera and a pistol were found on the trio, the channel said.         
	Lahore police havent confirmed the arrests. The Indian High Commission, too, has not been intimated about the arrests.

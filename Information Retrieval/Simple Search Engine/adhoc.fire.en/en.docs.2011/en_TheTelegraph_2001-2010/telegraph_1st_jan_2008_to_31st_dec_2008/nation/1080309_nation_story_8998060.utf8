	The move comes days after Union finance minister P. Chidambaram announced a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for farmers in this years budget.        
	There was, however, a hiccup over the Andhra bonus on Thursday when finance minister K. Rosaiah said the government had not taken the final decision, although advertisements had appeared in newspapers.        
	The chief minister went into a huddle with the finance minister and marketing minister M. Mareppa the next day. After the meeting, Reddy directed officials to submit a comprehensive strategy paper by next Saturday.        
	Reddy also wants a regulatory authority to fix the quantum of bonus for the farmers.        
	The chief minister said the bonus would help boost agriculture production and stabilise the foodgrain prices.

	New Delhi, April 11: A six-decade-old legal wrangle over the Hyderabad Nizams money locked up in a London account is set to end with an out-of-court settlement with Pakistan and the Nizams heirs.        
	The Union cabinet on Friday gave its approval to pursue an out-of-court settlement with Pakistan and the heirs of the Nizam on the matter of funds lying with the National Westminster Bank, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal told reporters. This will resolve a long-standing item on the Indo-Pak agenda.        
	The Hyderabad Funds Case, dating back to September 1948, had started after the transfer of over 1 million from the account of the government of the Nizam of Hyderabad to Habib Ibrahim Rahimtoola, the then high commissioner of Pakistan in London.         
	The money was transferred on the instructions of the Nizams finance minister but without the consent of his government. The Nizam had then ordered the re-transfer of the money, but it was not carried out.

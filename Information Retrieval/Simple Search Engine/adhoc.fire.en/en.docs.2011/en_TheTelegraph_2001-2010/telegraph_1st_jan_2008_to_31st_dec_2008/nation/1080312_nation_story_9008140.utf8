          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 11: Government Railway Police today stumbled upon 61 live bullets allegedly belonging to a rebel in an abandoned bag.         
	Eyewitnesses claimed that the bullets belonged to a stocky, short man who got down from the train in a hurry, leaving the bag behind.         
	We are not sure where he got down. It could be Cuttack or any other station, conceded an officer of the GRP.         
	The bullets were found in a bag in a compartment of Purushottam Express when the train halted at Cuttack station between 5.15 and 5.30am, said S.K. Sen, the officer in charge of the GRP station.        
	Other belongings found in the bag indicated that the owner was possibly a Naxalite, he told The Telegraph.         
	GRP constables on night patrol discovered the bag that also contained a muffler, a monkey cap, three pairs of socks and a tumbler among other personal belongings.         
	The bullets were kept tied a handkerchief and in a pouch, he added.

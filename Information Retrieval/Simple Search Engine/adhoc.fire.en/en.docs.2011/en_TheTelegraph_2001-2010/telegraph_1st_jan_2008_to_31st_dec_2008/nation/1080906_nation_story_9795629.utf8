          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The sale of nuclear reactors to India will translate into thousands of jobs for US workers and deliver a boost to the American nuclear power industry, the US state department has indicated.         
	The 26-page state department response to the questions sent by the House committee on foreign affairs has spelt out possible benefits that the US-India civilian nuclear deal will yield to America.         
	Senior Indian atomic energy officials have indicated that they plan to import 40 nuclear reactors within the next 12 years, including at least eight 1,000MW-size reactors by 2012.         
	If American vendors win just two of these reactor contracts, it could add 3,000-5,000 new direct jobs, and 10,000-15,000 indirect jobs in the United States, the state department said in its response.         
	The Indian government has conveyed to us its commitment to enable full US participation in Indias civil nuclear growth and modernisation, it added.         
	At least 15 nuclear-related US firms, including General Electric and Westinghouse, had been part of a business delegation led by the US commerce department in December 2006.         
	Participation in Indias market will help make the American nuclear power industry globally competitive, thereby benefiting our own domestic nuclear power sector, the state department said.         
	This initiative will permit US companies to enter the lucrative and growing India market. Access to Indian nuclear infrastructure will allow US companies to build reactors more competitively.        
	Indian scientists view France and Russia as the primary potential partners for any future import of reactors or fuel if the India-US civilian nuclear trade pact and the waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group come through.         
	This view stems from the historical relationships between India and the two countries in high-technology collaboration. France had helped India with space technology and Russia had provided two nuclear reactors under a deal in the 1990s.         
	You have to help us help you, a French diplomat in New Delhi had told The Telegraph in an informal chat more than two years ago, implying that once the India-US pact and the NSG waiver were done, France could step in with supplies.        
	A civilian nuclear trade pact will also allow scientists from both countries to work together to make nuclear energy safer, less expensive and proliferation-resistant, the US state department said.

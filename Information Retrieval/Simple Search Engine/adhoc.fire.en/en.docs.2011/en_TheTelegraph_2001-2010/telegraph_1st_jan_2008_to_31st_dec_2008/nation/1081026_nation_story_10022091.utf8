          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pragya                                  
	Bhopal, Oct. 25: A planeload of anti-terrorist squad sleuths from Mumbai descended on the Madhya Pradesh capital today to round up more suspects in last months Malegaon blast that killed five persons.        
	The team of at least 24 ATS officials remained tight-lipped about Mission Bhopal, but sources said they had detained two persons and questioned several others.         
	Smaller teams of officials left for Bhind, Gwalior, Jabalpur and Indore to gather more information on sadhvi Pragya Singh, now in the custody of Maharashtra police.         
	The 38-year-old sadhvi, accused of plotting the explosion, is from Madhya Pradesh. So are Shivnarain Singh, 36, and Shyam Sahu, 42, who, along with the sadhvi, have been slapped with murder charges.         
	The sources said a state BJP leader had been questioned and the ATS was also looking for a publisher and a financier.         
	The Mumbai team is said to have evidence of panic conversations between those arrested and some persons in Madhya Pradesh minutes before the arrests. Police officials said the squad also wanted to speak to a young BJP leader from Bhind who knew the sadhvi from her student days.         
	Pragya, a postgraduate in history, was known for her inflammatory speeches advocating violence.        
	BJP circles said Pragya reportedly took sanyas following objections to her proposal of marriage to a BJP leader. She joined Swami Avadheshanand Giri, a spiritual guru whose followers include Union minister Arjun Singh.        
	The BJP has distanced itself from the sadhvi, but photographs doing the rounds in Bhopal suggest otherwise. In several photographs taken last year, she is seen sitting close to then state education minister Laxman Singh Gaur, who died in a road mishap this February.         
	Another photograph shows Pragya sitting next to Gaurs widow in the company of chief minister S.S. Chauhan and BJP president Rajnath Singh when they had gone to Indore to offer condolences.        
	Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who faced a defamation suit for accusing the Sangh of manufacturing bombs, said: I have always maintained that Hindu terrorism was as dangerous as jihadi terrorism.        
	The BJPs M. Venkaiah Naidu said the Centre was targeting Hindutva outfits after failing to act against the banned Simi.         
	Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil said two persons had been held in Pune in connection with the Malegaon blast. They had links with some organisations when they were younger, he said.        
	Attack on VHP office        
	Suspected activists of the NCPs student wing today attacked the VHP office in Nashik in protest against the alleged involvement of Hindu organisations in the Malegaon and Modasa blasts.         
	They ransacked furniture and desecrated photographs of national leaders, the VHP said. They also blackened the faces of some VHP workers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 14: Deaths continued to scar Jammu and Kashmir as the Amarnath protests raged on.        
	Police gunned down a young protester in the old city of Srinagar while a retired doctor in Jammu allegedly sacrificed his life for the Amarnath cause.         
	The police said the youth was part of a mob that had tried to attack a police station in Safakadal, prompting them to open fire. Three persons were injured.        
	Two police vehicles were torched at Rawalpora in the Civil Lines area. Pakistani flags were unfurled at some places in the old city and in Lal Bazar.        
	Todays death has taken the toll in the blood-soaked Valley to 24. CRPF inspector-general S.K. Jain has been summoned to New Delhi following repeated complaints about his men using excessive force against protesters.         
	B.R. Khajuria, a 65-year-old retired doctor, committed suicide in Jammus Hira Nagar after consuming poison.         
	Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti leader Suchet Singh said Khajuria had sacrificed his life after he saw some pilgrims returning from the cave shrine being beaten up by people in Banihal. That event disturbed him.        
	Singh, a retired brigadier, said Khajuria had left a suicide note saying his organs should be donated and that nobody should mourn his death but instead recite Om Namah Shivaye five lakh times.        
	But, Singh added, Khajurias wish could not be fulfilled as his organs had been damaged by poison.        
	 Governor N.N. Vohra had organised an all-party meeting today. It was attended by Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti, National Conferences Abdul Rahim Rather and several other local leaders.         
	They appealed to the people to maintain peace and harmony and said all disputes must be resolved through dialogue and reconciliation.         
	The governor urged the leaders to use their influence in clearing the atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion.        
	State chief secretary S.S. Kapoor told the meeting vehicles would be allowed on the Srinagar-Jammu highway twice a day, but in convoys and under police protection.

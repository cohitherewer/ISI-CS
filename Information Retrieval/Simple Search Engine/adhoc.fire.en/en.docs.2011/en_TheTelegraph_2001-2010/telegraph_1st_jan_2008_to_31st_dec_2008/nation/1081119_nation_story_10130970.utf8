          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 18: The demand for reclaiming the building of Apparel Training and Design Centre (ATDC) has hit study there for the past nine days with no solution in sight.        
	About 100 former employees of Konark Television Ltd  closed in October 1999  have been blocking road and restricting ATDC staff and students from entering the building at Rasulgarh Industrial Estate.        
	The one-and-a-half-year old organisation threatened to leave the state if the matter was not sorted out at the earliest. Conceptualised by the Apparel Export Promotion Council, ATDC was inaugurated last year by chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The state textiles and handloom minister had been the pioneer in inviting ATDC here with the vision to generate employment. Till July 2008, ATDC has trained 250 students, including sponsored candidates from state government.        
	The building was allotted to Apparel Export Promotion Council by the general administration department in consultation with the textile and handloom department and Konark TV management. ATDC had paid all the pending dues of Konark TV towards water and electricity charges and got the building with a 99-year lease agreement. The building was also registered in Apparel Export Promotion Councils name.        
	The centre has successfully run for the past several months and there has been good response from youths to enrol themselves for training here.         
	However, the ongoing agitation has apparently ruined its prospects.         
	The admission process for January 2009 session has to be stopped also.         
	The future of the present students is also at stake with their internship arrangements, final examinations and placements being hampered. With the infrastructure being shut down for the past nine days, we are apprehending a loss of more than Rs 11 lakh, said ATDC principal Lopamudra Das Ghosh.        
	ATDC cannot be made a part of such agitation as it has nothing to do with the so-called problems or demands or any complaints whatsoever being stated by this agitators, she added.

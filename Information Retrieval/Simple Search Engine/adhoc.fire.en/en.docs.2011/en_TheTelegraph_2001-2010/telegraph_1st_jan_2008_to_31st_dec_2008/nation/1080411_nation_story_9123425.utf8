	Nagaon, April 10: A cycle bomb exploded in a weekly market in the heart of Assams Karbi Anglong district, injuring 29 people. The blast came on the day peace talks between the Centre and the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity were to resume.        
	 The bomb went off near the vegetable stalls, which were more crowded than the rest of the market.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Posco rules out fears of recession
  - Korean company still keen on project        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           An anti-Posco protester. File picture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 3: South Korean steel giant Posco today said the global economic recession would not have any impact on its Rs 51,000-crore mega steel plant project in Orissa and the company would go ahead with the much-delayed project.         
	There will be no change in our investment plan for our Orissa project despite the global recession, said Posco India director G.W. Sung.         
	Sung, who attended a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary Ajit Tripathy here to review the progress of the 12 MTPA steel plant, said the company rather wanted to expedite the project, which had been delayed.         
	The South Korean company had signed an MoU with the Orissa government in June 2005 for establishment of a 12 MTPA steel plant near Paradip port. The biggest FDI project, however, has failed to take off because of resistance by local villagers. The project was also delayed as the clearance of the Supreme Court was needed for diversion of 2,900 acres of forestland identified for the steel plant.         
	Meanwhile, the company has been accorded stage-I approval by the Centre for the forestland diversion. The stage-II approval will follow after Posco fulfils the conditions imposed by the Centre.         
	The project had also hit a roadblock because of litigation over the iron ore mines lease. Though the state government had earlier recommended the Centre for grant of Khandadhar iron ore mines lease to Posco, it was challenged by other applicants, including PSU Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited in the court. The court had asked the state government hear all the applications for the Khandadhar mines before recommending for grant of lease.         
	Meanwhile, the state steel and mines secretary has completed hearing of all the applications and is in the process of recommending the Centre for grant of lease in favour of Posco, sources said. Against this backdrop, the progress in the matters of land acquisition, mining and rehabilitation plan was reviewed today.        
	Sung said the state government assured them to expedite the forest clearance procedure. The sources said a four-member committee, headed by central empowered committee member S.K. Patnaik, would look into the matter.

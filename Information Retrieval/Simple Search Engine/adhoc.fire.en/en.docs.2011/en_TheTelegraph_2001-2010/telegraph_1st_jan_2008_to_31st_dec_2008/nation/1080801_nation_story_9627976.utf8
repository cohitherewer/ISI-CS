	Bhubaneswar, July 31: Here is some good news for young readers in Orissa.         
	Shishulekha  Orissas own Chandamama  will be back after a gap of 15 long years. The Orissa government has decided to revive the publication of the once popular childrens magazine.        
	The monthly that once used to be one of the most popular read among schoolchildren in the state will be published by the Orissa Sahitya Akademi. Shishulekha happened to be the only government-published childrens magazine in Orissa. The government abruptly stalled its publication 15 years ago. State culture secretary B.K. Jena in a letter to the school and mass education department has pressed for the magazine copyright.         
	An editorial policy will also be finalised for the publication to make the magazine more entertaining and informative, Jena said.         
	Also, to make the publication self-sustainable, chief secretary has suggested that school and mass education department circulates the magazine among students through the ongoing district primary education programme and OPEPA.

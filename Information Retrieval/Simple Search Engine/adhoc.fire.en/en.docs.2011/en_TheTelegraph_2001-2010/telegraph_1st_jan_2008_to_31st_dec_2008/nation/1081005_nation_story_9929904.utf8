          KINSUK BASU                                    
	Singur, Oct. 4: Shattered Asit Jyoti is sleepless in Singur.        
	The 40-year-old farmer, who had given up eight bighas for the Nano, has been tossing and turning all afternoon, trying to catch his siesta.         
	Only yesterday, he had inaugurated two rooms he would have leased to a Calcutta-based businessman, who wanted them as office space for a four-star hotel he was planning to build near the Nano site.        
	Now, Asit knows, the man wont require the office, at least not right away. Nor will there be other takers.        
	Sitting outside his two-storey Jyotipara home in Gopalnagar, Asit, who has two children, is disconsolate.         
	Some six months ago, we met this businessman. We identified land near Himadri Chemicals, for which Rs 15-20 lakh have been paid in advance to farmers from whom the land was to be bought. Even the layout was ready, he said.        
	Asit said the man had told him the hotel would take a year and a half to build and he would require office space to operate out of till then.        
	So, I bought a small plot and built two rooms, spending Rs 4.5 lakh. Yesterday, after the inauguration, we got news about the pullout.         
	Laxman Ghosh, the owner of the biggest readymade garments shop in Singur bazaar, is equally crestfallen.        
	After the Tatas landed, we started getting customers. We had a business of Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000 every day But it is all gone now, rued Ghosh.        
	The owner of an electronics shop in the central market, a few steps away, is as upset. We had heavily stocked up on gadgets and TV sets, keeping in mind the changing dynamics of the Singur market, he said. But he wouldnt give up hope. I think the Tatas will return. They cant go away.

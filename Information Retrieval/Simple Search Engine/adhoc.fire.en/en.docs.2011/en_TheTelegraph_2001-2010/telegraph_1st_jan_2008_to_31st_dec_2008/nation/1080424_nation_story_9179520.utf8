The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Its all about cricket: SRK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Its all about cricket: SRK
          SUBHRO SAHA                           Shah Rukh Khan in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, April 23: If theres a spring in the step of the Kolkata Knight Riders, who sit pretty on top of the IPL at the moment, you can attribute it to a new step team boss Shah Rukh Khan has been teaching them before every match in the dressing room.         
	But when it comes to matters relating strictly to cricket, the Bollywood badshah likes to leave it to the pros.         
	The team is about (John) Buchanan and his boys and I dont interfere in any matters relating to cricket. I wait patiently outside the dressing room during strategy meetings and knock before entering. I have full faith in the team and hope we can go on to win the crown, Khan told a news conference here today.         
	Revealing the new logo of lifestyle retail major Shoppers Stop, he dismissed suggestions that the IPL is simply a milky way of galacticos. Its serious cricket being played out there, and although I would like to at least break even, I dont mind being in the red if my team manages to pull it off, he smiled.         
	Complimenting the Calcutta crowd for its full-throated support, SRK felt the 100,000-capacity of Eden Gardens would help his team.        
	 A wonderful bonding had developed between the stars and the relatively unknown players, he said, promising the Knight Riders charge for the maiden title was set to gather more steam now, even if Im not there to cheer my team personally at all the games.         
	John (Buchanan) thought the first four ties should be used to create a strong team spirit and I feel we are already there. My job from hereon will be to contribute from the outside and create a standard that would attract eyeballs and hence, more sponsorship. Im working my socks off on that front.

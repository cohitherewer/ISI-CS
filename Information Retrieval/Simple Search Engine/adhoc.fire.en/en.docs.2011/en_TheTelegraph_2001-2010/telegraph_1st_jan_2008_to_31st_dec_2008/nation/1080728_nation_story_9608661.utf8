	Cuttack, July 27: The three-year-old controversy over selection and appointment of ad hoc judges for states fast-track courts took a new turn with the Supreme Court issuing a stay order on the cancellation of appointment of seven judges by Orissa High Court.         
	The Orissa High Court on July 3 had cancelled the services of seven ad hoc additional district judges in Cuttack, Patnagarh, Aska, Athagarh, Jagatsinghpur, Jeypore and Sundergarh.         
	The order came after it was seen that the judges had continued in service, despite securing 50 per cent marks.         
	Subsequently, all seven filed special leave petitions in the Supreme Court. While admitting the petitions the apex court has stayed the operation of the high court order. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan issued the interim order on Friday.         
	Selection and appointment of ad hoc judges for fast-track courts have been embroiled in controversy since 2005 when a section of lawyers challenged the process adopted for filling up 15 posts.         
	Candidates, who had secured less than 50 per cent marks were selected, while deserving candidates (with more than 50 per cent marks) were pushed down in the selection list by limiting their via voce test marks, it was alleged.         
	While disposing off the petitions the high court had invalidated the selection of 12 of the 15 appointed in 2004 on the ground that they were made without confirming to the stipulations prescribed in the advertisement inviting candidates to apply for posts.        
	The Supreme Court later upheld the high court order on September 9, 2005.

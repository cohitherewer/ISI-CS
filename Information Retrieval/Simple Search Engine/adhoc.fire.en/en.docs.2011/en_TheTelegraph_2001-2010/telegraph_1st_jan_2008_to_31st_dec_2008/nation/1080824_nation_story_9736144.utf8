          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Aug. 23: Cashew nuts and apples were the first in the line of fire. Now, the Kashmiri wazwan has got a taste of the Amarnath fury.        
	Last night, a group of protesters put an end to a three-day Kashmiri food festival at a hotel run by the Madhya Pradesh government even before it had started.        
	Members of the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti and the Bajrang Dal stormed into Palash Residency and began breaking everything in sight.        
	A shikara was the first casualty. Then, it was the turn of some plants and windowpanes.        
	Guests at Palash had just taken a few sips of a complimentary drink when the protesters barged in. The spread of tabak maaz, goshtaba, badam qorma, yakhni, dry fruit pulao, and firni lay untouched.        
	Police arrived at the hotel but, according to some guests, instead of driving the mob away, they were busy in discussions. By 9pm, when yakhni was to be served, kicking off the feast, the guests were asked to clear out.         
	A group of Italians present at the hotel wondered why Indians were protesting against serving food from a region that was part of India.         
	Samiti convener Anil Goel accused the BJP of double standards. On the one hand, they are demanding revocation of land for the Amarnath shrine board and, on the other, a BJP government is organising a food fest which hurts the sentiments of thousands of people fighting for the cause.         
	Bajrang Dal leader Subhash Sudele echoed Goel.         
	A week ago, Sudele and Goel had burnt Kashmiri apples, clothes, cashew nuts and wooden handicrafts.

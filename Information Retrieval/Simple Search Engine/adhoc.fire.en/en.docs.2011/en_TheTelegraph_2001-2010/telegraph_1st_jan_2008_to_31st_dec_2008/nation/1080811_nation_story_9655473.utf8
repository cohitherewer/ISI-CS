  - 1000 creatures in safe hands          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Bats. Telegraph picture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 10: Otherwise known as pests, bats have taken a different space in the minds of villagers in Kural.        
	The village in Odogaon block of Nayagarh district is home to about 1,000 of bats living peacefully for generations even as the number of bats have been dwindling across the world over the years.        
	Some 30km from Nayagarh town, the village has 6,000 households with a population of more than 20,000.         
	Shedding centuries of ignorance, myth and superstitions that bats are ominous, the villagers have been conserving bats on their own efforts without any specialised expertise.        
	While no one in the village exactly knows when the conservation started, village seniors date it back to the pre-Independence era when the villagers discovered that hundreds of bats taking shelter in a Banyan and an Ashoka tree near a pond close to the village temple.         
	Initially, the bats stay put to these two trees alone. But with the increasing population, the only flying mammals started to disperse to adjacent trees in and around the water body.        
	Arun Mishra, an active member of the village committee for bat conservation, said that despite the attack on their crops, not a single villager harms them.         
	Not only this, the villagers guard the bats from attacks by neighbouring villagers. The committee, formed about five years ago, has fixed a fine of Rs 501 if a person is found killing these creatures. We have fined many youths from the neighbouring villages in the recent past who tried to hurt the animals. The rules are same for everyone, he said.        
	During the scorching summer, bats generally fall off from trees and die.         
	It is really touching to see how villagers place water in pitchers and hang them in the trees inhabited by the bats to help cope with unbearable weather. This helps them quench thirst in extreme conditions, Arun said.         
	Bats provide ecological advantage more directly beneficial to humans and responsible for pollinating and dispersing seeds of economically important plants, said Shweta Mishra, senior environmentalist.         
	The government should look into how such activities can be encouraged and think of how such community conservation initiative can also provide economic benefits to the host communities, she said. About 45 per cent of the worlds bat species are endangered, threatened or near threatened.

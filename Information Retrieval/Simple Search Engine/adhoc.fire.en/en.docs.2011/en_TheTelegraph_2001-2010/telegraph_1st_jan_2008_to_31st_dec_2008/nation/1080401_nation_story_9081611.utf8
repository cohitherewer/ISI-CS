	Srinagar, March 31: A Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant believed to be the outfits most talented improvised explosive device expert was arrested today.         
	Rayees Ahmad Dar alias Rayees Kachroo was caught in a Srinagar hideout during a joint operation by police and the CRPF, Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai said.        
	He was the most talented improvised explosive device expert of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen. With his arrest, we hope IED explosions can be prevented to a large extent, Sahai said.         
	Kachroo joined militancy only five years back, but was allegedly responsible for some of the deadliest attacks on security forces. He was involved in an IED blast at Wachi in December 2004 that killed 10 army men, including a major, the police said.         
	There are 13 cases of murder registered against Kachroo in Awantipora in Pulwama district alone. He is said to have killed two dozen people, including soldiers.

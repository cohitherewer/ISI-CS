                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Former governor lashes out
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sinha                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The man in the middle of the land row in Jammu and Kashmir that has led to killings, street-fighting and re-ignited the secessionist movement today asked the Centre to give up its policy of appeasement and practically endorsed a hard-line Sangh Parivar stand.         
	Lt Gen. (retired) Srinivas Kumar Sinha, who quit as governor of the state in June shortly after granting the disputed land to the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board, alleged that he was bringing peace to Kashmir and the current protests in the Valley were a conspiracy by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Islamic fundamentalists to promote a Pakistan-sponsored project.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed the situation in Jammu and Kashmir today where violence is continuing over the Amarnath land row, reports PTI.         
	Sinha was the governor of Jammu and Kashmir from June 4 2003 to June 3 2003. He was also the ex-officio chairperson of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board to which 100 acres of forest land was diverted a week before he left office, sparking protests in the Valley.         
	It (the protests) was also the start of a communal movement to hijack my efforts to promote moderate and liberal outlook as against fanatic and intolerant outlook which has been the root cause of militancy in Kashmir, Sinha said in the first of a series of lectures in memory of Field Marshal S.H.F.J Manekshaw.         
	The former governor used the occasion in an effort to clear his name after several allegations  including from cabinet ministers  that it was his decision to transfer the land that has led to the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Sinhas successor, N.N. Vohra, has revoked the Baltal land transfer order, a decision that Sinha today said exemplified a policy of appeasement. Such ill-advised appeasement, ignoring high court judgements and legal provisions caused great consternation among the people of Jammu, he said.         
	The present conflict in Jammu and Kashmir is not between Hindus and Muslims as such, but between nationalists and anti-national forces, he said, asking for an immediate resolution. He left little doubt that he favoured taking a hard-line against the protestors in Kashmir.         
	He said there were now also demands being made for a reorganisation of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board which resulted in a spontaneous outburst of pent-up feelings of the people of Jammu and against the discrimination they had been suffering for years.

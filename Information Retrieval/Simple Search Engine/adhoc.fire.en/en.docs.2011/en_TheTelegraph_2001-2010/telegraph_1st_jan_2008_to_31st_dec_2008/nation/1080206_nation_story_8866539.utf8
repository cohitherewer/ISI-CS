The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu kin hums different tune
                                                                                                            Lalu kin hums different tune
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 5: Some days ago, Union minister Ramvilas Paswan was all praises for his son, Chirags foray into Bollywood.         
	But now its Lalu Prasads turn to wax eloquent about his nephew Nagendra Rai, who recently released a Bhojpuri album called Deewana Kailu Gori.         
	Though Lalu Prasad, or any other big politician for that matter, was not present at the release function, social activist Anil Sulabh graced the event.         
	Nagendra (who has dropped the Yadav tag, too) said: I have always liked Bhojpuri songs and rather fancied myself as a singer. When so many people can try their luck in Bhojpuri songs and films, why cant I?         
	The nephew was all smiles and at ease at the event and why not? This is not Naendras first brush with fame.         
	He has previously sung in a Hindi film (Pyar Mangti Hai Quarbani) and in a Bhojpuri movie, Sindurwa Bada Anmol Sajanwa.         
	At todays event he sang the title track from his album and received immediate applause from the audience for his different quality of voice and style.        
	The album was produced by Nisar Ahmed Tamanna and was directed by Naseem Khan and Payal.         
	Nagendra has collaborated with other singers for this particular project, including Munna Singh, Fauji Monto Singh, Sangeet Rai and Indu Singh  all known names in the music scene.        
	Nagendra is excited about the initial response he has received so far. At least, his singing career has been kinder to him. Nagendra unsuccessfully contested the 1999 Lok Sabha election as an Independent candidate. He is also a contractor. The 31-year-old had once fancied himself a sportsman and had taken to politics afterwards, though not with the RJD. But his notions about his political clout landed him in half-a-dozen extortion and criminal cases.         
	While one would have predicted that scions of Bihars leaders would take to politics, Lalus sons  Tej Pratap and Tejaswi  have stayed away from the glare and wish to be cricketers. Ram Vilas Paswans son has been bitten by the acting bug, while Nitishs son wishes to be an engineer.

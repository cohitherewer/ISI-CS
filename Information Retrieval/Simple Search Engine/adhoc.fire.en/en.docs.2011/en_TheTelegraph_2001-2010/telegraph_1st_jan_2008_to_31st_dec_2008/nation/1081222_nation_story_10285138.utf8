	Kathmandu, Dec. 21 (PTI): Nepalese authorities have busted a fake currency network criss-crossing Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Gulf states with the arrest of its alleged Pakistani kingpin, believed to have links with terror outfits in South Asia.         
	Aslam Ansari, a 58-year-old from Karachi, and his accomplice, Mohammad Jehangir, 25, from Sitamarhi district in Bihar, were arrested along with their Nepalese partner Nasim Ansari, 27, yesterday. The three were nabbed from a hotel in Birgunj, a border town in southern Nepal, according to police inspector Krishna Prasad Sharma.        
	The police have seized Rs 1.2 lakh in counterfeit currency of Rs 1,000 denomination from the hotel. The arrests were made on the basis of information from Sajid Ansari of Birgunj who was arrested in November with counterfeit Indian currency worth nearly Rs 8 lakh.        
	In Nepal, possession of Indian currency in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is illegal.         
	Sharma said Aslam had travelled between Pakistan and Kathmandu six to seven times in two-three years and was arrested in Kathmandu in 2005 but released on bail later.         
	The police officer said the three may have terrorist connections. The police suspect their involvement in narcotics and arms supply too. We are investigating whether he (Aslam) has supplied fake currency to terrorists, a police officer said.                    
	The arrests have come at a time when India has blamed Pakistan-based militants of carrying out terror attacks in Mumbai. Nepal police reportedly learnt from Nasim that the smuggling network had spread from Pakistan to Kathmandus Nakhu jail.         
	Nasim ran a travel agency in Kathmandu and provided fake travel documents to Pakistanis in Nepal to facilitate their trips between Pakistan and Kathmandu, the police said.                    
	The Rs 1.2 lakh counterfeit currency we recovered was just a sample of a bigger deal and we have information that they were trying to make give one crore to an Indian party, a police officer said.        
	The Indian embassy in Kathmandu has welcomed the investigation by Nepal police. Though we have not yet received any official notification from the Nepal government but we welcome the step as it will be beneficial for India and Nepal to control such activities, said Tsering W. Sherpa, spokesperson of the Indian embassy.

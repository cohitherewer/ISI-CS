          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chhagan Bhujbal                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 9: Like Samson shorn of his hair, Chhagan Bhujbal is deputy chief minister without the home ministry.        
	The Nationalist Congress Party leader, whose surname means man with powerful arms, got the official No. 2 post in the new Ashok Chavan government today.         
	But he watched party colleague Jayant Patil run away with the Maharashtra home ministry, now even more important after the Mumbai terror attack.        
	Patil, presenter of a record 10 budgets as finance minister in the Congress-NCPs long reign, was thought to have just the clean image for the job, sources said.         
	Bhujbal apparently remains tainted by his alleged proximity to stamp-paper scamster Abdul Karim Telgi, at least in his party boss Sharad Pawars eyes.        
	He was sworn in Chavans deputy in the 39-member Congress-led government yesterday, but the portfolios were handed out today. Some NCP sources claimed Bhujbal himself had been reluctant to take charge of home affairs, but others said Pawar had played a key role.         
	Bhujbal continues with his public works portfolio.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhagalpur, June 15: The central governments compensation to the kin of victims of 1989 Bhagalpur riots would fail to heal some wounds.         
	Mohammed Arif (29), who lost his mental balance during the riots and now spends his days chained in a tiny room, may not be able to reap benefits of the package.         
	Chained in his dirty room in Ashrafnagar of Sahazangi locality on the outskirts of Bhagalpur, Arif does not take kindly to strangers.         
	Move fast, they are coming please dont kill me. I am innocent and poor, he said when this reporter tried to approach him.         
	His father, Mohammed Salim, apologised for Arifs violent outburst.         
	Salim, a petty trader, manages to arrange two square meals for his family comprising his wife, son and two unmarried daughters. Treatment is certainly an improbable dream.        
	Arif was the oldest among all siblings and the family lived together in Nurpur village under Nathnagar police station in Bhagalpur. On October 26, 1989, rioters attacked Arifs village, killed 13 people and shot Arifs younger brother, Mohammed Jalil.         
	Though Allah saved Jalil, Arif saw 13 more people getting killed. He was 10 years old at that time. And he is yet to get over the brutal incident, said Zulekha Begum, Arifs mother.         
	On October 27, the riot was still on and Arif and I were fleeing the village after spending sleepless night in a paddy field. We were spotted and people started chasing us. Some of them threw stones and one hit Arif, Zulekha recalled.         
	By 1991 Arif had transformed into a different boy. The family tried to cure by getting him married off  and failed twice.         
	People told us that the government is going to pay Rs 1.25 lakh to those who sustained injury during the riots. Would Arif be entitled? Can we free him off chains? Salim asked. Asrafnagar, Sahajangi, where the family is currently residing is 5km from Bhagalpur.         
	Nearly 250 families settled there after being uprooted from their native villages  Bhotoriya, Nurpur, Govindpur, Kothachalk, Kamarganj and Choti Sahebganj  during the riots.         
	My husband and I once dreamt that we will make our daughter, Ladlee, an educated woman. Now, I dont even have the money to get her married off, said Shabnam, who lost her husband, Mohammed Jamal, during the riots at Nurpur village. The family comprising the mother-daughter duo barely manages to survive.        
	There are many such Arif and Shabnam in the 1,700 families that have applied for compensation after losing either family or property. The government has compensated 850 families, while seven are still in the waiting list.         
	There are around 264 families that enjoy monthly a pension initiated by the Nitish Kumar government, while 26 families are still under scrutiny, said Mushtaq Ahmed, the special additional district collector of Bhagalpur. Ahmad admitted that earlier the government had announced compensation for 126 families, but withdrew after noticing lapses in the claims.        
	Arifs tryst with the chain seems far from being over  at least till the time he learns to convince the administration of his plight.

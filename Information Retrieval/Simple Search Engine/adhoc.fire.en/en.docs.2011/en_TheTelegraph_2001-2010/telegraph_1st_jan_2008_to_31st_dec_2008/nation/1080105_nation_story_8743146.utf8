	Cuttack, Jan. 4: Return of Hanuman (see picture below) may be enthralling homes across Orissa, but the films producers and distributors are not happy, as most homes are viewing pirated CDs of the recently released animation flick.        
	Surprise raids undertaken by Cuttack police at suspected markets have revealed Orissa audiences top two choices CDs of the second Hanuman film and pornographic videos.         
	In the recent raids, the police also seized four computers, electronic equipment used for copying, more than 25,000 pirated CDs and a number of blank CDs.         
	During the weeklong raids, a Madhupatna police squad also seized 5,000 pirated CDs, a computer and electronic equipment (for copying) from a house in Shankarpur following a tip-off. Madhupatna inspector in charge P.K. Jena conceded that the maximum number of CDs were copies of the childrens film. The pirated CDs manufactured at the house were being sent to city parlours, Jena said.         
	One Shankarsan Sethi has been arrested at the house.         
	Malgodown police, too, seized some 20,000 pirated CDs at Rehman Square in Jobra. One Imtiaz Khan, who was caught, apparently is a key player in a wider nexus spreading to parts of the state.         
	The police busted pirated CD racket based on a tip-off from a T-Seriess anti-piracy lawyer. T-Series, the biggest audio company in India had recently acquired the video rights of Return of Hanuman, a co-production of Toonz Animation and Percept Picture Company.         
	The film has been written and directed by Anurag Kashyap. Other Bollywood recent releases were also a part of the loot.

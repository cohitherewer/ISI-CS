          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Alva: Moms agony                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Rumours that Margaret Alva had resigned as a general secretary of the Congress swirled through the day but the party refused to confirm it, fuelling speculation that the high command could be considering action against her.        
	Alva is at the centre of a storm after alleging that Karnataka Assembly poll tickets were sold and other leaders relatives favoured.        
	Sources said she was likely to lose the general secretarys job and could be dropped from the Congress Working Committee, the partys highest policy-making body.        
	However, some leaders were inclined to give the 66-year-old Alva, who has been with the Congress for close to four decades, the benefit of the doubt and said she could be let off with a rap on the knuckles if she sent a signal of regret.        
	But all sections of the party appeared to agree that she had violated party discipline.         
	Alvas main grouse was that her son Nivedith didnt get a ticket though relatives of other leaders were made candidates in the state polls this May.        
	Sonia Gandhi was said to be perturbed about the timing of Alvas outburst as it came weeks before Assembly polls in six states and could give the BJP an issue on a platter.        
	Whether she made the remarks voluntarily or involuntarily we dont know now, the Congresss chief spokesperson, M. Veerappa Moily, said.        
	Sources admitted that while irregularities in ticket distribution werent new in the Congress, the fact that a leader of Alvas stature had spoken about them publicly had emboldened others.        
	This evening, party workers from Rajasthan, where elections will be held on December 4, descended on the Congress headquarters to complain about tickets being bartered away for a consideration.        
	The concern over Alvas show of rebellion has increased in the wake of reports that key Karnataka leaders such as R. Jalappa, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and Siddharamaiah had egged her on.        
	Speculation was rife that the leaders were planning to float a regional outfit  until senior Delhi functionaries spoke to the group and nipped the moves in the bud. Sharief and Siddharamaiah later criticised Alva, but obliquely.        
	Moily refused to confirm if Alva had offered to resign as general secretary when she was summoned by defence minister A.K. Antony, heading the partys disciplinary committee, on Monday night.        
	Instead of going public, she could have brought her complaints to a party forum or directly to Sonia, whom she meets at least once a fortnight, Moily said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gavai bids adieu, misty eyed
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, July 3: Bihar Governor R.S. Gavai took many by surprise with his misty eyes while inaugurating the Mukhyamanti Kanyadan Yojna today  probably his last gubernatorial assignment in Bihar.         
	An emotional Gavai, who would be taking up his new post as the Kerala governor soon, today spoke of his soft spot for Bihar and his very special relationship with its people and its government. I am leaving you with a heavy heart, he said, while wiping his tears.         
	In the past, the state had witnessed long stints of torrid relationship between the occupants of Raj Bhavan and the ruling establishment. But Gavais tenure represents the best ever. The Congress veteran from Maharashtra  a state where a political section has been attacking people from the Hindi heartland  was fulsome in his praise for the state and its chief minister. I have enjoyed a cordial relationship with Nitish Kumar, he said, adding: I am happy that he (Nitish) and the people have loved the way I have worked in Bihar.         
	Ironically, it was the ruling NDA establishment that reacted strongly when the Centre decided that Congress member Gavai and Bhatia would swap positions.         
	Why has the Centre replaced Gavai three years before the completion of his term? The move violates the Sarkaria Commission norms, said JD(U) spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary.        
	On his final day, Gavai inaugurated a scheme where the government would deposit Rs 2,000 in the name of girls born into BPL families on or after November 2, 2007. The girls would be entitled to Rs 18,000 when she completes 18 years of age. UTIs asset management fund will handle the scheme.

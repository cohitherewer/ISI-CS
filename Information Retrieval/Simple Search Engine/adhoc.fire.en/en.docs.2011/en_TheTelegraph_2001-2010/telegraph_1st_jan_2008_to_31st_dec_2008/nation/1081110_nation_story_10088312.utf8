                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Safe Bhutan sees cash in market meltdown

	Thimphu, Nov. 9: Secure from the global financial crisis because of its closed markets, Bhutan hopes to attract foreign investors otherwise shy of putting money in tottering economies, says its top banker.        
	We are hoping for more foreign direct investment now because investors who may otherwise not be keen on countries affected by the crisis know their money will at least be safe in Bhutan, says Kinga Tshering, CEO of Bank of Bhutan, the equivalent of Indias Reserve Bank.        
	Closed to foreign investment  and of most other things from beyond India  for much of the last century, Bhutan has now started opening up its economy, following in the footsteps of Indias liberalisation programme.         
	Foreign direct investment (FDI) is now allowed in most sectors, including infrastructure. In tourism, the cap is 70 per cent. That means an Indian, for instance, can hold 70 per cent shares of a hotel he opens in Bhutan.        
	But Tshering, also one of the countrys top economic strategists, wants more. We need to liberalise more. Ideally, we should have started the process earlier, when India did in 1991. We could have been riding the boom that India witnessed.         
	Even now, we hope to open up and piggyback on Indias growth story, a minister in the Bhutan government said, on the condition of anonymity, concerned that his remarks might be misconstrued as being critical of the previous king of Bhutan.        
	The governments policy, the minister explained, is to liberalise enough to offer a plethora of investment opportunities, while at the same time maintaining a semblance of the traditional caution Bhutan has exercised.         
	Despite its safe banks, Bhutan isnt attractive enough for individuals to deposit money in. The truth is though we want Indians, for instance, to put their money with the Bank of Bhutan, which is probably safer than any Indian bank, it would be unrealistic immediately because the returns we can offer are very poor, he said.         
	A similar global financial crisis in the future may benefit Bhutan  it would take a hit, but could attract more from abroad  if it liberalises to offer safe avenues where the countrys banks can seek returns, the minister said.        
	Tshering agreed on the need to liberalise more. The banking sector, he said, was already witnessing the effects of such a policy.         
	Applications from 10 banks to operate in Bhutan are pending with the government, he said. These include Indias Punjab National Bank, a Kazakh bank, and eight private Bhutanese enterprises, he said.        
	The number is like an avalanche in a country where the Bank of Bhutan was the only one allowed till last year, when a Bhutanese private enterprise got the nod.                    
	Tshering also points to Bhutans stock market stability, for which it can thank the traditional economic policy it followed.         
	Only 14 companies are listed on the tiny exchange. While markets in India took a beating that reduced the sensex to half its value in 10 months, the exchange here remained unaffected, Tshering said. Thats because theres hardly any trading, he laughed.

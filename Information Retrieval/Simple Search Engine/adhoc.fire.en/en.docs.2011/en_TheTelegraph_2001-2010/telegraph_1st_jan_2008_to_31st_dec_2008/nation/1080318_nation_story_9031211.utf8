          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: Congress MPs Priya Dutt and Sandeep Dikshit today kicked up a ruckus in Parliament, asking the Centre what it had done to reduce exam stress on children.        
	Accusing the government of doing little through a calling attention motion, the duo said its promise to protect students from unwanted pressures and bring a package to focus on integrated personality development had remained on paper.        
	Sandeep, son of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, said a leading Delhi hospital had in its report cited exam stress as the trigger for children taking to smoking, drugs and anti-depressants.        
	Children were also consuming lizards and the pain-relieving ointment Iodex to fall ill before exams, he quoted the report as saying.        
	Sandeep brought up the issue of child suicides in the capital, saying there had been six deaths in the last 15 days. The figure, however, did not tell the whole story as some 300 children had tried to kill themselves in the same period.        
	He quoted a British researcher as saying Indian students were 70 times more likely to attempt suicide than those in his country.        
	Priya quoted another report that said 6,000 children had committed suicide in the country in 2006 and asked for a deeper look into what was driving them to extreme measures.        
	We read everywhere that children are our future. But we do very little for them. We are crushing their confidence in the classrooms, she said.        
	With every failed child, we kill a hope. We are suppressing their freedom of creativity by burdening them. Why should a childs life be decided by one examination?        
	Junior human resource development minister M.A.A. Fatmi tried to list steps taken by the government, such as no homework for children up to Class V and 15 extra minutes for Class X and XII students to read question papers.        
	But MPs cutting across parties refused to buy his arguments and shouted him down each time he tried to speak.        
	Sandeep said Fatmi may have been misled by babus. My daughter is in Class V and she regularly gets homework. It seems the government is not taking the issue seriously, he said.

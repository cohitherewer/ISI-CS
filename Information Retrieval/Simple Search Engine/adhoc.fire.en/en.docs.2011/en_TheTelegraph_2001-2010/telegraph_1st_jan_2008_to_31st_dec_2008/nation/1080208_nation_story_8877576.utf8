          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Feb. 7: A Class XI student shot at and critically wounded his classmate because he had informed their principal about his absence from the hostel.        
	Manvendra Singh fired at Asish Tripathi around 8.30 this morning with a country-made revolver at Chitrakoots Inter College, 180km from here. Manvendra, who had taken the weapon from his friends outside the college, is absconding. The victim was rushed to Allahabad Medical College Hospital. He is critical.        
	Chitrakoot senior superintendent of police S. Dhoudiyal said Manvendra had disappeared yesterday around 11am from the hostel, apparently to watch a film.         
	Asish told the principal about this and Manvendras parents were called to the college at 9am today, where they were to be told that their son wasnt following the rules. The shooting occurred before the meeting could take place.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A CRPF jawan stands guard on a street in Srinagar on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	Srinagar, May 12: Security forces today killed a militant trying to force his way into army headquarters in Samba, a day after eight persons died in a gunfight between militants and forces in the district.        
	A strike called by several political groups to protest the Samba attack paralysed life in Jammu. Two jawans, two militants, and four civilians, including a photojournalist, were killed in the daylong encounter yesterday.         
	Police sources said the militant who was killed today had managed to escape yesterday. Early today, he resurfaced near the armys 168 Brigade headquarters and opened indiscriminate fire at the sentry outside the residential quarters.         
	After an hour-long operation, the militant was shot dead only a few hundred metres from the spot where the two militants were gunned down yesterday.         
	The high point of todays operation was that it was conducted with surgical precision with no casualty in the army, defence spokesman Lt Colonel S.D. Goswami said.         
	The spokesman said the militants had infiltrated into the Samba sector and were trying to repeat the Kaluchak incident, in which a fidayeen squad killed around 35 family members of army men on May 14, 2001.         
	With the elimination of one more militant, the army managed to foil their designs, Goswami said. However, he did not rule out the presence of more militants in the area.         
	A huge quantity of arms, ammunition and equipment found at the site indicates that the militant group was well briefed about the targets in the Jammu region, so that an atmosphere of mass terror is created to influence the forthcoming elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Goswami said.         
	The sources said more encounters were likely as militant movement had been spotted in Kathua district.         
	The security forces have increased vigil in the area and we are following their movements, an officer said.         
	The slain militants are believed to have been part of a group which crossed the international border on Friday. The Border Security Force had earlier claimed the group was successfully repulsed.         
	Al-Mansoorian, a militant outfit, has claimed responsibility for yesterdays attack. The group is believed to be a shadow organisation of the Lashkar-e-Toiba.

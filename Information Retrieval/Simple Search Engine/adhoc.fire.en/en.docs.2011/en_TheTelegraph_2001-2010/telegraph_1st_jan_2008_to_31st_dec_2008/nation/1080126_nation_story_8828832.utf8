     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: Farmland compensation in Bengal should at least match the future stream of income that would have flown from the plot had it stayed with the owner, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.
    
	The package should be worked out in a manner that the total income from the land, for example over the next 100 years, should be commensurate with the income from the compensation if kept in a bank, he said at the India International Trade Fair organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    
	The per capita availability of land is the lowest in the country, Dasgupta said. At a larger level, there is no problem but at the level of farmers, the situation is different because land is an asset, promising future income, for them, he said. 
    
	The suggestion was that this could be the reason there were protests during land acquisition.
    
	Such packages, giving land losers enough control over the future, should be drawn up through frank and intimate discussions with farmers, he said. Lessons should be learnt from the Singur and Nandigram episodes, Dasgupta said.
    
	We should face the problem squarely and take appropriate steps for the future.
    
	He said there was no significant problem, barring Singur and Nandigram, for large units that wanted to acquire single chunks of land. The problem at Singur, too, has been overcome, he added.
    
	Investment burst
    
	Bengal is poised to take the second spot in realised investment  funds that actually reach the table after being proposed  with a tally of Rs 36,369 crore between 1991 and November 2007, Dasgupta said, citing the Centres data. The state is now third on the list, after Gujarat and Maharashtra.
    
	We have Rs 1.3 lakh crore of proposals on the table, which will materialise in the next three to five years. At this rate, if the quantum of realised investment is Rs 4,000 crore per year now, it could reach Rs 40,000 crore later, Dasgupta said.

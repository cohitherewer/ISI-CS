	New Delhi, June 13: A company cannot be evicted from a rented house merely on the ground that the accommodation was used by an employee other than the one named in the lease deed, the Supreme Court has clarified.         
	The deed can mention the name of a specific official but using the house for another executive will not constitute a change in use of the premises under law, a two-judge bench said today upholding earlier orders of an Alipore court and Calcutta High Court.         
	K.B. Saha and Sons had leased a flat in their building on Gariahat Road to Development Consultants.         
	The lease deed signed by the two sides stated that the house was meant for the exclusive use of Keshab Das, who was an executive of Development Consultants.        
	The apex court upheld the view taken by the high court, saying letting out property to a particular officer couldnt be the purpose.         
	As an example, it said evictions could be allowed if a house let out for an electronics outlet was converted into a grocery store.

	Patna, Oct. 27: An emotional Rahul Raj had been as agitated as any other Patna youth over the attacks on Bihar railway job seekers in Mumbai, his friends and teachers said here today.        
	But the decent and career-oriented 25-year-old never joined the violence and arson by protesting students that rocked Bihar over the past week.        
	News that he had been shot dead by police this morning after allegedly firing a revolver inside a Mumbai bus while abusing Raj Thackeray  left his neighbours, friends and teachers stunned and sceptical of the official version of the encounter.        
	Decorative lights blinked, as if mirroring the disbelief, on Diwali eve at the two-storey Patna home where Rahuls father Kundan Prasad Singh and stepmother barred themselves in for most of the day.        
	When Kundan, a middle-class businessman who owns a garage, emerged to speak to the media, he demanded a CBI probe.        
	How can a boy who had gone to Mumbai for the first time do any such thing? Some conspirators might have pressed a gun into his hands to frame him and kill him, Kundan said.        
	He was alone. The police could have easily caught him if at all he had fired in the air. Why did they kill him if he had not killed or hurt anyone? Only a CBI inquiry can bring out the truth.        
	One passenger in the bus, however, was wounded in the firing, although its not clear if the bullet came from Rahuls gun or the polices.        
	Rahul, an X-ray technician who recently earned a radiology diploma from the Indian Institute of Health Education here, had gone to Mumbai to look for a job. He left on Friday. He called me from a PCO on Sunday after reaching Mumbai. He told us he would scan the Sunday papers and appear at a walk-in job interview, Kundan said.        
	Anil Sulabh, director of Rahuls institute, said: Rahul was a career-oriented, decent student. Although a bit emotional, he never did anything violent or misbehaved with anyone here.        
	Rahuls college friends demonstrated on the campus amid authorities fears about another round of violent protests in the state after the body arrives tomorrow.        
	The BJP and the Rashtriya Janata Dal demanded the Mumbai policemen be tried for murder. BJP MLA Arun Kumar, Rahuls next-door neighbour in Kadamkuan Colony, said: He was a decent and affable boy. We never saw him take the law into his own hands.        
	Rahul was born to Kundans first wife. After she died, Kundan married her sister and had two more children, Puja and Rohit Raj. Puja is on probation at a State Bank branch in Calcutta and Rohit, an engineer, works at a factory in Ambala.

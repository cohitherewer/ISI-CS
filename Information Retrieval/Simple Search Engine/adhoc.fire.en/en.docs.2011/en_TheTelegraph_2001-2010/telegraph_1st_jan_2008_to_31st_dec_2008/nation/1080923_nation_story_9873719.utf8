          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Madhepura, Sept. 22: Even when flood victims at scores of relief camps scurry for curry, Bijoy knows how to get food: flashing a pistol.        
	With this pistol, I will manage food from nearby relief camp, said Bijoy, 17, confidently. The teenager of Tangraha village lost his father and two sisters in the recent floods and his mother too was missing.        
	Tangraha and neighbouring Vokhraha in Shankarpur block of Madhepura district are infamously called villages of dacoits with their long tradition of criminal antecedents. Surrounded by the Kosi river and its tributaries, the inhabitants of the two highly inaccessible villages are known as sardars. Their ancestors had settled down there from Nepal. All the villagers were landless and mostly engaged in criminal activities, police records state.        
	Villagers had promised not to take arms but the situation once again has compelled them to do it, said Manta Sardar, one of the residents of Tangraha. The state government gifted an Indira Awas Yojana unit to Manta soon after he had surrendered about a decade ago. According to him, some of them were given monthly compensation of Rs 3,000 for several months but it has been stopped since 1997.         
	The villages are dangerous, why are you going to take the risk? a policeman at Jitapur outpost told this reporter while on way to the villages. Two police posts were set up in nearby Voraha and Jarkaha.         
	Will the police face the pain of starving villagers of Tangraha and Vokhraha? asked Murari, who studied up to a Class III. With nothing to eat and relief not reaching them, most of the villagers like Bijoy now decided to return to the profession of their ancestors. Atish Chandara, the Madhepura district magistrate, claimed that special relief and rescue operations had already been initiated there.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Old solutions to new problems                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 20: For a young batch of students at Bhubaneswar Genius Academy, mathematics is no longer a fretting subject and solutions to arithmetic, algebra, geometry or trigonometry problems are ready in a jiffy.        
	At the Genius Academy more than 100 students have enrolled for a course in vedic mathematics and are enjoying maths like never before.         
	Vedic mathematics is an older, Indian system of calculation based on rules and principles with which any mathematical problem can be solved.        
	Thousands of years ago, mathematicians authored theses and dissertations on mathematics. The system is based on 16 vedic sutras or aphorisms that are word formulae describing ways to solve a whole range of problems.         
	These 16 one-line formulae originally written in Sanskrit, enables one to solve long problems in a much quicker manner.         
	It is believed that vedic mathematics has its roots in Orissa. The 16 formulae from the vedas that we use today was written by Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Bharati Tirthaji Maharaja of Govardhan Matha in Puri, said Sanjukta Sarangi, the director of the institute.         
	The vedic practitioners opine that the method is more systematic, coherent and unified than conventional ones. Its a mental tool that encourages development and use of intuition and innovation, while giving students flexibility, fun and satisfaction.        
	Last year, three students of the academy cracked the new system of management tests (CAT) successfully and one of them got into the XLRI, Jamshedpur, using the old system.         
	The board curriculum has a chapter on vedic mathematics, but lack of qualified teachers have so far hampered effective classes.         
	Several English and Oriya medium schools have expressed interest to start special classes. We are planning to reach out to rural areas and start centres there, Sarangi added.

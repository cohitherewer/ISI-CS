	Bhubaneswar, June 15: It is a good time to be a girl in Orissa. For, the three-day Raja festival observed every year on the last day of jyestha (June) to mark the beginning of monsoon gives girls a chance to take break from household works.        
	According to legends, it is the time when Mother Earth steps into puberty and marks the beginning of the agriculture season. It is also a time when pre-pubescent and teenage girls (symbolising Mother Earth) are given a royal treatment by their families.        
	With another day of the festival left, girls across the state are celebrating Raja with alta on their feet, sandalwood on foreheads and swinging to the tunes of traditional Raja songs.         
	Girls are also excused from mundane household chores for three days and are encouraged to spend time with friends and have fun during the festival.        
	No more work. Its a royal treatment for me in this period, said Bindu Panda, a student.         
	Peasants, too, are staying away from farming.         
	Another highlight of the festival is the Raja paan (betel leaf) distributed among loved ones. The favourite of the state, it is now available almost everywhere. We know we are not sticking to all details, but even a little bit of Raja is great fun, gushed Purva. Raja has always been a major festival in the states rural pockets, but now the celebrations are picking up in the cities as well.         
	In Bhubaneswar, Raja was marked by variety of competitions from podopitha competitions to alta meets.         
	Malls wore a festive look with special discounts.

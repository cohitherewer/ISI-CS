                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP promises   pilgrim safety
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Advani: Damage control                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: L.K. Advani today said if the BJP returned to power in Delhi, it would set up a national board for improving facilities at all important pilgrim centres.        
	The promise, from the partys Prime Minister-in-waiting, came a day after nearly 150 people were trampled to death in a stampede at a temple in BJP-ruled Rajasthan. Sources said the toll could cross 200.        
	The pledge also followed questions why the party, which has built its politics on religious causes and temples, had not taken proper safety measures at places of worship in states ruled by it.        
	Advani conceded that the issue had not received adequate attention despite several temple tragedies in recent years. One of the main reasons for these tragedies is that we have not addressed the need for adequate and reliable infrastructure, facilities and safety provisions at places of pilgrimage in our country, he told a rally in Maharashtra.        
	Therefore, if the NDA is elected to power, one of our priorities will be to take up this task on a massive and urgent basis.        
	Although the last two stampedes have been in BJP-ruled states  more than 160 people died in a Himachal Pradesh temple in August  Advani was quick to turn the heat on the Congress.        
	He cited the Amarnath land row in Jammu and Kashmir as an example of how poor amenities for pilgrims could be a trigger for violence.         
	The BJP leader rounded off his speech with his partys pet theme  the Congress-led governments alleged surrender to separatist forces.        
	Why did the Congress behave like this? It is because its whole approach to national issues has got perverted because of the politics of minorityism, he said.         
	Advani alleged that this politics of minorityism had prevented the UPA government from hanging Afzal Guru, convicted in the Parliament attack case, checking illegal infiltration and cracking down on banned student outfit Simi.

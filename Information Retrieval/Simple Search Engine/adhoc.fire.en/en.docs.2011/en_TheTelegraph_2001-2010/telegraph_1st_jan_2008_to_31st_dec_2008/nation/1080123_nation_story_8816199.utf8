             Advani: Battle-ready
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The National Democratic Alliance today warmly endorsed L.K. Advani as the coalitions shadow Prime Minister, settling the doubts about his acceptability among the allies.
    
	Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress was the lone ally to skip the meeting where an emboldened Advani expressed his gratitude to the coalition partners for reposing trust in him.
    
	He promised to seek the wise and inspirational guidance of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who ran the NDAs past governments and remains the alliances chairperson.
    
	Some of the allies were thought to have reservations about Advani because of his image as a hard-liner in contrast to the liberal Vajpayee.
    
	But todays unanimous NDA resolution saluted Advanis lifelong service to the nation and his vast political and parliamentary (experience) and unimpeachable record of integrity.
    
	Sushma Swaraj, who is handling the job of coalition coordinator, said George Fernandes would stay NDA convener.
    
	She told reporters that Trinamul leader Dinesh Trivedi had yesterday promised to attend the meeting but did not come. Only time will tell whether he did not come or could not come, Sushma added.
    
	Mamata, keen to exploit alleged cracks in the Bengal CPMs Muslim vote bank after Nandigram, has been keeping her distance from the BJP. Alliance leaders are not hopeful about a change of heart.
    
	Advani, who is looking for new allies, said the NDAs poll campaign would revolve around three issues  good governance, development and security. He eschewed Hindutva rhetoric and never once mentioned Muslim appeasement.
    
	He spoke of the betrayal of the common man by the Centre, rising prices, agrarian distress, growing rich-poor divide, patronage to criminals and the governments failure to counter terrorism.
    
	We must chalk out a plan for a sustained campaign of agitation and mass education on issues concerning the nation and common people. The forthcoming budget session of Parliament should also be effectively used for this purpose, Advani said.
    
	The meeting agreed that the alliance needed a common strategy and programme, rather like the United Progressive Alliances national common minimum programme. A core group will be formed to revise the NDAs existing national agenda for governance.
    
	Also, a conclave of the alliances chief ministers will prepare a document listing the kinds of discrimination allegedly practised by the Centre.

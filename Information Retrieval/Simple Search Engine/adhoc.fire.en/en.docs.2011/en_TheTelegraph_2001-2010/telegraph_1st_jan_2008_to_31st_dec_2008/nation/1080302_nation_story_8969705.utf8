	Jamshedpur, March 1: All efforts by the police to track down the gang involved in snatching bags in the city, especially in Bistupur, have fallen flat.         
	Now, the police have begun patrolling Bistupur, including the residential areas, with renewed vigour. Extra constables have been requisitioned from Golmuri police lines to intensify patrolling. While majority of policemen have been deployed at strategic locations on Bistupur roads, a sizeable number march on the stretches, especially the ones connecting with the market place.         
	Starting from Q Road in South Park up to K Road and further up to Gopal Maidan, lathi-wielding policemen can be spotted. However, there has been hardly any impact on women with the streets and the marketplace remaining equally crowded.        
	The motorcycle-borne criminals have targeted at least 12 young women in crowded places.         
	Late last night, the gang snatched the bag of a woman putting up at Hotel Sidharth on Bistupur Main Road. It contained Rs 50,000, credit and ATM cards.         
	The officer-in-charge of Bistupur police station, B.B. Tirkey, has sought the help of police officers from five neighbouring police stations for launching an intensified drive against the snatchers.         
	During the drive, the police intercept suspicious bike riders and seized several Pulsar and Apache bikes.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 24: The new wages proposed for the soldier mean a fatter pay packet that is still not what he thinks is fair enough.         
	The pay commission proposes to hike the minimum basic pay of officers in the armed forces at the entry level by Rs 7,600 a month, puts the service chiefs on a par with the senior-most bureaucrat in the government with a fixed pay of Rs 90,000 and introduces performance-linked incentives.         
	But in defence headquarters, a first look at the new pay structure did not convince the military that it would be able to attract the talent it seeks.         
	The armed forces have been making repeated and strong pleas for salaries that will allow them to attract the youth and fill its officer-level vacancies that currently total more than 11,000 in the army alone.         
	An officer can expect to draw a minimum of Rs 27,000 plus dearness allowance on commissioning at the rank of lieutenant if the recommendations of the pay commission are accepted. This would include a grade pay of Rs 5,400 and a military service pay of Rs 6,000.         
	The cost to government of an armed forces officer is considerably more than that  as pointed out in a study for the pay commission by the Xavier Labour Relations Institute  since it includes allowances and, for army officers, a sahayak who is often a personal attendant.         
	Benefits include, in accordance with rank and posting, rations, housing, newspapers, telephone, pension, gratuity, leave travel concessions, hardship allowance, high-altitude posting allowance, childrens education/conveyance allowance, electricity and water.         
	The basic pay of the services chiefs is proposed to be hiked three times  from Rs 30,000 a month to Rs 90,000, the same as that for the cabinet secretary.         
	While salaries have been hiked at the entry level, middle-ranking officers pointed out that the promise of a 40 per cent increase was illusory.         
	All military officers are proposed to be categorised into two corresponding pay bands of Rs 15,600-39,100 (up to brigadier and equivalent) and Rs 39,200-67,000 (for major generals/rear admirals/air vice-marshals to lieutenant generals/vice-admirals/air marshals who are not army commanders).         
	This addresses the issue of stagnation. For example, a colonel pointed out, he had reached the top of his existing pay scale (Rs 15,100-400-18,300) three years back but was not moving up. By being put in the band of Rs 15,600-39,100, he can look forward to annual increments of 2.5 per cent or 3.5 per cent of the basic even if he is not selected for promotion to the next rank of brigadier (commodore in the navy, air commodore in the air force).         
	The pay commission also introduces military service pay for nursing personnel though that is proposed to be fixed at Rs 4,200 a month, less than the Rs 6,000 proposed for combat arms officers.         
	The commission has also proposed to hike hardship allowances for high-altitude postings, long-duration sailings and fighter aircraft flying.

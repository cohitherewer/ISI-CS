	Punishment trip to spiritual spa    
	Errant employees neednt be sacked. They can, as a Pune firm has shown, be sent to a spiritual spa for redemption.    
	Shiv Sai Infosys Private Ltd sent three young employees accused of jeopardising the interest of the organisation to an all-expenses-paid trip to such a spa in Bangalore.    
	So, instead of facing the sack, the youths checked in for a week at spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankars ashram for an Art of Living course. The plan was the brainchild of CEO Dheerajj Agarwal, who had earlier taken an advanced version of the course at the ashram. The results left other executives at Shiv Sai Infosys, which offers business process outsourcing solutions and has branches in Mumbai, surprised. The trio came back transformed.    
	Seven days at the ashram changed us. The course has given us a new purpose. Earlier, our idea of enjoyment was to drink and make merry. Now, we are more focused and motivated towards our job, said Nikhil Baddap, one of the three who achieved the spa salvation.         
	Govt teachers on contract    
	Winds of change could sweep classrooms in Delhi after a plan to hire teachers on contract was cleared recently.    
	The state government gave the approval to cope with a teachers crunch. A large number of posts of teachers as well as computer instructors are vacant, resulting in difficulties in imparting education, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the meeting that cleared the move.    
	Those recruited under the arrangement would have a different pay structure, probably a consolidated sum.    
	The cabinet also extended to the teachers the benefits of the health scheme for government employees.    
	They can now contribute at the prescribed rate (to the scheme) to get the medical facilities. Earlier they were being granted a fixed medical allowance of Rs 75 a month.    
	More spots on heritage list    
	More Hyderabad destinations hope to go places now, after an international travel body put them on its must-see list.    
	The Pacific Asia Travel Association has put the Falaknuma Palace, the Buddha statue in Hussainsagar and other places on its roster. In doing so, it seemed to have broken out of the straightjacket of familiar sites like Charminar, Golcunda fort and the Qutumshahi tombs.    
	The new list was the outcome of the travel bodys recent conference in Hyderabad, where 1,200 delegates from several countries were given an idea of Andhras heritage.    
	For the first time in many years, these spots will get a much-needed exposure after their inclusion in the international list, said Laxmi Parthasarathi, principal secretary with the state tourism department. To give the international visitors a taste of the Falaknuma Palaces grandeur, chief minister Y.S.R. Rajasekhar Reddy and Union tourism minister Ambika Soni had organised a dinner meeting inside the monument.    
	The government hopes the hard-sell will pay off.         
	Speed spat    
	Brakes have been slammed on the row over speed governors but the protests could pick up again, truckers have warned.    
	The owners of commercial vehicles in Karnataka withdrew their indefinite strike recently after the Supreme Court extended the deadline for fitting the devices.     
	But the state truckers association, which opposes the move over fears it would slow deliveries and cost it business, has oftened threatened to go on strikes if the move is not reversed. (PTI)

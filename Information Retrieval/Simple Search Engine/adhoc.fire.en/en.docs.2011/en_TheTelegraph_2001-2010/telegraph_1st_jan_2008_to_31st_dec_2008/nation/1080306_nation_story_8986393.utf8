                                                                                                               Ghisingh plea to Prime Minister
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi/Darjeeling: Subash Ghisingh has toed the Gorkhaland line, a day before he resigns as caretaker administrator of the DGHC.         
	His party, the GNLF, had been harping on the statehood ever since it realised how the issue has been successfully cashed in by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to garner support against t he special status for the Darjeeling hills.         
	This is the first time that the GNLF chief tried to jump into the Morcha bandwagon.         
	He had banked on the Sixth Schedule bill to see him through even as indefinite bandh and hunger strike crippled the Darjeeling hills.        
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday, Ghisingh has asked him to look afresh into the Gorkhaland demand.         
	He has also accused the Centre and the state for the inordinate delay implementing the memorandum of settlement granting Sixth Schedule status to the Darjeeling hills.        
	The GNLF chief has also announced that he will resign as caretaker administrator of the DGHC tomorrow. He will send his papers to the governor of Bengal after he reaches Siliguri, a close aide of the GNLF chief said at Gorkha Bhavan here today.         
	The subject in the Prime Ministers letter, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, reads: Carving out separate state of Gorkhaland within the framework of Constitution of India.

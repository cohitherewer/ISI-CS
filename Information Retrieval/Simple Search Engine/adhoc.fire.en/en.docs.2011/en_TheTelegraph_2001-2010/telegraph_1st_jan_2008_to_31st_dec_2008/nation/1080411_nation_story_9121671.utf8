The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | North Pole high for navy 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     North Pole high for navy 
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, April 10: Wrapped in his weatherproof jacket under a tent with the white waste of the North Pole surrounding him, the mercury at 35 below freezing point, Commander Satyabrata Dam spoke this afternoon into his Iridium satellite phone, his voice carrying through to the navys Kota House establishment here in a minute after he uttered the words.         
	I am sitting in this tent here and what I see outside is an orangish sun, 20 degrees above the horizon, he described.         
	All around it is white and flat. I know it is 12.50 in the afternoon in India. Inside the tent with me are Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Ajay Sharma and Lt Commander Avinash Khajuria. Outside the tent the Indian flag and the naval ensign are fluttering.         
	Commander Dam is the navys role model for Indian youth. A submariner by profession, he has summitted Mount Everest, skied across the South Pole and last night  at 8.16pm  reached earths 90 degrees geographical north, leading a 10-member team of sailors.         
	The navy had connected the loudspeaker to the telephone here for Commander Dam to take questions. The fragile connection kept snapping every other minute. The last thing he might have expected is to be asked for his response to the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.         
	Did you feel you are well paid enough when you were lugging a 120kg sled across the snow and ice? he was asked.         
	Commander Dam, ever the role model, replied as he might: We were focused on our task  reaching the North Pole  and did not think of anything else.         
	Commander Dam is clearly not going where he is  to the ends of the earth, as it were  for Rs 15,000 or even Rs 40,000 a month. That is the salary bracket of a commander. The navy has put him in charge of the adventure cell because he is a gutsy sailor.         
	Yet, the spin-off the navy expects from promoting adventure sport is that it will attract the right talent to the service. Join the navy and see the world like no one else, the top brass like to say and hold up Dam as the example.         
	Yet, in naval headquarters, as in the army and air force headquarters, officers are increasingly worried that the effort to attract the right kind of youth is being frittered away.         
	More than 100 officers of the army are reported to have requested for early retirement or offered to resign since the pay panel recommendations. The air force is in any case worried its aviation specialists have an expanding market that is much more lucrative.        
	None of these concerns matters in the North Pole. When we reached here, says Dam, we rolled in the snow and shouted and jumped with joy.

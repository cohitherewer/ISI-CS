          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul shakes hands with supporters in Lucknow on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Lucknow, July 14: Amethi voters shouldnt be surprised if they receive a call and the person at the other end of the line says he is Rahul Gandhi. He just might be.        
	The MP will personally make calls to people after the Lok Sabha election is officially announced. Early in the campaign, Rahuls recorded voice will be heard. In the final rounds, hell make some direct calls himself and ask voters about their problems, a Congress leader said.        
	A database of voter names, their villages, landline and cellphone numbers has been created and is being fed into Rahuls public relations machinery as it gears up for the polls.        
	In a trial run of the tele-campaign, the MP made some calls and inquired about the health of some ailing panchayat chairmen and Congress workers in Shukla Bazaar.        
	A leader in Rahuls team said the Gandhi scion didnt want to miss a single voter from his contact list. The Congress general secretary, who arrived here today for a three-day visit, himself told party workers this.        
	Panchayat heads should engage themselves in preparations for the approaching election. I dont want a single voter to be missed, Rahul said at a training camp for verification of voter lists in Jagdishpur. The village panchayat heads were urged to get in touch with people directly. Now that you know how to approach them, I repeat that no voter should be missed, Rahul said.        
	Local leaders in the MPs team are expected to approach voters and tell them about the achievements of the UPA government and the projects Rahul brought to Amethi.         
	The nuke deal will figure in the interaction too, with the leaders focusing on the reasons for pushing an accord that could help solve much of the countrys power problems.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, July 25: The Congress has named nearly half of its Uttar Pradesh office bearers from among backwards, Dalits and Muslims as part of Rahul Gandhis two-year-old plan to reverse an upper-caste tilt.        
	With 267 members, the new Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee unveiled today is the biggest ever and over twice the previous panels strength of 125. Only 25 per cent of the posts in that panel were given to the three groups.        
	More than 46 per cent of the new vice-presidents, general secretaries and secretaries  the top three party posts  are backwards, Dalits and Muslims. Fourteen of the 31 vice-presidents, for instance, have been picked from these groups. The figure is 36 among the 67 general secretaries and 65 among the 146 secretaries.        
	The president, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, is a Brahmin but she counts five Muslims, five Scheduled Castes and 4 OBCs as vice-presidents, her immediate deputies in the party.         
	The idea behind the jumbo committee is to accommodate a large number of backwards and Muslims and yet not alienate others. We have tried to do justice to all, Joshi said as she announced the panel this afternoon.        
	The new proportion of social groups mirrors the caste formula in the Mandal Commission report, and the inclusion of Muslims is similar to the way leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad forged their axis of backward castes and minorities to win power. The two politicians had set aside party posts and ministries for backwards, Dalits and Muslims to woo them.        
	By including more such leaders, the Congress also hopes to counter the backward-Muslim-upper caste combination that Mayavati is trying to forge.         
	In the Congress committees 112-member executive body, more than 45 are either backwards, Dalits or Muslims  the highest representation in the party since the late 1980s. The proportion was around 25 per cent in the previous body.        
	Dalit and backward workers often told Rahul during meetings over the past two years that not enough of their leaders were given posts in the Congress state unit.        
	Many office-bearers are workers who had joined Rahuls youth training camps in Chitrakoot in 2005 and Gorakhpur in 2006, said chief spokesman Akhay Pratap Singh. Jagdambika Pal, a backward party leader and a former chief minister, lauded the new panels make-up.        
	It is not clear whether the higher representation will extend to the MPs in the general elections. Chances are the Congress will have to limit the total number of its nominees to 40 if alliance talks with the Samajwadi Party succeed. Only 10 of the states 80 MPs are from the Congress now.        
	 We have recommended 40 candidates from the Congress. But the negotiations will be held at the highest level (in Delhi), Joshi said.

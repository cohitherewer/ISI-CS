The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Camp boost to cattle count
                                                                                                            Camp boost to cattle count
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          More to come                                  
	Cuttack, Jan. 2: The government is wary of severe genetic erosion among cattle in the state and consequential abysmally low average milk yield of cows.         
	Orissa has the lowest average milk yield per cow with the national average being thrice that of the state one.        
	The animal husbandry and veterinary services officials, however, are hopeful that upgrading the cattle breed by implementing an aggressive artificial insemination programme would improve milk production.         
	In a bid to upgrade cattle breed, a bull station was inaugurated at Khapuria here yesterday. State animal husbandry and veterinary services director Bishnupada Sethi said: The frozen semen bull station, the largest of its kind in Asia, will be a boost to production of quality semen for the ongoing artificial insemination programme.         
	With an investment of Rs 60 lakh, the bull station has been designed to rear 32 bulls of exotic, crossbred and indigenous breeds. Each of them was provided separate high-tech chambers of 450sqft area.        
	The programme is underway through a cattle-breeding network involving nearly 2,500 artificial insemina- tion centres functioning across the state.         
	At least 42 per cent of the breeding cattle population in the state had been targeted to be covered under the programme by 2011 as part of the National Project on Cattle and Buffalo Breeding.        
	The new bull station added to an already existing frozen semen bank to facilitate collection, processing and preservation of quality semen from highly genetic potential bulls, said Sethi.        
	Veterinary officials at the frozen semen bank expressed hope that the new bull station would increase the production of doses of frozen semen straws in the state from the current level 8.16 lakh per year.

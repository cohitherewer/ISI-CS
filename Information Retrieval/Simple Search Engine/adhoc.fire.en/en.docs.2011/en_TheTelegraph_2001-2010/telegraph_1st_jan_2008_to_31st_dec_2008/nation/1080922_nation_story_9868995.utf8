	Sept. 21 (PTI): Security was stepped up in Goa today following a tip-off that a train from Kerala was carrying explosives meant for a terror attack in the coastal state.         
	Karnataka home minister V.S. Acharya said in Bangalore that Kerala police had informed his government about the consignment of explosives aboard a train that left Thiruvananthapuram today.        
	A report from Thiruvananthapuram said the Netravati Express bound for Kurla, a Mumbai suburb, had been thoroughly searched at Thrissur but nothing was found.        
	Goa police have, however, decided to take no chances and beefed up security around all vital establishments, especially the railway station.        
	The police said they, too, had received inputs from Kerala police about the train.        
	We are on our toes and have kept all arrangements ready, superintendent of police Atmaram Deshpande said.         
	We are checking almost all the trains. The bomb disposal squad has also been pressed into service.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: Tension brewed in the Posco steel plant project site in Jagatsinghpur district near Paradip port today after plant supporters and those opposing the project clashed last night.         
	The clash took place at Gobindpur when the anti-Posco protestors were holding a meeting, said inspector-general (law and order) Pradeep Kapoor. One person was injured in the violence.         
	Abhay Sahu, the president of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, told The Telegraph a group of plant supporters hurled a bomb at the anti-plant protestors, in which three persons were injured.        
	On the other hand, the plant supporters have alleged that the anti-Posco people had chopped the hand of a pro-Posco villager.         
	IG Kapoor said armed police forces had been deployed in the area to prevent further violence. Police forces were withdrawn from the project-affected villages a few weeks ago after socio-economic survey and land demarcation process were completed.         
	In the third week of April, the anti-plant protestors had detained the additional superintendent of police, Jitendra Patra, and inspector in charge of Kujang police station Anil Mishra all through the night at Govindpur village to seek the withdrawal of police force from the area.         
	They were released the next day after forces were withdrawn from the village.         
	Posco had signed an MoU with the state government in June 2005, for setting up a 12MT steel plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore near Paradip. This project is said to be the countrys biggest FDI project.         
	However, the project could not take off due to resistance offered by the villagers, who would be affected by the plant.         
	The project area, spread over 15 villages in three gram panchayats under Ersama block, had been out of bounds for the state government, police and Posco officials till November 2007. Only recently did the government manage to complete a survey and land demarcation in Posco villages.

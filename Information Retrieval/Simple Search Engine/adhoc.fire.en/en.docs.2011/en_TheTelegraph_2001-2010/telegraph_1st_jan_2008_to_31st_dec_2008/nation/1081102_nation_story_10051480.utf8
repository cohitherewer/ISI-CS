The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Extra fee on air tickets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Extra fee on air tickets

	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Almost all major airlines in the country today scrapped the 5 per cent agents commission and replaced it with a transaction fee for all tickets, including those bought on the Internet and from their own portal.         
	The move, which means passengers will have to pay more, drew mixed response from travel agents.        
	The only big domestic airline not on the list is Jet Airways, but it is expected to soon follow suit. We plan to have the same fare structure across all points of sale, Ragini Chopra, Jet vice-president, said, adding that the points would include the airlines portal.        
	Domestic travellers would be charged a minimum of Rs 350 and international passengers Rs 10,000, which will be denoted either as transaction fee or as other charges.        
	Earlier, top travel agents had told The Telegraph that they intended to hold a meeting tomorrow to decide on blackballing Jet for not agreeing to the transaction fee.         
	Pricing has to be similar across all verticals... that is a logical solution, said Subhash Goel, former president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators.         
	On the other hand, the Iata Agents Association of India has decided to boycott all airlines that have scrapped the commission. Its president Biji Eapen said over 800 agents had begun the boycott. Some 30-40 per cent of the airline business has been impacted by our boycott, Eapen said.

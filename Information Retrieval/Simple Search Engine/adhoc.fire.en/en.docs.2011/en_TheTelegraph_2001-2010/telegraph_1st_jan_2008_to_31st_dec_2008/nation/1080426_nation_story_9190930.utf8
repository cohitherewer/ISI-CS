	Bhubaneswar, April 25: They are the super six hailing from the backward regions of Orissa, but the rugby ball has given them a ticket to London.         
	Lalit Mohan Bankira, Prakash Chandra Murmu, Ramesh Badra, Sagar Marandi, Sudam Charan Majhi and Basant Murmu  all with an average of 14 years  will soon be leaving for Calcutta to attend a practice session in the Bengal capital before proceeding to London to play for the Indian team in an international rugby festival. The matches would be held in London between May 1 and 6.        
	Ever since its victory at the U-14 World Cup-2007, the boys in Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS)s rugby team have been attracting the attention of rugby organisations from across the world, including the UK and Australia.         
	This Under-14 fixture will feature teams from UK, Africa and Asia.         
	Besides the super six, another KISS team has been invited to play in the Under-14 tournament in Australia. The team will tour places across Australia in August 2008.         
	Interestingly, the sport was introduced in KISS only last year. Chairman of England and main coach Rugby Association Martin Hansport, coaches Paul Walsh, Upendra Mohanty and R.P. Jena trained students.         
	Barely months after the training started, the boys registered wins over some of the reputed school teams of India.         
	In September 2007, KISS rugby team, representing India at the U-14 Rugby World Cup, stunned the world by beating South Africa in the final.         
	Starting off as the tournament underdogs, the team registered upset victories over Zambia, Swaziland, Kenya, Romania and South Africa and lifted the world cup.         
	The students getting to represent India is a matter of pride for the tribal community, Orissa and KISS, said A. Samanta, founder of the KIIT Group of Institutions that runs KISS.         
	While the UK tour of KIIT Rugby team is sponsored by Tour Aid, an UK-based organisation, EXIM Bank would support their Australia tournaments.

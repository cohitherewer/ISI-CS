          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 18: The Congress today dismissed the Orissa governments claim of a Centre order seeking the emission of 10 lakh BPL families from the BPL list as a white lie.         
	Two days ago, the state government had said it had been forced by the Centre to restrict the number of BPL families within 34.93 lakh, around 10 lakh less than the BPL families figured in the 1997 list.         
	The government had announced that these 10 lakh deprived families would be extended benefits of free house, old-age pension and subsidised rice out of the states own resources.         
	Countering the governments contention, Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Prasad Harichandan and spokesman Kailash Acharya said the government was trying to mislead people and cover up its own failures.         
	Harichandan said the BPL list was last revised in 1997 during the Congress regime. Congresss successor (the BJD-BJP government) had not yet revised the list, even though revision was due in 2002. The present government has not conducted a household survey on the basis of 13 socio-economic indicators to count the BPL families, claimed former minister daring the government to show the 2002 list.         
	The government is now trying to shift the blame on the Centre to escape responsibility, said Harichandan.         
	On one hand, the government is claiming to have achieved economic growth and rise in per capita income. On the other, it is sticking to the 1997 figure of BPL families, he added.         
	The Congress leaders also described the governments announcement to extend the benefits to the 10 lakh deprived families as an eyewash.         
	The government has provided a meagre amount for this purpose. For example, a measly sum of Rs 30 crore has been provided in the budget to supply subsidised rice as against the requirement of Rs 165 crore to Rs 170 crore.

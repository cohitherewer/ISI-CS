          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 15: On a regular day it may be fun to be a VIP but on Friday, especially during the Presidents visit to Bihar, it became a pain, thanks to strict security.        
	To start with, PHED minister Prem Kumar was barred from entering the airport as his name did not figure in the list of VIPs who were to receive the President.         
	An embarrassed Prem Kumar later complained to the chief minister and the media, and blamed the bureaucracy for the glitch.         
	And to top it, the minister was stopped again at the entrance of Tarang the event that the President inaugurated today.         
	Junior science and technology minister Anil Kumar stayed away because his name did not figure in the list of dignitaries.         
	Anil, incidentally, is a teacher of TS College, Hisua, a constituent college under the university.        
	HRD minister Brishen Patel, too, was not too happy with the proceedings, especially since the programme anchor introduced him as Britain Patel. Then, the President addressed Brish en, as Brajesh.         
	Finally, he was the victim of the chief ministers wit. Irked by the short time alloted to him, Nitish gallantly introduced Patel as proficient in Urdu and offered to step down.         
	When stopped at the gate, IPS Raveendran Shankaran was a happy man. Raveendran, who was the security in-charge, was stopped by a constable and asked to produce a security pass. He was happy that his sub-ordinates were strictly following rules.

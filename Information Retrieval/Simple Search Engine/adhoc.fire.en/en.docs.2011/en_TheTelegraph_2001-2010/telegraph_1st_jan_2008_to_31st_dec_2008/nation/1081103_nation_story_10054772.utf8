          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 2: Justice delayed, but not denied even after eight years.         
	Orissa State Consumer Redressal Commission has done this in a case involving compensation against sub-standard seeds supplied to a farmer nearly nine years ago.        
	Kartikeswara Sahoo of Mahulpati village in Bolangir district  who was supplied sub-standard seed in December 1999  had to wait all these years for the commission to endorse a compensation of Rs 50,000 for it.        
	Bangamunda blocks junior agriculture officer had supplied 3.6 quintals of Parijat paddy seed  meant to be of high yielding variety  at a cost of Rs 4,273. But 90 per cent of it failed to even germinate.         
	Sahoo had immediately sought relief for the financial loss in the Bolangir district consumer forum, which on September 28, 2000, directed the state agriculture department to pay Rs 50,000, to compensate the farmer for the paddy yield failure as well as the cost of seed purchased by him for the crops, within a month.        
	The state agriculture department filed an appeal before the State Consumer Redressal Commission. But the commission took nearly eight years to upheld the order passed by the district forum.        
	On October 27, a division bench comprising commission president Justice A.K. Samantaray and member Subash Mahtab rejected the contention of the agriculture department.        
	The farmer was lured by the promise of high yield and increased profit to buy the seeds. While propagating the seeds, it was the duty of the department officials to guide cultivators on the correct procedures. But this was not done, the commission observed.         
	In 2003, the apex consumer court in the country had, in a landmark order, upheld the rights of horticulturists and agriculturists to seek compensation against defective seeds.         
	The national commission had then for the first time clarified that the farmer has a remedy against defective seeds under the Consumer Protection Act.

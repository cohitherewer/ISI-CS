          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: Maharashtra police will be modernised at a cost of Rs 127 crore, chief minister Ashok Chavan said today, ahead of the Assemblys winter session where the government is likely to come under fire for the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	Chavan, speaking in Nagpur where the winter session starts tomorrow, said details of the proposals would be disclosed in the Assembly.         
	The proposals, though, are unlikely to be different from what Chavans predecessor, Vilasrao Deshmukh, had announced days before he was forced to quit over the attacks.        
	He had promised a battalion of 1,000 commandos, the Maharashtra Security Guards, on the lines of the National Security Guard; a state security council, like the national security council; and a state industrial security force, like the CISF.        
	Other proposals included an intelligence training institute in Pune, 12 coastal police stations in addition to the 24 planned earlier, and purchase of 24 speedboats. The police top brass has mooted plans to procure over 500 AK-47s, helicopters for air surveillance, and advanced weapons.        
	The police upgrade was cleared at a cabinet meeting earlier today. Sources said the chief minister and his colleagues tried to find ways to blunt expected criticism from the Opposition in the Assembly.        
	Shiv Senas Ramdas Kadam, the leader of the Opposition, alleged today that Mumbai police commissioner Hassan Gafoor slept in his car while his ill-equipped force battled gunmen inside the Oberoi on November 26.        
	Gafoor denied the allegation, and senior police officers were fuming at what they saw as an attempt to target a Muslim officer. Such nasty allegations are being made by the Sena because Gafoor is a Muslim. Which officer can sleep when such a tragedy is taking place? asked an officer who was part of the operations at the Oberoi and Taj hotels.         
	Gafoor, he said, was stopped from entering the Oberoi by senior colleagues after ATS chief Hemant Karkare was shot dead.

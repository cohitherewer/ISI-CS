          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh at the conference. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 19: The Prime Minister today identified corruption as a challenge before the government and the judiciary but hours later, the countrys highest judge said Manmohan Singh was speaking only of the backlog of corruption cases in the courts.        
	The PM has not said (anything) about corruption in the judiciary, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan told reporters at the end of a conference of chief ministers and high court chief justices.        
	He was only talking about corruption-related cases. These are in large numbers and require speedy trial, the CJI added, flanked by law minister H.R. Bhardwaj, two other senior judges and the deputy law minister.        
	Singh had said: Apart from pendency and delayed justice, corruption is another challenge we face both in government and the judiciary.        
	He had added: The Chief Justice of India has written to me suggesting that we create special courts to deal with corruption cases. I agree that there is an urgent need to do so. This will instil greater confidence in our justice delivery system, at home and abroad.        
	The agenda paper at the conference had cited the mountain of pending corruption cases against government officials and stressed the need for special courts for their speedy disposal.        
	It had also spoken of the need to strengthen the vigilance mechanism for the subordinate courts to check corruption.        
	Both Singh and the CJI agreed that the backlog of cases was huge. The Prime Minister urged the chief ministers to upgrade judicial infrastructure and hire more judges at all levels.        
	He hoped that the gram nyayalayas, proposed as trial courts at the intermediate panchayat level, would ease the load by dealing with simple civil and criminal cases.        
	Over 5,000 such courts are to be established, Singh said, and they would dispense justice within 90 days. The bill, however, is yet to be passed.

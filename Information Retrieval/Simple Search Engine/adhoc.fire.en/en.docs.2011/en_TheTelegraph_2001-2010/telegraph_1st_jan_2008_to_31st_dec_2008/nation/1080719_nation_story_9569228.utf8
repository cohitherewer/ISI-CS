          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, July 18: As the NDA-Left and the UPA engage in fierce campaigns to ramp up numbers ahead of the trust vote, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today predicted Manmohan Singh governments defeat as imminent.        
	The UPA governments defeat in course of the trial of strength is imminent.         
	The gloom visible on the faces of the usually blustering central ministers from the state clearly indicates that they have lost the clue to muster sufficient number to ensure their survival, Nitish Kumar said on his return from New Delhi.        
	The chief minister, in yesterdays meeting of NDA chief ministers at L.K. Advanis residence, set the tone for launching the final assault on the Manmohan Singh government by suggesting that the JMM chief Shibu Soren should be offered the chance to become the Jharkhand CM.        
	However, reports indicate that the Congress has kept the JMM with it, with the JMM chief whip today issuing a whip for its four MPs to vote in favour of the confidence motion. But Nitish Kumar stepped up the pressure against the UPA on his return to Patna, too.         
	It is clear that the UPA government will not survive. It has become evident from the fact that the bhashan veer (leaders thriving on statements) from Bihar have suddenly fallen silent. Nitish Kumar was referring to his rival Lalu Prasad and other RJD ministers at the Centre.         
	Faced with uncertain future, they (Lalu Prasad) have stopped speaking, he said.        
	Confident of toppling the UPA government, the chief minister said: The central ministers have put a spanner in the development. We will go to the people in the coming Lok Sabha polls with facts and figures seeking their support for the formation of the NDA government at the Centre.        
	Referring to the Indo-US nuclear deal, Nitish Kumar said: The government should keep the deal in abeyance till it wins the trust vote. The government has lost the credibility and respect to govern.

	Singur, Jan. 12: Private security guards who had been disrupting work at the Tata Nano factory site in Singur for the past two days have ended their agitation after CPM leaders promised last night that they would not be sacked, reports our correspondent.
    
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose had said yesterday the party would request the government to ensure jobs for them in the vendor park where the ancillary units are coming up.
    
	The men, hired a year ago on daily wages, had stopped work after 135 of them were told they would not be needed any more. About 650 men selected by the local CPM were given temporary employment as guards.

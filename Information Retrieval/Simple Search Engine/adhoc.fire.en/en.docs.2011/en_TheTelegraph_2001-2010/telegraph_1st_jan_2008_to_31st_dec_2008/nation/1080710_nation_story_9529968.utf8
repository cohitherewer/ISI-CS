          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 9: Developing countries cannot at present consider quantitative restrictions on emissions of Earth-warming greenhouse gases, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a meeting of the worlds major economies today.         
	In an intervention at the meeting of leaders of the 16-member major economies group in Hokkaido, Singh also said climate change should not be used to maintain economic status quo or to add to challenges faced by developing countries.         
	It should not be used to add conditionalities to already complex developmental challenges that we face in developing countries or maintaining economic status quo or attempting to introduce protectionism by another means, Singh said.         
	The G8 nations had said yesterday that they would seek to work towards a global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050, but they expected major economies  such as India, China or Brazil  to contribute.         
	But Singh said poverty eradication was the first and overriding priority for all developing countries.         
	More than 600 million people in India are still without access to modern energy sources, and a quarter of our population lives on less than a dollar a day, Singh said.         
	Sustained and accelerated economic growth is critical for developing countries and we cannot for the present even consider quantitative restrictions on our emissions.         
	Singh said developed countries need to do more themselves.         
	We have not seen demonstrable progress on even low levels of agreed greenhouse gas reductions from developed countries... their emissions as a whole will continue to rise in the years to come, he said.         
	Singh said India is committed to a path of sustainable development, but would look for enhanced financial flows and access to new technologies to tackle the challenges of climate change.         
	There is a need for a fairer IPR (intellectual property regime) for advanced clean technologies so that rewards for innovators are sufficiently remunerative and, at the same time, they are made available to developing countries at affordable prices.        
	The major economies  G8 and Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and the European Union  account for 80 per cent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions.         
	In a joint declaration, the leaders of the 16-nations said they recognise that deep cuts in global emissions would be necessary to tackle climate change, but did not articulate any specific targets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fractured verdict in Nagaland
                                                                                                               Fractured verdict in Nagaland

	Kohima, March 8: Nagaland has thrown up a fractured verdict, a day after sister state Meghalaya.         
	After trailing the Congress as trends trickled in, the Nagaland Peoples Front-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland dislodged by Presidents rule three months ago  appeared set to return to power despite falling two seats short of the magic mark of 31.        
	The results of three seats in Zunheboto district, where counting will be taken up tomorrow, are crucial for government formation.        
	The Nagaland Peoples Front (NPF) improved its tally from last years 19 by bagging 25 seats. But the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) failed to cross the 30-seat barrier, largely because of the poor performance of its allies, especially the BJP, which slumped from seven seats in 2003 to two this time.         
	The NPFs other ally, the Janata Dal (United), fared worse. The party, which got three seats last time, failed to open its account. The NCP, the latest entrant to the DAN alliance, bagged two seats.        
	The other contender to the throne, the Congress, fared slightly better by bagging 22 seats  a gain of one from last time.        
	Former chief minister Nephiu Rio said the DAN legislature party would meet tomorrow afternoon to elect a leader. This will be just a formality as he is set to lead the state for another term. Rio will also stake claim to form the government tomorrow.        
	The results were below expectations, but that is because of misuse of central agencies under Presidents rule. Otherwise, we would have got more seats, Rioclaimed.         
	Dubbing the verdict a victory of the people, Rio said his priority would be to strive for permanent peace.        
	The Congress said it would play the role of a constructive Opposition if it could not form the government.        
	Earlier today, Assam police foiled an attempt by Naga militants to abduct P. Daku Phom, an Independent candidate who won from 49 Tamlu constituency. The incident took place near the inter-state border checkgate at Khotkhoti.

	New Delhi, Oct. 13: India today took up with Pakistan the attack on its Kabul embassy and the Kashmir ceasefire violations, two issues that Delhi says have put the peace process under strain.        
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan told his Pakistani counterpart, Mahmud Ali Durrani, that incidents like the embassy attack  blamed on Pakistans ISI  didnt augur well for the peace process, officials said. The two sides also looked at ways of ending ceasefire violations.        
	The two countries national security advisers met following an assurance from President Asif Ali Zardari to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that Pakistan would not let its territory be used for terrorist activities against India. Zardaris pledge came when the two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last month.        
	Before the start of todays talks, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said: We will discuss all the issues that concern us. Naturally, that includes what happened in Kabul, that includes the situation in terms of maintaining the ceasefire. We will do that.        
	He added: Mr Durrani is an old friend.... We know him and he has had an interest in Indo-Pak relations for quite some years. Let us see what we can take forward.

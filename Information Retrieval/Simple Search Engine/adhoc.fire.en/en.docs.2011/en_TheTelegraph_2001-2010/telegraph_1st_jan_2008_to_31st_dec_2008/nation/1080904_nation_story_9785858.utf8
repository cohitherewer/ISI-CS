          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The BJP today demanded a white paper on Simi and the return of the Prevention of Terrorism Act at a news conference where Narendra Modi was presented as the partys anti-terror face ahead of the general elections.        
	L.K. Advani said: Had the subject been related to economy, I would have asked Jaswant Singh to come. But because we are discussing terrorism, I thought Narendrabhai is the best person to be present here. The way his government handled the serial blasts in the state was commendable.        
	No other senior party leader was present.        
	Advani demanded a white paper on the activities of the Students Islamic Movement of India, which he and Modi described as a domestic terror organisation. Modi called it sponsored terrorism, where the masterminds are abroad and their plan is executed by Simi. He made a strong pitch for re-enacting the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

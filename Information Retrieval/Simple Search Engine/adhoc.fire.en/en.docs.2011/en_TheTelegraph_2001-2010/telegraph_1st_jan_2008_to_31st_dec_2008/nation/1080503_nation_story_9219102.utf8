                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nalini meet venue kicks up dust
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Priyanka Gandhi Vadra                            
	Chennai, May 2: The superintendent of the prison where Nalini Sriharan is serving a life sentence for her role in Rajiv Gandhis assassination has denied that his daughter Priyanka met the convict in jail.         
	No such nerkaanal (face-to-face interview) took place on the dates you have mentioned (March 14 and March 19) in the prison, Raja Soundari, the superintendent of the special prison for women in Vellore, said in a one-sentence reply last month to an application filed by Nalinis lawyer under the Right to Information Act.         
	The reply, made public today, is dated April 11. Four days later, on April 15, Priyanka had confirmed meeting Nalini. In a written statement, she said it was her way of coming to peace with the violence and loss that I have experienced after her fathers assassination in May 1991.        
	Soundari could not be reached for comment.        
	We are not privy to any such information, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said in Delhi when told about the jail officials denial.         
	When reminded that Priyanka had confirmed the meeting, he said: The statement exists.        
	Ilangovan, one of Nalinis lawyers, today confirmed receiving the jail heads reply. It was in response to the application filed under the information law by a junior lawyer on April 8 seeking details of the Nalini-Priyanka meeting on March 19.         
	The application had mentioned the March 14 date as an intelligence officer from Delhi is believed to have met Nalini as a preparatory step. But for us, it is the March 19 date (when Priyanka met Nalini) that matters, Ilangovan said.         
	Nalinis lawyers have challenged the superintendents reply by filing another application under the RTI Act before the information panel in Chennai. It states that the reply by the jail head is false information and calls for action against him, Ilangovan said.         
	We are sure that the information given by the jail superintendent is false as both Priyanka and Nalini have confirmed that the meeting did take place, Ilangovan said.         
	However, sources said, the meeting could have taken place in the office of the jail superintendent herself instead of the prison room where visitors and inmates usually meet. Only Priyanka and Nalini met, without any aides, the sources said.         
	Since there would be no record of any such meeting in the prison room, the superintendent may have gone by the book it, the sources said.

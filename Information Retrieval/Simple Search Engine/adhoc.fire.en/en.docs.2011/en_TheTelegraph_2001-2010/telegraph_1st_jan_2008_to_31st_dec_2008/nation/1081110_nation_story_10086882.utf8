          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 9: Samrudha Orissa, a regional political outfit, today demanded a CBI probe into the alleged rampant smuggling of minerals from the state.        
	Holding chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his government responsible for the spurt in mineral theft, smuggling and other unlawful activities related to mines, Samrudha Orissa president J.C. Mohanty told reporters that there was an urgent need for an inquiry into these malpractice.         
	Mohanty alleged that the state was losing revenue to the tune of crores due to smuggling of gemstones, chrome, manganese, coal, and bauxite from different mines in Orissa        
	On November 1 last, 16,000 tonnes of iron ore was seized from Nayagarh area. Similarly, on November 6, police seized 34 truckloads of manganese from Sarua industrial area under Khurda police station.        
	But not a single person was arrested in connection with these seizures and all the truck drivers managed to flee the scene. How such a huge quantity of manganese ore in so many trucks passed through as many as six gates without any inspection? Mohanty asked.        
	Quoting official figures, he said 483 cases of mine theft were reported in 2004-05. The number of cases was 514 in 2005-06 and 368 in 2006-07.         
	Alleging that the state government, the police and the Mafia were hands in glove in the mine smuggling racket, Mohanty lambasted the functioning of the mining enforcement squad, which is defunct.        
	Worse, the task force and the flying squad constituted in February 2007 to prevent illegal mining and is being manned by a single person on deputation though its sanctioned strength is 15.         
	The government is encouraging the mineral loot and is remaining intentionally inactive, he alleged.

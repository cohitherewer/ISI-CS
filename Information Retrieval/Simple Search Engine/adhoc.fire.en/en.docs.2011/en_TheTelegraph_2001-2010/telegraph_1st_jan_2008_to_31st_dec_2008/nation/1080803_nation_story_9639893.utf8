	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Farmers and day labourers working in remote parts of the country can now take their grievances directly to the rural development ministry through a helpline.        
	The ministry has decided to set up the national helpline with its hub in New Delhi to let National Rural Employment Guarantee Act households as well as others seek assistance from the ministry and authorities connected with the job scheme.        
	Under the scheme, one member of every rural household can get 100 days of work every year.        
	The helpline  a toll-free MTNL number, 1800110707  will be duly publicised.         
	It can be used by families that are benefiting from the rural job scheme and others to raise questions, submit complaints and seek guidance from the ministry.         
	In March this year, the government had started a toll-free number in Ganjam district of Orissa for beneficiaries of the rural job scheme.         
	The success of the venture encouraged the ministry to decide to replicate the initiative at the national level.        
	The helpline aims to connect all 614 districts in the country.         
	Helplines will later be set up in all states because the rural job scheme is implemented at the district and block levels and through panchayati raj institutions.        
	Anyone with grievances or questions relating to the employment guarantee act will be able to contact NREGA authorities through this network of helplines across the country.         
	The ministry has issued newspaper advertisements inviting expression of interest from organisations to participate in setting up and operating these helplines.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 16: Jammu-based pharmaceutical distributors have threatened a non-co-operation movement against drug companies selling products directly to traders in Kashmir.        
	The move follows the decision of Kashmir distributors to bypass Jammu colleagues who had participated in the economic blockade of Kashmir during the Amarnath land agitation.        
	Frustrated that Kashmir traders were toeing the line and shunning the distributors, Rakesh Gupta, the general secretary of J amp;K Pharma Associates, has threatened action against the companies, including seizure of goods, if they defy the diktat.        
	Any organisation attempting to disturb the existing distribution system in J amp;K after requests/threats from some anti-national Kashmir based associations shall face non-co-operation from Jammu as also the rest of the country, Gupta said in a letter to drug companies.        
	The letter has warned that if any complaint is received in this regard, every possible and impossible action would be initiated against defaulters through different associations and political parties.        
	We warn that our action against defaulting anti-national companies shall be so intense that it will lead them to extinction. If any re-booking is reported (we) would seize such goods and distribute them free to charity organisations.        
	Gupta has also warned Masaud Samoon, the divisional commissioner of Kashmir, to desist from meddling in the problem without ascertaining the facts to avoid chaos.        
	He should have understood the basic fact that the route to the Valley from any part of the country is through Jammu province only, Gupta has said in another letter to B.B. Vyas, the principal secretary to the governor.        
	The decision of the Kashmir-based traders is bound to cause losses for Jammu where most of the commission and forwarding (C amp;F) agents of various companies are based.        
	We will not trade with Jammu, come what may. We will trade directly with companies and not with Jammu, said Mushtaq Ahmad, the chief spokesperson for the Srinagar Chemists and Distributors Association.        
	Most of the drug companies have already started direct trade with us and others will fall in line also.        
	The Kashmir divisional commissioner said efforts were on to sort out the problem.

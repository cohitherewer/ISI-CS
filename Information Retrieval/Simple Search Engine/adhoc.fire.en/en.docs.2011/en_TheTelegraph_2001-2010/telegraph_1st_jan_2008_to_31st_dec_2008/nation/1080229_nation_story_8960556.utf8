          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 28: With Orissa High Court issuing a stay order on eviction operations along the Taladanda canal, the proposed plan to restore the 85-km channel, connecting Cuttack and Paradip, has hit a roadblock.         
	Orissa government plans to restore the 130-year-old canal that faces a series of problems due to inadequate protection with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).         
	Eviction of illegal huts and unauthorised constructions along the banks is imperative for the project, which would involve cleaning the channel originating at Jobra (Cuttack) and linking the Mahanadi with the Bay of Bengal in Paradip.         
	Water resources department officials said the canal bed, along the entire stretch, needs to be dredged to provide a clear draft. To facilitate restoration, Cuttack Municipal Corporation had launched an eviction operation on February 25 along the first 2km stretch from Jobra. Prior notice for eviction was given to the squatters.         
	But, the civic administration could make little headway due to stiff opposition from illegal residents, gathered under the banner of the CPM-backed, Cuttack Basti Unnayana Mahasangh.         
	More than 3,000 families have been living along the Taladanda banks for years. These dwellers cannot just be evicted without alternative rehabilitation, stresses Subash Singh, the president of the Mahasangh.         
	We do not oppose canal plans. But, we demand rehabilitation before eviction, adds Singh, who is also the president of the CPMs Cuttack unit.         
	Meanwhile, a two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and M.M. Das has issued an injunction on the eviction for two months and has advised the state to take up rehabilitation before eviction. The interim order was issued yesterday on a petition filed by Cuttack Basti Unnayana Mahasangh president Subash Singh.

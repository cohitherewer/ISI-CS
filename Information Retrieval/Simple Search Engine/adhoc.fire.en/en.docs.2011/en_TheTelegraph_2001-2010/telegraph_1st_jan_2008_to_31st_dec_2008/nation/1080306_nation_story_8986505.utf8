                                                                                                               Student polls back in Maya land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati                                  
	Lucknow, March 5: The Mayavati government today lifted the ban on student union elections, setting the stage for the return of power politics on Uttar Pradeshs volatile campuses.         
	The election in state universities and degree colleges will take place from the next academic session, Mayavati announced in the Assembly.         
	The ban was imposed on September 7 last year following violence in colleges and universities.         
	The trigger for the campus unrest was the implementation of the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations on norms for student polls.         
	Amid severe opposition, Lucknow University vice-chancellor R.P. Singh had implemented the recommendations in December 2006. Elections were not held in the last academic session as almost all the contestants had criminal charges against them and were debarred.        
	The campaigning for Uttar Pradeshs student union polls is no different from elections to the legislature. Student leaders of the states 12 universities and its affiliated colleges spend crores on campus campaign.        
	Mayavati said a directive would be issued to hold the elections within six to eight weeks after the start of the new session in July.        
	She assured the House that the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee would be strictly implemented.        
	The chief minister said only regular students with no criminal background would be allowed to contest. A ceiling of Rs 5,000 has been put on expenditure while the entire election process must be completed within 10 days. No printed posters would be allowed in the campaign.        
	Student sources welcomed the lifting of the ban, but said the decision could again touch off a confrontation between the government and student leaders who believed the recommendations of J.M. Lyngdoh, a former chief election commissioner, were a way of clipping their wings.         
	Shyamacharan Vidyarthi, a student leader in Lucknow University, said: We have our own traditional norms of campaign. This is our right and we dont want any intervention. Vidyarthi belongs to a union affiliated to the Samajwadi Party.        
	Vidyarthi and his tribe had described the report as an unnecessary intervention to curb rights of students, though the Supreme Court has ordered that the guidelines must be adhered to.         
	Last years ban was the fourth in the history of the states campuses, a nursery of future politicians. Student polls had been banned earlier in 1967, 1972 and 2001 following widespread violence.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav, after taking over the reins of the state in August 2003, had lifted all curbs on student unions. What followed was the return of lawlessness on campuses. At least 12 students, including three in Lucknow University, died in campus violence that flared up between 2003 and 2006.        
	Subsequently, the Supreme Court directed the state government to stick to the Lyngdoh report while holding polls.        
	Among other guidelines, the Lyngdoh report suggests that students wishing to contest should have at least 75 per cent attendance in classes. The committee has also fixed the age limit for candidates: 21, 25 and 28 years, respectively, for undergraduate, postgraduate and research students.        
	The Mayavati government was under pressure to lift the ban as the Samajwadi Party had threatened to use it as an issue during the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Samajwadi Party campaign had turned violent with one student, Mukesh Yadav, being killed in police firing in Etawah in January.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 31: Naxalites made their first move during the Martyrs Week observance by setting a telephone tower on fire.        
	The incident occurred at the Narayanpatna village in Koraput where around 300 armed Naxalites attacked the tower, damaging it partially.        
	The damage has disrupted telecommunication in the area. Also, the rebels have reportedly put up a temporary saheed stumbha in the area and have pasted posters.         
	The posters were more of a cry against alleged police atrocities, said Deepak Kumar, the superintendent of Koraput. He added that the posters called for greater peoples participation in the observance of martyrs week         
	We have intensified combing in and around the area, Kumar added.         
	Orissa police has sounded a high alert in all rebel-hit districts after the Martyrs Week began from July 28.        
	Martyrs Week is observed on the occasion of the death anniversary of Naxalite leader Charu Majumdar. This is the 36th year of his death.        
	Jawans in Malkangiri, Rayagada, Gajapati, Koraput, Rourkela, Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Sambalpur have intensified search operations.        
	The week comes close on the heels of two major Naxalite attacks in the district.         
	On July 16, a landmine blast on Motu-Kalimela road killed 17 jawans of special operation group of the Orissa police and on June 29 an attack on a motor launch in Balimela reservoir, that sank the boat, killed 36 commandos of the Greyhound Force of Andhra Pradesh, with two persons from Orissa.         
	Meanwhile, two suspected rebels were arrested from Aska and cash worth Rs 1.35 lakh was seized from them. An investigation is on to confirm if they are indeed Naxalites, said a police officer.

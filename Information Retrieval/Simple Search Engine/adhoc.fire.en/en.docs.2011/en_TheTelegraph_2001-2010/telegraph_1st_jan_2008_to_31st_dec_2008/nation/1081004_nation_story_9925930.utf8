The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre relooks at world-class varsity plan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Centre relooks at world-class varsity plan 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Centre has decided to reconsider its initial blueprint for launching 14 world-class universities, amid growing concerns that the new brand of institutions may indirectly label other central varsities as inferior.         
	A draft legislation for the new breed of universities prepared by the University Grants Commission distinguishes between the new brand and the existing universities in their goals rather than quality, government officials have said.         
	The Prime Minister, while announcing the world-class universities in 2007, had declared that these varsities would be built to compete with the best institutions in the world and to make India a knowledge economy.         
	Higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal is scheduled to meet officials of the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) tomorrow to discuss the draft bill that the government is keen to enact soon, sources said.         
	The draft stays clear of any ranking between universities.         
	The draft legislation aims at downplaying the segregation between the new brand of universities and other central universities. But there are distinctions between the two categories, a source said.         
	The initial blueprint for the world-class central universities envisaged the institutions as centres that would provide the best education across streams available in India. Each university was to be built as a combination of an IIT-standard engineering school, AIIMS-like medical college, a law school like the National Law Universities and a humanities institution like the Jawaharlal Nehru University.         
	At a national workshop organised by the UGC on July 29-30 in Delhi, several vice-chancellors of central and state universities, however, raised objections to the plan blueprint, the workshop minutes reveal.         
	The idea of a de-novo world-class university is a non-starter. A world-class university may enjoy a superior status at the cost of central and state universities, and therefore, may give a dangerous signal to the peril of the university system, the minutes note.         
	The workshop  attended by HRD ministry officials, senior academics and vice-chancellors  recommended that the world-class universities be called national universities instead.         
	No decision has, however, been taken on the nomenclature yet, an official confirmed.         
	We may still retain the format of a combination of institutions of excellence, but the thrust now is on research, and excellence in research, the official explained.         
	The need to catch up in quality, inter-disciplinary research with countries like China and Korea is cited as a key objective behind the concept in the draft bill, a source said.         
	The draft also suggests that existing central or state universities can seek a shift to the new brand.         
	The Centre today also announced that it would introduce, in the coming session of Parliament, a legislation to introduce 16 other central universities.

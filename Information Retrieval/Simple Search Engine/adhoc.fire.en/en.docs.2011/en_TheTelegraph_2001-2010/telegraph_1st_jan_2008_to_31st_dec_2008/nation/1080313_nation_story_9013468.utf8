          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Manoj with his dead baby                                  
	Ahmedabad, March 12: A three-day-old baby was killed in a fire in an incubator in a city hospital early today.         
	Shardaben Hospital superintendent N.C. Pandya said the tube light and a rod in the incubator caught fire because of a short circuit at 4.15am. The rod fell on the baby and killed it.         
	A nurse rescued two others, who were in the incubator. Four had been taken for breastfeeding only 10 minutes before the fire, she said.         
	The babies have been shifted to LG Hospital.         
	Pushpa Rai, the mother of the dead infant, has not been informed. Her husband Manoj blamed the hospital for the babys death.         
	But hospital authorities said: Our staff took prompt action and did whatever could be done.         
	The Rai family had come from Delhi to visit the Chaamunda Devi temple in Bhavnagar on Saturday. Pushpa was admitted to the hospital after she went into labour on way to Bhavnagar.        
	Municipal commissioner I.P. Gautam has ordered an inquiry.         
	K.R. Joshi, assistant manager of the hospital, claimed the incubators were not defective.

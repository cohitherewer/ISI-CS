               Chander
              
	Oak Forest (Illinois), Jan. 3 (AP): A blaze that killed an Indian couple and their three-year-old son in their suburban Chicago apartment may have had its point of origin in the caste system.
    
	Prosecutors say Subhash Chander, an immigrant from Chandigarh, doused the place with gasoline and set the fire  killing his pregnant daughter, son-in-law and their child  on Saturday because he believed the young woman had married beneath her station.
    
	His son-in-law was beneath him, in his opinion, prosecutor Robert Milan said of the 57-year-old. 
    
	Chander was jailed without bail yesterday on charges of murder, arson and intentional homicide of an unborn child in the deaths of Monika Rani, 22; Rajesh Kumar, 36; and their son Vansh.
    
	The public defenders office, which is representing Chander, refused to comment.
    
	Prosecutors said Chanders son-in-law was from a lower caste.
    
	Chanders sister Kamla Devi, however, said family members had accepted Kumar as the son-in-law. 
    
	Authorities said they did not know which castes the husband and wife belonged to.
    
	Chander told police he spilled gasoline at his daughters apartment during a pushing match with his son-in-law who asked him to leave as it was late. 
    
	Chander said he became angry and pulled a lighter from his pocket and set the carpet on fire.
    
	But the prosecutors said the victims were probably asleep as everyone else in the building was able to escape.

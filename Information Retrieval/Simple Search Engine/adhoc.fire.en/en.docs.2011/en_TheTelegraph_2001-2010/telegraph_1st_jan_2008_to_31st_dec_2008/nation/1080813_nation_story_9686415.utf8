  - Bangalore protests as party-pooper police shut discos 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A protest for the extension of pub hours in Bangalore. Bangalore News Photos                                        
	Bangalore, Aug. 12: All work and no play will make Bangalore a dull city, but try telling that to its police.        
	On Sunday, residents did just that. They joined a protest by disc jockeys and musicians on M.G. Road with placards that read: Bangalore police are going after musicians instead of criminals. Some of the protesters  playwright Girish Karnad was part of the march  sang songs and strummed the guitar.        
	The result: 40 discotheques have been shut down since.        
	They are all operating without licences and are illegal. There is a ban on dancing to live music and serving liquor on the same premises. Let them apply for discotheque licences, we will give them a nod if they do not serve liquor, police commissioner Shankar Bidari said.        
	So you can either drink or dance in Bangalore, you cant do both together.        
	The rule divorcing drinking from dancing came about when cabaret joints were sprouting four years ago. But the police should know a cabaret from a disco, fume residents.         
	For gods sake, discos are not cabaret joints, this is where hard working people let their hair down, fashion designer Manoviraj Khosla said.        
	Fashion guru Prasad Bidappa echoed him: Cabarets are where prostitutes hang out. Discos are where decent people hang out. Cant the police differentiate between the two?        
	But that is not all that Bangaloreans are worked up about. The city that works 24/7 cant even party till Cinderella hour  the law says that any place serving liquor has to close shop by 11.30pm, a rule that is strictly enforced.         
	How can enjoying good, live music in a decent restaurant with a drink at night be illegal? Having seen such things in almost all places in the world, these restrictions sound absurd to me. I am ashamed that the city has come to such a pass. I hope they resolve the issues soon, said Karnad.         
	There seems little hope of that. Appeals to push back the curfew hour  even the governments own tourism department thinks 12.30am would be more acceptable for a city that calls itself international  have been made for almost a decade.        
	What kind of a pub city  one of Bangalores many names  is this if it cannot allow its citizens to enjoy a decent night life? asks fashion designer Khosla.         
	A pub owner who did not want to be named said even staying open for a few minutes after 11.30 invited a police raid. He owns a pub on Church Street, just off Brigade Road  which is to Bangalore what Park Street is to Calcutta.        
	D. Vikramaditya, a self-confessed night owl, complains: Having a good time with your friends in a pub is a problem as police walk in and force closure after 11.30pm.         
	We are only enforcing the law, shrugs commissioner Bidari.         
	Last year, the police forced a favourite watering hole to shut down when a former ministers son opened fire after an altercation with a couple. Instead of taking action against the VIPs son, the police closed the pub, a party-goer says, to back up the argument that the police are high-handed.

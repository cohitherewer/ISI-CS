                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Top cop bids adieu to Super 30
          SANTOSH SINGH                          Abhayanand. Telegraph picture                                  
	Patna, June 9: Bihar Military Police (BMP) chief and physicist Abhayanand has decided to say goodbye to the Super 30 that produced 30 IITians this year.        
	The additional director-general of police is leaving the successful experiment in education as a contended man.         
	He is not quitting Ramanujam School of Mathematics with any rancour, but with a great sense of pride.         
	Abhyanand today told The Telegraph: Now that we have achieved 100 per cent results, there is nothing to prove to myself. Its time to move on and take this social laboratory to other sectors.         
	Extending his thanks to Super 30 mathematician Anand Kumar, the police officer, once a blue-eyed boy of chief minister Nitish Kumar, said he is grateful to Anand for providing him a socio-educational space.         
	Abyanand used to teach physics to the Super 30 batch.         
	He, however, said: I will be available for guidance but will not be a part of any teaching faculty anywhere.         
	Abhayanand stressed that he was not dissociating himself from anyone. As he believes Super 30 was an experiment in a social laboratory and not a coaching institute.        
	The police officer also played down insinuations of him leaving the famous group after having fallen out with the chief minister a few months ago.        
	The talks began when the physicist gave the Super 30 felicitation function that was organised by the chief ministers office last Saturday a miss.        
	Grapevine states that last year, despite nearly cent per cent success, the batch was not felicitated by the CMO because of some internal police politics involving an ego tussle between Abhayanand and the former DGP, A.R. Sinha.         
	Let people come out with their interpretations. I am now looking forward to my next project. His next project would involve constables. The officer has asked the personnel to get together, pool in seed money and start a hospital. A formal declaration would be made on 16 June, Abhayanand said.        
	Nitish Kumar, however, seemed ignorant about the top officers decision.         
	My association with the Super 30 is minimal. I received an invitation from Anand Kumar and attended a function. I know nothing more, he said. He added that the Super 30 a wonder.         
	Super 30 mathematician Anand Kumar said: I have tremendous respect for Abhayanand s abilities. He has a Midas touch and I am happy about his ideas of taking the Super 30 to other fields.        
	Abhayanand had associated himself with Anand in early 1990s when the latter wanted to do something new in the field of education.         
	The duo conceptualised a talent hunt from among the weak socio-economic strata, which came to be known as Super 30 that started in 2003. The batch started with 18 students making it to the IIT in its first year. The tally went up to 22, 26, 28, 28 and 30 in successive years.

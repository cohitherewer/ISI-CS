  - Wives of aids victims to get financial aid          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: Battling AIDS is a task in itself. Add to that the stigma attached to the disease, and the life of a patient becomes even tougher.        
	In order to ease the hardships just a bit, the Orissa government yesterday initiated a special pension for HIV-positive patients  Madhu Babu Pension Yojana.         
	Under the scheme, every HIV-positive person will be entitled to Rs 200 per month. With the announcement, Orissa becomes the first state to provide such a benefit.        
	Orissa currently has a population of 6,132 (approximately) HIV-positive persons. The scheme would benefit all patients irrespective of their age and wage. Maximum number of beneficiaries would be from Ganjam, where the patient percentage is the highest in the state.        
	The government has also decided to provide a widow pension to the wives of AIDS victims.         
	Efforts notwithstanding, superstitions run too deep and discourage many from appearing for the HIV test.         
	Majority of the patients are ostracised. Even the family and neighbours sometimes keep a distance. Children infected with the virus hardly are allowed to attend schools, said Himadri Mohapatra, a member of the Orissa Human Rights Commission, while speaking at an awareness programme organised by Ruchika Social Service Organisation for slum residents today.         
	Despite the setbacks, there have been instances that serve as encouraging examples. A couple from Patikata of Gosani block in Gajapati yesterday adopted a newborn of a mentally-disturbed HIV-positive woman. The childless couple  G. Lachheya and his wife G. Rajulamma  came forward to adopt the newborn disregarding all social stigmas. They officially adopted the child.        
	Yesterdays case is encouraging, said Mathew Pickard, the country director of Concern, an international NGO working with patients in the state.

Dial a call centre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ready replies                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: Banks, telecom companies and utilities have long used call centres to deal with customer queries. The government has now turned to a call centre to help achieve population stabilisation.         
	A society set up by the ministry of health and family welfare has hired a call centre to address doubts among people about family planning, adolescence and infant health among other aspects of reproductive health.         
	A team of 12 executives supervised by a doctor at the New Delhi-based call centre will respond to callers who dial 6666-5555 seeking advice, health ministry and call centre officials said.         
	Since its test launch in April this year, the number of calls has already climbed from less than 10 a day to 500 a day, they said.         
	The service is primarily used by adolescents and newly-married and about-to-be-married couples, the officials said. The queries cover a range of topics  from adolescence issues to menopause.         
	A dedicated call centre is likely to help deliver information about reproductive health more efficiently than existing helplines managed by non-government organisations or hospitals, said Shailaja Chandra, executive director of the National Population Stabilisation Fund (Jan Sthirtha Kosh), the society that has supported the call centre.         
	People can access impartial information on reproductive health anonymously from this helpline, she said.         
	In its effort to catalyse a movement in favour of population stabilisation, the society has also introduced a programme to reward parents if a girls marriage is delayed to after 19 years of age, if a woman delivers her first child after 21 years of age, if parents keep a 36-month gap between the first and second child, and if one parent gets sterilised after the birth of a second child.         
	The society is also encouraging private gynaecologists to perform tubectomy procedures in an effort to expand the role of the private sector in population stabilisation.

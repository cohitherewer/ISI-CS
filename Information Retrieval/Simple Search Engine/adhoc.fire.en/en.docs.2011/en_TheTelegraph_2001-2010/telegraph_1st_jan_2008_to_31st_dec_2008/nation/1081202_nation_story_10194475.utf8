	Mumbai, Dec. 1: Sourav Mishra, a Reuters reporter injured in the Mumbai attack, was declared dead on the Maharashtra government website. My sister who had called my number was not ready to accept that I was Sourav Mishra... I had to scream to bring her back to sense, the 29-year-old said from his hospital bed.

          JAYANTH JACOB                          The cover of Alex Haleys Roots: In search of the past                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: If Alex Haley were an Indian, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble while giving the world his unforgettable novel Roots.        
	The ministry of overseas Indian affairs has tied up with private company Indiaroots to help people of Indian origin (PIOs) anywhere in the world who want to trace their roots in India.        
	Under the programme, a PIO pays Rs 20,000 to the Indian mission in the country where he lives. Within three months, Indiaroots is to identify the applicants surviving close relatives and place of origin (from fathers and mothers sides) and work out a possible family tree.        
	Indiaroots undertakes the same job now, but the government tie-up means it will effectively have a front office in almost every country, wherever there is an Indian mission.        
	The desire to find out about ones ancestors can be very strong among diaspora, as suggested by the life and work of Haley (1921-92), a black American writer best known for Roots.        
	The 1976 novel is based on the authors own family history starting with Kunta Kinte, kidnapped in Gambia in 1767 and sold as a slave in Maryland, the US. Haley, who claims to be a 17th-generation descendant of Kinte, researched the book for nearly 10 years, making intercontinental trips.        
	In contrast, PIOs have just to fill in a prescribed form at an Indian mission and deposit Rs 20,000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies such as the US dollar or euro. They can also hand in any information or document that can help trace their roots.        
	The ministry will forward the application and the documents to Indiaroots with a Rs 6,000 advance. The companys findings will be sent to the Indian mission to be passed on to the applicant.        
	Haleys research was disputed, leading to an out-of-court settlement. However, if theres any doubt about Indiaroots findings, the ministry decision  taken in consultation with the applicant and the company  will be binding on the PIO.        
	If Indiaroots fails to trace an applicants ancestry, it will retain only Rs 4,000 from the advance. The ministry will keep Rs 6,000 and refund the remaining Rs 10,000 to the PIO.        
	If the applicant wants to visit his ancestral place after receiving the information, the ministry and Indiaroots will arrange for a trip but the PIO must foot the entire bill.        
	The Centre had launched its tracing the roots programme about two years ago as a pilot project in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments  for PIOs who believed they were from these states. But it flopped because of staff shortage.        
	On Haleys evidence, the programme should be a success. The author said the most emotional moment of his life came on September 29, 1967, when he stood at the site in Annapolis, Maryland, where his ancestor had arrived 200 years before.        
	Roots was published in 37 languages and made into a TV series that drew 13 crore viewers.

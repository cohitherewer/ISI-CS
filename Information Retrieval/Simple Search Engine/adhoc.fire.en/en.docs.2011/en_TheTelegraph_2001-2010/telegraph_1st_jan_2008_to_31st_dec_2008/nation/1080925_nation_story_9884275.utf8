                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jamia VC stands up with students
          OUR BUREAU                           Hasan                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor today asked his students to remain calm, but the attempts to soothe frayed nerves may have only further agitated students of an institution struggling to recover from recent terror taints.         
	Amid a din of slogans accusing the media of maligning Jamia, vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan defended the varsity aggressively in his first address to students and faculty after the arrest of two students  Zia-ur-Rehman (BA course) and Mohammed Shakeel (MA Economics)  for suspected roles in the September 13 Delhi blasts.         
	Hamein ek saath mushtaidi se ladna hoga (We will have to unitedly fight in a determined manner), Hasan said, diplomatically omitting what or who the fight was against.         
	An obvious target was the media  which Hasan accused of exaggerating facts  and students heckled reporters.         
	But the absence of any clear mention of the target may have allowed sections of the university fraternity to interpret his address differently.         
	By emphasising that the university would stand united in this time of trouble, the VC has helped assuage concerns that the administration is not in control. This message will help calm the atmosphere down on the campus, Wasim Riaz, a lecturer in the school of social sciences, said.         
	To Mansoor Alam, a second-year student of mechanical engineering, the VC indicated that he is opposed to the police attacks against the university and our students.        
	He clearly meant the fight is against all those opposed to Jamias interests, Alam said.         
	Rakesh Madan, a BA student, agreed that the university is being unfairly targeted and the VCs message indicates he agrees with us.         
	I am not a Muslim, but the fact is that we need to stand together as a university at this time. Two of our students have been picked up and the police are yet to present any evidence against them. Some of my Muslim classmates are worried whether they will be next, he said.         
	The university has announced a peace march tomorrow at 11am. Madan said he had planned to skip the march, but changed his mind after Hasans address.         
	I cant study at the moment. We will all come to the march tomorrow and will express our anger against the manner in which our students are being persecuted, he said.         
	Hasan, however, cautioned the students against politicising the events that have led to the tension in the university. Jamia ko siyasat ka akhada na banaye (Dont make Jamia a hub of politics), he told students at the Ansari auditorium on the Jamia campus.         
	He urged the students not to take the law into their own hands, but reiterated a promise he made yesterday that the university would legally assist our boys who have been arrested.         
	The BJP today asked for his dismissal for assisting terrorists.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Farmers willing, if price is right 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A plaque in Sanand with the name of Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata Group, last on a list of donors who helped save cattle during the famine of 1899-1900                                  
	Sanand, Oct. 8: The farmers of Sanand, the Gujarat site where the Nano has found its new home, feel that they are different from their counterparts elsewhere in the country.        
	The Gujarati farmer is forward looking and believes in changing with the times. The farmers in Singur still appear hung up on their feudal land-holdings, said Ravuji Vaghela, a farmer of Sanand who has set up a small-scale unit that manufactures foils.         
	Nazir Pathan, the sarpanch of Chharodi village that will come under the plant area, has sold two acres to the government for building the approach road to the Nano factory.        
	Pathan said farmers like him were more than happy to sell their land if the price was attractive enough. With the money we get, we can buy cheaper land elsewhere, said the sarpanch, who, like fellow villagers, is excited over the prospect of a township coming up in Sanand.         
	The farmers of the area, who own anywhere between three and 20 acres, grow paddy and wheat, which are fed by the waters of the Narmada canal. Electricity is abundant and a farmer with three acres earns around Rs 70,000-80,000 annually.         
	But like Pathan, the farmers are willing to part with their land as they see an opportunity to turn cash-rich overnight and take care of future generations.        
	We want to secure the future of our children and this is the best way forward, said Pathan.         
	An official in the land records department carrying out a survey in the area said he would not be surprised if the land price touched Rs 1 crore per acre in the near future.        
	In that case, he pointed out, the market price of the 1,100 acres the government has transferred to Tata Motors would add up to nearly Rs 1,000 crore, half the proposed investment of the company.         
	However, a leading property developer, who has already struck a deal, said the market price of the government land was bound to be pegged much below the prevailing rate, else the cost-sensitive project would not be economically viable.

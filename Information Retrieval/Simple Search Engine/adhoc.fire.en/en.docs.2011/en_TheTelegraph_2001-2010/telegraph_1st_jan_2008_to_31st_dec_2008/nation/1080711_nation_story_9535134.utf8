          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, July 10: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted crimes against women were alarmingly high in Bengal but insisted it reflected a countrywide phenomenon.         
	Responding to a question from Congress MLA Gyan Singh Sohanpal in the Assembly, the chief minister, who also oversees the home (police) department, said several factors were responsible for the increase. These included gender discrimination, dowry, poverty and lack of education.        
	I agree with Sohanpal that crime against women in Bengal is a matter of concern as they are alarmingly high. But Bengal is not an exception. This (the increase) is a countrywide phenomenon, the chief minister added.        
	Later, speaking on his departments budget, Bhattacharjee sought to draw a comparison with Delhi and paint Bengal in better light, saying only 44 rape cases were registered in Calcutta in 2007 against 598 in the capital.        
	At this, Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy intervened to say incidents of rape were high in Delhi members of a particular community are generally aggressive there (in the capital).         
	The chief minister stopped Roy midway through his speech, saying his words amounted to casting a slur on a particular group. Why did you talk about (that community)? As a Trinamul Congress MLA, you have insulted that community.         
	Reeling off statistics, the chief minister said 12,873 cases of atrocities on women were registered in 2005. The figure increased to 13,113 cases in 2006 and 16,059 in 2007.        
	Bhattacharjee said the government was taking all possible steps to minimise such crimes. Since the crimes involve a socio-economic problem, mere policing will not help much. A concerted (social) campaign is necessary. I am optimist of tackling the problem.        
	He said the billboards for consumer goods outnumbered government hoardings against accepting dowry and going in for child marriages. It (rise in crimes) is a vicious circle.        
	Grievance cells have been set up in most police stations to register complaints from women, the chief minister said. The Opposition said the special cells were meaningless as crimes against women were hardly registered in the districts.        
	Responding to a question from Barry Brien, the chief minister said various schools were giving students lessons in personality development, appearing to suggest that they were being groomed to desist from and resist such crimes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | China hackers breach foreign office 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     China hackers breach foreign office 
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, April 9: The foreign ministrys computer networks have been broken into and telltale tracks are pointing to the hand of Chinese hackers.        
	Government sources said the worrisome security breaches uncovered during an audit last month had shown that the prime targets were systems of officials handling sensitive communication from Indian missions abroad.        
	The hackers may already have accessed mission plans and policy-related exchanges, the sources cautioned.        
	More than anything else, what should ring in caution is that there have been breaches, including of some government sites maintained by the National Informatics Centre, in the recent past, a source said.        
	A ruffled government has decided to do a fresh audit of the security standards of Indian missions in key countries.         
	The check will begin at the Indian embassy in Beijing later this month and then move to London and the European countries.        
	The break-in was spotted in March by a team of Internet auditors from intelligence agencies that was reviewing the security of the external affairs ministrys networks.        
	By a system of verification, the team discovered that the hackers Internet protocol address and the media access control address originated from China, the sources said.        
	Although the IP address can be faked, it gives a clear idea of the place of its origin. The MAC address is an authoritative identification number (hardware) that helps trace the location or country of its origin.        
	The sources refused to give out more details, saying it was a sensitive matter.        
	Last year, there were reports of Chinese hackers breaking into computers at the Pentagon, including that of US defence secretary Robert Gates. There have been similar reports from London.        
	The Pentagon breach was reported last September by the Financial Times, which cited former and serving US officials as saying hackers controlled by Chinas military were behind it.         
	China has, however, denied all the reports. Some people make groundless accusations against China. China has all along been opposed to and forbids criminal activities undermining computer networks, including hacking, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said after the Pentagon episode.        
	China is ready to strengthen cooperation with other countries, including the US, in countering Internet crimes.

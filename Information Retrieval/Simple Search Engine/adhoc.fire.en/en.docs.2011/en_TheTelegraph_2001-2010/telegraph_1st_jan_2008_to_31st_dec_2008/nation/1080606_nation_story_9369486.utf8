	Cuttack, June 5: The Ravenshaw University has decided to reduce seats for undergraduate courses in the arts stream by 50 per cent for the next academic session and enhance its intake capacity for the subjects that are in demand.        
	With a 50 per cent slash, the total number of seats for bachelor in arts in Ravenshaw University for the next session would plummet to 256 from 512.         
	In a bid to reduce the huge number of vacancies in the arts departments after admissions every year, the university has also decided to decrease the total number of seats for postgraduate studies in English literature and economics by nearly 40 per cent.         
	Official sources said the number of seats for postgraduate courses in English and economics has been brought down to 64 from 104. The slash has been implemented to bring in uniformity in the number of post-graduation seats in different subjects.        
	The registrar of Ravenshaw University, Satyakam Mishra, explained that the university would increase its student intake up to 50 per cent in the commerce stream, taking the total seats for BCom to 384 from 256. The university would also add 24 seats to computer science (undergraduate) course and increase the (undergraduate) BSc course seats to 280.         
	The seats for undergraduate arts are never completely filled. This has been a trend over the past few years. So, the seats were decreased to accommodate more students in commerce and science streams that are in demand, the registrar told The Telegraph today.         
	Additional seats up to 20 per cent beyond the sanctioned strength would be made available only to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes students in undergraduate courses in arts, he added.         
	The latest UGC guidelines make it mandatory for PG students to present at least one seminar paper in a year. With so many seats, this was becoming impossible, Mishra added.         
	The seat slash, however, has been met with a degree of protests from members of the Aidso. The party has demanded a rollback in the university decision.

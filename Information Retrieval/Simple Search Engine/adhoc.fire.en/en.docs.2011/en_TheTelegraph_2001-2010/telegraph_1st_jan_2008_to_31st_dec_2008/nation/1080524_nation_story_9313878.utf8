	London, May 23 (PTI): Lakshmi Mittal is said to have spent 117 million on a new mansion here  making it possibly the worlds costliest home.         
	The Indian steel tycoon and Britains richest man, Mittal, bought the palatial home on Kensington Palace Gardens, a street dubbed Billionaires Row in west London, fully furnished and with an art collection for his 32-year-old son Aditya, The Sun reported today.         
	However, according to the tabloid, Mittal  who moved into the half-mile, tree-lined Private Avenue four years ago after paying 67 million for a 12-bedroom house  has denied buying the mansion.        
	The price of the mansion works out to 8,000 per square foot.         
	Mittal had recently put his 11-bedroom summer palace  one of Britains most expensive homes at 40 million  on Bishops Avenue on sale after his neighbours, the Barratt family, got approval from the civic authorities to build luxury apartments next door.         
	Mittal, the worlds largest steel maker whose fortune is estimated at 51 billion, had earlier tried to prevent them from getting permission from the local city council. The council had rejected his appeal.

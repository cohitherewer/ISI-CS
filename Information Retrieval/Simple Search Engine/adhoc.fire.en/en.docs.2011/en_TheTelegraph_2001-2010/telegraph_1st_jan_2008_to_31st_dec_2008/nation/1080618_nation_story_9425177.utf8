          SHEENA K.                          Bharti Sonkar                                  
	Raipur, June 17: For Bharti Sonkar, it was a different campaign trail this election, or elimination.        
	Three years ago, she trudged the same lanes of Gunderdehi with folded hands seeking votes to get her elected as president of nagar panchayat.         
	But this time, she begged people to vote for her to prevent her from losing office.         
	But it was a losing battle.        
	Besides Gunderdehi, about 80km from here, people of two other nagar panchayats in Chhattisgarh today underlined that they were the power by voting out the presidents of their respective civic body by exercising the right bestowed under the state Nagar Palika Act.        
	Section 47 (recall of the president) of the Chhattisgarh Nagar Palika Adhiniyam, 1961, enables people to seek election to recall the elected representatives  if the three-fourth of the total number of corporators in the municipal bodies inform the collector in writing that the president has lost the confidence of the body and hence fresh elections be held to recall civic body chiefs.        
	Before seeking fresh mandate, Bharti had two years in office to match up to the expectations of the people as the act has a provision of two years moratorium on its use.        
	Bhartis hectic campaign  literally not for getting elected but to protect her seat  did not sway the voters of her panchayat with a population of about 6,500. Of the 3,425 voters who exercised their franchise, 1,389 polled in her favour while 1,977 voted for her removal.         
	Interestingly, the ballot paper had only two symbols  an empty chair for recalling the elected representative and an occupied chair if they want the person to continue.        
	In fact, this was the first time when three nagar panchayats went to the polls to recall the president.         
	The precedent was set some two years ago when corporators sought recalling the Mahasamund nagar panchayat president Vimal Chopra. The matter was challenged in the court by the panchayat president and a final decision was still awaited.         
	But, Bharti was not so lucky to get a legal breather.         
	After the high court ruled against her, Bharti moved the Supreme Court. But, the apex court rejected the plea on May 13. I paid the price for being honest, she said.        
	Khoren Khalko of Rajpur nagar panchayat in Sarguja district was another woman panchayat president who failed to match the expectations of people. The two women were associated with the Congress.         
	In Nawagarh nagar panchayat, independent Sitaram had to give up his office after 1,146 voters backed for recalling him as against 865 voters who wanted him to remain as the president.

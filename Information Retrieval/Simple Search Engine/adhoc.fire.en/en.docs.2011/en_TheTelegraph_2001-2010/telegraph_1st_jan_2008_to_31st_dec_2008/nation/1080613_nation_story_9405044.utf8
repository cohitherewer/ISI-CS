	New Delhi, June 12 (PTI): The Centre has decided to set up a committee to look into the working conditions of child artistes performing in tele-serials, reality shows and advertisements.        
	Concerned over reports that children in such shows were overburdened by parents, the Union ministry for women and child development has asked the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to look into their working conditions.        
	The five-member panel will include officials from the labour and women and child development ministries, a child psychologist, a member of the child rights panel and a professional with experience in producing reality shows.        
	The working conditions under which they work are not properly defined. There are no guidelines to define whether they are getting proper rest after shooting for eight-nine hours or nutritious food in the studios, women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury said.        
	We are not sure whether their education is suffering because of these engagements. After a thorough study we will be coming out with guidelines for children working under any conditions, she said.        
	Child rights commission member Sandhya Bajaj said the panel members would talk to child stars like Kunal Khemu and Sarika about their experiences and suggestions.        
	This is a new type of child labour which we have to deal with. The parents of these child artistes are rich and do not necessarily need money, but today the craze to see their offspring on TV is all-pervasive, Bajaj said.

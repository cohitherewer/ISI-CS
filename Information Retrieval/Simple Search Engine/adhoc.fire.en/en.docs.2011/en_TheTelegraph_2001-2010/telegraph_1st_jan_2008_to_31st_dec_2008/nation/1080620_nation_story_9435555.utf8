	Sambalpur, June 19: Knowledge Circle India, New Delhi, in collaboration with Bharat Integrated Social Welfare Agency (Biswa), today organised a seminar on Peace on planet earth at the Sambalpur railway institute.        
	Speaking on the occasion, Satya Narayan Sahu, a director in Prime Ministers office, said that human beings often had harmed peace. Humans have emerged as a threat to peace. Empathy and a Gandhian way is the path to achieve peace, Sahu said.         
	World peace is a vast subject and symposiums need to be held to make people aware of its relevance as well as necessity. The so-called army defences by developed nations are nothing but a ploy to butcher its neighbours, said Bhagwan Prakash, the chairperson at the seminar.         
	The participants concluded that poverty, illiteracy and injustice were the impediments towards world peace.        
	Speaking at the seminar the Biswa chairperson K.C. Mallick implored all to be responsible in their duties to the family, nation and earth.

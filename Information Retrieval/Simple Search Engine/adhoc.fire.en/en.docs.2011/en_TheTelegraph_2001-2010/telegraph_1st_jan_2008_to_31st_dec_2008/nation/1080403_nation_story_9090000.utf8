	Chandigarh, April 2: Islamabad seems to have forgotten about its 46 nationals who have completed their sentences in Punjabs Amritsar jail.        
	Repatriation is a long procedure, with a series of verifications that Pakistan has to initiate, but so much time has lapsed since the prisoners won their freedom that they have begun to lose hope.        
	All the 46, including three women Shukla Ghosh, Farzana Nasreen and Seema, have now sought Indias help to facilitate their release.         
	Most of the prisoners had inadvertently strayed into India, a senior Amritsar district officer said.

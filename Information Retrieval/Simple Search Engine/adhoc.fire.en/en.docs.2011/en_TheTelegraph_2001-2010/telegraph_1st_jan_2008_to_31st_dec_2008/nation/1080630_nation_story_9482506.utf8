The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu PhD fails to ensure job
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lalu PhD fails to ensure job
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, June 29: Initially, he thought that his PhD on Lalu Prasad would earn him job and recognition besides the blessings from the minister who revolutionised revenue earning for the railways.        
	Shyam Narayan Tiwarys venture had earned him a doctorate degree but it failed to fetch him a job of lecturer for which he picked up the most successful railway minister for the topic of his thesis. What has added wound to his injury is his failure to meet Lalu Prasad despite his repeated efforts.        
	Son of a poor farmer from central Bihars Rohtas district, Shyam is third among his brothers  all highly educated but unemployed. Eldest among the sons of Brijbilas Tiwary, Taranath was the first in the family to secure masters degree from Benaras Hindu University. Taranath joined farming on his failure to get job. The second brother, Ram Narayan, also completed masters, adding BEd too in the curriculum vitae. But he too ended up jobless and joined farming.        
	The underprivileged family had great hopes in Shyam who had been sent to BHU. Shyam, after procuring masters in political science, embarked on to do PhD on Lalu Prasad. The topic of the PhD which was awarded to Shyam is: Lalu Prasads role in Indian politics.        
	I was sure that my thesis on Lalu Prasad, being invited as management guru in the B-schools in India and abroad, would be appreciated earning me at least a job of lecturer, Shyam says, adding: Now the interviewers ask me why I picked up Lalu Prasad for my PhD thesis.        
	I fail to understand what is wrong with the topic. After all, top notch management institutions in India and abroad present their students before Lalu Prasad to learn the art of managing the affairs, Shyam asks rather worriedly.        
	He has no money to get his thesis published. Its publication requires at least Rs 60,000. I have tried many times to meet Laluji with the sole purpose to get financial assistance from the publication division of the Centre to get the thesis published. I have written many letters to him also. But there is no response so far, Shyam laments.        
	Will Lalu Prasad listen? After all, he had sent one Brahmdeo Paswan to Rajya Sabha for writing Lalu chalisa. What is wrong with Shyam?

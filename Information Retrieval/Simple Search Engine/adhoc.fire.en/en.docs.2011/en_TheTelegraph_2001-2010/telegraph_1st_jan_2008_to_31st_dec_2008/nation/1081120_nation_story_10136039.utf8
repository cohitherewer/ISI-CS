                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tata Steels unused land taken back
          ANKUSH SINGH                               
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 19: An industrial development body in Jharkhand has taken back 100 acres lying unused within a 350-acre plot leased to Tata Steel, stepping up efforts to help at least 150 small and medium units waiting for land to start operations.        
	Officials of the Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority (AIADA) said of the 350 acres leased in 1969, the steel major was using 200 acres in Gamharia to house the Tisco Growth Shop, a steel product manufacturing subsidiary. The remaining 150 acres were lying vacant.        
	Based on a hearing conducted by the AIADA managing director on October 31, the authority today decided to cancel the lease for 100 acres, leaving 50 acres for future expansion plans of the company.         
	We had sent several notices to the company (since 2006) asking it to use the land, AIADA secretary H.N. Ram said. The company said the vacant land would be used for expansion purposes of its sister concern.        
	A spokesperson for Tata Steel refused comment, saying the company was not aware of the development.        
	Officials of the authority in Adityapur, a town in Seraikela-Kharsawan district separated from Jamshedpur by a river, said the decision had been taken to help facilitate the construction of small and medium units in the industrial belt, already plagued by acute shortage of land.         
	The land that has been taken back from Tata Steel would be given to other industrial units that are waiting for land in the industrial belt. We have provisions to cancel a lease agreement with an industrial unit if it has failed to use it according to the rules of the agreement, a senior AIADA official said.         
	The AIADA has given the go-ahead to at least 150 industrial projects but they have not yet taken off for want of land.         
	The AIADAs land acquisition proposals have also failed to take off because of protests from local villagers. We are looking to acquire around 2,200 acres near Sitarampur Dam in Seraikela-Kharsawan district, the official added.        
	The AIADA has also sent notices to several other industrial units that have not been using land leased to them.

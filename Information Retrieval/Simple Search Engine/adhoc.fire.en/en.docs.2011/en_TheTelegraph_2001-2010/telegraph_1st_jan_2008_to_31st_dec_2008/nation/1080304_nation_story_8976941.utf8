	Patna, March 3 (PTI): The Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, today admitted that there has been a decline in the cases of kidnapping and abduction ever since the NDA-government came to power. 
    
	He allayed apprehensions about Nithari-like incidents in the state. Nitish told the Assembly that boys, who went missing, were being traced as by police. 
    
	We are concerned about the boys who remain traceless even today. Policemen are on the job to look for them, he said, while making brief intervention in reply to a question asked by the LJP leader, Maheshwar Prasad Singh, in the Assembly.
    
	The LJP MLA wanted to know the fate of the 314 boys who are shown to be missing in the state crime records and in police complaints. 
    
	Patna High Court is also monitoring the cases, said he, adding he has held meetings with officials regarding the matter and had issued directions to personnel to act soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left seals elite golf club, gets egg on face
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left seals elite golf club, gets egg on face
          JOHN MARY                          The Trivandrum Golf Club                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, June 3: Kerala High Court has restored the heritage Trivandrum Golf Club to its members, three days after the Left government ordered its immediate takeover for non-payment of dues and because it was being used by a privileged few.        
	The government, which has been left red-faced, will file an appeal in the high court tomorrow against yesterdays single-judge order staying the takeover of the club, set up in the 1850s by the erstwhile Travancore royal family.         
	It is also the second oldest golf club in the country. Calcuttas Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the oldest outside Britain, was set up in 1829.         
	A similar move had been initiated against Calcutta Club in 1993, when the Bengal government had asked it to vacate the leased property on which it stood. Then public works minister Matish Roy had complained in a letter that the club had not increased the rent from the time the property had been handed over to it in 1915 and that it was a violation of the terms of the original lease. The club signed a new lease deed in 1995 with an enhancement of rent.         
	The Thiruvananthapuram institution, which has a nine-hole golf course, was locked and sealed by the district collector at 9pm on Saturday following chief minister V.S. Achuthanandans announcement in the day that the cabinet had decided on the takeover.        
	The reason cited in the collectors order was that the club was in illegal possession of land and buildings which were being used by a privileged few as opposed to the common good.         
	The government claims its decision was based on a recommendation of the Assembly Petitions Committee and that it wants to set up a permanent venue for the annual international film festival of Kerala without disturbing the golf course. But golfers scoffed at the defence, saying government land was available elsewhere for the festival site.        
	The club, according to the government, has totted up licence fee arrears of Rs 58 crore. It has been the preserve of the elite and is anachronistic, given that many of the colonial heritage structures elsewhere in the state have been razed or reduced to ruins over the years.         
	But the government has egg on its face since the club got wind of the cabinet decision and swiftly moved court seeking a stay. Many of those on the 11-member club executive committee are senior officials, including chief secretary P.J. Thomas and district collector Sanjay Kaul, who served the takeover notice asking the office-bearers to vacate within 24 hours the 25.38 acres and all buildings, leased out for 99 years in 1967.         
	Justice Siri Jagan, who stayed the takeover, has directed revenue principal secretary Nivedita P. Haran to appear before the court on Monday to explain the haste with which her department had sealed and locked the club even while the court was seized of the issue.         
	Lawyers alleged that the hasty move by the officials to get the golf club vacated was deliberate and intended to provoke the court into issuing a stay order, frustrating the governments takeover plans.        
	E.M. Najeeb, a former secretary of the club, said it was unfair that the government should try to close down a club when it was planning to set up an 18-hole golf course elsewhere in the state to attract high-end tourists.

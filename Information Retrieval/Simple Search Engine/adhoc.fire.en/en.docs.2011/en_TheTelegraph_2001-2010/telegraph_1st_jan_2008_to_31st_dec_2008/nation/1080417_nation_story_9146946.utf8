	Gaya, April 16: The body of 14-year-old Reena (name changed), who was gangraped and later strangulated near Dara Chak village under Chandauti police station in Gaya, was found today.         
	Reena was an orphan who lived with her grandparents and her brother. Police believe that the teenager was raped and killed in the early hours of April 14, but her bruised and decomposed body was discovered today.         
	Reports at the police headquarters state that the crime was committed around the time when Reenas village was busy celebrating Chaita festivities.         
	Reenas brother met with an accident on April 14 and she rushed to her younger brothers aid.         
	Whereas, her grandmother and other villagers took her brother to the hospital, Reena was sent back home.         
	It is suspected that on her way, Reena met a group who raped her and then strangled her to death. The unidentified criminals then dumped her body in the fields, burying it under the harvested wheat.        
	For two days Reena went missing while police and villagers looked for her everywhere.         
	The body has been sent to Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem. Tension gripped the village with sympathisers swearing to avenge the girls death. Some villagers suspect that the girl was killed because she identified her attackers.         
	When contacted, Gaya superintendent of police Paresh Saxena confirmed the incident and said that the investigations would start after the Maoist bandh got over.         
	However, sources reveal that no arrests have been made so far. Gaya police public relations officer Rajvansh Singh said a case against unknown offenders has been instituted.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           Orissa High Court          
	Cuttack, Jan. 8: Orissa High Court on Monday took judicial note of a change in the mode of inquiry into a murder case at the behest of a BJD MLA, while the matter was still sub-judice.         
	The crime branch in June 2007 had taken over a probe into the death of one Bhagirathi Das in Jajpur, while police probe into the case was under judicial scrutiny. Inspector-general B.K. Sharma of the crime branch allegedly issued the probe order based on a representation from Jajpur BJD MLA Parmeswar Sethi, a status report submitted by the government has revealed. The two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B. Mohapatra summoned B.K. Sharma to make a personal appearance at 10.30am on January 10 to explain taking over a matter while it was still sub-judice.         
	The bench has further directed the IG to file an affidavit stating his legal competence to change the mode of inquiry. Bhagirathi Das was murdered at Ichhapur on March 6, 2007.        
	Kabita Das, his wife filed an FIR at Mangalpur police station naming Kedar Narayan Parida, his son and 17 others as responsible.         
	The court expressed its displeasure and stated that interference in the process of inquiry at that stage was unwarranted.         
	The murder case reached the high court when Kabita sought judicial intervention alleging police inaction. Acting on her petition the court directed the government to file a status report on the inquiry.         
	Later, the government admitted that three of the accused had been arrested. while the other 16 named in the FIR were absconding. Non bailable warrants had since been issued against those absconding. The murder, however, was by then being investigated by the crime branch.         
	The government report also revealed that Parmeswar Sethi had written a letter for a crime branch inquiry as innocent persons were being unnecessarily victimised in the case.         
	Subsequently, the IG, on June 23, 2007, had issued an order for a crime branch probe on the basis of the MLAs plea.

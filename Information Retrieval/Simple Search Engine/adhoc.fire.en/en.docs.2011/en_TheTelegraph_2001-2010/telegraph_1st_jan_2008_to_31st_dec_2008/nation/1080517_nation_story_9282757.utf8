          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, May 16: Not the red carpet alone, a bullet-proof vehicle, too, would be waiting for all VIPs visiting Chhattisgarh.         
	The government has decided to purchase 10 new bullet-proof vehicles to provide adequate security to VIPs visiting Chhattisgarh in wake of red threat. The home department has approved the proposal and asked the police headquarters to purchase the vehicles, a senior police officer conceded.         
	The vehicles will be at the disposal of state garage and state protocol, he added.         
	At present, neither the state garage nor the state protocol has bullet-proof vehicle reserve. The limited vehicles available in Chhattisgarh are part of the states dignitaries convoys, who are in the top of the red hit list.         
	With more VIPs making headway into the state, it was inevitable for the authorities to purchase new vehicles. Not only do the VIPs travel to the state they prefer visiting the tribal dominated, red pockets, and expect full-proof security cover. Without bullet-proof vehicles that proves to be a daunting task for the state police. In many occasions, the state protocol has had to hire vehicles from travel agencies, a move that is against prescribed security protocol.         
	Thereby, the government has also sanctioned 20 new posts for drivers for the state garage.         
	With 10 posts already lying vacant, 30 new drivers will be recruited soon.         
	With Chhattisgarh going to Assembly polls later in 2008, the vehicles will go a long way in helping the police provide security to politicians when they visit interior areas for poll campaign.

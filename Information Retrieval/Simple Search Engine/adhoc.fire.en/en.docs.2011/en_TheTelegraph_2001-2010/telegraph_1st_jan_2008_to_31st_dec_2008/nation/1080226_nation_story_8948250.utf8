          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Samruddha Odisha, a regional outfit floated five months ago, is planning to launch a mass contact campaign from February 28 from Mayurbhanj.         
	Announcing their plan, Samruddha Odisha president Jatish Mohanty said he would embark on a padyatra (walk) from Dantiamuhan panchayat of Morada block under Mayurbhanj district on that day.         
	Mohanty, a former IAS officer who quit the service last year to float the outfit, said his party has set a goal to remove poverty from the state within five years of coming to power.         
	That cant be possible without reaching out to the rural masses and making an advanced plan based on their feedback. And that is why Samruddha Odisha is organising the padayatra, he said.         
	He also alleged that all previous state governments had lost their contact with the masses and forgotten them after coming to power.         
	Mohanty said his party would contest the forthcoming polls in all the 147 Assembly and 21 Lok Sabha constitucies across the state.

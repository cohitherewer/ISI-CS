The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong to be on call in MP
                                                                                                               Cong to be on call in MP
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, March 25: Please hold the line, your vote is important to us.        
	That will be the welcome line that greets any person who dials the Congress call centre due to be launched in Madhya Pradesh next month.        
	Thanks to prodding from IT-savvy Rahul Gandhi, an army of trained Congress workers will soon be on call in the poll-bound state, fielding phone queries from prospective voters on many things under the sun.        
	Starting from power cuts and water scarcity to deletion of names from poll rolls to Congress leaders agenda, the team will take questions on broader issues like the UPAs policies and schemes as well as the ideology and history of the 123-year-old party.        
	They will also record public grievances, corruption complaints and information from whistle-blowers, and try to take appropriate follow-up action.        
	State Congress chief Suresh Pachauri, the brain behind the call centre, said the idea was to set up a communication channel with the voter ahead of the year-end Assembly elections.        
	Such a hotline will enable the party to get comprehensive feedback from rural and urban voters about the BJP regimes weaknesses, he said.        
	We need information about corruption even at the lower rung of administration so that we can take up the peoples cause, Brij Mohan Srivastva, one of Pachauris aides, said.        
	We have 14 departments, cells and morchas, a battery of lawyers and other professionals to take up their cause. The only thing needed is the connection between the masses and us. That is where modern technology and the call-centre business model will help us.        
	The role of the proposed call centre is vast. The 24x7 centre will have Congressmen working in shifts, giving information on the agenda of the party and its leaders. Anyone can call and ask where Congress leaders are touring, their programme, details of meetings etc.        
	The call centre will also have an SMS desk where queries relating to the Right to Information Act, human rights, the UPAs schemes for minorities, women, SC/STs, farmers, ex-servicemen and other specific groups will be handled.        
	Anyone wishing to join the Congress would just have to send a text message or dial the call centre. A related Congress Online scheme in the pipeline would also enable clients to enlist via email.        
	Srivastva said Pachauri had been in constant touch with Rahul as he was keen to dispel the notion that the Congress is an old mans party.

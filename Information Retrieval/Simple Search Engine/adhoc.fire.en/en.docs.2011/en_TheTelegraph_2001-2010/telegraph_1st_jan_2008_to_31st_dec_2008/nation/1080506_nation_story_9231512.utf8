          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Azad in Srinagar on Monday. (Reuters)                          
	Srinagar, May 5: A Congress MP today stunned Jammu and Kashmir by claiming that he fell at Sonia Gandhis feet to prevent the Assembly Speaker and the former state party chief from being linked to the Srinagar sex scandal.        
	The allegations against Speaker Tara Chand and former state Congress chief Peerzada Sayeed were raised by member of Parliament Madan Lal Sharma. The revelations come a few months before elections are due in the state.        
	The MP said he had approached Sonia and chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to save the duo. I fell at the feet of Sonia Gandhi and Azad Sahib to clear their names. The Congress party would have collapsed last year if both Tara Chand and Peerzada Mohd Sayeed were sent to jail in the sex scandal case, Sharma told a gathering at the Speakers Khour constituency in Jammu. If you want to know about Tara Chand, he should be sent to jail like Pappu Yadav.         
	The Speaker, however, dismissed the allegations as false. The case was being monitored by the high court and it found nothing against me. This is a conspiracy, and false allegations have been levelled against me, he said.        
	The relations between Sharma, a former soldier who got injured during the 1971 war with Pakistan, and the Speaker have not been cordial. Sharma has been lobbying the party leadership to deny a ticket to Chand in the coming polls.        
	The sex scandal surfaced in February 2006 when police seized a compact disc containing pornographic footage of a 15-year-old girl. Questioned, she blew the lid off a sex racket and named two former ministers, two senior police officers and an IAS officer.        
	All the accused were given bail by a court in Chandigarh, where the case was transferred to on the directive of the Supreme Court. Most of the accused officials have also been reinstated.         
	Jammu and Kashmir High Court, however, pulled up the CBI last year for shoddy investigation, saying that some people whose name figured in the racket were not questioned or arrested.         
	The court asked the chief judicial magistrate to start proceedings against 12 more people, including several politicians.        
	The fresh crisis has taken the Congress by surprise. Chief minister Azad refused to comment on the issue. You talk about the government. I have no time for stupid issues, he said after re-opening the civil secretariat in Srinagar.         
	The state government later issued a statement denying the involvement of Sonia and Azad.         
	There was no question of the MP having approached the chief minister or the UPA chairperson on this issue or the government trying to protect any accused in the scandal. It is most unfortunate and reprehensible to drag the names of the UPA chairperson, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, and the chief minister into the controversy, a government spokesperson said.

	New York, Aug. 10 (PTI): A 46-year-old Indian store manager was robbed and shot dead by unidentified assailants on his way to work.         
	Kanubhai Patel, who worked at a doughnut store in Delaware, was found dead by his wife Ramila yesterday morning, police said. This is the second attack targeting Indians in the US within a week.         
	Patel was found outside Christiana Skating Rink with a gunshot wound, said police spokesperson Gary Fournier, adding that they had found no suspects yet.         
	The Patels, who moved to the US from India in 1999, were living in Delaware for five years, friends said. They have two children who live in India.        
	The police did not reveal how much money was stolen.         
	A 62-year-old store clerk, Inder Jit Jassal, was also shot dead in a departmental store in Arizona this week by an African-American man.

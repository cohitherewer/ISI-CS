                                                                                                               Ready with flock of 34, Rio knocks on Nagaland Raj Bhavan door

	Kohima, March 9: Neiphiu Rio today staked claim to a second successive term as the head of a coalition government in Nagaland with the committed and unconditional support of 34 legislators.         
	As he emerged from a meeting with governor K. Sankaranarayan at the Raj Bhavan, Rios smile spoke of a triumph that must have tasted sweeter after the embarrassment of being dismissed just two months before the completion of his first term.         
	I requested the governor to invite us to form the government on Tuesday, he said.        
	A Raj Bhavan source said the governor would have to recommend revocation of Presidents rule and dissolution of the previous Assembly, in suspended animation since January 3, before inviting the leader of the single-largest party to form the next government.        
	Rios Nagaland Peoples Front has 26 legislators in the 60-member Assembly and the partys allies in the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland  the BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party  have two each. Four of the six elected Independents have extended support to the coalition.         
	The NPFs and the Congresss tally today increased by one each.

	The newly formed Meghalaya Progressive Alliance, fronted by NCP leader Purno A. Sangma and United Democratic Party chief Donkupar Roy, is likely to parade 31 MLAs before the governor tomorrow.        
	We would like the governor to invite us to form the government,a member of the alliance said.

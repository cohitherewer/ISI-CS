The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HC nod to CMC garbage proposal
                                                                                                               HC nod to CMC garbage proposal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 6: The idea of a common dumping yard for Cuttack and Bhubaneswar fizzled out as Orissa High Court allowed Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) to settle for a separate site.         
	The court, on Wednesday, also lifted its deadline for the construction of a wall around the land, allocated for the single-point garbage disposal for both Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the CMC.         
	On February 28, the court had fixed a deadline after advocate-general B.K. Mahanti had said: Some 61.41 vacant acres had been identified at Bhuasuni in Bhubaneswar tehsil under Khurda for a dumping yard by both CMC and BMC.         
	The single-point system was proposed under a Twin City Solid Waste Management Plan to facilitate a waste to energy power project proposed by the state government.         
	The advocate-general, however, on Wednesday pleaded that the committee constituted for the purpose had pointed out technical constrains. One of them was the clearance required from the Union ministry of environment. Besides, he added, permission from airport authority was also required, as the site was 2km from the Bhubaneswar airport.         
	According to norms, garbage yards or land-filling sites are prohibited within 20km of airports, informed the advocate-general while seeking more time before submitting a detailed project report. A single bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty sought a detailed report.

                                                                                                            Anant cousin killed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Jan. 8: In what appears to be a case of family feud, a cousin of Mokama legislator Anant Singh was shot dead today in daylight at a government office near Boring Canal Road.         
	MLA Anant Singh and six others have been named accused in an FIR lodged in Kotwali police station.        
	Sanjay Kumar Singh (40), a contractor, was attacked by six armed assailants and received at least four bullets from close range around 1pm inside rural engineering organisation (REO) office. Singh died on the spot.         
	No office employee, however, was hurt in the firing. Singhs body has been sent for post-mortem at Patna Medical College and Hospital.         
	Singh, a Ladma resident, had visited the office to clear his pending bills from another office near the REO premises. Employees of REO said Singh was chased and came running to their office for safety, but assailants blocked his way and shot him. Anant Singh, however, was not spotted near the scene of incident.        
	The victims family and Anant Singh shared the same household in their native village  Barh. The victims family, however, has been staying out of the village for a decade now. The deceaseds brother Viveka Pahalwan and Anant Singh have long being in contention for power in Barh. Three and a half years ago, Viveka had allegedly shot at Anant Singh.         
	The deceaseds eldest brother, Arvind Kumar Singh, also a contractor, told reporters at the hospital: My cousin (Anant Singh) is behind the murder. He has been threatening to eliminate us for long. He added that his teenaged nephew was a witness to the incident and might recognise some assailants if the police carry out a identification test.         
	Arvind added: As we did not follow his ways, we fell out with him years ago and have not visited our Barh home for years, because we were afraid of Anant. He accused the police and the government of siding with the MLA.         
	Office-in-charge of Kotwali police station Abhay Narayan confirmed to The Telegraph: A case of murder has been lodged against MLA Anant Singh and six others. The police have launched manhunt.         
	Senior officers, however, are pursuing the matter cautiously. Patna senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan said: I am yet to know the details and cannot say anything regarding the case as yet. No arrests have been made so far.         
	Strangely enough the JD(U) MLA has preferred to remain quite over the issue. A senior JD(U) leader, on condition of anonymity, said: Its not a political issue for us to comment on. The police are already pursuing the matter.         
	Two months ago, the JD(U) MLA was arrested for beating up a national television channel correspondent, who had gone at his office to seek his version on the legislators alleged involvement in another case of murder.         
	The MLA, however, was released on bail.         
	The police had also given him a clean chit in the murder of Reshma Kajal and arrested Patna builder Anil Sharma, who reportedly had hatched plans to defame the Mokama strongman to settle some financial scores.         
	Theft        
	In another case, a theft was committed at the residence of Warisnagar LJP legislator Maheshwar Hazari here.        
	Electronic goods and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh was stolen on Sunday night from the Harnichak, Phulwarisharif residence.         
	The MLA and his father, Ramsevak Hazari, a former member of the Parliament, however, were not at home when the incident happened. The thieves broke locks to enter the home.

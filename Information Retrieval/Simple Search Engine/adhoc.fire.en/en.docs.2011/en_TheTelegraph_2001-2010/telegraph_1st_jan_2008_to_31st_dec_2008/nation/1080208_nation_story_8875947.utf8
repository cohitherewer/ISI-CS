The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Survey amid slight tension
                                                                                                            Survey amid slight tension
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: The socio-economic survey and land demarcation for the proposed $12-billion steel plant to be set up by South Korean steel maker Posco in Jagatsinghpur commenced today amid heavy police deployment.        
	Government nodal officer Priyabrata Patnaik said the survey continued without any hitch after an initial resistance. The survey is expected to continue for a fortnight.         
	Jagatsinghpur collector P.K. Meherda, who was camping at the project site to oversee the survey, said work was being conducted in four villages  Nolia Sahi, Gadakujang, Polanga and Bhuyanpal  under Gadakujanga gram panchayat.         
	Twelve survey teams consisting of 60 personnel were on the job.         
	Reports from the area said the villagers had initially put up resistance and had stopped the official vehicles carrying the personnel at the Mahavir Temple Square and Gadakujanga Square.         
	There was no violence although there was a palpable tension. Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police R.K. Sharma said adequate precaution was taken to avoid violence. Three platoons of armed police forces were deployed in and around the survey sites.         
	Villagers agitating against the proposed mega steel plant have agreed to allow the survey after several rounds of intense negotiation.        
	Recently, Posco authorities announced a rehabilitation and resettlement package, including job and homestead land, for each displaced family.        
	Posco had signed an MoU in June 2005 with the state government to set up a 12-MTPA steel plant near Paradip, billed as the biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country.         
	However, the project had virtually remained a non-starter due to agitation by the local villagers opposing displacement. The socio-economic survey had been stopped thrice earlier due to resistance from the villagers.

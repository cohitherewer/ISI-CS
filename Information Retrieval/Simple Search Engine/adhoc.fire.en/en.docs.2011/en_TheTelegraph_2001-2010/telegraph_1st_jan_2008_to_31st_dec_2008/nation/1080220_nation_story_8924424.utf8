          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: The RBI today asked banks to freeze for a year the recovery of working capital loans poultry farms have taken.        
	The measure is intended to help farms struggling with the fallout of the bird flu in Bengal.        
	Bengal has around 250,000 poultry owners, including 200,000 with backyard units. Organised farms usually depend on bank credit. Out of the backyard farms in Bengal, 10 per cent or 20,000 are said to have taken some form of loan.        
	Working capital loans help an entity run day-to-day operations. The banks have been directed to convert the principal and interest on working capital loans and the instalments that have fallen due on or after December 31, 2007, into term loans.        
	The notification said the converted loans could be recovered in instalments based on projected future inflows over a period up to three years with an initial moratorium of up to one year. The first year of repayment is likely to be fixed after expiry of the moratorium period.        
	The RBI asked banks to reschedule the remaining portion of the term loans in a similar fashion with a moratorium period up to one year, depending upon the cash flow-generating capacity of the unit.        
	According to the RBI, the rescheduling of loan repayment should be completed latest by April 30 this year. The rescheduled loans will be treated as current dues after which the borrower will be eligible for fresh loans.        
	There have been instances of outbreak of avian influenza (bird flu) in some areas of the country. Keeping in view the loss of income that has occurred because of culling of birds as well as steep fall in the demand for poultry products and their prices, banks may consider extending the facilities to poultry units financed by them, the notification said.        
	The loss in Bengal is put at Rs 100 crore.

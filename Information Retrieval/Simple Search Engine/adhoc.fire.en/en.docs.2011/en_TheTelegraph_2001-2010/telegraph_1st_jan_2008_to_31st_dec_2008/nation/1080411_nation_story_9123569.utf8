  - Wait for promotion refuses to come to an end          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The Orissa secretariat                                        
	Cuttack, April 10: The civil servants in the Orissa Administrative Service (OAS) cadre are aggrieved. No promotions for years are sapping the strength out of majority of them.         
	At the pace we are moving, it may take more than seven to nine years for us to reach the Class I (Senior) grade, said an OAS officer of 1987 batch, elevated from Class II to Class I (Junior) grade in 2000 with his batch-mates.         
	The purpose of becoming a civil servant seems to have been lost. Whats the point if you become a sub-collector at an age close to 55 years, said another OAS officer of the same batch.         
	The civil servants have reasons to be pessimists. There has been no departmental promotion committee (DPC) for OAS Class I (Senior) for years together. Officers in the OAS cadre from 1993 onwards are continuing their service in ad hoc basis for want of concurrence from Orissa Public Service Commission (OPSC) on their promotion.         
	There are 1,100 OAS Class II officers and 648 Class I (Junior) officers now. But the government is evidently in a quandary over effecting promotion and granting seniority to its civil servants, a recent review of the OAS cadre undertaken by the state revenue and disaster management department had revealed.         
	The publication of the gradation list has been delayed due to insufficient information on joining of OAS Class I (Junior) officer, a top official of the department observed.         
	Though gradation lists of OAS officers in Class I (Junior) were published in 1997 and 2001, they are entangled in legal dispute with the State Administration Tribunal or high court. Some cases are pending before the Supreme Court. Officers holding the post of OAS Class I (Senior), too, are involved in the litigation, said a deputy secretary.        
	Meanwhile, the revenue and disaster management department had released a provisional gradation list of 559 OAS Class I (Junior) officers on March 3, 2008 while inviting objections from the civil servants by March 31, 2008.

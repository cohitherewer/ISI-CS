	Bhubaneswar, June 29: The ruling BJD-BJP alliance today launched its poll campaign from Rourkela well ahead of general elections.        
	The next election will be fought on three planks  inflation, farmers woes and the nations internal security, said L.K. Advani, the BJPs prime ministerial candidate and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha while addressing a massive rally, Vijay Sankalp Samavesh, organised jointly by the states ruling coalition.        
	We feel these three are burning issues, which need to be addressed soon, said Advani, flanked by Orissa chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik.        
	Describing UPA government as a government in ICU, the BJP stalwart said the longer it stayed in power, the more the country would suffer.        
	Its amazing that finance minister P. Chidambaram is not sure of the cause of the inflation. At one time, the finance minister said its due to the failure of states to curb the prices and later he said it as the fallout of international pressure.        
	Castigating the UPA government for the growing Maoist menace and threats to internal security, the former Union home minister said the rebels were encouraged by the soft attitude of the Centre.        
	Referring to the Indo-US nuclear deal issue, Advani alleged that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was keen to surrender Indias sovereignty of the country.        
	Advani was eloquent in praising his ally BJD and its leadership.         
	Your leader is great son of an even greater soul Biju Patnaik and I am sure he will always remain so.        
	Giving a pat on Naveen, the BJP veteran said he was happy with the kind of progress Orissa was making and in the coming days the state would see even brighter times under the alliance government under his able leadership.         
	Naveen described price rise as the biggest failure of UPA government and highlighted the Centres neglect and apathy towards Orissa.         
	Listing out the achievements of the coalition government in the state, the chief minister mentioned about several state-funded developmental and welfare schemes such as Gopabandhu Gramin Yojana, Mo Kudia Yojana, Madhubabu Pension Yojana and Biju KBK Yojana.        
	Earlier during the day, while addressing the valedictory function of partys state executive meeting, Advani called upon his partymen to prepare themselves for the forthcoming elections and work in unity ironing out all differences.        
	He, however, did not tell anything on whether the seat-sharing formula with BJD for the forthcoming polls would be changed or not.         
	BJP state unit president Suresh Pujari said the party would go to people on the issues of price rise and central neglect within three months.

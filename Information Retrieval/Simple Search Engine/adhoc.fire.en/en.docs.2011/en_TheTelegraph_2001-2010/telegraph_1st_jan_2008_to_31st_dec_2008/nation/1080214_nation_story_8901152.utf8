          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: Taslima Nasreens visa is likely to be extended, sources in the government said, even as writers and activists released an open letter addressed to the Prime Minister warning against moves to deport the Bangladeshi author.        
	It will shame and diminish all of us, the Forum for the Protection of Free Speech and Expression said in the letter written by author-activist Arundhati Roy.        
	An official said a decision on the visa, which expires on Sunday, will come at an appropriate time.

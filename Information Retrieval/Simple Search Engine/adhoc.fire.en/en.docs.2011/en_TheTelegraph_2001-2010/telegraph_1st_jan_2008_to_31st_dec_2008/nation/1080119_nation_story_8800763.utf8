	New York, Jan. 18 (PTI): A 25-year-old Indian woman and her two children were killed in a mysterious fire at a motel owned by her husband in Florida on Tuesday.
    
	Priya, 25, daughter Mahi, 3, and son Milan, 1, were killed in the fire in the storage room of Camellia Motel that her husband Bimal Master owns. The woman was found on the pavement outside the room while the children were inside.
    
	If the deaths are verified as fire-related, it would be one of the deadliest fires ever in Polk county.
    
	Mayur Patel, a family friend, said Bimal was in the shower at the time of the incident. The family lived in an apartment attached to the motel.

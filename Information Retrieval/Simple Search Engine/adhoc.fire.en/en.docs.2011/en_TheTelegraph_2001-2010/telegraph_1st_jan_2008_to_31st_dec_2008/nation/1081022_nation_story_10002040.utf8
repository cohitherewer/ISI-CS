          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tokyo, Oct. 21: The Indian government has no intention of bringing back the ashes of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, currently being kept with respect at the Renkoji Temple here, in the absence of a political consensus and disagreement within Boses descendants on the issue, official sources indicated here today.         
	Although two out of three official commissions of enquiry had concluded that the ashes were that of Netaji, some doubts continue to persist and the family itself is not agreed about their authenticity.         
	Under the circumstances, it was best to leave the ashes as they were and not ignite fresh controversy on the undying mystery that surrounds the national heros disappearance and death, the government felt. The possibility of a DNA analysis was also ruled out because the nature of the remains is not good enough to allow it, a source added.

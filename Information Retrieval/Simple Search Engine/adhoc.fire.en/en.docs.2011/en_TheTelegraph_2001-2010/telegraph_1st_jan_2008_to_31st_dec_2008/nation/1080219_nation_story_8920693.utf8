	New Delhi, Feb. 18: Indias defence scientists are claiming a technological breakthrough with a submarine-launched missile that is being readied for a final test before being inducted.         
	K-15 is important for Indias nuclear doctrine of no first strike in the event of a war because it requires the capability for a massive second strike. We have completed all preparations and a testfiring is awaiting government clearance, DRDO chief controller, S. Prahlada, said at Defexpo 2008 today.         
	There had been five tests earlier for separate ranges. As India does not have a nuclear submarine, the DRDO has built a submersible pontoon launcher to test it.

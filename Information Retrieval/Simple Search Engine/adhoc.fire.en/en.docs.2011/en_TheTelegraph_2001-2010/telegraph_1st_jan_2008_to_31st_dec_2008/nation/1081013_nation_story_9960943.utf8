	Actors, former policemen and gangsters  Andhras ballot bout could now have terror suspects flexing their muscles, too.    
	Never an insipid contest to start with, the elections could turn more colourful and suspense-prone if a lady don eventually clears the nomination hurdle along with a shadowy figure accused of helping youths get terror training.    
	The don, Farah Fatima, is said to have taken a fancy to Chiranjeevis newly launched party, hoping to use her record as a campaigner on womens issues to get a ticket.     
	The other aspirant, Abdul Rawoof is reported to have sounded the Telugu Desam Party.     
	Rawoof, who had worked with the Desam in the past, was accused of sending Gujarat youths to terror camps in Pakistan. He had lost the local body polls as a candidate of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in 2003. This time, he is eyeing the Malakpet Assembly seat.    
	About the charges against him, Rawoof said he was implicated falsely. I have friends from all religions. Given a chance, I will do whatever my party asks me to do.        Attack shield for govt schools               
	The air is thick with the stench of terror, leaving the capitals government schools sniffing the possibility of attacks.    
	But some of those jitters could ease as early as next month, when the Delhi government plans to post armed defence personnel outside the schools to protect students.    
	Under a pact with the defence ministry signed last month, the Delhi government plans to deploy the personnel round the clock. At least 1,000 army jawans are being specially trained to handle terrorist attacks as well as first-aid-related issues with an aim to ensure maximum safety for students, a senior education official said.    
	The initiative will initially cover two schools in east Delhi. It will be extended later to over 1,000 secondary and senior secondary schools owned by the government.        Hospital leap for hotspot              
	Dwarka, the fast-expanding west Delhi township, has taken a leap of sorts with a foundation for a super-speciality hospital.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit set the 750-bed project going, saying her government was committed to quality and affordable healthcare for people. The hospital will take two years and Rs 350 crore to build.    
	The hospital, which will have an attached medical college, is expected to cater to the five lakh residents of Dwarka as well as other colonies, Dikshit said.    
	Ecologically, the new hospital goes where few have gone so far.     
	Its plinth area will be 1,04,000sqm. The building will be eco-friendly and earthquake-resistant. The highrise towers will ensure plenty of sunlight and ventilation. It will also have rainwater-harvesting facilities and the recycled water will be used in air-conditioners.    
	At the foundation-laying ceremony, Dikshit said well-equipped dispensaries had been built and steps taken to ensure healthcare facilities reached the poor.                   
	The capital has a new address for technology training.    
	It is a polytechnic that has been set up at Dwarka, one of the fastest-growing townships in the capitals west.     
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit recently inaugurated the institute, which offers diploma courses in pharmacy, medical laboratory technology, IT-enabled services and management. The campus is sprawling, spread over 33,000 sqm.     
	Officials said the new institute would ease the growing pressure on the existing polytechnics, which have so far received 48,000 applications for admission this year.

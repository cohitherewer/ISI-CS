	New Delhi, July 22: When Brajesh Pathak and Akbar Dumpy Ahmed ranted in Parliament about how the CBI was intimidating BSP MPs, they received instant support from the Left and the Telugu Desam Party.        
	And when the BSP cut Rahul Gandhis speech mid-stream, the Samajwadi Party sprang to his defence. Its MPs, Ramgopal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav, kept lauding Rahul when he completed his address later and hugged him after the vote was won.        
	Amar Singh, the Samajwadi general secretary, said this was the happiest day in his political career. The politics of Prakash Karat, Brinda Karat, A.B. Bardhan along with L.K. Advani has been exposed. Both Lals (Advani and Left) are destroyed now, he crowed.        
	This is the victory of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs policy.... This is the victory of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	The vote was as much about the emergence of new political alignments as the nuclear deal.         
	The first sign that the BSP-Left-Desam friendship might not wither away as quickly as it blossomed was a breakfast meeting Mayavati decided to host for her new allies tomorrow.         
	That the Left and Mayavati are keen to banish the perception of a tacit tie-up with the NDA was clear when the Uttar Pradesh chief minister blamed L.K. Advani and the UPA in equal measure for the result of the trust vote.         
	The Desam has already said it wants no truck with the BJP because of the heavy price N. Chandrababu Naidu paid in the 2004 elections for his five-year dalliance with the party.        
	The third front will attempt to appropriate the aam aadmi campaign from the Congress by playing on price rise.         
	BSP sources said Mayavati would now focus on adding more Muslim votes to her kitty because she sensed that if the Congress-Samajwadi alliance materialised, it could spirit away some of the Brahmin votes she had consolidated in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.         
	Mayavatis prospective alliance with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal is expected to add a new dimension to Uttar Pradesh politics because it will mean an alliance of historical caste rivals, Jats and Jatavs. However, some Jats had voted for Mayavati even in the 2007 Assembly elections when they spotted a clear winner in her.        
	However, the Congress and the UPA were not worrying about the future tonight, busy as they were celebrating the emphatic win in the House.        
	Lalu Prasad expressed happiness at the victory despite the bribery drama staged by the BJP, which, he said, had seriously damaged the image of Parliament.         
	Ram Vilas Paswan also described the BJPs behaviour as shameful. The BJP MPs conduct should be probed as bringing a bag into the House could also have posed a security threat, he said. The whole episode was stage-managed to defame the government, he said.        
	It was disgusting, said Rahul Gandhi, about the currency-waving, adding he had never applied his mind to the numbers game. I never thought about it. My point was that the right decision should be taken. Whether we lose or win was not the issue, he said.         
	With inputs from Sanjay K. Jha

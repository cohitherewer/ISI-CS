	Raipur, April 25: For Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi, its more a discover Nehru-Gandhi family rather than Discover India tour.         
	Congress general-secretary in the morning today landed in Ambikapur, some 350km from the state capital, for a two-day tour organised under his Discover India campaign.        
	Rahul reached Lenga village in the afternoon and spent more than two hours there. For Ramlal Gond and Tistabai, tribal villagers, Rahul Gandhi was not a familiar name. What made all the difference was Rahuls introduction to the villagers as the grandson of Indira Gandhi. In all families he met, Rahul mentioned his ancestors consistently.         
	While villagers were unsure of Rajiv or Rahul, the name Indira brought a smile to their face.         
	Congress leaders accompanying Rahul then introduced the scion as the grandson of Indira. Indira Gandhi had ruled the heart of tribals and poor people. Its natural that people are more familiar with her name. Rahul is a member of that great family and there is nothing wrong if he asks about the great leaders (Indira and Rajiv), defended a senior Congress leader.         
	In his trademark white kurta, Rahul sipped black tea in Ramlals house, while he had lunch in another tribals house, where he was served rice and chutney.         
	Finally the young leader asked of the welfare programmes under progress in his village, availability of power, irrigation facilities and issues he was there to talk of and discover. The Congress MP would be visiting Bastar villages on Saturday to interact with the tribals there.

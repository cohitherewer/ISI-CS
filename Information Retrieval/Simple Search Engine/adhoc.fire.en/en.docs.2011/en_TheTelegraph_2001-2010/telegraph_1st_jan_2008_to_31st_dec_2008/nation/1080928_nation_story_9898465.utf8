          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Wage alert                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The Centre has ordered the chiefs of the armed forces to implement the new pay scales for the services but has also set up a high-powered committee to study the grievances over the wage structure.         
	The Centre announced new pay scales for the services on August 14 but the armed forces pointed to anomalies that are yet to be resolved and have withheld a notification announcing implementation of the pay scales.         
	The government took a hard line last night and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, now in the US, was consulted.         
	The Centre has demanded immediate compliance from the service chiefs and set Monday morning as the deadline by when the army, navy and air force headquarters must submit to the defence ministry a draft notification on implementing the new pay scales.         
	Defence minister A.K. Antony also said in Thiruvananthapuram that troops would get the new wages by Diwali.        
	The chiefs of the army, navy and air force were in consultations with the government over the grievances, the most important of which is a reduction in the status of lieutenant colonel-rank officers in comparison to their counterparts in police and the civilian bureaucracy.         
	Navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta, who is the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and army chief General Deepak Kapoor met cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and PMO officials on Thursday.         
	Antony said the Centre would address the grievances. Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will head the committee, which will include Antony and finance minister P. Chidambaram as members.         
	If the services headquarters do not comply with the government order, it would lead to an unprecedented situation. A defence ministry officer said that is quite unthinkable right now because the government has asked them to do a job and they will have to do it.         
	The defence ministry accounts office was expecting the draft notification by Friday evening.         
	The service chiefs have said the anomalies and the downgrading of military officers are threatening to hamper their operational roles.         
	The downgrading, the military has argued, would mean drastically reduced career progression opportunities for officers in the long run when it is trying to attract talent. The army alone currently has a shortage of 13,000 officers.

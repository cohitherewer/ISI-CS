          KINSUK BASU                                     Shah Rukh (top), Ponting                                  
	Calcutta, April 19: Peshawri kebabs and Daal Bukhara for Shah Rukh Khan. Some fine Italian dishes and malt whisky for Ricky Ponting and Lamb Lajawab for V.V.S. Laxman and Adam Gilchrist.         
	As the Eden gets ready for play, The Sonar is preparing for the party.        
	The Knight Riders and the Deccan Chargers have already checked in. Shah Rukh Khan will arrive tomorrow with his Bollywood gang. And two suites are waiting for his friends from Delhi, Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi. The brother has yet to confirm if he is coming, though.        
	Besides two suites for Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a few other suites have been kept ready for the VIPs, a hotel employee said. We have also kept in mind what many of these guests opted for when they were with us last.        
	Shah Rukh had shown a preference for kebabs when he was here for the Knight Riders launch, the employee added. Ponting had breakfast at Eden Pavilion and lunch at West View Bar and Grill.        
	Most of Laxmans Deccan Chargers, who arrived in the afternoon, got a taste of the Eden straight away. Not the ground where they will battle Sourav Gangulys boys, but the restaurant with the all-day buffet.         
	The welcome was sweet, with the visitors spoilt for choice for dessert  Mishti Doi, Rabri, Gulab Jamun, Gajar ka Halwa, Kaaju Barfi, Chocolate Mousse and Pineapple Egg Pudding.        
	Maybe too sweet  many headed for a heavy workout later. Some were off to the spa.         
	After end of play, Shah Rukh will throw a party for his guests at Dublin, sources said, before joining the teams for dinner. Not all his friends will be at the dinner  security concerns mean some of them might be eating in their rooms.

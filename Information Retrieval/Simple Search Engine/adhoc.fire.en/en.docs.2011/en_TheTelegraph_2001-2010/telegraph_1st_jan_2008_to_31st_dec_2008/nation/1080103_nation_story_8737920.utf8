The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya seeks SPG, Delhi sniggers
                                                                                                            Maya seeks SPG, Delhi sniggers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati: Under threat?                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Mayavati has demanded that her personal security be handled by the elite Special Protection Group that is reserved for providing cover to the Prime Minister and former Prime Ministers.        
	Citing tremendous threat to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister from terrorist groups, state cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar has written to Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta seeking SPG cover.        
	Mayavati enjoys the highest security under the Z-plus category, provided by Black Cat commandos of the National Security Guard (NSG).        
	In a letter dated December 28, a day after Benazir Bhuttos assassination, Shekhar said Mayavati, also the Bahujan Samaj Party president, should be immediately provided round-the-clock SPG cover.        
	As Mayavati had to travel across the country on party work, it was necessary to have a centralised command for her security, the letter said.        
	However, home ministry officials said there was no way she could get SPG cover as it was limited to the Prime Minister and his family and former Prime Ministers and their families. Former Prime Ministers got the cover only for 10 years from the day they demitted office, they said.        
	According to the risk assessment by the Intelligence Bureau, there is no threat to Mayavati from any terror group and NSG cover is more than sufficient.        
	Recently, Uttar Pradesh police had killed two Lashkar militants in the Barabanki area and claimed the duo had planned to assassinate Mayavati. But the home ministry officials said there was no evidence to suggest that.        
	Sources said the home ministry might, at the most, increase the number of NSG commandos protecting Mayavati and allow her to drive up in her bullet-proof car to the plane she is taking at all airports in the country.        
	Mayavati is one of the few VIPs allowed to drive up to the aircraft at Delhi airport. But she wants this facility at all airports, the officials said.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government takes Mayavatis convoy to every state before her visit, something no other chief minister with Z-plus security does. Shekhar has also asked for more bullet-proof cars in her convoy, the sources said.        
	Congress salvo        
	The Congress today accused Mayavati of being too busy with political machinations in the country to concentrate on administrative affairs in her state.        
	Mayavati appears to be preoccupied with travelling around the country in order to build up her party. In the process, she should not lose her focus on the primary and pressing importance of governance of a large and sensitive state like Uttar Pradesh, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said in a statement.        
	The allegation reveals the Congress is worried about its poll prospects in states where Mayavati is trying to make a foray. Its fear is the BSP might slice away a chunk of Dalit and Muslim votes that belong to it.        
	The Congress has lost around 20 seats because of the BSP in Gujarat. In Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the threat is greater.

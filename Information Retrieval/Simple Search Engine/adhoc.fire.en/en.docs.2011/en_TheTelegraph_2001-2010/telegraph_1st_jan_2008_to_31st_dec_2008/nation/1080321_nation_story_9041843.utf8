          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 20: The Wildlife Institute of Indias recent report has irked and worried wildlife lovers including Savers, a group of animal enthusiasts.         
	A recent report by the institute indicated a dip in the tiger count and stated that Orissa had 45 tigers in its parks and sanctuaries in 2006 census  a clear departure from the state governments claim of 192 tigers (57 males, 75 females and 60 cubs) in 2004.         
	Savers, a group comprising like-minded animal enthusiasts and volunteers involved in rescue, treatment and rehabilitation of animals, today set off on motorbikes to create awareness about the recent dive in count. Today, the group organised a bike rally-cum-tour to make Orissas people aware of the importance of tiger conservation.         
	While creating the group our main focus was to make people aware of environmental issues, such as importance of bio-diversity impact of conservation, animal rescue, and proper documentation of endangered species, among other issues, conceded Rudra Prasanna Mahapatra, a member.         
	The rally-cum-tour would be spread over four days and will move from eastern Orissa to the west, covering almost 1,250km.        
	We mainly plan to cover Bhubaneswar, Angul, Sambalpur, and Nuapada, said Mohapatra. We are trying to involve all those who can make a difference. Our target group is a motley crew comprising children, intelligentsia, elites and tribals in Angul, Sambalpur and Satkosia. We want to make everyone aware of the present situation in the country as far as wildlife conservation is concerned and what needs to be done to protect it, Mohapatra added, before setting of for his four-day tour.        
	The volunteers would be visiting schools and clubs making presentations to generate interest and awareness.        
	That apart, they would be meeting the respective district forest officers and would be discussing the problems.         
	The Savers also work extensively with other organisations to save the endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtles.         
	The group would also release a documentary on nesting and breeding of the turtles shortly.

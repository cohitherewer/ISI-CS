	New Delhi, April 1: The CPM might claim credit for the Centres pro-poor programmes and crow about blocking neo-liberal economic policies, but the partys internal assessment reveals a feeling of being taken for a ride on the economy.        
	The draft political organisation report, being discussed at the party congress, says the UPA-Left co-ordination committee stopped meeting since November 2006 because of an objectionable practice of the government.        
	The practice of holding discussions and then announcing that (the) Left has agreed to go ahead with their policies was objectionable, the document says.        
	After November 2006, the UPA-Left co-ordination committee did not meet. The PB (politburo) discussed the matter and decided that we need not take any initiative to revive the co-ordination committee meetings. This was also the understanding of the other Left parties.         
	Discussions on the note the Left parties gave on three years of the UPA government did not result in course correction on the economy, the document adds. They did not result in closing the gap between the Congress and the Left on economic policy issues.        
	The party document also blames RJD chief Lalu Prasad for the womens reservation bill not being introduced.         
	After the Congress agreed to take up the issue of womens reservation bill... in 2006, a broader meeting of the UPA partners with the Left parties was held. In this meeting, the RJD leader agreed that the bill be introduced. However, within a few days, he went back on his word due to pressure from within his party. Till now, we havent got the UPA as a whole to agree to introduce the bill despite the fact that all other parties except the RJD are for the bill.

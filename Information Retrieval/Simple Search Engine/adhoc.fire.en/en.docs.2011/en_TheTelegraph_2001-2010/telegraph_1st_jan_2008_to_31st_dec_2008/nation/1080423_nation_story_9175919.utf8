          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The Supreme Court today directed the Andhra Pradesh health secretary and a Hyderabad hospital to explore if a medical negligence case in which a patient was paralysed waist down after botched surgery could be settled out of court.        
	Prashanth S. Dhananka, son of a Bhel employee, was admitted to the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences in September 1990 after complaints of unexplained intermittent fever. Doctors from Bhel had referred him there for further tests.        
	The tests showed a large lesion in his left chest cavity. After an X-ray and a CT scan confirmed this, he was asked to do an excision biopsy (thoracotomy) to find out the nature of the tumour.        
	Although the tumour was found to be benign, doctors felt that if it was left in the chest cavity it might put pressure on his respiratory, cardio-vascular and neurological systems. It could later turn malignant also. So, a team led by a cardio-thoracic surgeon removed the tumour. In the process, a part of his ribs had to be excised.        
	However, after the surgery, Prashanth developed paralysis of the lower portion of the body and legs (paraplegia).        
	No allegation of medical negligence was made then. But six months after his discharge, Prashanths father wrote a letter to the institute in 1991, alleging negligence.        
	In 1993, the patient moved the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission alleging negligence and sought damages of about Rs 5 crore. The commission held the doctors negligent and directed that Rs 14 lakh be paid to the patient and Rs 1.5 lakh to his father. The institute was asked to pay another Rs 25,000 as costs.        
	The institute challenged the finding that it was guilty of negligence as it had not associated a neuro-surgeon in the surgery from the beginning and had not exchanged any opinion with sister institutes in India and abroad.        
	The patient challenged the compensation amount as inadequate. The case reached the Supreme Court in 1999 and has since been pending before it. But after the institute agreed to settle the matter out of court, the court today directed it to check out if it was feasible.        
	The case, due to be heard in July, could set a precedent because the damages involved are huge. Out-of-court settlements are unusual in any case, more so in medical negligence cases that are not easy to prove. Parties usually settle for compensation in such cases.

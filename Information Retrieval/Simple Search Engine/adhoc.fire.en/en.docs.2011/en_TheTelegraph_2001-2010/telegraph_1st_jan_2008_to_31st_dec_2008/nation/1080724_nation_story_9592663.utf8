                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Former MP settles scores with Naveen
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Good times: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik with Harihar Swain after the latter broke away from the Congress in 2004 to join the state BJD. File picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 23: Expelled BJD MP Harihar Swain today said he had voted in favour of the UPA government in yesterdays trust vote to settle scores with chief minister and party boss Naveen Patnaik even as party activists staged demonstrations dubbing him a betrayer.         
	Harihar Swain has betrayed BJD and deceived people of his constituency, who had elected him on the BJD symbol, Naveen had said last night before expelling him from the party. The chief ministers reaction had its reflection in Ganjam, the home district of both Naveen and Swain, today as angry activists took out silent rallies and staged demonstrations at Berhampur, the headquarters of Ganjam district, and Aska.         
	They burnt the effigy of Swain branding him a betrayer and alleged that he had brought shame to the district and Aska constituency, once represented by Biju Patnaik and son Naveen Patnaik.         
	BJD parliamentary party leader B.K. Tripathy said steps were being initiated for Swains disqualification as a Member of the Parliament according to the provision of Anti-defection Act, as he had defied the party whip and voted in favour of the UPA government.         
	Unfazed by the developments, Swain said he had not voted for the UPA government, but against autocratic Naveen. Swain, who returned here this afternoon, stressed that he did not vote for money. I have not voted in favour of the UPA, but against Naveen Patnaik. My intention was not to save the UPA government but to shock Naveen, said the defiant MP, adding that he had been waiting for an opportunity to settle scores with the chief minister, who had earlier suspended him.         
	Reacting to Naveens statement dubbing him a betrayer, Swain said: I have not seen a bigger betrayer than him.

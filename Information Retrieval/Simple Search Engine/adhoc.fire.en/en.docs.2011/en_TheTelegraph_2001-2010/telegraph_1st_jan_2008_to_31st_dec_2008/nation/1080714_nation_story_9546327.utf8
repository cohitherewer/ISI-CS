The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren reminds Centre of berths 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Soren reminds Centre of berths 
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                          Shibu Soren                                  
	Bokaro, July 13: JMM chief Shibu Soren today sought his pound of flesh to help the Centre in the trust vote, staking claim to a cabinet slot and a minister of states berth promised to his party.        
	Soren told The Telegraph that neither foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee nor any of the BJP leaders had contacted him for his partys support.        
	Let me make it clear at this juncture that none of the senior Congress, communist or BJP leaders met me on this issue though they sent congratulatory messages to me on the marriage of my son Basant. No politics should be read into it, he said.        
	Late in the afternoon, chief minister Madhu Koda and his wife Meera arrived at Sorens Bokaro residence with an urgent message from UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to ensure that all five JMM MPs voted for the confidence motion. The JMMs MPs are Soren, Teklala Mahto, Suman Mahto, Hemlal Murmu and Sudam Manjhi.        
	Koda held a 50-minute, closed-door meeting with Soren after congratulating the newly wed couple  Basant and Hema.         
	Later, Koda told reporters that he had gone to Delhi to submit a report on the development of the state to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Failing to meet Manmohan, the chief minister had called on Sonia and discussed the states welfare and the political situation, he said.        
	Koda added that his talks with Soren were absolutely satisfactory.        
	But Sorens response was less than categorical. At this stage, the JMM is with the UPA but the final decision on voting will come on July 19 after the party meeting, he said.        
	For many months, we have been demanding that the JMM should be given one-and-a-half berths in the Union cabinet (one cabinet and one minister of state), Soren said         
	One week is still left for bringing the confidence motion in Parliament and I am too tired and even indisposed because of the social obligations after my sons marriage. I will take a bit of rest before thinking of politics, he added.         
	One of the JMM MPs said that the nuclear deal has given us a last chance to get into the cabinet.        
	Telengana pressure        
	Another regional party, too, struck while the iron was hot  but in the south.        
	The Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) said it would vote against the trust motion if a resolution was not passed on the formation of a Telengana state. TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, whose party has three MPs, iterated its demand for a resolution by the cabinet in favour of Telengana.

	Cuttack, Sept. 17: The state government, acting on a high court order, issued a fresh draft notification on delimitation of wards in Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) leaving just 21 of the 54 wards unreserved.        
	Earlier, the numbers of wards were increased from 48 to 54, creating six new wards by splitting the previous ones. The state government on February 20 issued a final notification on it.        
	The high court, however, nullified it in May and directed the state urban development department to issue fresh notification within 15 days after considering objections and concerns expressed by different parties. But the notification was not issued.        
	Eventually, the state election commission moved the high court alleging deliberate delay by the government in issuing notification on delimitation of wards. Conducting civic polls for formation of new council of CMC before the present councils term expires on September 30 was not possible due to it, the commission had stated. Acting on it a two-judge bench of Justices I.M. Quddusi and B.P. Ray had on September 10 granted the government time till October 8 to issue the final notification, which should be preceded by a draft notification and hearing of objections and appeals.        
	The draft notification has retained the increase in number of wards from 48 to 54, but made changes in the reservation of wards.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left still a govt ally? CIA thinks so
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 9 (PTI): After discovering weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Americas Central Intelligence Agency has now spied out something equally invisible: Prakash Karats support for the Manmohan Singh government.        
	The World Factbook section of the CIA website is unaware that the Left withdrew support to the UPA government last July  an event that made headlines even in America since the issue was the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Populist pressure from within the UPA government and from its Left Front allies continues to restrain needed initiatives, the site says in a section on the Indian economy.        
	It says the India page was last updated on November 6, 2008  that is, four months after the Left dumped the government.        
	The CIA, which has a history of botched operations, was officially said to have furnished the findings on Saddam Husseins alleged WMDs that President George W. Bush had used to justify invading Iraq in 2003.        
	The agency website also misses the recent interest-rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, mentioning instead the earlier rate hikes.        
	Economic expansion has helped New Delhi continue to make progress in reducing its federal fiscal deficit. However, strong growth... fuelled inflation concerns in 2006 and 2007, leading to a series of central bank interest rate hikes that have slowed credit growth and eased inflation concerns, it says.

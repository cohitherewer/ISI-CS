          FARHANA KALAM                              
	Gaya, May 28: After a heated discussion and controversy over the legality of the special meeting of the senate held today, Magadh University finally gave its nod for the introduction of more than 12 new courses.         
	The courses would be introduced under self-financing scheme, which means that neither the state government nor the UGC would foot the bill for introduction of the courses.        
	The courses include an engineering degree course in the proposed Bihar Institute of Technology to be set up on Magadh University premises. Nursing and hospital management, nanotechnology and material science, business management, biotechnology, journalism and mass communication, remote sensing, floriculture and medicinal plants, computer science and information technology, travel management, postgraduate course in home science and biochemistry among others would also be introduced.        
	Before the nod, the senate members raised the issue of quality control, financial discipline and monitoring of the progress of these courses. The members who were reluctant to give the nod and raised the issues of propriety and concealment of vital details, including cost and fee structure, comprised former minister Vijay Kumar Singh and JD(U) MLA Jagdish Sharma.        
	In the beginning, Surindra Narain, a senior member of the senate, raised the issue of the legality of the special meeting. He said that according to the rules of business, special meeting of the senate can be convened only once a year, while the present meet was the third special meeting in a row. Vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey, who presided over the meeting, overruled the objections. Narain also said that various statutory bodies of the university have not been constituted and the senate remained unrepresented in the syndicate in violation of the provisions of the universities act.        
	MU Teachers Association president A.K. Singh Thakur demanded immediate regularisation of the services of the teachers and staff of the fourth phase colleges, promotional benefits for the yet to be regularised staff, award of leave in lieu of examination work done during vacations and stoppage of the so called rationalisation process in which teachers were allegedly being subjected to harassment transfer.        
	The association also alleged that illegal appointments were being made in the university on extraneous considerations. Refuting illegal appointment allegation, Pandey said that in cases of acute shortage of staff, the principals have been authorised to engage qualified and competent persons on contract basis and payment to such contract employees would be made from the internal resources of the college.        
	Pandey added that the university might have to exercise the outsourcing option to clear pending works.

	New IIM batch: state ministers    
	The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore will have a new set of pupils  ministers from the BJP government in Karnataka.    
	The B-schools centre for public policy is organising courses to sharpen ministers skills. The programme has the support of chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. He feels since most of his 33 cabinet colleagues are first-timers, they will benefit from the training as they deal with public money and approve projects that benefit millions.    
	Apart from basic managerial skills, the course hopes to highlight how the leaders can derive maximum gains from minimum investment. It helps that the initiative is cost-effective and keeps public accountability in mind.     
	Since large sections of the government is run by power-wielding bureaucrats, the chief minister feels some lessons in management for ministers will go a long way in keeping them aware of which way their department is headed.    
	Once the ministers are through the B-school grind, one hopes they will boost development and run the government more along the lines of a corporate entity.        
	Books short, govt chips in    
	NCERT books are often in short supply but the Delhi government has turned over a new leaf with an offer to print them.    
	Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said recently the state was considering a proposal to publish the Class XII books the NCERT hasnt been able to supply enough.    
	The governments printing units have been rolling out NCERT textbooks from the first to eighth classes. Books for higher classes are printed by the NCERT itself.    
	Since the NCERT is overburdened with printing, we have decided to seek its permission to print the textbooks for our students at our printing units, Lovely said.     
	The announcement about the state considering such a printing plan came at a meeting that Lovely presided over. Senior education officials attended the discussions.    
	Old cabs can belch longer    
	Mumbais ageing cabs appear to have got a new lifeline.    
	The Maharashtra government announced recently it would set up a committee to study the problems caused by old taxis, primarily their high level of emissions.    
	The announcement was made by minister of state for transport, Hasan Mushrif, who told the legislative council that the principal secretary in the transport department would study problems caused by outdated taxis.    
	The panel will prepare a report within six months, meaning any move to phase out the smoke-belching vehicles will not be started any time before the findings are ready.    
	Speaking about other transport travails, Mushrif said the government was planning to start monorail in 50 places as part of a wider plan to reduce use of private vehicles and bring down the congestion on roads in the city.    
	When told the strength of the traffic police was far too low, the minister accepted the shortage posed a problem in road management but promised to increase the number.

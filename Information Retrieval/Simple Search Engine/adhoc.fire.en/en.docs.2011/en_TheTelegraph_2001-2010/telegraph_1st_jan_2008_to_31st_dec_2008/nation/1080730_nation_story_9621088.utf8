          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, July 29: Seven members of a rich Jat family with no known enemies were today massacred in their sleep in the middle of the night in a west Uttar Pradesh village.        
	Sukhveer Singh, the head of the farmer family and the first to be killed in Barari village, was an ardent supporter of Ajit Singh. The Jats have been bristling since the Rashtriya Lok Dal chief switched to Mayavatis side for last weeks trust vote.        
	The Jats are upset with the Bahujan Samaj Party chief minister because she has allegedly not met any of their demands so far. Last week, they had dubbed Ajits switchover the great betrayal.        
	Barari, about 70km from Delhi, is a stronghold of the RLD leader. Whispers have begun floating that the murders could have a political angle, although police had initially claimed revenge as a motive.        
	The police said two dozen gunmen swooped on the village in Bulandshahr district around 3am and slit the throat of Sukhveer Singh, 38, who was asleep on a cot outside his house.        
	They then barged into the house and shot dead his pregnant wife Suryabala, 29, and two-year-old son Abhishek. A second son, Suryapratap, who is eight, escaped unhurt.        
	Two other women relatives who had come visiting were also killed. The identities of the other victims have not been confirmed but the life of a deaf-mute household help was spared, reports said.        
	After the bloodbath, the killers kept firing indiscriminately in the air and loudly challenging the people to face them if they dared. If any of you want to die, come forward, a witness cited the gunmen as screaming.        
	The Singhs neighbours trashed the police theory that the murders had a revenge motive. They said the Singhs were a friendly family and had no feuds or conflicts with anyone.        
	Sukhveer Singh, the head of the family, was a well-to-do farmer and we have not received any information suggesting they had any feud with anyone, Balvir Singh, an inspector of Aurangabad police station, later said.        
	The murders have stirred anger within the community. Fingers are being pointed at the callousness of the cops because Sukhveer Singhs house was not very far from the local police station.        
	Angry farmers held demonstrations in the area and briefly barred the police from entering the village and taking the bodies away.        
	Bulandshahr SSP Raj Kumar Kureel said valuables in the farmers house had been left untouched. We are working on a number of clues. We still feel some personal enmity might have led to the murders.        
	Two companies of the Provincial Armed Constabulary have been posted in the area to prevent any backlash.

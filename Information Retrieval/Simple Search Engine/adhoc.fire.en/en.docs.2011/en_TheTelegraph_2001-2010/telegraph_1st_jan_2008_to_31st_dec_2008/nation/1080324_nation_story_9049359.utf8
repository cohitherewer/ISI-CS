          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 23: Accidents on Holi and the day after have claimed 11 lives in Delhi and its outskirts.         
	The first accident occurred on the busy Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) flyover when a Swaraj Mazda caught fire yesterday. Three persons died in the blaze and nine other passengers were injured. Police are unclear on what sparked the fire.        
	The traffic jam that the accident caused led to a second mishap on the DND within 10 minutes. As vehicles got stuck in the snarl, a car coming from the wrong side hit an autorickshaw. There was a traffic jam and one of these vehicles was travelling on the wrong side of the road, said a police officer. Three persons in the auto were killed and one was injured.         
	The youths in the car were injured and not in a state to give a statement. The exact cause of the accident will only be worked out once we get to speak to the boys, a police official said.         
	Whether the youths were returning drunk after Holi revelry was also not clear.        
	Later last night, a truck carrying vegetables as well as people turned turtle at Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi. Four persons were killed and five injured. The truck was speeding towards Azadpur Mandi, the wholesale market for fruits and vegetables, when it overturned. The victims died on the spot.         
	This morning, a speeding Blueline bus rammed into a tree in south Delhi. One woman passenger was killed. The driver was arrested.         
	MTNL CMD R.S. Sinha was also injured when his car collided with another one at a busy intersection in south Delhi. Both the cars were travelling at great speed, said a police official. Sinha had to be extricated from his car that had overturned. He is in hospital.         
	Contrary to perceptions, Blueline buses, often blamed for Delhis road casualties, cause only 16 per cent of the tot-al accident deaths. Private cars and taxis are responsible for 10 per cent of such deaths. Most people in Delhi die coming under the wheels of trucks.

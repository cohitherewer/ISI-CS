 29 navy chiefs

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The chiefs of 29 navies from countries around the Indian Ocean will be in New Delhi next month to discuss a proposal for a regional forum of maritime security organisations.
    
	Pakistan has yet to indicate its participation in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), for which 29 countries have confirmed participation. The chiefs of the navies will meet at a seminar on Contemporary Transnational Challenges  International Maritime Connectivities in Delhi and will be taken on a visit to the naval station in Goa on February 14 and 15.
    
	France is invited despite being a European power because it has a territory in the Indian Ocean, Reunion Island.
    
	The IONS is not meant to be an India-led or India-centric platform. Its purpose is to build a forum for discussion of global and regional maritime issues, the assistant chief of naval staff in charge of foreign cooperation, Rear Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, said here today.
    
	The IONS is loosely modelled on the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, an initiative of the US at the end of the Cold War. Naval sources said the IONS was interested in greater flow of information, and invites had been sent to navies in the OODA  observe, orient, decide and act  loop. 
    
	The Indian Navy has proposed that the navies learn to operate jointly and evolve procedures for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Decisions will be taken at the conclave of the naval chiefs.

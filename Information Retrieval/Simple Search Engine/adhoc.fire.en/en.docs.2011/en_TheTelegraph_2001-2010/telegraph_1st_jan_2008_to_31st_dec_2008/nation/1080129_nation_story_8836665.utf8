          CHIRANJEEVI MEETS RAJASEKHAR IN HYDERABAD AFTER THE ATTACK ON HIS CAR ON MONDAY. (PTI)G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, Jan. 28: Telugu actor Rajasekhar today escaped with minor injuries after angry Chiranjeevi fans chased and attacked his car with iron rods for what he had said about the superstars lack of political experience.        
	Rajasekhars actress wife Jevitha and their two daughters were in the Accent when it was stopped and its windscreen and glass panes smashed near the Panjagutta circle in the Andhra capital.        
	The actor, at loggerheads with Chiranjeevi over copyrights to the blockbuster Tagore, drove straight to Apollo Hospital after the 9am assault.        
	They attacked with stones and iron rods, Rajasekhar, who was at the wheel, said.        
	City police have registered a case of criminal attack but have yet to make any arrests, sources said.        
	The attack followed Rajasekhars comments yesterday at Bhimavaram, about 450km from Hyderabad, that Chiranjeevi lacked political experience and that he would not join a political outfit floated by the superstar.         
	As reports of protests by his fans poured in from across the state, Chiranjeevi  the first Indian star to be paid a crore for a film  drove to Rajasekhars house and apologised for the incident.        
	I strongly condemn this attack. I sincerely apologise to you for this, he told the actor in the presence of the media.        
	We are contemporaries in the film industry. Rajasekhar has his own opinions and I respect them, he said, asking his fans to restrain themselves.        
	In a democracy, everyone has a right to express his views. There is nothing wrong in what Rajasekhar has said. I strongly disapprove of the way my fans have reacted. This is very unfortunate.        
	The police provided armed security at Rajasekhars house after the actor made a request to chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.        
	Rajasekhar is known to be close to the chief minister and had produced a film last year eulogising the YSR regime. Several Congress legislators played roles in the political satire Yevadaithe Nakemti (Who cares?).         
	Chiranjeevis fans said Rajasekhar did not have the right to say anything about their hero.         
	He is not a superman that he can speak about our Chiranjeevi, said Chiru, a fan. He (Rajasekhar) should have stood up like a man and answered us.        
	Earlier, Chiranjeevi fans protested at platforms along the route of the Narsapur Express train, which Rajasekhar and his family boarded from Bhimavaram last night. Others burnt effigies of the actor in Bhimavaram and Vijayawada, about 150km away.        
	Later in the day, the anti-Chiranjeevi lobby sprang into action, with most calling on Rajasekhar at his residence. Among them was actor-producer and former Rajya Sabha MP Mohan Babu.        
	Several Congress leaders called on Rajasekhar to express solidarity with him, while Union minister and film director Dasari Narayan Rao called up the actor.        
	On the other side of the political divide, the BJP was considering joining hands with Chiranjeevi, sources said. The partys national executive might invite him to join the NDA.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Patel, Deora: Bailout battle				                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: The three leading airlines in the country owe state-run oil companies over Rs 1,500 crore, a hurt petroleum ministry said today in an apparent reply to suggestions that it was standing in the way of a bailout package for the aviation industry.        
	These are difficult times for them (airlines) and oil companies. IOC, BPCL and HPCL practically live on borrowings and so the airlines have to clear their outstandings (at the earliest), petroleum minister Murli Deora said, stopping short of threatening to discontinue supplies.        
	The three airlines are Jet, Kingfisher and the state-owned Air India.        
	I am disappointed and hurt by Prafuls comment, Deora told reporters. He was referring to aviation minister Praful Patels comment yesterday expressing disappointment at some ministries failure to take positive steps to help the industry. Patels statement was seen as an indirect reference to the petroleum ministry.        
	The petroleum minister said he had brokered a deal between Jet chairman Naresh Goyal and IOC chief Sarthak Behuria in Mumbai recently under which the airline was given 60 days to clear the fuel dues.        
	But they have not kept the agreement, Deora said, adding that Jet had defaulted on Rs 259 crore on bills run up more than two and a half years ago.        
	Jets total outstanding amount stood at Rs 859 crore, of which it had defaulted on payment due on September 25 and October 5, ministry officials said.        
	Deora said Kingfisher owed Rs 110 crore to the oil companies, of which Rs 60 crore remained unpaid after expiry of the credit period. Air Indias holding company does not have any grace period with oil firms and had an outstanding of Rs 606 crore on October 8.         
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said the airlines have to clear their outstanding accounts at the earliest as oil firms were losing heavily on the sale of subsidised petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene. They will have to borrow (to clear the dues), he said.         
	Deora, a Congress leader from Mumbai, also criticised Jet for retrenching over 1,900 people during the festive season and in the middle of the global financial crisis.        
	I appeal to Goyal not to retrench people and try to find some solution. We have supported Goyal several times (but) this is not the right time to retrench people, particularly before Diwali, the minister said.        
	Union science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the government could not interfere in the decisions of airlines and individual companies. Our responsibility is only to ensure that the economy is functioning well.

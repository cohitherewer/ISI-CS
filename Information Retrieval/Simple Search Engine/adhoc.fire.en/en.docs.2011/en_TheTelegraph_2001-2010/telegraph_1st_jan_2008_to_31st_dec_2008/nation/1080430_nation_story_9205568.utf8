The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Accidents on rise, railway hospitals still ill-equipped
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Accidents on rise, railway hospitals still ill-equipped

	Patna, April 29: Rohit Kumars (20) dreams of cracking the civil services were cut short on March 19, 2008, when he lost both his legs in a train accident at the Patna railway station.        
	Rohit (name changed on request) was about to board a train bound for Gorakhpur when his hand slipped off the greasy handle of the gate and before he could recover his balance, the train started moving, leaving Rohit enmeshed between the platform edge and the track.         
	Rohit is one among the 800-odd people, who suffer railway-related accidents in Bihar annually.         
	Despite the high frequency of accidents and casualty, Bihars rail hospital remain ill equipped to tackle emergencies.         
	The railway hospital lacks the most intrinsic facility  operations involving artificial limbs  though most accidents involve loss of limbs.         
	Of the 800 patients who fall prey to rail accidents, most are in the age group of 20-35 years and are sometimes the sole earning member in the family.         
	Surprisingly, even when its the Indian Railways duty, few patients approach the consumers forum seeking compensation.         
	Despite the high revenue, railways too refer most cases of injury to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).         
	The PMCH, a premier state hospital, received 370 injured patients in 2006-07. The number would have been higher, stressed hospital sources, if the unaccounted rail deaths were taken into count.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, the head of the department of orthopaedics at the PMCH, Arjun Singh, said: In most cases of train accidents, lower limbs are either cut or badly lacerated.        
	Other injuries pertain to upper limbs, head and pelvis.         
	For us its a tough task trying to rehabilitate patients who suffer amputation of any sort  without any help from the railway hospital. We solely depend on charitable bodies such as Mahavir Biklang Seva Kendra (Jaipur) that provides free train tickets, hospital stay and artificial limbs to patients. Even if the railway is at fault it barely or never cover costs, Singh added.        
	Of the 363 cases reported between 2005 and 2006, 169 cases of injury were caused in platforms, 59 were caused while boarding or de-boarding trains, 29 cases involved running trains and 103 accidents occurred while people were trying to cross the tracks.        
	Despite train accidents being a part of the every day reality, the hospital head rued, the Indian Railways offered its passengers very few amenities.        
	The worst aspect of train disability is that sufferers are mostly young bread-earners belonging to BPL families. With accidents affecting lower limbs in 80 per cent cases, people are rendered jobless, said Singh.         
	Gopi Kumar (18), a Khagaria resident, lost both legs below the ankle.        
	Now recovering at the PMCH, he said: The accident occurred when I was trying to cross the rail track  people came forth to help, but none of the railway staff were on sight.         
	His mother, Usha Devi, pointed out that she had to start working again as Gopi, their sole bread-earner, has been rendered jobless.        
	Mohan Paswan (45), a Jehanabad resident, lost his right arm while he fell from the trains foot-board.         
	Suresh Shah (40) of Lakhisarai was luckier as he retained his arms  but lost his toes.

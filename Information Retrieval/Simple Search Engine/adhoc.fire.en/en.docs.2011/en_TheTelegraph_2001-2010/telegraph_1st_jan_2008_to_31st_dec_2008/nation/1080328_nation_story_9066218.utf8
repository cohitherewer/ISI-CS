The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Marshal proxy FIR on Speaker
                                                                                                               Marshal proxy FIR on Speaker
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 27: Gayatri Panda, an assistant marshal of the Assembly, stood by her charges of sexual harassment against Assembly Speaker Maheshwar Mohanty and filed an FIR today at Mahila police station here.        
	Panda wasnt present at the police station, but was helped by a group of women activists to file the FIR. The victim could not come to the police station because of a threat, said Rituparna Mohanty, an activist who signed the FIR on Pandas behalf.         
	Assistant commissioner of police B.N. Guru, who received the complaint, said Pandas FIR had been acc- epted but a case was yet to be registered.         
	We are verifying the authenticity of the compl- aint. We have asked the woman who lodged the complaint on her (Pandas) behalf to submit a forwarding letter along with the complaint, said DCP Amitav Thakur.        
	In the FIR, Panda alleged she was deliberately assig- ned duty beyond usual working hours and out of her jurisdiction at the behest of the Speaker. The Speakers behaviour became intolerable during the last few months, she claimed. He was making lewd gestures and sending his driver and other staff to persuade me to have a sexual relationship with him, she alleged in her FIR.         
	Panda cited an instance when the Speaker appare- ntly sent a vehicle to her house late at night.         
	As I did not oblige, I was threatened of action on flimsy grounds and repeatedly placed under suspension to put pressure on me to succumb to his wishes. I was approached by people who promised that all my problems would be solved if I met him (the Speaker) in private, she said in the FIR.         
	Panda also claimed she ad written to the Assembly secretary twice. Since no action was taken, she was left with no alternative but to go to the media and seek help of NGOs.        
	The Speaker has refused to preside over the Assembly till such time a House committee inquiry cleared him of the charges he claims are baseless and motivated. He has, however, refused to step down. Yesterday, the Speaker had decided against presiding over the House until an inquiry cleared him of the accusation. He had suggested a House committee probe and described Pandas allegations as a conspiracy and alleged that powerful persons were involved.

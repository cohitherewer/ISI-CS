                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amar to break bread with Sonia
          OUR BUREAU                              Amar, Sonia				                                 
	New Delhi, May 20: For the first time in four years, Amar Singh will break bread with Sonia Gandhi.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited the Samajwadi Party general secretary to the UPA governments fourth anniversary programme at 7 Race Course Road on May 22, which includes a dinner.        
	Sources close to Amar confirmed he has accepted the invite. He is abroad and will touch base tomorrow.        
	The sources said Amar let bygones be bygones and was prepared to forget how he was allegedly given a short shrift by Sonia after he gatecrashed the first UPA dinner she had hosted at her home in May 2004. The Samajwadi leader said Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the then CPM general secretary and the bridge between the Left and the Congress, asked him over. Amar later said he rued the decision to go to the dinner.        
	In politics nothing is permanent, a source said, referring to the change of mind now.        
	Senior Samajwadi MPs Ram Gopal Yadav and Mohan Singh have also been invited. They did not sound overly excited but confirmed they would go. The reason is that we are all suffering under the Mayavati government. Good sense has dawned on the Congress rather late, said Mohan, the partys chief whip in the Lok Sabha.        
	A Congress leader clarified that this was not the first time the Samajwadis were being invited. Invites were sent to their leaders for the last two years. However, Amar was not spotted at the Prime Minsters residence on the earlier occasions.        
	Asked if the Samajwadis decision to withdraw support last year had not changed the circumstances, he said: No, because they never gave anything in writing to the President. So it means nothing.        
	The leader said the invite should not be over-interpreted. Talks are on... but nothing has happened on a formal level.         
	A thaw in the Congress-Samajwadi equation was evident of late. Amar was invited to address a seminar on health organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in April. Sonia chairs the foundation.        
	The Samajwadis later indicated that the party could reconsider its line on the Indo-US nuclear deal, even if that meant going against the Left.         
	The Congresss assessment was Mayavati was invincible at the moment and if her supremacy went unchallenged, she would net the most seats in Uttar Pradesh in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.        
	The sources acknowledged that the Congress was not in a position to take on the BSP single-handed. Therefore, if not an alliance, some kind of an understanding with the Samajwadis might help both.        
	The sources also admitted to a real fear of the BSP luring away the Congresss MPs.        
	However, as in the past, this year, too, the Prime Minister has asked the BSP over.

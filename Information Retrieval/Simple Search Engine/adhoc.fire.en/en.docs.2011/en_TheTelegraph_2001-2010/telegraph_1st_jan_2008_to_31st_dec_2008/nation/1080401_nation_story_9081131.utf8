The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Free Tibet? Karat utters the K-word
                                                                                                               Free Tibet? Karat utters the K-word
  - Leader draws parallel with Indian scenario, says protesters doing great disservice to nation        OUR BUREAU                                                A child at a rally for Tibet in Sydney on Monday. (Reuters)      
	Coimbatore/Behrampore, March 31: Prakash Karat today said those who supported the movement for an independent Tibet were doing a great disservice to India, which too faces the problem of secessionist demands.        
	Those in India who want to join this chorus for an independent Tibet will be doing a great disservice to our own country. Are we going to support a free Nagaland? Or a free Jammu and Kashmir? Or those other secessionist demands? the CPM general secretary asked.        
	Karat said he appreciated the central governments stand that anti-China activities would not be allowed on Indian soil. He favoured talks between Beijing and representatives of the Dalai Lama within the framework of the one-China policy to sort out their differences.  
	The CPM general secretary said there was a tendency to violate the sovereignty of nations in the name of human rights and ethnic minorities.        
	He said he detected a western design in such attempts to break up nation states, and cited the instance of Kosovo. The CPM is against secessionism, whether it involves China, any other Asian country or a European nation, he said.        
	Karat attacked the BJP and National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes for their positions on China and Tibet.        
	The BJP has come out with a statement criticising the governments stand. Fernandes has urged the Centre to boycott China and refuse to allow the Olympic torch into India.        
	When he was defence minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Fernandes had remarked controversially that China was Indias enemy number one. Karat, however, cited how the Vajpayee government had to put on record that Tibet was an autonomous region of China.        
	That is the correct position, the CPM chief said. We want a dialogue between the Chinese government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. Beijing has already said it is willing to hold talks provided the Dalai Lama does not want to go out of the framework of one China.        
	He added: Some Indian politicians are toeing the line of certain western powers like the US which would lead to the break-up of larger states in the name of human rights or rights of ethnic minorities.        
	Asked for his reaction to the way Beijing had summoned Indian ambassador Nirupama Rao in the middle of the night to protest the attack on its embassy in Delhi, Karat said he was not well-versed in diplomatic practices.        
	In Behrampore, Murshidabad, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee repeated the Centres stand that Tibet was an autonomous region of China.        
	In 1959, the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had provided shelter to the Dalai Lama on condition that he would independently (with full freedom) preach his religion but would not indulge in any kind of politics that may affect India-China relations, Mukherjee told reporters after inaugurating a BEd College in Suti, Murshidabad, about 275km from Calcutta. The Dalai Lama is an honoured guest in India and a religious leader. When the Dalai Lama left Tibet for India, it was a part of China. Today, too, Tibet is very much a part of China.        
	Asked to comment on Fernandess demands, he said: When he (Fernandes) was defence minister, he had said that China was enemy number one. Then he went on a trip to China. It was in 1959 that the Indian government had formulated its stand on China, and it is still unchanged.

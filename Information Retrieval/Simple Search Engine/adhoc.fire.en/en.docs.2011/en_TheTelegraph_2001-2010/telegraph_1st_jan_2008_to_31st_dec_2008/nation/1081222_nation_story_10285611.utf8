                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     World-class pursuit without a plan
  - Ministry asked to refer to other institutions for new laws framework        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: The Centre is drafting a law to launch world-class universities without a blueprint for either their character or mandate, scrambling to meet a commitment made by the Prime Minister as elections approach.        
	Tired of waiting for a University Grants Commission (UGC) panel to finalise a concept note on the new set of universities, the government decided to go ahead on its own, senior officials have said.        
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry has been asked to plod through legislation for other existing institutions, pick up ideas and piece together a skeleton for the new law, sources said.        
	The government finishes its tenure by mid-2009, and is keen to present a final vision of the framework for the world-class universities before the elections.        
	With the UGC apparently unable yet to finalise a concept, the government has little option but to move on without a clear concept. The world-class universities cannot wait any longer, a government official said.        
	The UPA announced plans for 14 world-class universities across the country in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. The universities, part of the Prime Ministers strategy to transform India into a global knowledge hub, are expected to compete with the best institutions in the developed world.        
	The UGC set up an expert committee to draw up a concept paper on the basis of which a law for the institutions would be drafted. A draft concept paper was circulated earlier this year but several arms of Indias higher education infrastructure raised objections.        
	Vice-chancellors of several central and state universities opposed the concept of world-class universities, arguing the new classification relegated the rest to a lower category.        
	The National Knowledge Commission, too, suggested changes, proposing greater autonomy for the institutions and a change in the title to national universities. Several eminent educators have also expressed concerns in private.        
	The UGC expert committee was asked to redraw the blueprint for the new universities, addressing the concerns raised.        
	UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat has said he is not personally against the concept of world class universities. However, some UGC officials stressed that as Indias higher education regulator, the organisation is required to represent the views of the countrys universities in any concept paper.        
	The problem of accommodating all concerns while retaining the gist of the Prime Ministers vision has proved complicated, an official said.        
	The HRD ministry is now studying the administrative and academic structures of institutions like the IITs, the National Institutes of Technology, the IIMs and leading central universities, government sources said.        
	Bits and pieces from each of these institutions may need to be picked up in the drafting of the law for world-class universities. But the real challenge is to draft a law without a clear vision for the universities, a senior government official said.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Feb. 4: The drugs controller of Orissa has been ordered to conduct a technical probe into the alleged death of cattle after drinking the Mahanadi water here. 
    
	Official sources said drugs controller K.C. Mishra would be probing into the toxicity of the water after being asked by Cuttack collector Sujata Kartikeyan, who visited the riverbed near Gadgadia temple where six cows were found dead on Sunday.
    
	Sample of the water has been sent to laboratory. Viscera have been sent for forensic test. The cause of death can be ascertained after the reports come, said the collector. She further appealed to the people to keep away from the area. 
    
	Officials suspect that fake drugs or those that have passed their expiry date might have been dumped in the river. 
    
	Ironically, Orissa High Court on January 17 had observed that Orissa has become a dumping ground of fake medicines. 
    
	A two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty had made the observation while adjudicating a PIL on large-scale influx of fake drugs into the state.

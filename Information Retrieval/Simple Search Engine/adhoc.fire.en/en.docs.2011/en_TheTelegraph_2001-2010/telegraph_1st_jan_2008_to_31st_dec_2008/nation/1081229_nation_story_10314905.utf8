The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP gets tonic for Big One
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           BJP gets tonic for Big One
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Birthday gift: Arun Jaitley was the BJP leader in charge of the Jammu and Kashmir elections. The results came on his birthday                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The near clean sweep in urban Jammu has perked the BJP up 20 days after the disappointment of the heartland Assembly polls.        
	Jammu and Kashmir has been to the BJP what Delhi was to the Congress  mainly a tonic  since both states have single-digit Lok Sabha seats and are lightweights in a national election.        
	The victory is that much sweeter for Arun Jaitley  and not just because it comes on his birthday, which he is celebrating with his family hundreds of miles away in Kovalam.        
	Jaitley was the BJPs man in charge of the polls both in Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir. Todays triumph would apply balm on the Delhi failure  Jaitleys first-ever defeat after a string of dazzling successes, including victory in Gujarat.        
	Jaitleys wife Dolly is from Jammu and Kashmir where her father was a Congress leader and a close associate of Sheikh Abdullah. The Jammu BJP calls Jaitley its damaad (son-in-law), so for the lawyer-politician it was a question of his izzat (honour) as well.        
	The BJP has hiked its tally from one to 11 in Jammu. Party leaders Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Prakash Javdekar put it down to one factor. The right issue clicked at the right time, Naqvi said.        
	The allusion was to the Amarnath land dispute, which had led the Congress into several flip-flops as it tried to please both Hindus and Muslims. In the process, it lost an ally and a government and, eventually, its base in urban Jammu.        
	If the BJP had earlier taken the Delhi rout as a bad omen for the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress sees grave threats in the Jammu results.        
	Its a worrying sign. Secularism and development are shrinking (in the face of) communalism, said former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.        
	BJP sources said that though the Mumbai attacks did not influence voters in Delhi and Rajasthan to the extent they had hoped, the communally divisive Amarnath controversy had worked.        
	Its a question of the credibility you carry. Our ads on Mumbai didnt take off because the Congress kept reminding people the NDA had released a Pakistani terrorist after the Kandahar hijack, a BJP source said. Our Amarnath campaign focused on one point: the neglect of Jammu  and, by implication, of Hindus  by the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress.

                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Silly DGP gets governors goat    
	Four months into Presidents rule and Karnataka can already hear governor Rameshwar Thakur cracking his whip.     
	Rumours are that director-general of police K.R. Sreenivasan is Thakurs next target.     
	The DGPs silly comments seem to have left the governor fuming. At a news conference called to play down the ongoing terror investigations, Sreenivasan had unleashed many a wisecrack.     
	What you journalists have written so far is only a short story, terrorism is a mega serial, was his opening line.    
	erplexed, a journalist asked him if a police team was being sent to Kerala. His answer: If a diplomat says yes, he means no; when he says no, it means maybe.    
	The confusion compounded, another reporter wanted to know if those arrested were terrorists or just terror suspects. But there was no stopping the DGPs flow of wit.    
	If a man is unmarried, do you call him unmarried or bachelor? he chuckled.    
	The governor, clearly, isnt amused.        
	Fine Holi for traffic cops    
	The capitals traffic cops had a busy Holi this year. While the rest of the city was having a splash, they were keeping a watch on rule-breakers. And their eyes had no rest, as the offender count ran into thousands.    
	More than 2,100 people were fined on Saturday for violating traffic rules. While 271 people were booked for drink-driving, 443 were fined for jumping red lights. High on fun and colour, they might have argued. But the cops, armed with alcometers (breath analysers), were not listening.    
	Over 2,100 challans were issued on Saturday, an officer said.    
	As many as 646 people thought it was okay to toss away the helmet while riding two-wheelers on Holi.    
	Rash driving, too, seemed to be the flavour of the festive day with 102 people being booked for the offence. Four were fined for trespassing into a no-entry zone.    
	MP booklets a babu    
	People usually file an FIR when they want to bring a person to book. But Congress MP Dhanushkodi Adityan had so many charges against IAS officer N.K. Raghupathy that he decided to list them in a booklet.     
	Titled Memorandum of Complaints against N.K. Raghupathy, IAS, the 147-page booklet charges him with giving untrue and misleading facts to higher authorities on various issues, including problems that plagued the Tuticorin Port Trust, of which he is a former chairman.     
	The bureaucrat has also been accused of being negligent while heading the Sethusamudram project, and indulging in malpractice and misappropriating guesthouse facilities.     
	Copies of the booklet have been sent to secretaries in the departments of shipping, and personnel and training, besides the central vigilance commissioner and the Tuticorin superintendent of police.        
	Phish net    
	Watch out banks, the phishing net can get you.     
	A study has revealed a six-fold increase in phishing attacks  a form of Internet fraud  on the countrys lenders in the last four months alone.    
	The phishing brains steal valuable information such as credit card details, social security numbers, user IDs and passwords. The fraud is executed through spoof emails and fake websites that prompt users to disclose their personal details.    
	The study conducted by an Internet security firm, Symantec, found that in October last year, there were 20 phishing strikes on Indian banks and the figure grew to 120 till January 2008.    
	Mumbai: Little Theatre at Nariman Point screens LArgent, a French film based on a Leo Tolstoy story, at 6.30pm on Thursday. Directed by Robert Bresson, the film is about the petty manoeuvrings of some upper-class boys and shopkeepers resulting in the downfall of their employee.

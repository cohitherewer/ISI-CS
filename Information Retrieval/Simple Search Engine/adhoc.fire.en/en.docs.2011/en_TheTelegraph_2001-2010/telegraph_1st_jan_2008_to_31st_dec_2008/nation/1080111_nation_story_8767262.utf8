     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 10: Bihars prison department has decided to introduce cricket in overcrowded and violence-prone jails to keep prisoners in good mood. 
    
	We have decided to introduce matches in the prisons to help prisoners use their energy positively, said prison welfare officer, Jaiprakash Das, while talking to The Telegraph. The man added: Many prisoners love cricket  all Indians do.
    
	The administration, of late, is battling with the stepped up incidents of violence and fracas in the state jail. 
    
	Recently, the Maoist prisoners indulged in vandalism and beat up officials in Beur central jail.
    
	Samastipur, Jehanabad, Biharsharief and Sasaram jails, too, faced violent clashes. 
    
	Top echelons of the administration have decided to introduce the innovative idea in the chaotic prisons following the local officials report that the Indias controversial engagement in Australlia kept many of the prisoners across the state glued to the TV and also worked as a binding force among them. 
    
	The officials feel that the cricket matches in the prison will have a further cooling effect on the prisoners living in a stressful condition. To begin with, the officials said, the prison administration will start inter-ward cricket tournament in the prison. 
    
	We are preparing to organise the first tournament in Gaya by this month itself, Das said. Its possible that we will introduce the most popular sports of the country in all the 54 jails of the state. But some jails lack the space. So, for now, we will introduce it in all jails which have space and ground, Das said. 
    
	The prison authorities said the prison administration was supposed to provide the instruments of recreation in the jails. We already provide them with newspapers, TV and magazines. We have also supplied volleyballs in some jails. But cricket that has become so popular may go a long way in keeping the prisoners stress free, Das said.
    
	All 54 Bihar jails are plagued with problems such as overcrowding and violence.

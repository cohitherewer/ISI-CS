          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Midnapore, Nov. 8: Roads are again being dug up in Bengal to shut police out of villages, less than two years after Nandigram.        
	A nervous administration has acted quickly, shunting out the local police station chief in Lalgarh, West Midnapore, for failing to stop the hundreds of shovel-wielding tribals who cut trenches and placed logs across two highways today.        
	The villagers are protesting police high-handedness after Sundays Maoist blast hit a Union ministers convoy some 30km away, saying the cops are entering homes and beating up women.        
	People from a dozen-odd villages in Lalgarh  from where five persons have been arrested after the blast  today cut off road links with the district and subdivision headquarters, Midnapore and Jhargram. Yesterday, they had dug up roads connecting West Midnapore with Bankura district.        
	Police sources said the inspector in charge of Lalgarh police station, Sandip Sinha, was asked to go on leave today and charge was handed over to inspector Sushanta Rajbanshi.        
	The police, unable to find our men, have been torturing us, alleged Sumi Murmu, 32, who lives with her three children in Chhotopelia village.        
	Most of the male villagers had fled for fear of police raids, but they have been returning for the past two days to dig up roads before vanishing again. Today they dug up a road at Jhitka forest, 35km from Midnapore town, and another at Brindabanpur, 25km from Jhargram.        
	Scores of unarmed villagers squatted on the blocked roads tonight, watchful of any police movement. They have threatened to dig up more roads tomorrow if the harassment does not stop.        
	I have asked Lalgarh BDO Chinmoy Mondal to talk to them and find out their grievances, district magistrate N.S. Nigam said.        
	Angry residents forced local MLA Chunibala Hansda, of the Jharkhand Party (Naren), to turn back when she arrived at Chhotopelia today. I wanted to enquire about their grievances but had to return disheartened, she said.        
	District police chief Rajesh Kumar Singh said: I shall not say anything about the Lalgarh inspector-in-charge; Im at a meeting.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia: Tough time                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: The Congress Working Committee, the partys highest policy-making body, will meet for the second time this year against a gloom-and-doom backdrop.         
	The party is faced with a string of poll reverses, growing inflation and an imminent hike in fuel prices which, sources said, will only put a further strain on the aam aadmis resources.        
	While the Congresss doomsayers privately agreed such tidings augured poorly for them in an election year, like the other CWC meetings in the recent past, Saturdays session is not expected to reflect on what went wrong in Karnataka, Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland  where the party lost  or why the Centre had not delivered anything tangible on the price front so far.        
	Sources said the CWC was expected to ratify the Centres proposed fuel hike in its resolution after parroting the arguments marshalled by the government: the global oil crisis, the demand-supply mismatch and the need to pull oil manufacturing companies out of near insolvency.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Murli Deora were asked to brief the members though they are not members of the CWC.         
	Chidambarams statement expressing satisfaction about the GDP growth at 9 per cent in 2007-08 despite the turbulence in the money market cut no ice with the Congress.         
	Sources said it was poor or no consolation because the so-called growth rate cannot offset the damage caused by inflation. But no CWC member is likely to contest Chidambarams assertions, said a source.        
	While Chidambaram and Deora were pressed into service for the Congress, Pranab Mukherjee, the external affairs minister, was tasked to deal with the UPA allies on the fuel front.        
	The only good news for the Congress was that the government was expected to scale down the proposed oil price hike and settle for what a spokesperson said was an absorbed increase in tandem with other measures like eliminating customs duty on oil, slashing import duty to 2.5 per cent and reducing excise duty by 50 per cent. Another proposal on the table was to float oil bonds to mop up resources for debilitated oil companies.        
	The last time the CWC met was in February, a couple of months after the Gujarat elections. Those who expected sparks to fly were shocked to find there was not even a mention. The reasons were already gone into by a smaller group, a source said.        
	The Congresss Friday Club  consisting of the Prime Minister, Sonia, Ahmed Patel, A.K. Antony, Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and Arjun Singh met this evening to take stock of the Karnataka defeat.

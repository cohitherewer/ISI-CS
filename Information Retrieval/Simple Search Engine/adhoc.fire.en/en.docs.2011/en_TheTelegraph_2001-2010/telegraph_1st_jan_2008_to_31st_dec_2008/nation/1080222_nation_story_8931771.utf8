          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 21: The Bihar government has suspended two members of the Bihar Public Service Commission for alleged irregularities in the appointment of veterinarians and 2003 commission examinations.        
	The order comes at a time when trial of nine more officials and 71 scheme beneficiaries started recently over the same issues.         
	The suspension of the two commission members, D.N. Sharma and Shiv Balak Chaudhary followed an elaborate procedure, as is required before removing people holding constitutional positions.         
	The state personnel department secretary Amir Subhani said D.N. Sharma and Shiv Balak Chaudhary had been suspended after a presidential reference was made to the Supreme Court.        
	Since they were holding constitutional posts, the governor sent a recommendation to the President of India for their removal in July 2007, he added. An inquiry into the commission scam was instituted in December 2005 after the commission test results were announced.        
	Two former commission chairpersons  Razia Tabassum and Ramsinhasan Singh  have already retired.         
	In all, nine commission officials, including five employees, have been chargesheeted. Besides, 71 beneficiaries have also been chargesheeted.         
	The additional director-general (vigilance) Neelmani told The Telegraph: The case has finally reached the trial stage after we filed three chargesheets within the past three months.         
	The ADG said the two chairpersons and as many members have been framed for irregularities in evaluation of answer sheets, recommending appointment of 165 veterinary doctors and in promotion matters of 184 Grade-III employees.         
	The chargesheets present strong evidence against the accused. We are looking forward to the speedy trial, he added.

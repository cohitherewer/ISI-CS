          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 6: Supporters and rivals of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi are now engaged in lobbying to solicit support in the run-up to the head count that the central leadership has decided to carry out on June 8 to decide on the BJP leadership logjam in Bihar.        
	Possibility of a status quo in Bihar the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls due within a year is getting thinner with the chasm widening between the rebels and Modi-supporters every day.        
	It became evident when the deputy chief minister and rebels, including health minister Nandkishore Yadav, dropped ministers Chandramohan Rai and Janardan Singh Segriwal, landed at the Patna airport from the same flight. The non-Modi coterie huddled in a group and parted ways with the deputy CM clearing showing that they were in no mood for any sort of rapprochement.         
	On the other hand, Sushil Kumar Modi has adopted a different strategy. Sources close to him revealed that he has formed a group of his core supporters, including MLA Ramadhar Singh and Rajendra Gupta, to persuade leaders against insisting on extreme steps.         
	Having failed to strike a rapprochement between the factions, the BJP leadership has formed a committee headed by president Rajnath Singh, with Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitely, to decide on the logjam in Bihar.         
	The committee has called all 69 legislators to seek their opinion.

	Bhubaneswar, April 11: Several parts of the state today reeled from the seasons first heat wave conditions even as the government geared up to combat the impending drinking water crisis likely to escalate in the next few months.        
	People preferred staying indoors as the mercury hovered around 40C-mark in the coastal districts.        
	Meteorology centre director S.C. Sahoo said heat wave conditions prevail when the temperature rises five degrees above normal and reaches a minimum of 40C.         
	In its first precautionary statement this summer, the Met department today issued a local warning saying that the heat wave condition would prevail in the next 48 hours.        
	While Bhubaneswar recorded the highest day temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius, neighbouring Cuttack was not far behind where the mercury touched the 40C-mark with high level of humidity making life unbearable.        
	Although schools have been running morning sessions since April 1, school children had to face the scorching heat while returning home today. Office-goers had to cover their heads and faces with wet towels or hankies to protect themselves from the sweltering heat.         
	At the secretariat, chief minister Naveen Patnaik directed senior officials to ensure that tubewells were installed in all areas, primary schools and tribal hostels.         
	It was also decided to provide piped water in the areas  Nuapada and Nayagarh districts  where there was a high fluoride and iron content in groundwater.         
	A target was set to set up 2,000 rural piped water supply projects during the current year as against the previous years 1,010.         
	Similarly, 12,800 tube wells would be installed across the state this year as against last years 7,400.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Policemen escort Hussain (face covered) to a court in Jaipur on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                   
	Lucknow, Aug. 27: Uttar Pradesh police are claiming that the arrested main suspect in the Jaipur blasts may have used his skills as a computer professional to send the emails that reached media houses after the Pink City explosions and before the Ahmedabad bombings.        
	Additional director-general Brij Lal said the police were also probing Shahbaz Hussains role in the court blasts that rocked the state last November.        
	Sleuths of the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) said Shahbaz  also known as Shanu  used to run two business centres, one of them a computer centre called Synergy Computer Training Institute at Ameenabads Maulaviganj area.        
	The institute, police sources said, also provided broadband Internet services.        
	The police said the second centre, Zyna Career Consultants, was a placement agency that sent labourers to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.        
	ATS sources said it was Shahbazs email address  shahbaz_hindiyahoo.com  that gave them the first clues to his operations.        
	A senior police officer who received a number of clues from Jaipur police now interrogating the 25-year-old former chief of banned student outfit Simi said a common word in all the email IDs from where the mails were sent was hindi.        
	The ID used to send the mail after last years court blasts was guru_alhindiyahoo.co.uk, while that used to send mails after the May 13 Jaipur explosions was guru_alhindijaipuryahoo.co.uk.        
	In both cases, the messages were signed by a person who introduced himself as Guru al-Hindi.        
	Police sources said the word Guru probably referred to the person heading the Internet communications network behind the explosions rather than to the spiritual head of any organisation.        
	The police also said Ali Mohammad  a student of American citizen Kenneth Haywood whose email ID was hacked to send a terror mail just before the Ahmedabad blasts  might be an associate of Shahbaz. Mohammad is also from Lucknow.        
	Like the November court blasts and the Jaipur explosions, the July 26 Ahmedabad bombings were also followed by an email. But while one signature was that of al-Hindi, a second operative signed as al-Arbi.              
	The email ID from where the mail was sent has been identified as alarbi_gujaratyahoo.com.        
	 Yet another email, sent recently to protest the arrest of Mufti Abu Basheer, the alleged mastermind of the Ahmedabad blasts, was also sent from a yahoo ID.        
	A search in Shahbazs computer centre and seizure of software materials show that he is one of the new-generation software professionals who joined jihad, said a senior ATS official.        
	ATS sources said Shahbaz  a science graduate who once worked as a sub-editor in an English-language magazine, Islamic Movement, and whom his neighbours described as a decent businessman  visited Jaipur several times.        
	The sources said Shahbazs double life as a terror operative and a successful businessman came under the scanner when Safdar Nagori, the jailed former Simi general secretary, named him during interrogation.        
	Nagori had told the police that a man called Shanu was heading the groups communications cell and acting as its chief undercover organiser.        
	Later, Mufti Basheer had also mentioned Shahbazs name to Ahmedabad police.

	June 12: The Congress yesterday invoked the memory of Rajesh Pilot, the tallest Gujjar leader it has had, perhaps hoping that would compensate for the partys inability to take a stand on the communitys demand for ST status.        
	After 21 days of protest, the Gujjars have agreed to hold talks with Rajasthans Vasundhara Raje government tomorrow after 25 Gujjar women, arrested during the agitation, were granted bail.        
	While Raje appears determined not to give in to Gujjar pressure, the Congress has not revealed its mind on the demand that has polarised Rajasthan along caste lines.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday released a postage stamp to mark Pilots eighth death anniversary. Congress president Sonia Gandhi was the chief guest. Pilot, who was a Rajasthan MP, was so popular in his community that at the height of militancy, he could travel without security in Kashmir because of the large Gujjar presence there.

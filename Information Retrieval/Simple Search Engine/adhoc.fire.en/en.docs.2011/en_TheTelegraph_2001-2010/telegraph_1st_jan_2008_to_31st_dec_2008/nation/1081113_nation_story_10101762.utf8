	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 12: Culturally sensitive approaches are essential tools for development organisations concerned with promoting sexual and reproductive health, finds a report, State of World Population 2008, prepared by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).        
	Cultural sensitivity helps mitigate and overcome cultural resistance to couples and individuals using modern contraception, the report states. It prepares the way for empowering women in particular with control over their fertility.         
	In many cultures, patriarchal frameworks determine notions of masculinity and femininity as well as the meanings of sexuality, reproduction and rights. The result is that womans needs and rights are paid little attention. It is important to situate womans health within their social and cultural contexts and to develop culturally sensitive approaches, said sociologist and social activist Rita Ray at a ceremony to release the report here today.        
	Culturally sensitive approaches understand and work with a communitys view for example about what it signifies when a woman or a couple do not reproduce the effect of contraception on a womans ability to conceive or a mans view of what makes up his manhood. It notes that what culture and people understand by reproductive health and rights may vary, even within a community.         
	Millions of women still do not have control over spacing or limiting pregnancies nor access to effective contraception This is the result of ineffective health systems but there are also social and cultural factors involved, said Namita Panda, the state commission for women chairperson.        
	Cultural sensitivity is about being aware of these varied meanings and being prepared for the unexpected or example some men may work for gender equality against their apparent self interest and some women may support practices that apparently harm them. In societies where men traditionally control household finances, womens health expenses are often not a priority.

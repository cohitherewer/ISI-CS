The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress MPs join airport protest
                                                                                                               Congress MPs join airport protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 12: The Congress was not amused today when its Karnataka MPs joined an all-party delegation that met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to protest against the proposed closure of Bangalore airport after a new one opens this month.        
	Singh was to have inaugurated the new airport on March 30 but it is now uncertain whether he would go, a party source said.        
	The state Congress leadership signalled its displeasure through a statement by spokesperson Manish Tiwari. For the countrys progress, we need to give relief to farmers on one hand. But on the other, the basic infrastructure also has to be upgraded. Both should go hand in hand, he said.        
	A Karnataka MP said Congress colleagues had joined the save-the-old-airport mission because the party-backed Indian National Trade Union Congress (Intuc) was among the protesting unions. We couldnt be seen to let them down and allow the BJP and the Left to steal the limelight.         
	The MPs were told infrastructure development meant the old order will give way to the new. The old-versus-new issue was not intractable and Intuc members could have sorted it out with the government before striking. Whatever uncertainties and doubts exist, can be sorted across the table, Tiwari said.        
	A senior Karnataka Congress functionary said development could not be stalled but this would have to be understood first of all by the strikers, including those of our Intuc.        
	S.M. Krishna, who has just touched base in Bangalore after a long stint out of politics and is about to be packaged as the Congresss panacea to the states infrastructure ailments, panicked when he heard of the strike. Sources said he told the leaders in Delhi they couldnt afford to have a mess on their hands before the Assembly election.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 15: Saroj Kumar Beheras name may mean little to the people since his plea went unheard. But his act was a conscious protest of a victim of alleged prejudiced approach of the law. The man accused in a criminal case made several supplications over the past year expressing anguish over the charges framed by the police against him.        
	On September 11, he set himself on fire outside the courtroom to protest against prolonged mental torture for false charges, when the Cuttack first class judicial magistrate, Pranati Patnaik, was presiding the trial proceedings inside.        
	Horrified onlookers, mostly advocates, used their coats to beat out the flames engulfing Sarojs body, while instantly later he ventilated his grievances to reporters despite his burns.        
	Led away by the police, the 31-year-old son of Sridhar Behera of Alisha Bazaar died three days later at SCB Medical College Hospital yesterday from his injuries.         
	Apparently embarrassed by Sarojs self-immolation, the police converted the case of attempt to suicide into a case of abetment saying nothing other than that he had apparently lost hope of acquittal and was petrified over conviction and consequent imprisonment.        
	The police had framed charges against Saroj under Sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 294 (obscene acts and songs), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. Conviction could have led to a two to three-year imprisonment.        
	The case was registered in May last year on the basis of an FIR lodged by Swapna Maharana of Alisha Bazaar area accusing him of harassing her college-going daughter, said K.R. Swamy, the inspector in charge of Lalbag police station.        
	But some lawyers who were present outside the courtroom where Saroj set himself on fire said: His plea of innocence may have gone unheard and remained largely unknown, but his act was apparently a conscious effort to protest against the prejudiced approach of law.

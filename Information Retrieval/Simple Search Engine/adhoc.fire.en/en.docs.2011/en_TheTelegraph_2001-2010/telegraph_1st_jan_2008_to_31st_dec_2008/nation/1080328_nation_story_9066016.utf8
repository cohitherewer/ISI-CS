          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 27: St. Stephens College has said it will not compromise its autonomy under pressure from Delhi University, indicating readiness to take on its parent varsity over the selection of a new principal.        
	The Supreme Council of the college today issued a statement saying it would protect the minority character of St. Stephens at any cost. The statement asked all concerned to draw a distinction between regulation and interference.        
	Delhi University has been expressing concerns about the criteria laid down by the council for the selection of principal after Reverend Valson Thampu ended a controversial 10-month tenure earlier this month.        
	The university had demanded that the college withdraw an advertisement for principal that set criteria it deemed were in violation of UGC guidelines.        
	St. Stephens withdrew the advertisement, only to replace it with another notice that retained some of the criteria the university had opposed.        
	The college, in its new advertisement, has said candidates between 50 and 60 years in age would be preferred for the post of principal. The word preferred is the only difference from the earlier advertisement which categorically barred those over 60 or under 50 from applying. Since the age for retirement is 65, and UGC guidelines do not stipulate any lower age cut-off, Delhi University had asked the college to remove the criterion.        
	The college has also repeated the criterion that applicants must be members of the Church of North India  the parent body of St. Stephens  or one of its affiliate organisations.        
	The university had suggested that the college change the advertisement to say that applicants from the CNI would be preferred, keeping the door open for exceptionally qualified applicants who do not belong to the church.         
	Todays statement came as the university was drawing up a list of objections to the new advertisement, sources said.        
	The Supreme Court has repeatedly and emphatically affirmed that the right to appoint the head of an institution, who meets minimum eligibility criteria, is a crucial aspect of the right to administer guaranteed under Article 30(1) of the Indian Constitution, the St. Stephens statement said.        
	No law-abiding individual, agency or authority would want to interfere with this right. Such interferences, if any, are unlawful and unwelcome, it added.        
	St. Stephens council spokesperson Sunil Mathews said the panel wanted to dispel concerns raised within the Christian community that the college was moving away from its commitments towards the community. The council wants to assure everyone that irrespective of who comes as principal, the Christian character of the college will not change, he said.

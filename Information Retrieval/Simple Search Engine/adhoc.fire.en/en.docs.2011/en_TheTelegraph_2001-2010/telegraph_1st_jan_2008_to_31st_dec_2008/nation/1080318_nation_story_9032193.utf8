	New Delhi, March 17: The ruling alliance and the Left resumed their battle of nerves over the nuclear deal today with the joint panel, which met after four months, buying time till April.        
	The panel decided that the April meeting would start the real negotiations on the India-specific safeguards in the text agreed between Delhi and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sources said.        
	Left leaders will hand in a questionnaire based on their understanding of whether the India-IAEA treaty matches their demands.        
	The government briefed us about the outcome of the safeguards negotiations. We will have a detailed discussion with them later, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat told The Telegraph.        
	The Left representatives, however, were not shown the actual document which, government sources said, runs to 25 pages and is replete with technical details and incomprehensible references to clauses and sections.        
	They admitted that no one in the government was in a position yet to clarify doubts if such clarification was sought.        
	Also, they said, India and the atomic watchdog had agreed to keep the document confidential till a mutually agreed date, perhaps until shortly before it is sent to the member nations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).        
	When the panel met this evening at the residence of foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, the Left representatives, who included Karat and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, were given a four-page summary which they had to return. The summary outlined the main features of the agreed text.        
	Congress sources said both sides were playing for time. The governments immediate concern was to get the Finance Bill passed by May, so a meeting in mid-April suited it fine.        
	Were not going to sacrifice the government for the deal, a cabinet minister said.        
	Left sources claimed success in derailing the deal by prolonging the timetable. They said the government had assured the Left that the deadlines were not sacrosanct and could be renegotiated.        
	The government, which had till last week maintained that the text had been frozen, is now understood to have said that if the Left wants amendments, it would approach the IAEA and see if they could be included.        
	The Congresss reaction to the meeting was mixed. One committee representative sounded gung-ho about the deal.        
	He said if the IAEA wanted to keep the document under wraps, it was only to ensure that Israel and Pakistan did not kick up a storm for being denied a sweet-heart deal of this kind.        
	These two countries, like India, possess nuclear weapons but have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).        
	Asked why it was a sweet-heart deal, the official said the atomic agency had addressed Indias three main concerns: maintenance of fuel supply, possession of strategic reserves of nuclear fuel, and a corrective mechanism in case supply was disrupted.        
	He hinted that in case America stopped supplying nuclear fuel, the treaty would ensure that another country like Russia, France or China would bail India out.        
	Another representative wondered if the deal would go through during the current governments tenure.        
	How can you go to the NSG without first going to the IAEA board of governors? he asked.        
	And that can happen, he added, only if and when the Left is fully satisfied. Its a long haul.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Uma the rebel growls again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Uma the rebel growls again
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Uma: No change                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: Uma Bharti seems to be an incorrigible rebel.        
	The BJP may be getting ready to welcome its estranged daughter back as she might have mellowed, but the firebrand sanyasin retains all the virtues for which her party had thrown her out.        
	I cant change because what I have been is not artificial, Uma said today. I think the system is anti-poor and I will continue to fight for them. I feel there is no creamy layer among OBCs and Dalits and I want the government to move the Supreme Court for a review. I have said the BJPs government in Madhya Pradesh is corrupt, I cant withdraw that charge.        
	Uma made it clear her commitments were not negotiable. There is an orbit of my values and core beliefs and I wander in that. The BJP was once upon a time moving with me, now it has fallen behind. I cant walk in reverse gear to return to it.         
	Senior leaders, who admitted that a move was on to bring her back into the BJP, however, expect Uma to be more disciplined.         
	But Uma said she was planning to meet leaders from all parties to build a movement against the exclusion of the creamy layer from the quota.        
	Asked if she would meet BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, Uma shot back: I will not meet her because she had strongly opposed the OBC sub-quota. Only a woman from a backward community who has gone through the grind can understand the problem. Women who do politics of contact and networking cant.        
	Uma then turned her ire on the media, which, she said, were preoccupied with item girls like Rakhi Sawant and Mallika Sherawat.

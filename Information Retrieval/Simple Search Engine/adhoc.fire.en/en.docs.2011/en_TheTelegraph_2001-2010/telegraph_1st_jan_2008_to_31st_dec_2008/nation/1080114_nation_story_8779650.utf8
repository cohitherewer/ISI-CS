 in death

                 
	Jammu, Jan. 13: An 82-year-old man who chose Pakistan over India during the 1947 conflict had his last wish fulfilled when he was buried beside his parents graves in his ancestral village in Poonch.
    
	Two foreign ministries, Jammu and Kashmir High Court, Poonch district authorities and residents of Loran village came together to turn Gulam Mohmmad into a symbol of Indo-Pak friendship.
    
	It was the Poonch-Rawalkote friendship bus that the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir resident had taken last July 16 to visit Loran. He died there yesterday morning, sparking a debate whether the body should be sent back to Muhajir Colony in PoKs Palandhari.
    
	Mohmmad, who was 21 when he left his family behind to cross the Line of Control, had arrived in Poonch on a 15-day permit. He was granted a 10-day extension when he was admitted to hospital.
    
	After he improved and the 10 days passed, the authorities tried to deport him but the old man approached the high court. There was nobody in PoK to look after him, his writ petition said. I may be allowed to stay in my ancestral Loran village till my death. I may also get a burial here.
    
	The court stayed his deportation till the matter had been disposed of. After his death, the district authorities got in touch with the external affairs ministry, which gave the nod for burial after consulting Pakistani authorities.
    
	The administration, people and the court helped us fulfil his wish, nephew Shah Mohmmad said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, July 9: The mercury is rising in the heartland: sworn rivals Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati are tapping disgruntled MPs in each others parties and dangling carrots to win them over.        
	A day after the Left pulled out of the UPA, Samajwadi Party leaders have begun courting Bahujan Samaj Party fence-sitters with a vengeance amid reports that Mayavati had charmed some of their dissidents into opposing the nuclear deal.        
	Faizabad BSP legislator Mitrasen Yadav was the first target today, with a Samajwadi leader close to Mulayam calling him up thrice.        
	Instead of humiliation in that party (BSP), why dont you prepare to join us? Mitradev was apparently asked. But before that, vote for the nuclear deal.        
	Mitrasen has not been on the best of terms with Mayavati since she got his son, former minister Anandsen Yadav, arrested last month in connection with the murder of a woman law student.        
	He confirmed he had got feelers from the Samajwadi Party but refused to disclose which side he would vote for.        
	Another BSP legislator the Samajwadis are working on is Jaunpur MP Umakant Yadav. As in the case of Mitrasen, Mayavati had got him arrested late last year for allegedly trying to grab Dalits land.        
	Umakants brother Ramakant, who has been with the BSP, the Samajwadi Party and the BJP, yesterday visited him in jail and tried to coax him to vote for the deal and eventually switch over to Mulayams party.        
	Behenji does not honour leaders of our caste (Yadav), Ramakant is believed to have told his brother.        
	The Samajwadis also managed to convince Beni Verma, now an Independent but earlier with Mulayam, to vote for the deal. Last week, the BSP had tried to win him over.        
	I have decided to vote for the deal despite my bitter relations with Samajwadi Party leaders. I am convinced by the Congresss argument, he said over phone from New Delhi.        
	Verma is not on good terms with Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, who said today that seven BSP MPs had contacted him as they were fed up with their party leaderships constant demand for money.        
	Another MP the Samajwadis have been eyeing is Raj Babbar. But the actor, who quit the Samajwadi Party in 2006 after differences with Mulayam and Amar, appears to have been won over by Mayavati.        
	Yesterday, the Jan Morcha, of which Babbar is the convener, announced its merger with the BSP. Babbars aide and Morcha MLA Dharampal Singh has formally joined the BSP.         
	All this is to pave the way for Babbars entry into the BSP, now that he has no future in the Samajwadi Party or the Congress, a leader close to Babbar said.         
	BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra dismissed rumours that a few of his party MPs had been won over by the UPA. We are intact. There is no question of any bickering in our group.

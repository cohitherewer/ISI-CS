	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 17: The sankaracharya of Puri, Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, was given Z-category security today after he received a threat letter apparently from Maoists.        
	The 80-year-old monk, however, said that he did not feel insecure. I dont feel threatened. I am not afraid of death, he said here this afternoon. During my 17-year stint at Gobardhan Peetha, I received several letters, which I never took seriously, he said.        
	But neither the Centre nor the state government wants to take a chance, especially after the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati in Kandhamal on August 23. Prodded by the Union government, he was provided with Z-category security, which till date was enjoyed by the chief minister only.        
	Yesterday, the Gobardhan Peetha received a hand-written letter along with a 12-page leaflet with a postal mark of Phulbani, and suggesting that it was sent by the Naxalites. Those who create riot in the name of religion will face the same punishment as Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, reads the threat letter.        
	What is the proof that the letter was written by the Maoists? asked the sankaracharya, stating that it could have been written by anybody in the name of Maoists. The sankaracharya claimed that he was respected by even communist-ruled states, including Bengal. Had Mao been alive, he would have loved me, he said.        
	Stating that he has been working for the uplift of the underprivileged and campaigning against cow slaughter, protection of rivers and Ram Setu, Swami Nischalananda said all these activities would not anger the Maoists.        
	The monk returned to Puri today after touring Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh for one-and-a-half months. In his absence, his disciples had filed an FIR with Sea Beach police station in Puri yesterday.         
	The district police have stepped up security in and around the Gobardhan Peetha, said Puri superintendent of police Asit Panigrahi.

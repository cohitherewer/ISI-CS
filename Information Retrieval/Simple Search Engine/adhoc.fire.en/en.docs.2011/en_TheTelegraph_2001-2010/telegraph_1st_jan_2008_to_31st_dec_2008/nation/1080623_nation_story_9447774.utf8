The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Call for quotas in teacher training courses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Call for quotas in teacher training courses
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 22: Indias apex school policy maker has proposed OBC quotas in its teacher training courses under the controversial reservation law aimed at covering central higher education institutions.        
	The National Council for Educational Research and Training has asked the Centre that it be allowed 27 per cent OBC reservations in teacher training courses, human resource development ministry officials have said.        
	This the first time OBC quotas have been sought by a school education body in India, they said.        
	The NCERT admits 850 prospective teachers a year to the training courses it offers. The courses are widely rated as the best in the country for schoolteachers.        
	In a proposal submitted to the HRD ministry in May, the NCERT has argued that its teacher training courses are a part of Indias higher education and cannot be excluded from quotas, sources said.        
	The NCERT has also asked for a raise in retirement age for its staff from 62 to 65, as has been done in central higher education institutions.        
	We have submitted our proposal to the HRD ministry and are awaiting a response from them. We believe we have to implement the quotas, and for that we will need to raise the retirement age, NCERT director Krishna Kumar told The Telegraph.        
	Kumar met HRD minister Arjun Singh earlier this week to discuss the request, ministry sources said.        
	The OBC quota law  the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admissions) Act, 2007  requires institutes to also increase seats to ensure general category students do not suffer from reduced opportunities.        
	Anticipating that the existing teacher crunch would explode into a public embarrassment with the expansion in seats, the Centre had allowed higher education institutions to raise the age bar to 65.        
	Although the NCERT is not a higher education institution, council officials are pinning their hopes on a clause in the quota law that they say entitles them to reservation.        
	Section 2(d)(5) of the act includes an educational institution set up by the Central Government under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 as a central educational institution. The NCERT was set up under this act in 1961.        
	We should be allowed to reserve seats like higher education institutions, a senior NCERT official said.        
	But the proposal has yet to be cleared by the HRD ministry. Officials said they feared the request to implement OBC quotas might be a ruse to raise the retirement age.        
	Barely a few employees are involved in teacher training courses, the only higher education courses at the NCERT, a school education official said. But the retirement age will need to be raised across the board, for all employees of the NCERT.         
	The courses include degrees for a two-year BEd, a four-year BSc-cum-BEd, a one-year MEd and a one-year postgraduate diploma in counselling.

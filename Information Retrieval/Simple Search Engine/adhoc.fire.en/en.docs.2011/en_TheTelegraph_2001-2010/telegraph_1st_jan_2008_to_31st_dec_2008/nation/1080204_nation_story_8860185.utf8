	Ahmedabad, Feb. 3: Seven persons were crushed to death and nine injured when a four-storey hotel, which did not stop taking in guests even after the building had tilted, caved in this morning.
    
	More were feared trapped in the debris of Hotel Shakunt, near the Ahmedabad railway station.
    
	Fire brigade chief M.F. Dastoor, whose 200 officers are part of the rescue team that also includes 100 CRPF jawans, disaster-response personnel and volunteers, said chances of finding survivors were very bleak. 
    
	Many of the nine injured, including two women, pulled out of the debris of the 23-year-old structure are in a critical condition, officials said. Around 25 people were inside at the time of the collapse.
    
	The owner, Guarang Jani, blamed the owner of the adjoining hotel for the 8.30am collapse, saying Abdullah Seth, who runs Moti Hotel, had started digging the plot behind. Abdullah said he had permission from the civic authorities, but Ahmedabad municipal commissioner I.P. Gautam said complaints had been lodged against both.
    
	Hotel Shakunt, which was already undergoing repairs, had tilted a bit on January 31 as a result of the digging, prompting Bank of India, which had its office on the ground floor, to move out. 
    
	Jani should not have rented out rooms knowing the structure had been affected, Gautam said, adding the corporation had warned the hotel earlier against taking guests.

          OUR BUREAU                               
	June 2: The RSP has decided to pull out of the UPA-Left co-ordination committee, saying it was high time to withdraw support to the government.        
	 It also urged the other Left parties  the CPM, CPI and the Forward Bloc  to take a collective decision on this.         
	The RSP said this was the partys first salvo against the UPAs failures, particularly rising prices.         
	This is the first salvo. We are dissociating with the functioning of the government, which has become alienated from the people, RSP general secretary T.J. Chandrachoodan said after a two-day meeting of the partys central committee here.         
	We have come to a conclusion that providing support to the government is not conducive. We hope other Left parties would do a rethink on the support to the government, which is making the country a profit state and not a welfare state.         
	However, the partys member Abani Roy, a Rajya Sabha MP, will continue to be in the UPA-Left nuclear deal panel, Chandrachoodan said.        
	The RSP also lashed out at the CPM in Bengal. Kshiti Goswami, the states PWD minister, said his party would talk to like-minded outfits, including Naxalites and Maoists for a better Left Front in Bengal.         
	Biman Bose, the CPM Bengal secretary, said: It hardly matters (if the RSP quits the committee) when the committee remains ineffective, defunct and inoperative.

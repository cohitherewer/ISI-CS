The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | After docs, cops threaten strike
                                                                                                               After docs, cops threaten strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Aiming high    
	Cuttack, April 3: After the medicos and nurses, the states police inspectors have now threatened to go on a strike unless their demand for a 23 per cent hike in basic pay is met within a month.        
	The agitation would start from the first week of May if the government does not make a move till then, the members of Orissa Police Association (OPA) have decided.         
	The Orissa police currently have 550 inspectors, while more than 100 posts are vacant for years. We are asking for a basic pay at a par with that of assistant surgeons, said S.N. Sharma, the president of the state police panel.        
	Previously, police inspectors and assistant surgeons in Orissa use to get basic pay of Rs 6,500 till the government increased the doctors salary last month.         
	Now, the basic pay of Orissas assistant surgeons has shot up to Rs 8,000.        
	The onus now lies with the government to increase our pay to maintain a parity with assistant surgeons, as before, the panel president told The Telegraph today.        
	The panel had convened a meeting of its central executive committee in Cuttack following the hike in doctors salary last week.         
	The association has submitted a charter of demands to the government with a months ultimatum after that. Besides, the police association has also pressed for their long-neglected demand for an increase in the basic pay of sub-inspectors from Rs 5,000 to Rs 5,500.        
	Sub-inspectors in other states and the paramilitary forces enjoy a basic pay of Rs 5,500 after the last pay revision. Orissa police, however, have been an exception, Sharma rued.        
	Orissa police currently has around 1,600 sub-inspectors, while 900-odd posts are vacant.        
	The government has been saving a huge amount of money by keeping the posts vacant for years together and has also neglected our legitimate demands, members alleged.

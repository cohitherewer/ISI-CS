                                                                                                               NDA cries bias
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 29: The NDA has decided to launch an agitation against the Centre for discriminating against Opposition-ruled states.        
	Apart from raising the issue in the second phase of Parliaments budget session, the BJP-led coalition will highlight it at demonstrations in state capitals and a rally in Delhi.        
	This was decided at a meeting of NDA chief ministers at leader of Opposition L.K. Advanis residence today.        
	They identified two other issues  rising prices of essential commodities and the budget fraud on farmers  that will share space with the bias cry. For the Delhi rally, the NDA will mobilise farmers who find themselves out of the Centres loan-waiver ambit.        
	Briefing reporters on the meeting, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said all chief ministers gave specific figures to vindicate their charge of discrimination by the Centre. Inadequate assistance for natural calamities, reduction of quota for the public distribution scheme, apathy towards national highways and the flawed forest rights act and mineral policy were the major complaints.         
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and his Orissa counterpart, Naveen Patnaik, alleged that the promised amounts from the Prime Ministers relief fund had not been disbursed. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar complained that the Centres attitude in times of crisis bordered on non-co-operation.         
	Todays was the first meeting of its kind chaired by Advani since being declared the NDAs shadow Prime Minister. BJP leaders view this as an effort to provide greater legitimacy to Advanis leadership and set the agenda before the next general election.         
	The BJP, the leaders said, is also keen to send out the message that it is serious about good governance and there is more to its politics than temples and minority bashing.

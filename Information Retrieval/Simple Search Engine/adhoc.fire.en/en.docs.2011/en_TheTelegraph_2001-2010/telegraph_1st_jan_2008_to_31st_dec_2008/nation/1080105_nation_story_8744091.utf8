          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 4: Orissa High Court has directed judicial officers of subordinate courts to spread awareness on plea-bargaining in jails and make way for undertrials to benefit from alternative.        
	The process, which was introduced in jurisprudence in July 2006, seeks to lessen sentence if the accused agrees to compensate the victim. Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty issued the order, while hearing a PIL filed by Maitree Sansad, a social organisation, which alleged human rights violation in Orissa jails.         
	The government plans to start the drive in six jails in Cuttack (Choudwar), Berhampur, Bhubaneswar, Baripada, Sambalpur and Rourkela. Under the programme video conferencing rooms would be set up in all district courts to facilitate hearings.

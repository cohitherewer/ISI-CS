          OUR BUREAU                                      
	Mumbai, Oct. 24: Investors might have been praying today for a circuit-breaker that would have snapped trading for a while to allow passions and fears to cool.        
	But that wasnt to be because of an elaborate mechanism that set the triggers too high for them to kick in.        
	The system has three trigger points  volatility levels of 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent.        
	The circuit-breakers can be triggered by the movements of either the sensex or the Nifty and are designed to bring about a co-ordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets across the country.        
	But theres a catch here: the calculation is based on the closing value of the sensex or the Nifty on the last day of the previous quarter: in this case, September 30. On that day, the sensex had closed at 12860.43.        
	Under the system, if the index falls or rises by 10 per cent before 1pm, the markets halt trading for one hour. If it falls by 10 per cent between 1pm and 2.30pm, the market is halted for half an hour. After 2.30pm, the market will continue to trade even if it falls by 10 per cent.        
	Under the 15 per cent trigger, the market will halt for two hours if the fall occurs before 1pm. It will stop trading for one hour if the indices move by that much between 1pm and 2pm. After 2pm, the market will cease trading if the indices fall or rise by 15 per cent. In the case of 20 per cent volatility, trading will cease immediately.        
	Based on the sensex calculations, the 10 per cent trigger would have been activated if the index had moved either way by 1275 points; the 15 per cent trigger, if it oscillated by 1925 points and the 20 per cent trigger at 2575 points.        
	The sensex had fallen by only 6 per cent at 8955 just after noon  and it didnt activate the trigger. Since the sensex fell by almost 11 per cent only after 2.30pm, trading wasnt halted  and there was no respite from the relentless pounding on the markets.

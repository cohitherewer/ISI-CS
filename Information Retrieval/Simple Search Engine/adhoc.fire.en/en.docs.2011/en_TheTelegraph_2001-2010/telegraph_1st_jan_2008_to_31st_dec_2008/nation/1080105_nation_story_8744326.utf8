The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath snubs Raje
                                                                                                            Rajnath snubs Raje

	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje today met BJP chief Rajnath Singh over lunch to express reservations over Om Mathurs appointment as state unit head.        
	Raje was miffed that her close aide Mahesh Sharma had to make way for Mathur, a BJP general secretary so far in charge of Gujarat, in spite of stiff resistance from her.        
	Party sources said Rajnath appeared to have talked Raje into accepting the appointment and she did not talk of resignation.        
	Mathur will now take over at a programme, possibly on Monday, to be attended by Raje. The anointment was due yesterday but was put off as Mathur wanted the problem resolved amicably. He was also believed to be under pressure from some senior leaders in Delhi who were unhappy with his appointment.        
	Rajasthan watchers said the row over Mathur was symptomatic of the larger power struggle within the BJP as well as the growing indiscipline as chief ministers were coming out in defiance of the central leadership.        
	Raje has been facing open rebellion from senior state leaders who have visited Delhi many times to lobby for her ouster. The central leadership, which wants her to continue, decided to change the state party chief as a compromise formula. But Raje saw this as a threat because Mathur has the backing of the RSS.        
	Sources said L.K. Advani advised Rajnath not to go for a person who did not have Rajes backing. Veteran leader Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, too, conveyed his displeasure.        
	Emboldened by this support, Raje dug in her heels to stall Mathurs appointment. But Rajnath made it clear to her that running the party was his responsibility.

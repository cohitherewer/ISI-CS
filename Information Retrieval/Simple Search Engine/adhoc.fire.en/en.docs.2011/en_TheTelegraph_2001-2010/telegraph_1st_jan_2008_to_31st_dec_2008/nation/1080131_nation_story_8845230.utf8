     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Mayavati
                 
	Lucknow, Jan. 30: Chief minister Mayavati today recommended a CBI probe into the allegedly anti-Muslim CD the BJP had released on the eve of the Uttar Pradesh elections last April.
    
	The Bahujan Samaj Party chief told reporters the sensitivity of the matter and the possibility of involvement of many senior BJP leaders had influenced her governments decision.
    
	The move, late in the day, came after state police had readied a chargesheet against several BJP leaders, including national chief Rajnath Singh and Lalji Tandon, who had released the controversial disc aimed at polarising voters.
    
	But what rankled BJP leaders was that the chargesheet had been leaked to the media. 
    
	BJP sources alleged it was a well-orchestrated move by the BSP regime to humiliate their leaders in the run-up to the 2009 general elections.
    
	She is indulging in politics of hate. She thinks all Opposition leaders are epitomes of evil. If a chargesheet is filed against Rajnath Singh, we will hit the streets and fight this politics of vendetta, said Om Prakash Singh, the leader of the Opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.
    
	BSP insiders said Mayavati was eyeing at least 35 MPs from the state in the 2009 elections. They said her message to party workers was they must work hard to ensure that the BSP won a majority of the seats in Uttar Pradesh.
    
	Yesterday, at Jhansi, she had railed at the Congress for trying to make inroads into her Dalit vote-bank.
    
	Lucknow SSP Akhil Kumar said the police had readied the chargesheet. And, yes, he confirmed, it contains Rajnath Singhs name.
    
	But he said he didnt know anything about a leak.
    
	BJP leaders claimed the police were being used by their political masters to malign Rajnath, although the party had clarified that the person whose name figured in connection with the CD was Rajnath Surya, and not Rajnath Singh.
    
	It is surprising that the police failed to detect this mistaken identity, said state BJP chief Ramapathi Ram Tripathi.
    
	A BSP leader, however, maintained that the ruling party had nothing to do with the chargesheet. The FIR was lodged by the Election Commission, not by the BSP, he said.
    
	Police sources said the officers who probed the CD titled UP Victimised  which reportedly contained scenes of the Babri mosques demolition and the Godhra violence and highlighted the BJPs anti-minority stance  had found evidence against Rajnath Singh and the other leaders for trying to spread hatred between communities.
    
	Besides Rajnath Singh and Tandon, some of the other leaders named in the chargesheet include Choudhury Virendra Singh, Alpana Talwar, Pravesh Gujjar, Lal Bahadur, Udit, Lokesh, Sunita and K.C. Asthana.

	Gaya, Feb. 20: A statement made by Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam has made it clear that the PMs journey was as much about his roots, as it was about obtaining cheap labour.        
	Addressing the media at Gaya airport shortly before his departure in the evening, the PM said Mauritius, making rapid strides in the field of economic development, was witnessing a labour shortage  a gap that Bihar would find easy to fill.         
	When a journalist, from Mauritius, wondered why people from Bihar were shying away from his country when workers from other parts of India were thronging it, Nitish Kumar assured things would improve, since a new chapter has been added.         
	During his address, chief minister announced that Seosagar Ramgoolams birthday (on September 18) would be celebrated as a state function. Seosagar is the former Mauritius Prime Minister and Navinchandras father  originally from Bihar.        
	Nitish added that a Mauritius cultural centre would be developed in Patna, which would promote cultural exchange between the two places and would serve as a tracking station to help migrants find their Bihar roots.

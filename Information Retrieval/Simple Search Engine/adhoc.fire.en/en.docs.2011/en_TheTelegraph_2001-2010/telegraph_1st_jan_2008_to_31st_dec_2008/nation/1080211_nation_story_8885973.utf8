  - Farmers face economic loss          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          A file picture of a cockfight                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: A unique species of chicken bred by tribals in Mayurbhanj for cockfights might perish with the governments decision to cull chickens in Orissas districts that border Bengal.         
	The total number of the (fighter) breed of chicken is approximately 12,000, including 10,000 cocks used in the fights, explained officer in charge of Veterinary Officers Training Institute Ramakanta Mohapatra quoting a 2004-2005 survey.         
	While the origin of the breed is uncertain, the species is believed to be indigenous to Mayurbhanj. The most coveted breed is Hansli found in the Katipada block.        
	The fighter birds are different from ordinary ones. Its body length varies from 71cm-74cm (males) and 48cm-57cm (females), which is longer than the standard. The height of the males is 61cm-75cm and 45cm-63cm in females - again, taller. The spur is well developed and both male and female birds are lighter than ordinary ones.        
	Usually the slimmer and taller ones are considered as good fighters, whereas the bad fighters are heavier and with more feathers, explained Mohapatra. Red, flower-like circular spots (of 0.5cm diameter) on the elbow joints also distinguish the fighters.        
	Usually one cock is saved for every three to four hens. Adult males are sold between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000. Owners giving it away (for culling) at Rs 40 a bird, experts believe, will be a tremendous loss for the farmers.         
	The economic loss apart, the germplasm created over thousands of years will be lost if the birds are culled, rued Pratap Jena, a researcher at the Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology here.        
	The chickens are allowed to scavenge for their food in the backyard - to build up that fighting spirit.        
	Cockfights remain an entertainment for the village people and indigenous varieties - Hansli, Gujuri and Dumasil - are a familys biggest possession. They are so serious about the birds purity that no local or exotic germplasm have been introduced, Mohapatra added.        
	The number of cocks a family possesses usually serves as a yardstick for its power and affluence. While not all fights are to the death, many a times the cocks do die. The two teams keep a close eye on their birds. If one of the fighters is noticed to be getting weaker, it is taken off the fight, given water and fanned. Then the fight resumes. The owner of the winning bird gets to take the losing one home - unfortunately to consume it.         
	Betting goes on by signals. Techniques of the game are passed from one generation to generation, said A.C. Sahoo, the director at the Academy of Tribal Dialects and Culture.

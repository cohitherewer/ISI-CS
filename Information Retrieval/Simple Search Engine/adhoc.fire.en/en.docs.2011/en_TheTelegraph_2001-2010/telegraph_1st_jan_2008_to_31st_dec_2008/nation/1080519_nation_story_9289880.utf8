          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           An election poster of Shetty                                  
	Mangalore, May 18: Unlike his rivals, Yadav Shetty has no fancy cars or helicopters to help him campaign for the Karnataka Assembly elections. He takes the bus to reach the centre of town, and then walks to meet voters.         
	In an election of crorepati politicians, Yadav and his Rs 500 bank balance stand out.         
	I dont think of my lack of funds as a disadvantage. People know me, and today, voters are conscious enough to not just vote for a candidate who offers them money, Shetty tells The Telegraph on a mobile phone borrowed from a friend for the duration of the elections. He does not possess a mobile phone of his own.         
	The 42-year-old grassroots worker of the CPM contested from the Mangalore constituency. The city of Mangalore has two other constituencies  Mangalore North and Mangalore South.         
	Yashwant Maroli, an advocate, contested for the CPM from Mangalore South.         
	Shetty competed in the second phase of the Karnataka elections where the average declared assets of all candidates was Rs 2.42 crore.         
	The Congress fielded 64 candidates  66 seats went to polls in the second phase on Friday  with average declared assets of Rs 7.35 crore per candidate. BJP candidates in this phase have on an average assets of Rs 3.78 crore, while the figure drops to Rs 1.28 crore for Janata Dal (Secular) candidates.         
	The first phase of polls on May 10 also saw wealthy candidates in the fray  13 of them, across the major parties, declared assets over Rs 30 crore.         
	But it is the second phase which has the richest candidates in Karnataka.         
	Mining magnates from Bellary and Davangere districts have the highest declared assets.         
	Candidates from Dakshin Kannada district  in which Mangalore falls  are not too far behind, though. J. Krishna Palemar, the BJP candidate from Mangalore North, has declared assets worth Rs 27.57 crore.         
	But Shetty says he is unperturbed. People respect me for my sincerity, and I am counting on that to win, says the party full-timer, who earns Rs 2,000 a month.         
	Shetty has two school-going children, and his wife teaches  her income supports the family, he says.

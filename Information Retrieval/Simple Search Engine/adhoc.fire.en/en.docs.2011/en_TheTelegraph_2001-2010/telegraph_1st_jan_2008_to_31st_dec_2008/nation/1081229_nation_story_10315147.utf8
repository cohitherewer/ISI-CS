          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 28: The BJP will demand seat readjustment with its ally BJD for the coming general elections in view of the redrawing of boundary of Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies.         
	A decision to this effect was taken at a party core committee meeting that concluded yesterday. The proceedings of the two-day meeting indicated that the BJP had begun its groundwork for the coming elections.         
	Talking to The Telegraph today, BJP state unit president Suresh Pujari said the party felt the necessity for a change in seat adjustment in view of the redrawing of boundaries of Lok Sabha constituencies by the Delimitation Commission.         
	The commission has redrawn boundaries of as many as 141 Assembly constituencies and 13 Lok Sabha constituencies.         
	Since 1998, BJD and BJP have shared seats on the basis of a 12:9 formula. The same formula may be expected to continue, Pujari said. Former BJP president Venkaiah Naidu would lead the negotiation with BJD for seat adjustment and is scheduled to arrive in the state capital on January 6.         
	Prior to his visit, the BJP state leaders are expected to prepare a list of constituencies where candidates stand a fair chance of winning.         
	However, dominant partner BJD, upbeat over its spectacular victory in the recent elections in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation and civic bodies, may not be content either with the old formula of 12:9 and may demand for more seats themselves.

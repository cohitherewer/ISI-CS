          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sonapur (Kamrup Metro), Feb. 24: A dozen people died and an unconfirmed number went missing when a speeding Guwahati-bound bus hit the concrete railing of a bridge and plunged into a pond 40km short of its destination around 4.30 this morning.        
	The bus had begun its journey last night at Silapathar in Assams Dhemaji district with 11 people on board. It picked up more passengers on the way.        
	Divers from the 128 Battalion of the BSFs National Disaster Response Force fished out the bodies and rescued two of the injured by evening. They said there were no more bodies in the pond. But the family of one of the passengers, Uttam Jain, insisted his body was still in the pond.        
	Seven of the dead have been identified by relatives. One of them was Tai, a postgraduate student of Guwahatis Cotton College. The name of a second student who died  Pradip Konwar of City College  was not on the list of passengers because he had boarded the bus later.

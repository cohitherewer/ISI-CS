	Pak cement for Games projects    
	Delhi needs Pakistani cement for its Games foundation.    
	The state government, racing to complete projects for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, is considering buying cement from across the border to cope with rising construction costs and supply disruptions from protest-hit Rajasthan.    
	We have written to the Centre to permit us to import cement from Pakistan to complete projects associated with the Games. Prices of the material available here have risen, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said last week. The approval has not come in so far.    
	Building companies say Pakistani cement is of a quality similar to the type being used in the projects in Delhi.    
	The government feels it will not be able to complete the projects on time unless alternate arrangements are made. The state has been criticised by the Centre for the delay in finishing Games projects.     
	Flyovers, stadiums and low-cost houses are facing the squeeze from soaring cement and steel prices. Officials are preparing a report on the increase over the initial estimates. (PTI)        
	From tarmac to the tube     
	Touchdown in Bangalore promises to get more exciting in a few years  with a hop into the tube from the tarmac.    
	The Karnataka government last week approved a high-speed rail link between the city and Bengaluru International Airport in a decision that could change the way people from the city travel to or from the new hub.    
	The Rs 3,600-crore project was cleared by the state cabinet to make the commute to the airport at Devanahally, built on the citys fringes, as smooth as possible.    
	The tube will cover the 33km stretch in 25 minutes, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said after the meeting where the project was cleared.    
	It is also proposed to have check-in counters on Cubbon Road, which is in the heart of the city, he added.    
	After showers, dry-tap scare    
	Weeks ago, Mumbai was sinking. Now, it might not have enough water.    
	The chief of the citys civic body recently warned that the dry spell, which has come as a relief to many rain-roiled Mumbaikars, could leave the taps dry if it persisted.    
	If the dry spell continues for another 10-15 days, it will be a cause of worry and we may have to think of water cuts, said municipal commissioner Jairaj Phatak.    
	He promised there would be no immediate disruptions, saying the lakes that feed the city have enough to supply water for 60 days. But the lack of rain in the past week had left the lakes less full than they should be.    
	According to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the water level has fallen from 0.02 meters to 0.21 metres.     
	Citing Modak Sagar, the report said the water level of this lake stood at 147.59 metres last week compared with last years 148.12 metres same time last year.     
	The adequate level is around 163.12 metres.        
	Hoax alarms    
	Hoax calls have kept the Metro on the edge since last week.    
	On Monday, an 8pm call was made to blow up a central Delhi station. Officials at the Chawri Bazaar station said this was the second call in three days and the fifth in a month.     
	Bomb disposal teams and dog squads were rushed for searches but nothing was found.     
	The last hoax was on Friday, when the call, also about an impending explosion, was made in the afternoon.    
	MUMBAI: This Wednesday, hear the soulful strains of Pandit Dina Nath Mishra and Urmila Srivastava at Megh Malhar, a series of concerts organised on monsoon ragas. The show begins on 6.30pm at Nehru Centre, Worli. You can call the auditorium at 24964680 for details.

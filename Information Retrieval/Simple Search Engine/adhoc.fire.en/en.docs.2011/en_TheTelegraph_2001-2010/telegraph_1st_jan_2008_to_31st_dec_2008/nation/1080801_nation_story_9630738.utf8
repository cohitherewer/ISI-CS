	Jaipur, July 31: Visitors to Rajasthan may find it hard to go to bed early.        
	Tomorrow, the state inaugurates Jaipur By Nite, a three-night festival to showcase the citys brightly lit forts and bountiful bazaars, with an emphasis on weekend and corporate tourism.        
	The campaign follows a dip in tourists numbers after the May 13 blasts in Jaipur and the prolonged Gujjar agitation. The tourism department has tied up with business chambers like the CII and Ficci, travel bodies, hotels and airlines to promote Rajasthan as a safe destination.         
	One of the events aims is to lure tourists away from beach-lined Goa and Kerala during the monsoon.         
	The purpose is to target industrialists through the CII and Ficci, said R.V.S. Mandawa, convener of the tourism panel in the CIIs state unit.        
	Special rebates are being offered in hotels coinciding with festival period. Jet Airways is handing out discounts to Jaipur during the phase.        
	Apurv Kumar, chairman of the CIIs state council, said: We are receiving enquiries from Spain, Brazil and Italy with many of their sales teams confirming participation. The Spanish ambassador is expected.        
	Rajasthan, with its hot weather and scanty rainfall as handicaps, has lagged Goa and Kerala in getting off-season tourists. The numbers to the desert state had doubled from 1.21 crore to over 2.5 crore between 2003 and 2005, but inflow has been down to a trickle in summer. So, the emphasis is on tourism by pleasant nights.              
	The event will feature cultural evenings at the City Palace, Kesar Kyari and Amer Fort, with live music, fashion shows, sound and light programmes, ethnic shopping, drinks and sumptuous cuisine. Foreign visitors may fancy rides on tongas and rickshaws at the fort.        
	The main bazaars will be open till late, and a heritage walk in city alleys will introduce visitors to the delights of kachoris, lassi, bhujiya, paranthas and other Rajasthani delicacies.        
	A fashion show will feature top models in attires made by rural weavers.

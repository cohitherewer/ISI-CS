  - ODI Tickets to be sold on nov 23          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Barabati Stadium                                        
	Cuttack, Nov. 20: Excitement has reached a fever pitch in Cuttack, with fans waiting for the November 26 India-England ODI at Barabati with bated breath.         
	The city has, in the past, hosted 13 ODIs, the last being between India and West Indies on January 24, 2007. The host team won. The stadiums capacity has since then been increased to 34,000.         
	However, only 45 per cent of those seats would be available for sale, a fact that has irked local residents.        
	Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) secretary Asirbad Behera, however, defended his stand and said: We have increased the number of tickets to 14,455, this year, even after reserving 8,395 tickets for affiliated units, members, BCCI sponsors and state associations.         
	The tickets would be available on November 23.        
	We expect a big rush so an individual would be restricted to a maximum of two tickets, Behera said. Besides, closed circuit cameras will be installed at the three counters to trace the black marketers, he added. Personnel from the Cantonment police station will monitor the cameras.         
	The OCA would also issue 8,350 complimentary passes and another 2,450 duty passes of different categories. Sources said OCA had earmarked a corporate box with 100 seats for Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys.        
	Tickets have been priced at Rs 4,000, Rs 3,000, Rs 1,500, Rs 500, Rs 400 and Rs 200 (players and students concession). Tickets going for Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 for the day-night match were too costly, feel some affiliated unit members.

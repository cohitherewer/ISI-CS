	Hyderabad, Aug. 9: Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and roof collapses across Andhra Pradesh, killing at least 26 people in the last 24 hours.

	As the swelling floodwaters breached the embankment of the Musi river on the outskirts of Hyderabad, two children were swept away. A mother and daughter were killed in Filmnagar area.        
	The Met department has forecast heavy rain over the next two days. Since last night, Hyderabad recorded 13.6cm rain, with the old Begumpet airport area being the worst hit.        
	Long-distance trains, including some bound for Calcutta, were disrupted on the Vijayawada division after tracks went under water near Khammam and Warangal.         
	Many housing colonies were inundated, jogging memories of the August 2002 flash floods that killed 14 persons.        
	Standing crops over lakhs of acres in Khammam, Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar, Krishna, Guntur and Rangareddy districts were affected. Several villages in these districts went under water as irrigation tanks and reservoirs overflowed.

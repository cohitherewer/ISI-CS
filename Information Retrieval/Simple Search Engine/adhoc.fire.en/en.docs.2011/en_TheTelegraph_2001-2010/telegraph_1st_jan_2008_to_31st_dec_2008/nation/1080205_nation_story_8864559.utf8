	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 4: Four persons in Orissa have died of suspected anthrax after eating half-boiled beef, adding to the fear fuelled by bird flu in neighbouring Bengal.
    
	Three women and a man died in Koraput last week, prompting the district administration to ask residents not to eat beef from animals that could have died of illness.
    
	Do not consume dead cows. If you eat them, you will die, said the administrations message to tribals whose traditional diet includes half-boiled beef that increases chances of infection.
    
	Last September, Koraput reported more than six deaths after tribals consumed stale beef from infected cows.
    
	The problem is acute in this region. Households dry leftover beef in the sun and store it in earthen pots to be taken out occasionally, cooked and served. 
    
	The practice should be shunned, doctors said, because spores that cause anthrax can lie dormant for decades and prey on the host when the environment is favourable. 
    
	Despite initiatives to create awareness, people seem reluctant to shed food and cooking habits, said chief district veterinary officer S.K. Takri. The people here are illiterate and dont understand how the infection spreads. They dont understand the symptoms and dont go to hospital immediately after the symptoms emerge. The delay proves fatal, he added.
    
	The administration has started vaccinating 12,600 cows in the block. Teams of doctors and health workers have been deputed to the affected areas with medicines.
    
	Culling nod
    
	A reluctant Orissa government has decided to cull chicken in the wake of a directive from the Centre to sanitise a 5km corridor bordering Bengal. But poultry farmers have threatened to move the high court.
    
	At least 8,84,000 chickens in Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts, which share borders with Bengal, would be culled, sources said.

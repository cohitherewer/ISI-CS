The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | To New York, on Andhra
                                                                                                            To New York, on Andhra

	New York, Feb. 8: Air India flew in non-stop from Delhi to New York today, its first such service from the capital.        
	The Maharaja, as the state-owned carrier is also known, has been running a non-stop flight to the Big Apple from Mumbai since last August. Two more, Bangalore-San Francisco and Mumbai-Chicago, are lined up for later this year.         
	The plans are part of the efforts of Air India and rival Jet Airways to grab a larger share of the fliers to the US, who account for 20 per cent of all overseas travel from India.        
	The plane used for the new service was a gleaming new Boeing 777-200 LR, named Andhra Pradesh, with room for 238 passengers  eight in the first class, 35 in executive and 195 in economy. The aircraft has individual viewing monitors for in-flight entertainment in all classes.        
	This flight offers unprecedented comfort and convenience, Air India chairman V. Thulasidas said before take-off. The airline said the fares, taxes included, are competitive: Rs 1.57 lakh in business class and Rs 44,967 in economy.        
	Saurabh Sen, the only first class passenger on the flight, appeared more than satisfied.         
	A non-stop service offering flat beds in the first class and serving Indian food is a good business proposition given the profile of NRIs here, Sen, the director of the US-based Astonfield group, said.        
	Non-stop services to more US cities, such as Houston, Atlanta and Washington, are on the cards. Vancouver and Rome, too, could be on the non-stop list this year.        
	Air India now has 35 flights a week to the US, matching the combined numbers of Delta, American and Continental. Jet has 14 a week, with a stopover in Brussels.         
	A third Indian carrier, Kingfisher-Deccan, is getting ready to start flying to the US from August.

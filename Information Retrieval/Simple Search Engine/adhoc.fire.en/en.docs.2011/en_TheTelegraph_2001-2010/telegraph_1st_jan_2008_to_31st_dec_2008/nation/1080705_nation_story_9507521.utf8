                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Post-G8 withdrawal possible
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sitaram Yechury after a Left meeting in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: The Left today set the government a July 7 deadline to clarify if it was indeed going to the IAEA board of governors with the safeguards text.        
	Sources said the Left parties were likely to withdraw support after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned from the G8 summit on July 9, though the RSP wanted an early pullout.         
	The move, however, will almost certainly be inconsequential with the Samajwadi Party having decided to support the Congress.        
	We wish to know definitely whether the government is proceeding to seek the approval of the safeguards agreement by the board of governors of the IAEA. Please let us know the position by July 7, said a letter signed by the general secretaries of the four Left parties and addressed to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The letter was firmed up after an hour-long meeting. The Left parties will meet again on July 8 to consider the governments response, if any, and decide the next step.        
	The letter was released to the media by CPM chief Prakash Karat at his party headquarters in the presence of the CPIs A.B. Bardhan, the Forward Blocs Debabrata Biswas and the RSPs T.J. Chandrachoodan.        
	Karat said: The second decision that the Left parties have taken is to launch a national campaign from July 14. We shall explain to the people our position on the nuclear deal.        
	The Left will highlight the governments refusal to take appropriate steps to tackle the runaway inflation and its anti-people policies.        
	A statement issued after the meeting said the Left would staunchly expose and oppose the efforts of the BJP and its allies to whip up communal polarisation with a view to gaining political and electoral support.        
	Forward Bloc general secretary Biswas later said the last meeting of the UPA-Left committee on the nuclear deal had completed all the political and technical discussions.        
	In that meeting, it was decided to hold another meeting to finalise the findings of the committee. We should have completed the proceedings. But now it seems the government is going ahead with the deal and there is no need for another meeting.        
	Keeping this in mind, Biswas said: We came to the conclusion that we should ask the government categorically whether it is thinking of going to the IAEA.        
	Asked about the Samajwadi Partys stand, he said: Let them do what they want to. The proceedings in Parliament are on record as to which party said what and what stand they had taken on the Indo-US nuclear deal. The sense of the House was opposed to the deal.

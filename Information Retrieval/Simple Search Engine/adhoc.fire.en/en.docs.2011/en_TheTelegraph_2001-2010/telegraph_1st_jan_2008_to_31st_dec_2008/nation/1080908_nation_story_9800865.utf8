          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Students celebrate. Ravenshaw University would again witness scenes like this                                  
	Cuttack, Sept. 7: Bowing to students pressure backed by its alumni, Ravenshaw University officials today said they would revoke the decision to put an end to students union elections that several former students said would have deprived the pupils of their democratic rights.        
	The rollback decision was taken on the basis of recommendations submitted by a committee of the deans of the eight schools and other officials of Ravenshaw University after taking a fresh look on the issue, said registrar Satyakam Mishra.        
	The committee was constituted following an appeal from former Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray, former member of Parliament Trilochan Kanungo and former state health minister Mustafiz Ahmed, he said, adding the recommendation would be implemented after due ratification by the syndicate.        
	Ravenshawvians, including Ray, Kanungo and Ahmed, had strongly pitched for students union elections expressing support to the agitation spearheaded by All-India Democratic Students Organisations Ravenshaw Committee.        
	Earlier, the syndicate had passed a resolution recommending formation of students council on the basis of nomination of meritorious students by putting an end to the practice of elections for creation of better environment on the campus.        
	The university officials had decided to implement it from this year, while students union elections in colleges and universities of the state are scheduled for September 25.        
	Sources said the committee, after deliberating on the issue yesterday, had recommended continuance with the polls as the selection process for the formation of the students union instead of adopting the nomination system, but with several riders.        
	The conditions include restrictions on campaigning inside the university after 6pm, involvement of outsiders in campaigning for candidates and contesting of candidates without achievements in sports and cultural activities for the post of athletics secretary and drama secretary.         
	While banning campaigning inside hostels, the committee recommended rejection of nominations of candidates who had not updated payment of fees.         
	The recommendations would be adopted as code of conduct for the students union elections henceforth, the registrar said, adding an 11-member committee of students has been constituted to adhere to it during the polls.

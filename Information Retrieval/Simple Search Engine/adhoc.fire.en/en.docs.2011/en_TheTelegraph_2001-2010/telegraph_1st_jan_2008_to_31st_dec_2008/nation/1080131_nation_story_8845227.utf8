     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The Centre has told states that steps to check abuse of women and children must be taken within three months.
    
	Accusing states of not implementing laws aimed at helping women and children well enough, Renuka Chowdhury issued the ultimatum at a two-day conference with state ministers that ended yesterday.
    
	This is not the first time the women and child development minister has warned states, but she has never before handed out a time-bound agenda.
    
	The minister is learnt to have warned the state governments of greater central intervention if they fail to deliver.
    
	Chowdhury also plans to ask her cabinet colleagues to upgrade the Integrated Child Development Scheme to a Mission Mode project, which will allow a central review of states performances every week.
    
	Under the National Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2006, all states were to put in place child rights commissions by the end of 2007. None has been set up yet. 
    
	Rules accompanying the 2005 domestic violence act make it mandatory for state governments to employ dedicated protection officers to counsel victims and help them fight a legal battle if necessary.
    
	Most states, including Bengal, have asked officers already burdened with other tasks to double as protection officers, leading to complaints that they were not spending enough time with victims of domestic violence.
    
	The Telegraph had reported the matter on October 24, 2007.
    
	The problem has been compounded because the state governments are not paying these officers extra, leading to a lack of interest in work, several protection officers have complained.
    
	But now, states will have to implement the laws  and the accompanying rules  or face a possible reduction in funding. 
    
	States have been given the agenda and have three months to complete their task. We will review their performance at that point, Chowdhury said yesterday.
    
	Women and child development is a concurrent subject  states and the Centre can both implement their own schemes and laws  and ministry officials said an agenda such as this is rare.
    
	It is possibly the first time this ministry is telling states, look, you need to be spoon-fed on what you should do to improve the lives of women and children, a senior official said. 
    
	Chowdhury said the government was concerned that the money allocated for the child development scheme was not reaching its destination. 
    
	The money we give must go into projects directly. We cannot have this process of transferring funds to states for them to implement the projects. We need a weekly review. All this needs the scheme to receive Mission Mode status, Chowdhury said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hike strike starts in Bihar courts
                                                                                                               Hike strike starts in Bihar courts
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 31: Over 80,000 lawyers of Patna High Court and 38 district and several sub-divisional courts boycotted work today to protest against the recent court fee hike. The non-co-operation will continue for two more days        
	Emboldened by the protest of lawyers of Patna civil court, Danapur, Patna city, Patna district collectorate, Kishanganj, Purnia, Barh and Masaurhi courts against the hike, lawyers under 122 Bar associations across Bihar decided to join the cease work.        
	Bihar State Bar Association, which met yesterday, said the lawyers might go on an indefinite strike from Wednesday if the government did not reconsider the hike till then.         
	After the fee hike, a petitioner has to pay the government a stamp duty (by way of court fee) of Rs 500 for a general application in the court. The fee for filing a PIL has been raised from Rs 250 to Rs 1,000.         
	Bihar court fees, lawyers argue, is now higher than that in states like Maharashtra, which has the second-best per capita income in the country. Bihar ranks second in the list from the bottom.         
	Senior high court lawyer Yogesh Chandra Verma, who led a protest march with 150 lawyers at Hartali Chowk here, said: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has not kept his word on withdrawing the hike. Thus, we have no option but to boycott work. P        
	rotesting lawyers, however, have generally refrained from using the word strike.        
	As Verma pointed out, the lawyers were against the anti-people provisions of the Bihar Court Fees Amendment Act, 2007.         
	Rajendra Singh, the president of the High Court Lawyers Association, called the fee hike black law, as petitioners would be forced to cough up more to safeguard their democratic rights in court.        
	Chairman of the legal cell of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee Mahendra Prasad Gupta said clients had been finding it tough enough to pay court fees  but it would become even more difficult. The Nitish Kumar government must look for other ways to raise revenue rather than exploit poor clients.         
	Hundreds of clients have started to feel the boycott heat, as now they have to wait for yet another date for their cases.

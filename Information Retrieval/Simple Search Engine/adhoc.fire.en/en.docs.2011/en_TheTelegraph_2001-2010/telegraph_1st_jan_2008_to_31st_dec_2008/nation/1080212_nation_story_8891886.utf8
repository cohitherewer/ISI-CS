The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kerala ache for Karat
                                                                                                               Kerala ache for Karat
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: If stalling the nuclear deal was a challenge that Prakash Karat relished, reining in factionalism in Kerala remains an insurmountable task for the CPM general secretary.        
	Indications about the enormity of that job came at the state conference of the party today.         
	The event was inaugurated by Karat and attended by politburo members Sitaram Yechury, R. Umanath and S. Ramachandran Pillai along with 546 delegates.         
	The politburos guidelines for maintaining discipline have been honoured more in the breach.        
	The brief suspension of both faction heads - chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan - from the politburo doesnt seem to have improved matters.        
	At the conference today, Vijayan presented a working report that doesnt pull punches at the 85-year-old chief minister.        
	It mentions instances where Achuthanandan hasnt supported ministers - an allusion to those in the Vijayan camp.        
	The report has made it clear that the differences within the organisation have affected the governments performance, sources said.        
	The central leadership has intervened time and again, with Karat paying special attention to his home state, but the report is a sign the feud could deepen further.        
	Vijayans dossier speaks of adding 20,439 members since the last state conference, with the frontal organisations together bringing in 20 lakh members.        
	But there are indications the chief ministers camp will shrink in the state committee, the selection of which will see the scrupulous avoidance of ballots.         
	The panel is poised to get at least 10 to 12 new members. Taking the strength of the Vijayan camp into consideration, the new composition could leave the chief minister weakened further in the committee.         
	The last committee had 76 members, 15 of whom were said to be close to the chief minister. If the number goes up as planned, the fraction of Achuthanandans supporters on the panel will fall further.        
	The Vijayan camp has marshalled statistics to prove the problem lies with the government, not the organisation.        
	These leaders have argued that in the previous Assembly election, held after the last state conference, the Left Front had bagged 96 seats. Of these, the CPM won 65. The rest had gone to party-supported Independents.        
	In the local body polls soon after, the CPM bagged over 50 per cent of the votes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Whiff of IIT fee hike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Whiff of IIT fee hike
  - No official sanction yet from Arjun Singh        OUR BUREAU                                     
	New Delhi/Lucknow, April 29: Indias education bureaucracy has decided to allow the Indian Institutes of Technology to hike fees this year, but minister Arjun Singh is yet to officially sanction the raise.         
	Based on informal assurances from the bureaucracy and a green signal for the proposed hike from the Prime Ministers top scientific adviser, the IITs have already started finalising their fee structure.         
	But Arjun alone holds the answer to whether the premier engineering institutes will be allowed to raise fees this year, top sources at the human resource development ministry told The Telegraph.         
	The minister has not yet cleared the proposal for a fee hike in the IITs. The proposal is still pending with him, a source said, adding, however, that Arjun might yet sanction the raise in time for admissions.         
	The IITs had proposed a fee hike over two years ago when they first faced a crunch in funds and had to withdraw money from a corpus built only as an emergency reserve.         
	This February, the proposal received an official stamp of approval from C.N.R. Rao, chairman of the Prime Ministers scientific advisory council.         
	Rao chairs most meetings of the standing committee on IITs  a body consisting of IIT directors and top HRD ministry officials.         
	Arjun is the committees official chairman, though he rarely attends its meetings.         
	Ministry officials cautioned that the standing committee could only recommend and the government was not bound to follow its suggestions.        
	For instance, the minutes of the same committee meeting where the fee hike proposal was cleared reveal that the panel had expressed discomfort over the governments plans to start three new IITs this year.         
	The committee recommends that the pace of expansion of the IITs be moderated to preserve the brand, the minutes  a copy is with The Telegraph  say. Yet, the government went ahead and announced that IITs in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar would start functioning from this academic session.         
	Sources close to Arjun said the ministers decision was likely to be political.         
	The political ramifications of the decision can explain the amount of time it is taking the minister to make up his mind, a source said.         
	A number of states go to polls later this year, and general elections are scheduled next year.         
	Arjun does not want to be seen as interfering with the autonomy of the IITs, the source said. Yet, he is concerned that poorer students must not be affected, the source added.        
	The minister has now asked all IITs to send details of the scholarships they plan to offer to ensure that economically weaker students do not suffer.         
	The hike in fees by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) may, however, win the day for the IITs, whose proposed raise pales in comparison with the B-schools fee hikes.         
	The IITs want to raise tuition fees from Rs 13,500 for each semester to between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 a semester.         
	A four-year undergraduate course would cost a student between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 4 lakh in tuition fees apart from hostel charges. Over 90 per cent of IIT students live on campus for their eight-term course. The students now pay Rs 1.08 lakh in tuition fees for their undergraduate studies.         
	The fees, even after the hike, that the IITs plan to charge are peanuts compared with what the IIMs will charge. So, if we cant stop the IIMs from hiking their fees, we dont have an argument to stop the IITs, a senior HRD ministry official said.         
	IIT Kanpur officials said they were planning to charge Rs 25,000 for each semester this year from undergraduate and MTech students but would like to maintain the Rs 13,500 term fee for MSc students.         
	Officials in the IITs said as many as 80 per cent of students would be exempt from the fee hike.

	 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Junior railway minister R. Velu today let out an open secret: political bigwigs have over the years skewed the railway network heavily towards their own states.          
	Influential MPs have been able to get more track length for their states, Velu told Parliament, virtually indicting railway ministers past and present.          
	Velus boss Lalu Prasad is facing a bias charge from the Shiv Sena and the MNS, who have accused the railways of favouring heartland youths in recruitment.          
	Velu said the worst sufferer has been the Northeast as it has few influential politicians and, he added later, because of the laxity of the state governments. The minister was replying to a supplementary query in the Rajya Sabha.                   
	 Bangalore: A retired air force sergeant who claimed to have found his wife and two children with their throats slit in their house has confessed that he killed them to marry a woman whom he had met on Internet chat. City police commissioner Shankar Bidari said D.S. Yadav, 42, used to scout for women on the Net and had even registered himself on a marriage website.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has permitted use of loudspeakers on all Mumbai beaches, including Juhu, during the Chhath festival celebrated by people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. They will be allowed to use loudspeakers till 10pm.                   
	 London (PTI): NRI psychiatrist Raj Persaud has quit his job as a consultant at a leading UK hospital, four months after he was convicted of dishonesty by a disciplinary tribunal. The 49-year-old doctor had admitted plagiarism at a General Medical Council hearing in June.                   
	 Chennai (PTI): A high-level team from Delhi will probe the near-collision of two aircraft at Chennai airport on Thursday night, officials said. The cargo flight staff and the pilot, who had been detained for an inquiry, have been released.

										      K.P. Nayar                                    IAEA chief ElBaradei  in  Berlin  on  Tuesday. (AFP)        Washington, July 15: India rsquo;s   march to Vienna last week to   topple one of the pillars of nuclear apartheid was like the   US invasion of Iraq in 2003.    The UPA government   achieved its primary objective. But poor planning led to   acrimony over form and political etiquette that overshadowed credit for having negotiated an acceptable safeguards   agreement under the circumstances.    The small group in the government which steered the   safeguards agreement towards the IAEA did not take   into account the possibility   that officials of the UN rsquo;s nuclear watchdog in Vienna   would announce within hours   that New Delhi was taking   steps to sign the landmark   agreement.    They also underestimated   the anger in the ranks of the   IAEA mdash; which is largely made   up of non-proliferationist believers mdash; against India for getting away with the proverbial   cake even after the country rsquo;s   dogged refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation   Treaty (NPT).    The top leadership of the   IAEA mdash; including director-  general Mohamed ElBaradei   and board chairman Milenko   Skoknic mdash; supports the Indo-  US nuclear deal and wants to   bring India into the global   non-proliferation regime   under mutually acceptable   conditions.    But the bulk of the IAEA   secretariat and staff are unhappy that India is getting   away on its own terms and   they would do everything possible to undermine the process   now under way in Vienna and   later in the Nuclear Suppliers   Group (NSG).    In the entire history of the   IAEA, for instance, no official   at the Indian embassy in Vienna mdash; who is also accredited to   UN organisations there, including the IAEA mdash; has been   allowed to enter its Department of Safeguards, currently   headed by a radiochemist   from Finland.    As far as IAEA veterans   can recall, the nuclear watchdog has taken extreme care   not to even post any Indian national working full-time for   the IAEA in the Department of   Safeguards.    While the government left   its diplomatic flanks wide   open in the march to Vienna, it   also failed to marshal the considerable public relations resources at its command.    The Prime minister rsquo;s   media adviser did not accompany Singh to Japan during   the crucial week when the government was in deep crisis.   This is the first time in recent   memory that a media adviser   has not accompanied a Prime   Minister on a foreign trip.    Navtej Sarna, the   spokesman for the external affairs ministry who has set a   record in that post for longevity, is the most accomplished officer in publicity in South   Block, having done media   work in Moscow, Warsaw,   Thimpu, Washington and New   Delhi.    He also knows how UN   agencies like the IAEA operate, having done disarmament work in Geneva and UN work in the ministry headquarters.    Had Sarna been consulted by the small group that took decisions about Vienna on its public relations fallout, he would have told them that the safeguards agreement mdash; which the government held close to its chest mdash; would leak the moment it was filed with the IAEA Secretariat at the Vienna International Centre.    Left to the whims of those at the top levels of the government who are completely out of touch with the way 21st century global media operates, the Indian ministry became the very last agency to release the draft of the safeguards agreement almost 35 hours after anyone anywhere who had an interest in the draft had seen it from other sources, including media websites.    If the neglect of the public relations process was an act of omission, there were serious acts of commission which added to the UPA rsquo;s woes.    Instead of micro-managing the entire process of approaching the IAEA, the top-most ministry official dealing with the UN, an additional secretary for international organisations, was busy packing his bags for New York for an inane meeting at the UN headquarters about mdash; believe it or not mdash; the moribund ldquo;Group of Four rdquo; process to get India permanently into the UN Security Council!

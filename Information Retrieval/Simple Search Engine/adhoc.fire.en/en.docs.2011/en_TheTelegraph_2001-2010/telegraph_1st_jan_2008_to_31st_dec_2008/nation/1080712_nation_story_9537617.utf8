          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 11: A day after Mohammed Yunus was shot in an encounter, Peoples Watch, a voluntary body, today wrote to the state home secretary and the National Human Rights Commission seeking a departmental inquiry into the incident         
	Police reportedly fired at Yunus in retaliation when the gangster opened fire while trying to escape. Two bullets hit his legs and he is now undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.         
	We have asked for a report from the home department about the incident. The public should know if it was a real encounter. Yunuss family will soon be filing a case in the court, said Namrata Chaddha, the state president of Peoples Watch.         
	The encounter took place last evening near Satyanagar flyover in the heart of the city. Yunus, known to be one of the close aides of dreaded gangster Hyder, was delivering a cache of illegal firearm, when a special police squad reached the spot.         
	The team reportedly intercepted him, forcing the criminal to fire at officers while trying to escape. The bullets that hit Yunuss thigh were fired in self-defence, said police commissioner B.K. Shrama.        
	Peoples Watch, an organisation that works to prevent illegal detention and upholds civil rights in India, today contacted Yunuss family and decided to demand a departmental inquiry.         
	Meanwhile, the gangsters associates who managed to flee are still at large. A member of the special squad Alok Jena who was injured during the operation is still recovering.         
	Yunus, who hails from the Balianta area of Khurda, has been involved in some six cases of murder, robberies and arms possession.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Supreme Court has asked the Orissa government to file an affidavit tomorrow pledging to protect the life and liberty of people in Kandhamal.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan today expressed unhappiness at the way the state was tackling the situation in the district where Christians were being attacked. Ordinary people have to be protected. It appears the state government is not doing so.        
	The head of the Catholic Church in Orissa had filed the petition to draw the courts attention to the plight of the community. Appearing for Raphael Cheenath, archbishop of the Cuttack diocese, senior counsel Colin Gonsalves told the court that more houses had been razed overnight.         
	The CRPF commandant there (in Kandhamal) has told TV channels that the police were not taking their help and they couldnt do anything without the direction of the state police, under which they have been placed, Gonsalves said. The petition had also sought central forces.        
	He urged the court to issue directives asking the government to set up a hotline immediately so that the beleaguered community could call for help in the event of attacks.         
	Gonsalves expressed fears that Praveen Togadias planned yatra on Friday, with ashes of slain VHP leader Swami Laxmananda, through the trouble zone could spark more attacks on the community. The murder of Laxmanananda last month had triggered the communal violence.        
	The Church regretted the killing and had condemned it, Gonsalves said. We may have differences but we dont go around killing people.         
	The court asked for a clarification from a senior state official on whether the Friday yatra had been allowed and on steps being taken to ensure it passed off peacefully.        
	The Centre told the court it was closely watching the situation and had sought an assurance from the state that it would do everything to keep the situation under control.         
	The Orissa governments counsel insisted the situation was under control but the court wasnt satisfied and asked for a sworn statement, saying it would protect the life and property of all in Kandhamal.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Chandigarh, Jan. 25: Police have busted a kidney transplant racket run by doctors in Gurgaon.
    
	Labourers from Agra, Meerut and Moradabad would be taken to Gurgaon on the promise of jobs and money, the police said. 
    
	A medical test would be done on them in a private hospital on the pretext that the government had made the practice mandatory for getting jobs. A few hours later, they would be taken for surgery to get their kidneys removed. If anyone protested, he would be threatened with harm.
    
	The lid was blown off the racket when some of these labourers lodged a complaint with Moradabad police. They named an agent, who the police tailed for some days. 
    
	The police traced the hospital last night, where they stumbled on five labourers. Three were recuperating after their kidneys had been removed and two were awaiting their turn on the operation table.
    
	We have arrested five persons and are on the lookout for some others who ran the racket, Gurgaon police commissioner Mohinder Lal said today.
    
	Upendra, an MBBS from Ballabhgarh, and a quack identified as Jagdish are among the five arrested. But the alleged mastermind of the racket, a surgeon called Amit Kumar, and doctors Jeevan Kumar and Saraj are absconding.
    
	The police have released photographs of the surgeon and alerted airports across the country.
    
	The police raided a mansion in Gurgaon that the doctors allegedly used as a guesthouse for kidney buyers, most of whom came from abroad, mainly from West Asia, Malaysia and Canada. 
    
	Four Greek nationals and an NRI couple from Britain found there have been detained for questioning.
    
	Preliminary investigations have revealed that the doctors sold between 400 and 500 kidneys in the last six to seven years. They used to remove the kidneys from poor labourers and pay them between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh. They used to sell the kidneys at exorbitant rates. All operations were conducted with the utmost secrecy, the police commissioner said.
    
	Some members of the racket had been arrested in Delhi and Andhra Pradesh in 2000 and in Mumbai in 2005, the police said.

	Patna, Jan. 24: Raids conducted today in residences of Bihars minor irrigation chief engineer Awadhesh Prasad Singh yielded property worth crores including Rs 55 lakh in cash and share papers amounting to Rs 50 lakh. 
    
	The special vigilance team known as the Corruption Linked Efforts for Affirmative Action (CLEAN) carried out raids on the engineers three establishments; his Patna and Muzaffarpur homes and his relatives house at Samastipur in north Bihar. 
    
	Inspector-general of CLEAN A.K. Upadhyay said the recovered papers showed that Singh possessed flats and lands in Noida, Bangalore and Calcutta, besides Muzaffapur and Patna. 
    
	The government has initiated the suspension of the engineer in question and has initiated proceedings against him, in the wake of the raids.

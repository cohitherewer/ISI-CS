          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Aug. 29: A show of unity has thrown up cracks in the Congress in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh.        
	Regional leaders from the state are busy projecting themselves as chief minister candidates instead of joining forces against the Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime when elections are less than three months away.        
	The problem has become so serious that V. Narayanswamy, the Congress general secretary in charge of the state, has sought an appointment with Sonia Gandhi to lodge a formal complaint against senior leaders, including Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath and Subhash Yadav.        
	The battle for one-upmanship began, ironically, at a meeting organised in Chhindwara on August 22 to show a united face of the Congress. By the time half the top-line speakers had finished, the thrust of the rally had shifted to the choice of chief minister.        
	Digvijay suggested Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Naths name, much to the discomfort of state Congress chief Suresh Pachauri.         
	Asked why Pachauri was sidelined, Digvijay said: He should decide if he wants to be the king or the king-maker.        
	Within the next 48 hours, another leader eyeing the crown  Jyotiraditya Scindia  had run out of patience. Who says Kamal Nath is being projected as the chief minister candidate? It is an issue that will be decided by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the young MP told a meeting in Ujjain.        
	The Nath camp is, however, unfazed. It has organised extensive tours for the minister across the state early next week.        
	The so far silent Pachauri has found support in Narayanswamy. Sources close to the Congress general secretary said he had not taken too kindly to Digvijays retorts and the Nath camps consistent campaign.        
	But since both Digvijay and Nath have a bigger stature in the party and the government, Narayanswamy has reportedly sought Sonias intervention to discipline them.        
	Nath has a larger than life image in Madhya Pradesh, his home state. Known for his political acumen and resources, he is said to have conducted a secret survey to spot the Congresss promising nominees.         
	The buzz in state party circles is that the ministers next step would be to back as many winning nominees as possible so that he can get their support after the elections.        
	The clamour for the chief ministers chair is surprising, considering the Congresss stated position and convention. Unlike rivals BJP and other parties, the Congress has traditionally avoided naming a chief minister candidate.        
	Successive regimes have defended the system, saying newly elected MLAs should get a chance to choose their leader.         
	But there have also been several critics of the practice. First, they say, the absence of a chief minister candidate means that the Congress does not have a public face to project throughout the campaign.         
	Second, when picking a leader for the post, loyalty or proximity to the Delhi durbar plays a more decisive role than the individuals strength in the state.        
	After the recent debacles in the Gujarat and Karnataka Assembly polls, an influential section of the party had made a strong case for the projection of a chief minister nominee.

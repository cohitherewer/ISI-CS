                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hurt archbishop lashes out
          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                           Yeddyurappa with Archbishop Bernard Moras in Bangalore on Monday. (Bangalore News Photos)                                  
	Bangalore, Sept. 22: The Karnataka government today blamed rivals for the continuing attacks on churches but ran into an angry blast from the archbishop who snubbed the chief minister in public when he went to Bishop House.        
	We cannot express our feelings when the blessed sacrament is exposed, Archbishop Bernard Moras fumed at B.S. Yeddyurappa in the porch before a crowd of journalists.        
	It is Jesus for us in whom we believe. What will you do if your religious place is desecrated? The whole church in Karnataka is very hurt, Moras told the BJP chief minister who had gone to apprise him of the steps his government had taken to stop the raids that reached the state capital yesterday.        
	Moras, however, thanked Yeddyurappa for coming to his doorstep and invited him inside for a meeting.        
	About 5km away, at the BJPs Karnataka headquarters, state unit chief D.V. Sadanand Gowda blamed the escalating crisis on the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) and even claimed that police had proof that Congress workers were involved in two of the attacks.        
	In one case, he said police sniffer dogs had followed the scent from the church that was attacked to the district Congress office.        
	Gowda also alleged that the Congress, along with its one-time ally JD(S), was working overtime to malign the ruling BJP.        
	A source present at the closed-door meeting between the archbishop and Yeddyurappa said Moras made it very clear the culprits, whoever they might be, had to be punished for the sacrilege.        
	The government was also asked to withdraw cases slapped against innocent Christians who were beaten up by the police in Mangalore last Monday while they were protesting against the attacks, the source added.        
	He also told the chief minister the church was against forced conversions.        
	The source said Moras appealed to Yeddyurappa not to take the insult to the sacrament lightly, alluding to attempts by the police to treat one of the Bangalore attacks as a case of burglary. It is not just monetary loss but the desecration of a religious symbol, the archbishop was quoted as saying.        
	Yeddyurappa, who was accompanied by state home minister V.S. Acharya and senior officials, assured Moras that police and home guards would be deployed to prevent further attacks.         
	Earlier, after an emergency cabinet meeting, Yeddyurappa said his government had decided to slap charges under the tough Karnataka Goonda Act to deal with those responsible for the attacks that began last week in Mangalore, Udupi and Chikmagalur where miscreants simultaneously attacked 15 prayer halls.        
	Under the goonda act, a person can be jailed without charge for up to six months at a time.        
	The raids yesterday spread to IT hub Bangalore, where early-morning intruders attacked churches in Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Hebbal. Police, however, said the Hebbal incident could be a burglary and refused to acknowledge it as part of the serial assaults.         
	Miscreants had entered the church by breaking open the back door and destroyed the sacrament, literature, furniture and friary clothes.        
	The VHP general secretary in charge of Karnataka, B.N. Murthy, said neither his outfit nor any of the BJPs affiliates, including the Bajrang Dal, was involved in the attacks. It is the handiwork of some youths who were angry with attempts to convert them, he said.        
	In Delhi, the Congress and its allies like the Rashtriya Janata Dal, said they did not want the BJP government in Karnataka to be dismissed or the Bajrang Dal banned for the church raids. Lets not make martyrs of the BJP, RJD leader Lalu Prasad said.

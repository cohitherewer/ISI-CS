          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 12: The Congress said it favoured keeping the creamy layer of the Other Backward Classes out of the ambit of reservation in higher education institutions, but the Centre would have to take a final call.        
	The party is also in favour of bringing a bill to legislate quotas in private, unaided educational institutions.        
	Sonia Gandhi is likely to call a meeting of the UPA coordination committee next week to discuss both issues, which figured in the Congresss core committee meeting yesterday.         
	The broad view was though the party was bound by a Congress Working Committee resolution adopted when Rajiv Gandhi was the president that the creamy layer should be skimmed off, the compulsions of coalition politics would demand a flexible stand.        
	Spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said: The issue of how to define the creamy layer will ultimately rest with the government and would need to be based on todays socio-economic realities.        
	Moily, who headed the oversight committee appointed by the Prime Minister to look into the quota, said his report had hinted at the need to keep the creamy layer out so that the truly backward get the benefit of reservation.         
	Karunanidhi letter        
	DMK chief M. Karunanidhi sent a letter to the Prime Minister today, asking him for a fair and just review of the creamy layer criteria. Under the present income criteria  Rs 2.5 lakh a year  even children of Group D employees may not benefit, he said. The Prime Minister spoke to him and said the HRD minister had been asked to scan the verdict with the UPA allies.

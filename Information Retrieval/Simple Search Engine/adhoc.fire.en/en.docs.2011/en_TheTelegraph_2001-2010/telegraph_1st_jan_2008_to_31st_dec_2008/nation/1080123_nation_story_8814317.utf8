     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Nearly a decade after monitoring cases of starvation deaths in Orissas KBK districts, the Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to end supervision of steps taken by the state to tackle the problem. 
    
	The court had, at the request of an NGO, Indian Council of Legal Aid and Advice, stepped in to issue a host of directions to prevent recurrence of starvation deaths in the predominantly tribal belt in 1997. The NGO had moved court as the state had refused to accept the deaths as starvation deaths.
    
	But, a decade of court monitoring, during which the NHRC sent a fact-finding team to the area and recommended steps to the government tackle the problem, the NGO urged the court to close the case as the state government had agreed to implement all the NHRC recommendations.
    
	The NGO, however, said it should be given the option of returning to the court for further directions in case of any exigency in the future.

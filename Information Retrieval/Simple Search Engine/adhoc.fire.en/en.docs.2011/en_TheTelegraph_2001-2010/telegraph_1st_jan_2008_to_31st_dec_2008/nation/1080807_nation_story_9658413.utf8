The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diana fame to Asian babes fall 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diana fame to Asian babes fall 
          AMIT ROY                                    
	London, Aug. 6: Martin Bashir, the veteran British television journalist who won world fame with his Diana three in a marriage interview, is once again the centre of attention  but this time for all the wrong reasons.        
	Addressing the Asian American Journalists Association annual banquet in Chicago on July 25, Bashir risked what he now recognises was a tasteless joke about Asian babes made in a moment of stupidity.        
	During his speech, which has now come out, Bashir told the audience: Ive never been around so many Asian babes in my life.        
	If he had left it at that, he might conceivably have got away with it.        
	However, Bashir, 45, who moved to America four years ago to earn the high salaries paid in the US to television anchors, displayed an uncharacteristic lack of judgement by going on: In fact, Im mightily relieved that the podium covers me from the waist downwards. Ive been having trouble all evening.        
	Nor did Bashir, who now fronts the news documentary show 20/20 on the ABC networks Nightline slot, leave it there. His brief was to offer something supportive of minority origin journalists in the American media.        
	But with Emmy award-winning co-presenter Juju Chang standing nearby on stage, Bashir went on to say that a speech should be like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague Jujus.        
	He emphasised his colleague had achieved this on both points.         
	As some in the audience booed, Chang cut in: See what I have to put up with?        
	She later described the comments as a ridiculous joke and said: He has since apologised to me for his boorishness.        
	Bashirs remarks are baffling, especially from someone who was born in London of Pakistani Christian parents, grew up with the cultural and ethnic mix offered by contemporary Britain, and suffered jealousy from white colleagues at the BBC especially after he landed the Princess Diana interview in 1995 (she named Camilla Parker Bowles as the other woman in Prince Charless life and confessed to taking a lover herself). He was finally forced to leave for America to rise beyond the glass ceiling, starting a new job at a reported 500,000 a year.         
	In his fulsome apology to his journalist hosts, Bashir issued a mea culpa: Upon reflection, it was a tasteless remark that I now bitterly regret.         
	In his letter, which has been reproduced in the New York Magazine, Bashir added: I am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organisation will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity.        
	The ABC networks spokesperson, Jeffrey Schneider, issued a stern rebuke: This kind of remark has no place in any setting and Martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgement.

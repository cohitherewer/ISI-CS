          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The countrys leading Muslim bodies have jointly formed a legal cell to help innocent terror suspects, which will start by defending the two alleged militants arrested after yesterdays Jamianagar shootout.        
	The Indian Muslim Co-ordination Committee, a newly formed conglomerate of all major Muslim organisations in the country, will also probe if police had faked the encounter that killed two suspected militants and a decorated officer.        
	We have constituted a four-member legal cell of two senior lawyers, a journalist and a social activist to take up the cases of terror suspects since lawyers associations have refused to defend them in many instances, said T.A. Rehmani of the Muslim Political Council of India, a constituent of the committee.        
	This leaves the accused with no legal aid even when there is neither any evidence nor a chargesheet. Such things should not happen in the future. Hence the legal cell.        
	Other than Zeeshan Ahmad and Mohammed Saif  the two men arrested after yesterdays shootout, the cell will defend the five persons detained from the southeast Delhi neighbourhood if necessary.        
	It may also file its own case against Delhi police after investigating the shootout.        
	We are not ready to buy the police version about the shootout, Rehmani said. Our legal cell will conduct a parallel inquiry and a case will be filed after our legal team finalises its report.        
	The co-ordination committee was set up recently to counter the Centres targeting of Muslims in the name of the war on terror. On Thursday, it decided to ask imams across the country to criticise the Centre during the September 26 Friday prayers.        
	Among the committees constituents are the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, Jamaat-e-Islami, All India Muslim Majlise Mushawarat, All India Milli Council and the Muslim Political Council of India, who have buried their differences to unite in the interests of the community.        
	The committee also proposes to set up a planning cell and a political cell, as well as a media cell that will monitor the alleged media onslaught on Muslims and Islam, said Mujtaba Farooq, the Jamaats political affairs secretary.         
	On Monday, the committee will make public a charter of demands, which include the dismissal of home minister Shivraj Patil, the Intelligence Bureau chief and the Delhi police commissioner.        
	The committee also wants a high-level probe into all alleged terror attacks in the country and a ban on Hindutva outfits such as the Bajrang Dal, VHP and the Hindu Vahini.        
	If the government fails to meet these demands, a massive agitation will be launched at Delhis Jantar Mantar on September 26. We all will court arrest, Rehmani said.        
	The committee, which has labelled the UPA government anti-minority, is in touch with political leaders who care for the community.

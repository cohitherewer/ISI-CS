	Gaya, Oct. 19: Ashok Kumar Jha, an ex-army officer recruited for SAP, the special police force created to combat Maoist menace, was killed in an encounter with the rebels this morning near Jhatpahri village under the Dumaria police station area.        
	Gaya superintendent of police Mallar Vizhi said that the police received information this morning about a meeting of the sub-zonal committee of the outfit.        
	Soon, a joint operation against the assembled rebels was launched by the SAP, STF, CRPF, the district police and the BMP.         
	Reaching the spot, the police discovered a Naxalite bunker which was subsequently destroyed by the police team.         
	The Maoists engaged the team in khaki in a gun battle. Jha was hit by a Naxalite bullet and died on the spot. Three country-made revolvers were recovered from the village.        
	According to reports, two persons, including a schoolteacher, were detained for questioning.         
	This is the third incident in recent weeks in which policemen fell to red bullets.        
	A few weeks ago, six police personnel, including five SAP jawans, were gunned down by the rebels in Raniganj village under the Imamganj police station area. Three policemen lost lives in an encounter between a joint police team and the Naxalites in the Dumaria police station area.        
	In another incident, the mutilated body of an eight-year-old boy was found dumped in Gurua. The boy had been abducted a couple of days back from the village.

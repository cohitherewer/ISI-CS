          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Orissa government today opposed any move to transfer the Kandhamal nun-rape case to the CBI and said compensating religious institutions was against its secular policy.        
	There are no grounds nor any need for transfer of the investigation of this case to the CBI, an affidavit filed by state home secretary Tarun Kanti Mishra said.        
	The affidavit for the state, where several churches have been destroyed or damaged in the ongoing violence, added: no compensation is paid for damaged religious institutions, irrespective of their religious affiliations, as per the secular policy of the state government.        
	However, the state government gives lump-sum compensation in the nature of ex-gratia payments for damage to schools, colleges and shelter homes and other public/charitable institutions run by religious institutions.        
	The state denied allegations that it had not taken action against those accused in the nun-rape case.         
	It said the nun had left the area and refused to co-operate with investigations, but an FIR had been filed against unknown persons for rape and molestation.        
	Eight persons had also been arrested so far, it said. Santosh alias Mitu Patnaik, Saroj Badhei and Muna Badhei were picked up on October 9 from a rice mill in Keralas Palakkad district.        
	investigation of the case is continuing very diligently and earnestly and the matter is being monitored at the highest level.        
	The affidavit said the ethnic and religious nature of the divide between the Kandhs, a Scheduled Tribe, and the non-tribal Scheduled Castes, as well as the districts hilly terrain had hindered movement of police forces.

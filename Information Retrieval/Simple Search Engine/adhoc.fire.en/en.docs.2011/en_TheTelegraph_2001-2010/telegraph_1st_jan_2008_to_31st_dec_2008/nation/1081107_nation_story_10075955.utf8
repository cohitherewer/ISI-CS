          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Left twins are locked in a you-stole-my-candidate row in the Okhla Assembly seat in Delhi, which goes to polls on November 29.         
	The CPI was considering the name of Raza Haider, a small-time worker in the partys media wing, but he has ended up being the CPMs candidate.        
	The Okhla seat includes the important Jamianagar constituency, famous for the controversial police encounter that followed the Delhi blasts in September.        
	An angry CPI today called its ally irresponsible.         
	The partys Delhi unit secretary, Amarjeet Kaur, said the CPM knew that the CPI had decided to field candidates in five seats, including Okhla, on October 31. Both parties had agreed to consult each other before announcing their lists, she said. But, she added, the CPM flouted the verbal agreement by naming its candidate for Okhla.         
	Kaur said Raza was a member of her partys mass front but did not elaborate.         
	The CPM argued that Raza himself had come knocking on the partys door. Raza had approached us for a seat. So we did a background check on him and found him to be a secular and democratic person. We had duly informed the CPI that we were contesting in four seats, including Okhla. However, I dont want to enter into any controversy. The candidate himself has issued a statement, Pushpendra Greval, the CPMs Delhi secretary, told The Telegraph.         
	Raza had issued his statement yesterday. I am contesting the poll as a CPI (M) candidate and I want all the Left and progressive parties who are sympathetic to the Lefts ideology to take charge and help the CPI (M) win from the Okhla constituency, it said.        
	The CPI has now named Amiruddin its candidate for Okhla. He today accused Raza of looking to divide Left votes.         
	Kaur said the CPI and CPM were in a dispute over just one seat, and that wouldnt make any difference to their poll pact. She clarified that except in Okhla and four other seats where the party was contesting, CPI workers would vote for the CPM and other secular parties.

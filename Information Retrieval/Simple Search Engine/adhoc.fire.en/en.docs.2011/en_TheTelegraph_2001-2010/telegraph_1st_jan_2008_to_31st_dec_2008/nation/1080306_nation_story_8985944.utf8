          G.S. MUDUR                          LISTEN amp; LOSE                                  
	New Delhi, March 5: Driving while listening to someone speak can drain a third of the brains activity, the first study to quantify the loss of driving capacity has shown.        
	Scientists at the Carnegie Mellon University in the US have found that just listening to sentences degrades the driving process, with a 37 per cent decrease in activity in an area of the brain that is crucial for driving.        
	Drivers need to keep not only their hands on the wheel, they also have to keep their brains on the road, said neuroscientist Marcel Just, director of the Centre for Cognitive Brain Imaging, a member of the Carnegie team whose findings are scheduled for publication in the journal Brain Research.        
	The scientists used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to assess the brain activity of volunteers who used a driving simulator to steer a car along a virtual winding road at different speeds.         
	They steered their cars undisturbed first, but then listened to a set of factual sentences and marked them true or false. The scans, called functional MRI, help identify the most active regions of the brain during specific tasks and have become an important tool to decipher brain functions.        
	Studies by other researchers conducted over the past decade have shown that simulated driving performance is disrupted by conversations, even when they involve hands-free devices.        
	But the Carnegie experiments are the first to show that driving-while-listening led to a 37 per cent drop in activity in the brains parietal lobe, a region that plays a crucial role in driving.        
	The study found that drivers who were listening to the sentences moved out of lanes more often or hit a simulated guard-rail on the side or deviated from the centre of the road.        
	The implication is that engaging in a demanding conversation could jeopardise the judgement and reaction time if an unusual driving situation arose, Just said.         
	The tasks of understanding sentences and driving are processed by different networks of cells within the brain. Yet, the study found that attempting both at the same time caused a degradation of driving, brought about by the processing of sentences.        
	The new findings suggest that other tasks requiring speech processing by the brain  such as conversing with a passenger or listening to a talk on the radio  may also degrade driving performance, the researchers said.        
	However, it is incorrect to conclude that using a cellphone while driving is no worse than engaging in one of these other activities, the researchers said in their paper.

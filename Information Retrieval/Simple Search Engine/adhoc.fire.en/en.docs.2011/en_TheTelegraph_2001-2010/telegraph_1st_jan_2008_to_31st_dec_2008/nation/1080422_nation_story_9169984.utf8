The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flurry of fatwas foxes the faithful
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Flurry of fatwas foxes the faithful
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Salman Rushdie, against whom a fatwa was declared                                   
	April 21: Fatwa factories have sprung up across the country, confusing the faithful who grapple with directives from traditional Islamic seminaries as well as modern scholars.        
	Last month saw a series of fatwas handed by the Deoband school and the Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence) Academy, which claims to be a representative body of scholars, intellectuals, researchers and muftis.         
	The academy has labelled medical insurance haram (prohibited) and ruled against credit cards and DNA tests. Euthanasia, shares and animal slaughter by machine have also been the subject of its fatwas.         
	The 141-year-old Deoband school, on the other hand, has declared watching television, wearing jeans, sex education and working in the film or entertainment industry haram.        
	Professor Imtiaz Ahmad, who specialises in research on Muslims in India, said these fatwas initially caused lot of disquiet but now the community was finding its own way of dealing with them.        
	I know many instances of families seeking fatwas from various schools and accepting what is most suitable and convenient to them, said Imtiaz, who was associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University.         
	In Varanasi, the traditional weaving community has come up with its own caste leaders and fatwas from renowned seminaries are discarded in favour of own-caste clerics, he said.         
	The scholar said he had come across a case where a clergyman had given two different fatwas to a disputing family. When the two sides came together, he panicked and the family worked out its own solution.        
	Imitiaz said there was also a tendency to issue counter fatwas. If one cleric says something which is not acceptable to another, a counter fatwa is issued, he said.        
	The scholar said there were deep misconceptions about fatwas. It has to be understood that as per Sunni faith, fatwas are not voluntary decrees binding on all. It is a response to an individuals query with a freedom to accept or reject it.         
	Much confusion arose following Imam Ayatollah Khomeinis fatwa against writer Salman Rushdie. In the Shia faith, the living imam is representative of God and such fatwas are binding on all. But among Sunnis, who are in a majority worldwide, there are no such provisions.        
	Scholars and religious leaders must understand their limitations while giving fatwas. In this context, he recalled how Muslim scholars had termed the consumption of coffee haram till Sultan Murad IV permitted it, making it a Muslim drink.         
	Most Barelvi religious heads oppose new interpretation of age-old laws. But Fiqh academy scholars disagree.        
	According to Khalid Saifullah, jurisprudence of Islam was a living, dynamic law for humanity. Now it is the responsibility of jurists and servants of Islamic Sharia to work out the harmonious application of the dynamic jurisprudence of Islam in the ever-changing patterns and circumstances of the milieu, he said.        
	Imtiaz said since Islam did not have a church structure and clergy, it was vulnerable to being hijacked for fraudulent purposes. In many cases, so-called Islamic investment funds  touted as alternatives to banks and shares as investment options  had defrauded lakhs of people of their meagre savings in the name of religion, he said.

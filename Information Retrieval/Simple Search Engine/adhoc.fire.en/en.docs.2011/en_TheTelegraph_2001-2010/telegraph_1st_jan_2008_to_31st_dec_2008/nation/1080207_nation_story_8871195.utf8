	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Three Burmese fishermen, virtually lost in the Bay of Bengal for three months, were rescued by police in Gopalpur, around 200km from here.        
	Berhampur police last night rescued the three Burmese men after local fishermen spotted the three on a makeshift raft.         
	The men, in their thirties, were clinging to the raft made from 50 bamboo pieces, said Gopalpur circle inspector Girija Sankar Rath.        
	The group of local fishermen saw the three wildly gesturing for food. In a fix to what to do, the confused group turned to seek advice of their kin. They went back a while later to tow the raft with the help of three boats. A home guard was informed about the rescue.         
	As soon as they reached the shores, the men started crying for food. None of us could speak the others languages, but their gestures made it plain enough  they were hungry, said the circle inspector. The men were given food, and clothes, besides a good shave.         
	Their signs were difficult to make out. It was after a long time that we understood that they were from Burma, said Rath. A resident who knew a little Burmese was then called for help around 10pm.         
	Thanks to our interpreter that we came to know about the group had lost their way in the deep seas since November. On November 17, 2007, the three had left home to fish. But strong currents pushed them into deeper seas, where they had been wandering since.        
	We had them medically examined and they are at the police station now, said the police.         
	The district collector has been communicated about the rescue. He would be speaking to the Burmese embassy soon.        
	The men albeit unintentionally have violated the Foreign Act II. We will have to file a case against them and forward them to the court, Rath added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 24: Rachna Vohras tunnel vision is all set to give travellers in Metros across the country a reason to gaze out of their windows.        
	Thanks to a technology still new in India, her company, C2E, has made it possible for commuters to watch a silent movie as they flash by in the high-speed, underground trains. The first such 15-second film for Kotak Mahindra is being screened on the Delhi Metro line.        
	We have also been approached by Calcutta Metro, Vohra, the vice-president of C2E said. They are very interested in using this technology to generate advertising revenue.        
	The film, stored in light boxes mounted on the tunnel wall, is beamed out as a train passes. The company has used over 71 light boxes  which have laser-cut slats to let out light from a camera fitted in  for a distance of 200 metres.        
	The commercials will be beamed for 15 seconds every four minutes when a train passes by.        
	Unlike billboards where you dont know how many people actually see the advertisement, in-tunnel films are more effective, Vohra said.        
	A study conducted by Delhi Metro indicates that 3.96 lakh people use the route daily.        
	Although the technology is at a nascent stage in India and still needs to be understood by filmmakers, in-tunnel advertisements are common in the West.        
	It will be possible to do pop-up ads, which will be like 3-D animation with this medium, Vohra said.

                                                                                                               Change lies in average age: Karat 
          JAYANTH JACOB                                             
	Coimbatore, April 3: Prakash Karat has been re-elected the CPMs general secretary by the 19th congress which concluded today. Not only have the two founding members of the politburo been re-assigned roles, the policy-making body has also got younger. Karat (in picture) had a brief conversation with The Telegraph.              
	Are you going to miss the presence of Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet?        
	We have discussed the issue and arrived at a decision. They are very valuable members of the party who are there since the days the party was founded. And we decided for this arrangement after discussions (Basu as special invitee to the politburo and Surjeet as special invitee to the central committee).        
	It is being pointed out that in your speech, you didnt mention Surjeet while talking about Basu and other leaders?         
	I spoke at length to the delegates about the contribution of Surjeet as well as Basu. I spoke about their service to the party and their contribution in the growth of the party. This happened just before the open session where the media was present.         
	But will the party be dependent on leaders like Basu now as it was before?         
	We acknowledge the role of both Basu and Surjeet and they will continue to associate with the party as special invitees.         
	Is there a generational change in the politburo?         
	There are new members. Some new faces have come in. Some old members are continuing. The average age of the politburo could be 58 or so. Thats the change.         
	How do you feel now that you are general secretary for the second time?         
	Yes (followed by a laugh).

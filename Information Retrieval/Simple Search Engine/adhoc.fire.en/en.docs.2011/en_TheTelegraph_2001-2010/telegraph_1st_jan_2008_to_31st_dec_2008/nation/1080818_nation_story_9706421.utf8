	Ketchup protest stains highway              
	The national highway passing Kolar, 70km from Bangalore, has seen a lot of red on its surface for years now.     
	The colour-coated stretch is the result of tomatoes dumped by farmers protesting a price crash. This week, too, the disgruntled lot threw their crop on the highway after the prices fell from Rs 80 per kilogram to Rs 15-25 a kg.    
	An appeal had earlier been made to the government to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 per acre to tomato growers.     
	The farmers action blocked the highway for hours this week. After their unique protest ended, the crushed tomatoes left an indelible stain kilometres long as trucks, buses and passing vehicles squashed the produce.    
	This action was first resorted to as a novel protest two decades ago when agitated farmers threw vegetables in front of their yards. Soon, the road resembled a sea of red as thousands of local farmers brought truckloads of tomatoes and dumped them. The scene is enacted once in a few years since tomato prices often crash.        
	Metro corridor speeds ahead              
	Mumbais first metro corridor seems to have the hit the fast track.    
	Mumbai Metro One Private, the Anil Ambani-led combine executing the project, recently awarded ABB, Siemens and SEW Constructions contracts for a variety of tasks.    
	ABB was given the deal for the power supply system on the 11km corridor, from Versova to Ghatkopar. Siemens, a world leader in signalling devices, will install the systems to regulate the running and control of the trains.    
	SEW Constructions is to build the cable bridge that will raise the tracks above the Western Express flyover. The route, with 12 stations in all, will cut through Andheri. The firm will also put in place two other bridges, based on the cantilever design. One of these will come up over Andheri station and the other over the Mithi river.

	Bid to ground flying danger              
	Too many feathers have been ruffled by bird-hits and the Delhi airport is trying to ensure the menace is tackled before it gets out of hand.    
	The threat came into focus recently when an Air Mauritius flight had to abort takeoff at the last minute, leading to an emergency evacuation of all on board. Three bird-hits have occurred in the past two months.     
	Efforts have been intensified to sanitise the periphery. We are cutting and trimming grass regularly to keep away insects as they often attract birds, an official of the Delhi International Airport Limited (Dial), which has revamped the hub, said.    
	Eco-friendly biocides have been used to remove unwanted vegetation and kill insects. Soil is being treated to remove termites and control rodents, which could also draw birds near the runway, he said.     
	Officials have also blamed meat shops in Dwarka and R.K. Puram, areas close to the airport, for the large number of birds lurking around. Aviation rules forbid slaughter of animals within a 10km radius of an airport.

	Not married and over 50, queue up for Rs 400 a month  if you are a woman and can prove an inability to work.    
	The DMK regime recently decided to pay such spinsters the sum in the form of dole. Over 9,100 of them have been officially spotted as potential beneficiaries.     
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi handed the cheques to the first batch of 15. He had announced the scheme two months ago. The payments are effective from last month.

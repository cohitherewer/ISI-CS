          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 9: Monsoon touched Orissa today, Met officials confirmed.         
	Heavy rains began in the afternoons and continued till evening.         
	The intermittent showers at most parts of coastal and interior Orissa for the past few days was a result of the monsoon onslaught and the rains were supposed to hit Orissa in the next 24 hours.         
	The southern point of the monsoon was tracked to Visakhapatnam and was extending up to Agartala through the Bay of Bengal. The formation of a trough over the bay is likely to strengthen the movement of the monsoon, said S.C. Sahu, the director of Bhubaneswar meteorological centre.        
	The south-west monsoon today covered bits of Orissa, including parts of the southern region, the coastal belt and Mayurbhanj district. The northern limit of monsoon is passing through 21 degree N/60 degree-east, 21 degree N/70 degree east of Verabal, Nasik, Parbani, Hanamkunda, Bhubaneswar, Sriniketan and Forbesganj, a release stated today.        
	The conditions are favourable for further advancement over south Gujarat, remaining parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh Orissa, Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar.         
	Meanwhile, Bhubaneswar experienced sporadic showers recording 8mm rain yesterday. Those were pre-monsoon showers and influenced by cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, Met officials said.        
	Officials have, however, predicted heavy rain at isolated places over Orissa in the next 48 hours.         
	The Met office also released a district-wise forecast for the next five days.

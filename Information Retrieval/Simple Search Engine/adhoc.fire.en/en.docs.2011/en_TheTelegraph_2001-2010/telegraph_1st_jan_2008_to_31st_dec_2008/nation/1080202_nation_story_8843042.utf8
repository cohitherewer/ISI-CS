	Cuttack, Feb. 1: A 15-month-old row over the publishing rights to 76-year-old Oriya lexicon  Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha  took a decisive turn recently when a sessions court rejected an appeal filed by the compilers granddaughter claiming copyright over it.
    
	The court, in October 2006, had imposed a temporary ban on the reproduction of the original manuscript of the book absent from the market for 67 years now. The encyclopaedia is a seven-volume collection with 1,85,000 Oriya words and their meanings explained in Oriya, English, Hindi and Bengali across 9,450 pages. Gopal Chandra Praharaj, a Cuttack lawyer and journalist, compiled the encyclopaedia between 1913 and 1930. 
    
	The citys Utkal Sahitya Press published it between 1931 and 1940. Praharaj died on May 16, 1945. 
    
	The lexicon made news in September 2006 when the proprietor of Lark Books, Mahendra Mishra, published a reprint of the first volume of the Bhashakosh. A legal battle over the publishing rights ensued when descendants of Gopal Chandra Praharaj moved court against the house.
    
	Praharajs great-granddaughter Pratima Praharaj (62) and her daughter Girijanandini Praharaj (41) filed a suit in the court of Cuttacks district sessions court claiming rights over the Bhashakosha. Subsequently, the sessions court passed an interim order restraining Lark Books from further publication till the disposal of the petition.
    
	The legal battle shifted to Orissa High Court when the owner of Lark Books, Mahendra Mishra, challenged the interim stay order. The court however, remitted the matter to the sessions court with a direction for the early disposal of the case in view of the importance of the litigation.
    
	District sessions judge Mukunda Prasad Mishra last week rejected the plea of the Praharaj family saying, the suit is not maintainable. The claim raised by the Praharaj family that they have proprietary right by way of succession was rejected in view of the provision under Section 22 of the India Copyright Act-1957, Pitambar Acharya, the counsel for the publishing house, told The Telegraph.

	Bhubaneswar, April 11: A woman dies every seven minutes from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth in India and in Orissa nine women die every day from the same cause.         
	Orissas Maternal mortality rate (MMR) may have reduced from 367 per 1 lakh childbirths in 1993 to 358 deaths per 1 lakh births in 2003, but there is yet to be a significant reduction. Participants at the Know your entitlements and demand for quality healthcare service organised today on the eve of National Safe Motherhood Day discussed ways to curb this fatal rate.         
	The event, a workshop, was organised by White Ribbon Alliance (WRA), Orissa, in collaboration with the state health and family welfare, Unicef and UNFPA. WRA is a global movement to save mothers from pregnancy and childbirth related deaths that started in 1999. The objective of the programme was to make women and families aware of their entitlements under schemes and policies taken up by the state government. On the eve of the National Safe Motherhood Day, the WRA, Orissa, urged the government to empower women towards a better utilisation of services and access to facility.         
	Policy makers including portfolio holders promised to fulfil health needs and aspiration of the mass and make them equal to the declared Indian Public Standards.         
	Unless we empower women to know their rights and ensure quality, accessible maternal health care, then the MMR would be beyond our reach and would take a decade to be at a par with the declared Millennium Development Goal-5, said family welfare minister, Sanatan Bisi.         
	WRA partners from 30 districts, NGO activists, government officials, and representatives from professional forums urged that women must have the right to highest attainable standards of health and access to emergency obstetric services.        
	In a bid to mobilise public support and reduce maternal, newborn and child deaths, WRA, Orissa, in collaboration with Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health initiated a new advocacy drive through the Deliver now for women amp; children.         
	Deliver Now would be a new advocacy drive to address the issue.         
	Actress Anusuya Dash Chaudhry was announced the safe motherhood ambassador for WRA, Orissa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | School prayer ban
                                                                                                            School prayer ban
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 10: A Kerala government committee has recommended banning religious worship in private schools that receive assistance from the state.         
	The Kerala Education Rules Reforms Committee, headed by former chief secretary C.P. Nair, has also cautioned against allowing religious graffiti on school walls.         
	Both recommendations are being seen as a move to curtail the religious freedom enjoyed by minority communities under the Constitution.         
	Schools run by Christian missionaries hold regular prayers, including the Holy Mass, and walls abound with quotations from the Bible. School buildings and premises are often lent for religious conventions.         
	Schools should not impose religious teaching and only those students who have permission from parents shall attend such classes, the committee has said. It has, instead, suggested moral science classes that inculcate the values of honesty, non-violence and fearlessness in pupils.        
	The committee has come down heavily on the practice of letting out schools for prayer meetings and said all forms of drills and physical training that have a communal colour should be stopped. This recommendation appears to be aimed at keeping RSS drills out of campuses. Of late, an ultra-Islamist student organisation has also started using campuses for its drills.        
	Another highlight of the report is the recommendation to cancel the recognition of schools that deny admission to HIV positive students or segregate them.        
	Education minister M.A. Baby has sought to allay fears among minority communities over the recommendations, saying the government will discuss all points with those concerned before implementing them.         
	The panel has also suggested that mobile phones be banned in schools, vigil on drugs stepped up and no form of intimidation tolerated on campuses.        
	Another suggestion that could run into resistance from private schools is the one on reducing the distance between schools and liquor kiosks from 400 metres to 183 metres. The distance from cemeteries shall be 50 metres.         
	The panel wants only two terminal examinations, instead of the three existing now, and suggests that schools switch to grading instead of awarding ranks based on marks. Also, it is against examinations up to the second standard.

	Srinagar, Oct. 28: The Peoples Democratic Party will participate in next months Assembly elections, making a U-turn after having initially opposed its timing.         
	The fear of being knocked out of Kashmirs political landscape appears to have prompted the change of mind, though the party claims it has taken the decision to facilitate the resolution of the Kashmir issue.         
	We are not contesting municipality elections where we talk of development and solving problems. Elections are part of resolving issues and we tried our best during our three years of rule to facilitate a solution to the Kashmir issue, party president Mehbooba Mufti said today.         
	She said the decision was a hard one as the situation was still not conducive to polls.         
	People are very angry in Kashmir, she said, minutes before releasing the manifesto. It was a challenge and we decided to accept it. We want to break the hegemony of the National Conference, which, along with some babus, is trying to create an impression that the party is going to win.         
	She hit out at the National Conference, which has argued that the Kashmir problem and the polls are separate issues.        
	The PDP had earlier faced public anger for having initially cleared the land allotment for Amarnath pilgrims while in the government with the Congress. Stung by the backlash, the party opposed holding polls this year, saying they should be put off until normality returned.        
	Now, the fear of a split in its ranks seems to have forced a reversal in stand. It was difficult to keep our flock together by staying away from the polls, said a senior leader.         
	The party will, however, not forge any pre-poll alliance and contest all 87 seats.        
	The U-turn comes days after the PDP released its self-rule proposals demanding dual currency for Kashmir and a trans-border upper House.        
	The party manifesto has been carefully crafted to promote soft-separatism by delinking development issues from the resolution of the Kashmir problem.

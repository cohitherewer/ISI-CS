The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mid-July dash awaits deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mid-July dash awaits deal
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, July 2: A race against time awaits the nuclear deal negotiators if the Manmohan Singh government scales the political hurdles.        
	Sources said once the formality of making the governments stand clear to the Left is over, the work for moving the IAEA board of governors should start in right earnest by mid-July.         
	As of now, the IAEA board is slated to meet in September, and it convenes with a notice of 45 days to the members. But since India is a member of the IAEA board of governors, an emergency session can be convened with a 72-hour notice.        
	Before moving to the board of governors, India has to initial the safeguards text with the IAEA secretariat, which, sources said, is not a time-consuming issue as the text has already been negotiated.        
	Then comes a phase of some uncertainty as member-countries can raise possible doubts about the unique safeguards agreement.        
	All the members have to see the safeguards text, and this India-specific agreement being a unique one, some members may take a little while to study it, but we are hopeful of passing that stage at the earliest, a source familiar with the negotiations said.        
	Next will be the turn of the crucial 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which is expected to be moved by the US for a clean waiver.        
	Realistically, we should send the 123 Agreement, the IAEA safeguards text and the NSG waiver to the US Congress by September or a little late. But we have been working on the NSG member-countries for some time. So, we are hopeful of a final-minute rush and making it into the US Congress agenda to save the deal, the source said.        
	Sources said that although the big players in the NSG like Russia and France are on the deals side, they could not ignore the reservations from the strong non-proliferation countries like Australia, Japan, South Africa and the Scandinavian nations.        
	Some of these countries would like to discuss the matter in their domestic platforms before arriving at a decision, which can delay the process.        
	Ackerman damper        
	The US Congress will not have time to approve the nuclear agreement with India, Gary Ackerman, chairman of the House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, told Reuters.         
	Ackerman, who will be in India this week, has been piling pressure on Delhi to keep away from Iran.

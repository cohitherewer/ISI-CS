          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 15: Prakash Karat today criticised the Centre over its US and Israeli ties, saying its foreign policy had deviated from the common minimum programme.        
	The CPM chiefs comments came ahead of the UPA-Left nuclear-deal panels June 18 meeting, and a day after Sonia Gandhi appeared to back the agreement saying nuclear energy had gained much importance because crude prices were rising.        
	In the common minimum programme (CMP) there is a clear absence on strategic relationship with Israel and the US, Karat told a meeting to observe the 60th year of the Palestinian catastrophe.        
	The Congress leadership had also assured us it would follow an independent foreign policy, Karat said.        
	But in the last four years we saw that the UPA government did not fulfil the CMP promises. It is pursuing the strategic relationship with Israel and the US started by the NDA regime in the 1990s.

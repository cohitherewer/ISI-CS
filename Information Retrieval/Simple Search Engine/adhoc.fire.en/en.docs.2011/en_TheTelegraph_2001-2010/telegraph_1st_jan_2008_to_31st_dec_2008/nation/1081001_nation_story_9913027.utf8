The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India back in nuclear fold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     India back in nuclear fold
                            
	Paris, Sept. 30 (PTI): India and France today signed an agreement on civil nuclear co-operation that covers supply of reactors and atomic fuel.        
	The deal is Delhis first concrete step back into the nuclear mainstream after 34 years of international isolation.        
	Sanctions had been imposed on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests of 1974, and also after the 1998 explosions. The US formed the Nuclear Suppliers Group without whose clearance no country could procure nuclear technology or supply of fissile material.         
	We expect to finalise agreements (on civil nuclear co-operation) with other European partners, too, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said after talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy at Elysee Palace here.         
	Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar and French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner signed the Indo-France Civil Nuclear Co-operation Agreement in the presence of the two leaders.         
	Today we have added a new dimension to our strategic partnership by signing an inter-governmental agreement on civil nuclear co-operation, Singh said.         
	France is the first country to open nuclear commerce with India since the 45-member NSG exempted India from its tough guidelines on September 6.        
	The Indo-US nuclear deal is still waiting for the Senates nod.        
	The deal with France will form the basis of wide-ranging bilateral co-operation  from basic and applied research to full civil nuclear co-operation, including reactors, fuel supply, radiation, environment protection and nuclear fuel cycle management.         
	Two other agreements were signed during Singhs two-day visit to Paris. One relates to social security for Indian and French nationals staying in each others country for up to five years. The other is on utilising services of the Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.         
	France is the first country with whom we have entered into such an agreement after the lifting of international restrictions on civil nuclear co-operation with India by the NSG. I conveyed to President Sarkozy our gratitude for Frances consistent support to our civil nuclear initiative, Singh said.         
	A statement on the agreement said both sides recognised nuclear energy as a reliable source of sustainable and non-polluting energy, which could make a significant contribution to meeting the global challenge of achieving energy security.         
	It said both countries shared common concerns in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including possible links to terrorism.

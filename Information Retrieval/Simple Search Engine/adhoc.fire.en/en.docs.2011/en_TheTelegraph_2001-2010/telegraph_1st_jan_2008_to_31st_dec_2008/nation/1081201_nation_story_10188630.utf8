	Mumbai, Nov. 30: Sixteen US officials, some of them from the FBI, who arrived to help with the terror attack probe were detained at the airport today because they were carrying arms without proper documents.        
	When challenged, they were brusque and said they were American government officials and did not need papers, a customs official said.         
	They were let off an hour later.         
	Israel team        
	Israel is sending anti-terror experts to India who will examine if the Mumbai attack was part of a global terror tactic and if Israel needed to adopt mechanisms to tackle the new threat, the website Ynetnews reported.

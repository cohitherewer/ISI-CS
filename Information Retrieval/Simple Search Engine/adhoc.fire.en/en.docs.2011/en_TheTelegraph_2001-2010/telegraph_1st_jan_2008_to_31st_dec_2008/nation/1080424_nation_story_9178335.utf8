          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 23: Perennially drought-prone Orissa received a pat on its back from the Centre for contributing to the central foodgrain pool.         
	Sources said the compliment was passed on to the state in the agriculture ministers conference today in New Delhi presided over by Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar. The Union minister said that states such as Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chhattisgarh were contributing positively to the central pool, while major rice producers like Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Bihar were receiving more rice from the central pool. Orissa had supplied 4lakh tonnes of rice to the central pool last year. This year, its contribution is expected to be higher in view of an all-time record rice production of 91.89 lakh tonnes, a senior official of the agriculture department said.         
	Agriculture minister Surendra Nath Naik, who attended the meeting, demanded a slash in the interest rate on loans from seven per cent to four.

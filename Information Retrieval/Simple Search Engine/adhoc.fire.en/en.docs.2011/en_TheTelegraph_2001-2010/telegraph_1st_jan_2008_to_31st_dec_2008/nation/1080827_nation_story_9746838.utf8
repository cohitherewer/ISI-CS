          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, Aug. 26: The situation at Padampur in Bargarh gradually improved today after heavy police deployment at all sensitive places inside the town.        
	During yesterdays bandh, the township and the Khuntpali village adjacent to it witnessed a spurt in violence as suspected VHP activists set fire to a missionary hostel leading to the death of a 22-year-old, who worked as the hostel caretaker.        
	The deceased Rajani Majhi hailed from Jagdalpur under Jharbandh block and was also a Plus-III student of Padampur College, police said.         
	Today, revenue divisional commissioner of the northern division Jamil Ahmed Khan, director-general of police Y.B. Khurania, Bargarh collector Suresh Chandra Padhi, superintendent of police (SP) Ajay Kumar Biswal and senior officers visited the spot and accelerated police action.         
	Two additional district magistrates are camping at Padampur and Sohela to maintain law and order. Strict vigil is being kept in sensitive pockets and on some people, said Suresh Chandra Padhi.         
	Though the situation is under control, things are not being taken lightly, Padhi added.         
	On yesterdays attacks on churches and missionary institutions, SP Biswal said that it seemed that the incidents were not pre-planned or deliberate.        
	The acts seemed more an emotional retaliation to the seers death, he said, adding: We have arrested three persons at Sohela and vehicles have been seized. The accused will be produced in court today.         
	Khuntpali apart, bandh organisers also attacked churches at Madhupur, Diptipur, Chichinda, Tungibandhli and Ghaghadimal.         
	We are under a lot of pressure now with the election work for urban local bodies also due in some days, said Padhi.

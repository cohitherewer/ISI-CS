          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Manmohan and Sonia after the trust vote. File picture                                        
	New Delhi, July 30: The trust vote won, its payback time for the Congress.        
	The party has begun weighing the demands and expectations of all the players who voted UPA in the floor test to decide how many can be realistically conceded.        
	The Samajwadi Party has apparently conveyed its desire to be included in the council of ministers, but has vowed to be reasonable.        
	Having dilly-dallied over joining the government, it has come around to the view that its presence will give the much-needed sense of stability to the UPA.        
	Party boss Mulayam Singh Yadav had thought as much from the start. But he did not push too hard, as there were noises that his loyalists had overplayed their hand by going public with their hopes.        
	Lets not get into the numbers business at this stage, how many ministers we want and so on. Negotiations are on and we dont want to jeopardise the process, a Samajwadi leader said two days ago.        
	The UPA has its task cut out. One, the council of ministers cannot exceed 82. At present, there are only two vacancies and too many hopefuls, especially from the JMM.        
	Two, while setting up the council of ministers in 2004, it had evolved a rough-and-ready yardstick of giving representation in proportion to the size of the parliamentary party.        
	If this principle is followed, the Samajwadi Party, with its 30 MPs, will be entitled to 12 ministerial berths.        
	Congress sources said there was no way Mulayam could get so many ministers. A few can be inducted. We are sure Mulayam is reasonable because his stakes in keeping this government going are as high as ours, a source said.        
	Samajwadi sources said they would be practical and accommodating up to a point.        
	The Congress sources said party ministers were likely to be the casualties of the cut-and-paste exercise that would kick off after the Prime Minister returns from Colombo next week.        
	Those holding dual portfolios in the government could lose one of them. Those who are ministers and party functionaries will probably be brought back to the party, a source said.

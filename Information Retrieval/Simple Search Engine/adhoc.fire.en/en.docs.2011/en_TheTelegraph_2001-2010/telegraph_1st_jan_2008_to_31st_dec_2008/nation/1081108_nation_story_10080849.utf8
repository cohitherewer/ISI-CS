          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The Centre will reward madarsas if they choose to teach science, mathematics and English but has stopped short of making these subjects compulsory as suggested by a minority education panel.        
	Under a new Rs 325-crore Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrassas, the government will assist madarsas willing to introduce modern subjects like science, mathematics, social studies and English.        
	Since the benefits include a raft of financial incentives, including doubling or tripling teacher salaries, officials do not fear much resistance.        
	Earlier, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions had proposed a central madarsa board that would make these subjects mandatory at all madarsas and try to develop a secular outlook among students.        
	That proposal ran into protests from many Muslim organisations, which saw it as government interference and an attack on the religious character of madarsas. The new scheme leaves the matter to the madarsas themselves.        
	Madarsas that introduce the recommended subjects can seek a link with the National Institute of Open Schooling and adopt its syllabi for these subjects. The government will provide financial and technical support. The madarsas will receive Rs 1 lakh each to set up science and computer labs and Rs 50,000 to buy books for their libraries.         
	Primary madarsa teachers salaries would rise from Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000. Those who teach at the secondary and higher-secondary level and have a postgraduate and BEd degree will see their pay trebled from Rs 4,000 to 12,000.        
	The earlier proposal for a central madarsa board on the lines of the Central Board of Secondary Education would have made the madarsa system more streamlined and modern. But it created so much controversy that we thought it better to go for a voluntary scheme, a Union minority affairs ministry official said.        
	The minority education commissions proposals, made in 2006, had suggested rooting out the gender divide and revising madarsa curricula to promote a secular outlook.

                                                                                                               Sleaze slur on teachers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 14: The usually quiet campus of Sangeet Mahavidyalaya witnessed loud protests today as students sat on a dharna to demand immediate suspension of two lecturers.         
	Earlier, on Tuesday, students had submitted a written allegation to the principal to demand the dismissal of Sukesh Panda and Bhabani Biswal  two lecturers accused of misdemeanour.         
	While Panda is a faculty in the department of drama, Biswal teaches Chhau and has taken up the additional charge as the hotel superintendent.        
	The institutes students stress that the teachers have been misusing their positions and have used language that is unbecoming.        
	In the morning, agitated students locked college gates for some two hours and went on a rampage in parts of the music building. Some squatted in front of the main entrance for hours. The trouble continued till police intervened.        
	The teachers have been using abuses, said Sanatan Jena, a student.         
	The students also alleged that the two would often discuss topics unrelated to the syllabus in class.         
	Sometimes what they discussed embarrassed us. Mostly, the topics had nothing to do with the formal syllabus, said Snehasudha Nayak, a student.         
	We were silent for a long, but they also misbehaved with some of the guardians. The authorities cant turn a deaf ear to our complaints anymore, said Balram Majhi, a student.         
	However, principal (in-charge) Sunil Singh Mahato, who joined only a month ago, did not think the matter was urgent then.         
	Today the students entered my chamber unannounced in the morning to demand action. It was difficult to explain to them that everything had to be done according to official procedure. I am bound by official rules, said Mahato.         
	I have discussed the matter with the students and an inquiry will be held on the matter, said he.         
	The teachers were not available for comments.         
	Police explained that it was not possible to act against the teachers as no formal complaints had been lodged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre shunts defiant general
                                                                                                               Centre shunts defiant general
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The government today threw the military handbook at one of the seniormost generals in the Indian Army and transferred him from the largest and most active northern command to the relatively quieter central command despite his protestations.         
	Lieutenant General Harcharanjit Singh Panag had sought the intervention of defence minister A.K. Antony after the army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, recommended his transfer from the Udhampur-headquartered command that oversees Jammu and Kashmir, the Line of Control and the Siachen Glacier.        
	In transferring Panag from Udhampur to Allahabad, Antony has upheld the prerogative of the army chief to transfer and post officers. Anything else would have seriously undermined the army chiefs authority. The postings and transfers of army commanders are approved by the Cabinet Committee on Appointments.        
	Lt Gen Panag is to replace Lt Gen .P. Nandrajog in the central command. Nandrajog is scheduled to retire on February 29.         
	The government also named Lt Gen P.C. Bharadwaj, currently commander of the Leh-based 14 corps, to replace Lt Gen Panag as the new northern army commander.        
	Lt Gen V.K. Singh, currently commander of the 2 (strike) corps, will take over as the eastern army commander and will be based in Fort William, Calcutta. Singh, who is in line to take over as army chief after Kapoor retires, will replace Lt Gen K.S. Jamwal who retires from Fort William on February 29.         
	But Panags transfer will still not be without its repercussions, not least because the northern commander had positioned himself as a crusader against corruption whose campaign was getting too hot for army headquarters.        
	A record number of courts martial and investigations was ordered by Panag into cases that went back to Kapoors term as northern army commander.         
	Panag took his tiff with the army chief to the political level when he met Antony in New Delhi on January 5. The ministers position has been that he committed no breach of protocol in granting an audience to a disgruntled officer. But the act shocked the military.         
	In the central command that Panag is now destined to head, his main job would be to keep track of the Maoist movement in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Although the army is not deployed against the Maoists, it is tasked to monitor the rebels and train central and state police forces in military counter-insurgency tactics.

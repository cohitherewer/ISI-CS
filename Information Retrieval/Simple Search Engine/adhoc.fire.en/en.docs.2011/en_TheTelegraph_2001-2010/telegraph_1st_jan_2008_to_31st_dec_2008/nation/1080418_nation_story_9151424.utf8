          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 17: A special panel has decided to seek the Centres nod to relax norms in the development schemes to facilitate growth in the red hubs across the state.         
	The decision was taken after several meetings where it was observed that two primary problems  non-availability of funds and stringent norms retarded the growth in the rebel-hit areas, said the home secretary.        
	The empowered committee on special plan in red hubs, headed by chief secretary Ajit Tripathy, decided to move the Centre seeking relaxation of norms to push progress.         
	The committee met today to finalise a pilot plan for a holistic scheme for Malkangiri and Rayagada.         
	The panel especially focussed on norms that disallow road construction in sparsely populated and remote pockets under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.         
	In the inaccessible pockets, the cost of construction is usually higher and contractors are generally reluctant to work there because of the red threat.        
	Similar problems in the implementation of the watershed development programmes were also discussed, said state home secretary T.K. Mishra.         
	Secretaries of related departments and collectors of districts concerned gave their views and suggestions for the holistic plan at the meeting. One of the suggestions was to keep a special discretionary fund at the disposal of the district collectors concerned to meet unforeseen expenditures.         
	Others included special incentives for employees working in affected areas, as in the case of police staff who get an additional allowance of 15 per cent of their basic pay.         
	Besides Malkangiri and Rayagada, the holistic plan will be formulated for 14 other districts in three phases.         
	Plans will be drawn up for Deogarh, Sambalpur and Gajapati in the second phase, followed by Koraput, Ganjam, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Nowrangpur and Sundargarh in the final leg.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, June 12: The director of Earthquake Risk Evaluation Centre of the Union meteorological department, A.K. Shukla, leading a three-member team, arrived in the town today to study the tremors being felt in Gaya.        
	The team would be conducting a two-week study of the phenomenon that has caused panic in the township. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was also worried by the recurrent tremors, personally invited the experts.        
	Talking to reporters soon after their arrival, Shukla said that there was no basis to rumours stating that a high-intensity earthquake may follow the tremors. There was no mechanism to predict earthquakes, he added.         
	The expert said that Gaya fell in a less vulnerable zone (Zone-III), while Zone-V comprising Himalayan region, the Northeast and Kashmir were the high-risk areas.         
	The expert confirmed that Gaya was the epicentre of all the recently felt tremors. Tremors of 4.7 and 3.3 intensity on the Richter Scale were felt on June 7, 2008, and June 9, 2008.         
	There are 51 observatories in India and observatories located at Bokaro and Varanasi are closest to Gaya.        
	Shukla said, if need be, the team would prolong its Gaya stay beyond the two-week period to conduct soil test to ascertain whether the Gaya soil was earthquake resistant or it facilitated smooth movement of tremor waves.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Veil to lift on IIT entrance cut-off

	New Delhi, July 30: The Indian Institutes of Technology will reveal cut-off marks used to select students in this years entrance exam, allowing candidates for the first time to independently verify whether their scores merit a seat.         
	On August 1, the IITs will display online the cut-off marks used in their Joint Entrance Examination 2008 to pick the top performers in the test, exam organisers have said.         
	The decision to reveal the cut-offs was taken by the IIT Joint Administrative Board, the highest decision- making body for the JEE, after The Telegraph exposed crucial discrepancies in the selection procedure followed in 2006, the exam organisers confirmed.         
	Nearly a year ago, on August 5, 2007, The Telegraph had revealed a mismatch between cut-offs used by the IITs in JEE 2006, and the cut-offs obtained using a formula they claimed to have used.         
	There have been concerns among the public that we are keeping crucial information regarding the JEE hidden, even though we believe the exam is transparent. This move will help clarify any misconceptions, professor N.M. Bhandari, the chairman of the JEE organising committee at IIT Roorkee, said.         
	The IITs will also disclose, on the same day, details of opening and closing ranks for students belonging to each category  general, Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, physically handicapped  Bhandari said.         
	For an entire month  from August 1 to August 31  students can see their scores online. On August 1, the question papers from this years exam, and the key to the papers, will also be displayed online, allowing students who remember their answers an opportunity to match their scores with their performance.         
	Both the subject cut-offs  in physics, chemistry and mathematics  and the aggregate cut-off used to screen students who have cleared all subject cut-offs, will be displayed on the JEE website  http://jee.iitr.ernet.in  officials confirmed.         
	Hopefully, all the details should be online by 8am, Bhandari said.

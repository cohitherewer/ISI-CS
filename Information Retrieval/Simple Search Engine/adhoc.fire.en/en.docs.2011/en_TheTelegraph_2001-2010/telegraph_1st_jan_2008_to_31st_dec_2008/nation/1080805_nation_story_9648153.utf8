          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                                    
	Shimla, Aug. 4: Himachal Pradesh will consider adopting the Vaishno Devi model to regulate pilgrim movement, chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said a day after a temple stampede killed 151 and injured over 300.        
	At Jammu and Kashmirs Vaishno Devi temple, devotees have to register before being allowed to proceed in batches. Dhumal today formed a three-member committee to come up with suggestions on security for pilgrims.        
	Police said they would post plainclothes personnel at temples to arrest those who spread rumours. A rumour of a landslide had set off the temple stampede yesterday at the Naina Devi shrine, 160km from here. Most of the victims were women and children.        
	The allegation that a police lathi-charge had contributed to the stampede, however, went bust with many survivors claiming there were no policemen at the temple, crammed with 20,000 pilgrims inside and another 80,000 outside.        
	But officers were unwilling to accept that the 350 policemen, 350 home guards and 300 sevadars (religious servants) on duty had played truant en masse.

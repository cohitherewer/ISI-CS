          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Police seize hooch stored in soft drink bottles. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 27: The state has decided to tackle the manpower shortage in the excise department by creating three more posts of district superintendents and 23 posts of deputy superintendents.         
	A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday evening. Over the past few months the department was drawing flak over the rise in excise-related crimes and hooch tragedies.         
	Two years ago, twin cases of spurious liquor deaths in Ganjam, rocked the home district of the chief minister.         
	Former excise minister Kalindi Behera had to resign on moral grounds after the hooch tragedies.         
	The state government had appointed Justice P.K. Patra commission to probe into circumstances leading to the tragedies and find out administrative lapses, if any.         
	According to a reliable source, Patra Commission has recommended the government to strengthen the department.         
	The standing committee of the Assembly, related to excise department, had also suggested to fill up vacancies and create more posts to meet the immediate challenges.         
	The Orissa Excise Association has also been clamouring for more power and better service conditions. Against this backdrop, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had convened the evenings meeting to discuss the issues.         
	At the meeting it was decided that chief secretary Ajit Tripathy would examine the association demands and submit a report to the chief minister. On the basis of the report, a final decision would be taken. It was also decided to create three posts of district excise superintendents, so that all the 30 revenue districts have such posts.         
	Presently, there are 27 district excise superintendent posts, who are responsible for 30 revenue districts. It was also decided to create 23 more deputy excise superintendent posts. Earlier, there were 21 such posts till 1994. Fourteen of these posts were upgraded to the posts of excise superintendent in the same year, thus reducing the number of deputy superintendent posts to seven.        
	With the creation of 23 more posts, there will be deputy superintendents for all 30 state districts. The associations demand for according Grade-II gazette rank to excise inspectors will be examined by the chief secretary.         
	However, the demand for direct promotion of excise inspectors to the post of excise superintendents was rejected.         
	A tentative decision was taken to extended all the service benefits to the excise constables at a par with forest and fire service staff.

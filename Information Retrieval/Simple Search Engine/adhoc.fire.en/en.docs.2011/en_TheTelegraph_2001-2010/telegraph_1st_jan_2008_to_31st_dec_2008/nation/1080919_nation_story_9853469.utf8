                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Seat worries for BJD

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 18: The ruling BJD seems to be on a sticky wicket for tomorrows civic body elections, as it has failed to go for seat adjustment with its coalition partner BJP in more than half of the urban bodies with also facing a strong anti-incumbency factor.        
	The fledgling regional outfit has been making seat adjustment with BJP for the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections since its inception in 1997 and this has helped it ride to power in the state for two consecutive terms.        
	But down the lines, the ruling coalition partners have failed to maintain their electoral understanding at the urban local body level. The two allies could manage to make seat adjustment in only 32 out of total 91 urban local bodies going to polls tomorrow. They are locked in friendly contest in the rest 59 civic bodies. The chaos and confusion among the two allies is more evident from the fact that out of 1,550 wards in which polling is being held, BJD has set up candidates in as many as 1,265 wards and BJP in 959 wards.        
	At very few places like Bhadrak, leaders of the two ruling parties are sharing joint platform. Both are rather trying to out beat each other to occupy the maximum number of municipal councils independently. This was virtually a trial of strength between two ruling coalition partners ahead of the coming Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, said Rabi Das, a veteran political observer.        
	In fact, the junior coalition partner BJP has been demanding a change in old seat adjustment formula (12:9 for Lok Sabha and 84:63 for Assembly polls).        
	Chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik, who campaigned for party candidates across the state, exuded confidence that his party would notch the top position in the civic poll. On the other hand, BJP state president Suresh Pujari hoped that his party would achieve a spectacular success this time.         
	Admitting their failure in making seat adjustments with BJD at many places, Pujari explained: It was difficult to adjust with aspirations of the party candidates and cadres at the local level.        
	Apart from the cross fighting, the other major obstacle for the ruling parties has been anti-incumbency factor, said Surya Mishra, a professor in political science in Utkal University.        
	BJD is heading the maximum 40 outgoing civic councils and BJP 25 out of total 95 urban local bodies. Obviously, candidates of both the ruling parties had to face a barrage of questions from the voters on their performance or failures.        
	While the Opposition parties nailed the ruling BJD-BJP for the lack of development in the urban local bodies ruled by them, the latter tried to shift the blame on Congress for its misrule during the previous regime and neglect and apathy of the UPA government at the Centre. Orissa PCC president Jaydev Jena, who led the campaign for his party, alleged that the BJD-BJP government had failed to spend the funds released by the UPA government under various urban schemes. The urban body representatives of the two ruling parties had misappropriated most of the central funds, he charged.

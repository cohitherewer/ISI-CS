	Islamabad, Dec. 18 (Agencies): Pakistan today summoned a senior Indian diplomat to formally complain about violations of its airspace, days after President Asif Ali Zardari downplayed the alleged breaches by IAF warplanes as technical.        
	Indian deputy high commissioner Manpreet Vohra was handed over a note by Pakistans additional secretary (South Asia) Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry at the foreign office this morning, diplomatic sources said.        
	The note expressed Pakistans concern about the alleged intrusions, officials said.        
	Vohra said he would pass on the complaint to his government but added that India had already denied the allegation. Our government, after holding an inquiry, has already said that there was no airspace violation from our side, and I reiterated this stance today, he told AP.        
	The India foreign ministry repeated the denial but said the note verbale given by the Pakistani foreign office today will be examined and responded to appropriately.        
	Islamabad claims two Indian Air Force jets violated its airspace in the Lahore and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir sectors on Saturday. A Pakistan Air Force spokesperson said the jets were forced back over the border by their planes.        
	Zardari had said on Sunday the planes were flying at 40,000-50,000ft when they executed a turn that slightly entered Pakistan soil. There are two versions about the incursions. My version is the correct version, he said.         
	Defence purchase        
	Pakistan is to buy an airborne warning and control system (Awacs) from China to boost its air defences, a Pakistani newspaper said. The News said a $278-million agreement had been struck to get the Chinese system within four years, on a deferred payment basis.        
	Last month, Pakistan was granted a $7.6-billion loan by the IMF to avert a balance of payments crisis and prevent the government defaulting on its international debt obligations.

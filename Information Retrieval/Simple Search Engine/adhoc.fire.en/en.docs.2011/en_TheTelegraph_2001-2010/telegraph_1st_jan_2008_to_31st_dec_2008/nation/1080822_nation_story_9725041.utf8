	Patna, Aug. 21: Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters today dropped food packets and relief materials in areas on the Indo-Nepal border even as Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kumar Dahal Prachanda responded to the state governments plea to provide security to countrys engineers working at Kusaha in Saptari district of his country.         
	Two days have passed since two breaches were formed on the Saptakosi barrage at Kusaha near Birput  that flooded Indo-Nepal border districts, including Supaul, Madehpura, Araria, Purnea and Farbesganj, besides parts of northern Nepal.         
	Till today, water has ravaged 500-odd homes in the Amaur block of Purnea.        
	Hundreds have taken shelter on the embankments, highways and railway tracks along the border and in border towns, while water has flooded the track along the Saharsa-Farbesganj section of the East Central Railway  halting traffic.         
	Yesterday, countrys engineers, who are engaged in checking erosion and repairing the Saptkosi barrage at Kusaha, have complained of trouble being created by Nepalese residents and some mischief makers.         
	Keeping in mind the safety of the countrys engineers, the Bihar chief minister today sought the help of the Nepal Prime Minister.         
	Prachanda, on his part, has assured of special security around the countrys engineers, sources in the home department said.         
	Also, the Nepalese Prime Minister carried out an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas of his country, officials of the Indian embassy at Kathmandu reported.         
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar, too, carried out an aerial survey of the areas, under the Indian side, and conducted two emergency meetings with senior officers regarding the flood problem.        
	He also called in the Indian Army and Air Forces help, besides called a team of the national disaster management force.         
	The state government, for now, has deployed two IAS officers, two officials in the rank of additional district magistrate and two deputy superintendents of police to oversee the relief work.         
	Today was the first day of the operations.         
	Sources in the state disaster management department said that nearly 60 personnel from the national disaster management force reached Bihar in the evening to join the special auxiliary force  already engaged in relief operations in Supaul, Saharsa, Nadehpura and Araria.         
	Water resources department officials estimated that the flood has, so far, affected over 850 villages in Muzaffarapur, Supaul, Saharsa, Madhepura, Katihar, Araria, West Champaran, Khagaria, Sitamarhi, Patna and Nalanda though the enormity of the deluge is relatively less in districts far from the Indo-Nepal border.         
	Over 7lakh people are said to be battling with the flood fury, as major rivers, such as the Ganga, Punpun, Ghaghra, Burhigandak, Bagmati, Kosi and Mahananda, are flowing above the danger mark.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, June 18: A complaint filed by Cuttack district authorities against former Union minister Kanhu Charan Lenka in the court of sub-divisional magistrate on Tuesday has become a glaring example of procedural delay.        
	The complaint alleged that the senior Congress leader had filed a false affidavit on April 7, 2004.         
	Yesterdays complaint was filed nearly four years after the period of limitation, which is a year from the date of the alleged offence.         
	The complaint against Lenka should have been filed within April 7, 2005.         
	On March 9, 2007, Cuttack sub-collector had filed the complaint alleging that Samir Dey had furnished false information to the returning officer on April 4, 2004, before contesting from Cuttack Assembly constituency.         
	On March 13, 2007, Cuttacks SDJM court refused to take cognisance of the complaint because of the delay in filing the complaint.         
	But it seems that the district administration has learnt little from the previous court verdict.

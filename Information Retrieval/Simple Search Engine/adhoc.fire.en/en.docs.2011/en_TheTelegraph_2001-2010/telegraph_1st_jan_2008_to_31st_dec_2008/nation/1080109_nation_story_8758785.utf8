	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 8: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today received bouquet from one team and brickbats from another.        
	The visit of the fact-finding team of National Commission for Minorities ended today with the team remaining in the state capital, instead of visiting clash sites, throughout the visit. The two-member team comprising Zoya Hasan and Dillip Padgaonkar met Governor M.C. Bhandare, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, senior government officials and a number of NGO representatives here today before leaving for New Delhi.         
	It was a fruitful discussion, said Dillip Padgaonkar.         
	Yesterday, the team was scheduled to visit Barakhama, one of the worst hit areas, where two persons were killed in the clashes. But, the programme was cancelled at the last moment and the team returned to Bhubaneswar last evening. The reason for the cancellation was the hilly terrain. It was very difficult on our part to go every, explained Padgaonkar.         
	But he added that the discussions that the two had were fruitful.         
	We met people, who had come from far-flung areas, from the district headquarters of the clash-hit areas. We discussed all points with them. We have met as many individuals and groups as we could, he offered as an explanation.        
	Before calling on the governor today, the team also had a detailed conversation with the chief minister, who gave a precise idea about the measures taken up by the administration and its future course of action regarding relief and rehabilitation.         
	Earlier in the morning, the two had a round of discussion with government officials including chief secretary Ajit Tripathy and home secretary TK Mishra.         
	While talking to the press today the team refused to divulge their findings to the reporters. Our observations will be communicated to the commission first. Thats the procedure we follow, explained Hasan. Though the report remained a secret, that the team was happy with the arrangements was clear enough as Padgaonkar complimented the government for the excellent arrangements.         
	Later, chief minister Naveen Patnaik admitted that he had a thorough discussion with the NCM team on the Khandhamal situation. Khandhamal is calm and peaceful now, he repeated. Naveen, however, evaded the Opposition demand to convene an all-party meet to review the situation.         
	Meanwhile, another team were less happy with Naveen. A group comprising members of womens organisations, which visited the riot-affected areas, criticised the substandard relief materials being distributed to the victims.        
	They should be provided better blankets since its chilly in Khandhamal, demanded Tapasi Praharaj, the general secretary of the state unit of All India Democratic Womens Association.

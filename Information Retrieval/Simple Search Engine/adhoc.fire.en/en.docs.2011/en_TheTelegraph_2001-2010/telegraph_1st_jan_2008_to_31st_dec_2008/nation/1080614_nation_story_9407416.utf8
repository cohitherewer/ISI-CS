          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 13: The government has started investigations into the murder of Choudwar Central Jail inmate Krushna Chandra Behera (43). He was killed by another inmate, Pratap Khatei.        
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra began the probe on Thursday with a visit to the prison late in the afternoon.         
	During investigations, Mishra would be checking lapses (if any) in the prison duties and how Pratap managed to carry a broken, steel handle of a karchuli (serving spoon) from the kitchen to ward number 19 and stab Krushna.         
	Jail superintendent Dharani Dhar Das said the home secretary was in the prison till 6pm, but refused to divulge further details.         
	Sources said Mishra quizzed the staff regarding the sequence of events that led to the death. Jail superintendent reportedly confirmed that Pratap suffers from psychiatric problems and was under treatment for a month between March and April 2008. The administration further maintained that a profusely bleeding Krushna was immediately shifted to the SCB Medical College, Cuttack, after being administered first aid.         
	Surgeons at SCB Medical Hospital were not able to carry out a required operation, as the convict had high blood pressure. The stab in his back had ruptured his lungs. He was declared dead at 9.05am on June 10.         
	Pratap (31) allegedly stabbed Krushna in the back first and then in the stomach when he turned. He had slipped out of the cell immediately after Krushna left. The 18 other inmates had no inkling of his intention. The incident occurred around 8.15pm on Monday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuclear nudge, not push
                                                                                                            Nuclear nudge, not push
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mulford                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: US ambassador David C. Mulford today said it was advisable for India to try and conclude the civilian nuclear deal with the current Bush administration but we are not pushing.         
	The ambassador was asked if time was running out for the 123 Agreement because India had yet to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the teeth of opposition from the Left.         
	We have kept our eye on the timeline and we are sensitive to the point that time is passing. If the processes are not finished during the term of this administration, then we must understand that there will be a new administration in the US and also a new Congress, Mulford said.         
	It is practical if the process is completed during the tenure of the current government. In that sense, a timeline is important. There are practical problems here and it is desirable that we move forward. But we are not pushing. We are patiently waiting for India to complete the processes, he said.         
	Despite the delay in concluding the nuclear deal, however, the India-US relationship was growing more comprehensive. Mulford outlined as many as 10 areas in which the relationship had grown in the four years of his tenure in India. The relationship was not deal-centric but the US believed it is good for India, good for the US and good for the world.         
	Mulford said the Hyde Act which enabled the deal had bi-partisan support (from the ruling Republicans as well as from the Opposition Democrats), but when a new administration is in place in the US, it would be difficult for the deal to be taken up with the same gusto as that of the Bush administration.         
	He said the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, was expected in New Delhi in February. An India-US defence policy group meeting earlier this month in Washington had reviewed the defence relationship between the two countries. Mulford said a Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) and an agreement on military communication secrecy between India and the US were being negotiated for a long time.         
	The LSA is pending with the cabinet committee on security and it is difficult for the UPA to go ahead and sign it despite opposition from the Left. However, Mulford said, the LSA is potentially of great importance to the Indian military to ease the operational abilities of the two military forces. He acknowledged that there were certain sensitivities involved.

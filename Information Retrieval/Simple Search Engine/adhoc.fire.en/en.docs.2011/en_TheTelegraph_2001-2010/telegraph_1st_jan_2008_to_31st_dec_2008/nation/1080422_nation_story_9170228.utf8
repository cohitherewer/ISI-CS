Your line can be cut
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 21: If your dependent parents phone bills are left unpaid, your line can be cut along with theirs.        
	The Supreme Court today ruled that an earning subscribers phone connection can be snapped over a dependants bill arrears. The assumption is that the earning member pays for both connections.        
	The ruling applies only to connections bought from the state-owned telecom service providers, BSNL and MTNL, but relates to both landline and mobile phones. And it applies whether or not the landline phones are installed under the same roof.        
	But if two family members are both earning, the connection of one cannot be cut because the other hasnt paid his or her bills, the two-judge bench said.        
	We have to draw a distinction between cases where a relative, though living in the same house, has an independent source of income, and cases where one is dependent on another, the court said.        
	There can be a case where the husband and wife both have independent sources of income, and the wife is paying her bills whereas the husband is paying (the) bills for his own line. In such a case, for non-payment of the wifes bill, the husbands telephone line cannot be disconnected.        
	The ruling came on a case filed by a Delhi resident, whose phones were disconnected because his wifes bills had not been paid.        
	Surjit Singh had challenged a Delhi High Court order of January 10, 2002, upholding MTNLs decision to snap his wifes line as well as two other lines held in the petitioners own name.        
	Surjit and his wife had two separate numbers at their home in Rajouri Garden  one for each  and the husband had one in his name at his office near Jama Masjid.        
	Surjits lawyer argued that the law did not allow MTNL to cut his clients lines, but the apex court rejected the claim. It observed that the wife was a homemaker without an independent source of income from any business or service.        
	It can be inferred that payment of the bill of the telephone line in the name of the appellants wife was being made by the appellant himself, the court said.        
	It also rejected the argument that the service provider could cut only the defaulting subscribers line, saying it could not take such a literal view.        
	The intention (behind the rule) obviously was that payment of telephone dues should be made promptly, otherwise the department would suffer. We have, therefore, to take an interpretation that effectuates and furthers the intention of Rule 443 (of the Indian Telegraph Act), i.e. telephone bills should be paid on time, the judges said.        
	Also, it would make no difference whether the telephone line is at the residence or on the business premises, even if the two are entirely separate. Hence, in our opinion, both the telephone lines in the name of the appellant, one at his residence and the other at his business premises, can be disconnected.        
	The court said that unless the law was broadly interpreted, the department would face a funds crunch.        
	 After all, salaries of employees have to be paid, telephone equipment has to be maintained, repaired and kept up-to-date. Sometimes new technology has to be introduced, the court observed.        
	There may be various other requirements for which funds may be required, and all these can only be possible if telephone bills are paid on time.

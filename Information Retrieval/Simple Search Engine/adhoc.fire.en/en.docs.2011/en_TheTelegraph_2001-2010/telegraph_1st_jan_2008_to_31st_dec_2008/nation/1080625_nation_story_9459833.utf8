The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong to push non-US deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cong to push non-US deal

	New Delhi, June 24: Tomorrow, the UPA is likely to plead with the Left to let the Centre go ahead with the nuclear deal under a plan that envisages nuclear trade with countries other than the US.        
	Not everyone in the government is hopeful that this line of argument will work, though.         
	Congress leaders are expected to tell the UPA-Left panel meeting that the Centre plans a parallel exercise  apart from going to the International Atomic Energy Agency with the safeguards agreement  to get the Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver.        
	The argument is: NSG exemption will allow Delhi to start trading in nuclear fuel and reactors with countries like Russia and France without waiting for the US Congress to pass the 123 Agreement.        
	Second, the Left will be assured that the government would take the sense of Parliament before the deal was operationalised. And operationalisation would now mean nuclear trade with countries other than America on mutually beneficial terms.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have agreed to this strategy.        
	The coupling of the IAEA and the NSG will help us de-link the deal from the US by creating a level-playing field with other countries. All we are asking the Left to do is open the doors for us, a Congress source said.        
	He added that the IAEA and NSG phases could not, anyway, be de-linked now. India had conceded some ground while bargaining on the safeguards text on the understanding that the NSG would suitably reciprocate when it came into the picture.        
	A government source, however, was sceptical.        
	Nobody (in the Left) is nave enough to believe that the US can be tossed aside. Washingtons veto is all-important in the NSG, where several countries believe that the US has yielded a sweetheart deal to us, the source said.        
	Will anyone believe us if we say use the US to get the NSGs waiver and then junk them to do business with countries with which the Left doesnt have a problem?        
	Congress leaders said a definite decision might have to be taken before July 7, when the Prime Minister leaves for the G8 summit, which is to be attended by the US President. Singh is believed to have told Sonia Gandhi he saw no point in going to Japan if the nuclear deal was left hanging.        
	A dominant section of the party believes that the deal is too far gone for the government to back off. If we abandon it, the BJP will go to town saying the Congress had bartered away the national interest for its political interests. That campaign is more dangerous than having to answer the Lefts charge of cosying up to the US, a source said.        
	With Sonia backing the Prime Minister, many in the Congress are weighing possible timetables for a general election in case the Left withdraws support.        
	Some leaders think the efforts at a consensus should go on till the last week of August, when the monsoon session of Parliament ends.

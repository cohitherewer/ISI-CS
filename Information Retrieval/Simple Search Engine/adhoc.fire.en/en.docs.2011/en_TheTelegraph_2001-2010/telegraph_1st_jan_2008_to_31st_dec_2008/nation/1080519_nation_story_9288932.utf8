          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 18: The Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissionerate today launched a community policing system in the Nayapalli area of Bhubaneswar.         
	Police commissioner Bijay Kumar Sharma inaugurated the event.         
	The programme would involve effective police-public co-operation and better co-ordination between the two sectors on matter of law and order.        
	Under the programme, plans are on to start two Bhubaneswar police stations with Common Integrated Police Application (Cipa) system under which a complainant would be able to file an FIR and receive an instant copy of it. The stations would also document records and profiles of deviant elements in the neighbourhood.        
	For now, a set of five computers has been provided to the two police stations for the programme. However, most officers are computer illiterate.        
	A senior citizen cell, similar to the existing one at the crime branch, is also being considered. We are planning to introduce a similar cell in the commissionerate.         
	For the programme, a constable would be responsible for patrolling an area every week and talking to senior citizens there about their problems, said commissioner Sharma. Many retired government officials and prominent citizens showed up for todays event.        
	In the absence of sufficient staff and infrastructure, its next to impossible for the police to single-handedly manage law and order. Public co-operation is essential, conceded Pranakrushna Mishra, the president of Nayapalli Community Care Association, talking at the programme.        
	Former deputy-general of police B.B. Mishra, who also attended the event, said: At present with the volume of problems Nayapalli has, it requires at least 10 sub-inspectors and 30 constables  which our system cannot supply. Therefore community policing is inevitable, he said.         
	Emphasising on the need for community policing, Sharma said: The two cities have an educated and a conscious population. They are enthusiastic and willing to co-operate with the police.         
	This is our first initiative and we will soon been implementing it in parts of Cuttack, he said.         
	The commissionerate is targeting residential welfare associations operating in both the cities.        
	We will assess the impact of the community policing in the forthcoming days and judge its need, said Sharma.         
	Our priority will also remain making the police technologically savvy, said he.

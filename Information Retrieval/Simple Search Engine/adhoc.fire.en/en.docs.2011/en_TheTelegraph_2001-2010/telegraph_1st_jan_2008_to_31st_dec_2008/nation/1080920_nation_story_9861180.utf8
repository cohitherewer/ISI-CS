The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jammu clamour for more seats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jammu clamour for more seats
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Sept. 19: Political parties in Jammu are campaigning for delimitation to increase the number of Assembly segments in the region that has nine seats less than the Kashmir Valley.        
	The increase in the number of seats  Jammu has 37 seats and Kashmir 46  would empower the people, according to the parties. The Congress, BJP, Jammu State Morcha and the Panthers Party see this as an election issue at a time peace has returned to the region after almost two months of strife with Kashmir over the Amarnath land.        
	Panthers Party leader Harsh Dev Singh said: We have already got around a lakh signatures and more people are coming forward. Delimitation is the demand of every family in Jammu and it should be accomplished before the polls. BJP state president Ashok Khajuria said this was Jammus biggest demand.        
	Kashmir has 46 Assembly constituencies and Jammu 37 although we have more voters and area than Kashmir. We want at least parity in seats between the two regions, Singh said. Jammu had 31 lakh voters and Kashmir 28 lakh during the 2002 Assembly elections, he said. Both the area and number of voters are in our favour.         
	Although the 2001 census agrees with Singhs claim of more area  Jammu covers 26,289sqkm and Kashmir 15,948km  it puts a question mark on the claim of more voters as Jammu has fewer people than Kashmir. According to the census figures, the population in the Valley is 54.76 lakh and that of Jammu is 44.3 lakh.         
	There is a catch, though. Jammus population includes around 1.5 lakh Kashmiri Pandits, who are enrolled as voters in Kashmir, not Jammu. They are included in the Jammu population because at the time of the census, they were living there (and continue to do so), said Chandreshekhar, the director of the state census department. Kashmir has around 1.3 million people more than Jammu if you include Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley population, another senior officer in the department said.         
	Jammu and Kashmirs chief electoral officer B.R. Sharma said the latest revised electoral rolls show that the number of voters in Kashmir is 32 lakh and in Jammu around 30 lakh, contradicting Harsh Dev Singhs claim. Sources said election authorities had deleted the names of a large number of bogus voters in Jammu. In 11 Assembly segments in Jammu, 94,000 bogus voters were found and deleted, a source said.         
	Sharma said he could not explain why Kashmir, despite having nearly 1.3 million people more than Jammu, had only about 2 lakh more voters. We have gone from house to house to enlist voters. All I can say is that it is the choice of the people to register, he said.         
	Sources said many Kashmiri youths were not registering because of their aversion to the process. No less than 7 lakh voters of Kashmir are missing from the electoral rolls, one source said.         
	There is still another twist to the delimitation puzzle  that of Muslim-dominated districts. National Conference provincial president Mehboob Beig pointed out that Jammu has five districts  Doda, Rajouri, Poonch, Kishtwar and Ramban  where there are more Muslims. Together these districts make up 65 per cent of Jammus area. The other five make up only 35 per cent. The BJP, Congress and the Jammu State Morcha want delimitation in all 10 districts.

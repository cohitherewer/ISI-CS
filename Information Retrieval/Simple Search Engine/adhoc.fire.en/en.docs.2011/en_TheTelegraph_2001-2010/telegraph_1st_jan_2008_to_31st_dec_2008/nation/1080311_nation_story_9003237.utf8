	Bhubaneswar, March 10: AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi today indirectly blamed the BJD-BJP government for its failure in delivering service equally in the state, resulting in disparity between regions and communities.         
	I am surprised to see how disconnected some parts (of Orissa) are from the others, Rahul said at a news conference at the last leg of his four-day Orissa tour today.         
	I dont think Orissa is poor per se. The problem is with the delivery of services and use and distribution of resources. The state is rich with resources, but those are not used to their optimum level, he said. The leader complained that a revolutionary scheme such as National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was being wasted in the state. Wherever I went, I asked people whether they were getting jobs. The answer was zerozero everywhere.         
	On if the government was to be blamed, the leader avoided a direct answer.         
	Im not here to blame anyone. But a lot of work remains to be done by the government to implement the programmes successfully. Of course, the Centre has to support every state with funds, but its up to the state government to implement all programmes, said the AICC leader.         
	Rahul denied the allegation that the rural job scheme had failed in Congress-ruled states as well and gave an example of Andhra Pradesh to prove his point.         
	Rahul also bypassed a reporters request to rate the performance of the Orissa chief minister. Im not in the business to grant marks. Its up to the people to judge.         
	The young leader, however, spoke at length regarding Vedanta Groups proposed bauxite mining project in Niyamgiri hills in Kalahandi, an area that he visited.         
	Rahul said: My view is that mining would destroy the environment, affect drinking water sources and livelihood of tribals and destroy their cultural identity there. I am not against the idea of industrialisation, but it should be responsible, he said.        
	Ruling out the possibility of an early election in the country, Rahul today said the general elections would be held on time. The AICC leader also denied that his four-day tour to the state had any thing to do with the polls.         
	For me, the Orissa tour was to learn and understand peoples problems and talk to them. Such trips will continue as long as I live, he clarified.        
	One the Congresss chance in the polls, Rahul said: I am not a fortune-teller. But Congress has a bright prospect in Orissa.

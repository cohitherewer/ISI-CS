                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mission: Save idea of India
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Chidambaram in Delhi on Monday. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec.1: Not many calls are made usually from one wing of the North Block to the other.        
	Today was different. P. Chidambaram, finance minister yesterday morning and home minister in the evening, took over the chair today from Shivraj Patil.        
	Leaving behind the financial woes, Chidambaram took a short walk from one wing of Edwin Lutyens colonial structure to the other this afternoon to salvage the very idea of India .         
	North Block houses both finance and home ministries. But the two seemed a world apart after he crossed over.         
	A paramilitary guard summed up the future for himself and his tribe, though it might have been a message to bureaucrats as well. Suna hai zyadatar attention mein rehna padega (I have heard most of the time we will have to stand in attention).        
	Some already appeared to be paying attention. Ministers of state Sriprakash Jaiswal and Radhika Selvi decided to stay back in office late today, along with most officials.        
	Chidambaram set the pace with a short speech on how the government would neutralise the threat to the very idea of India and recognising the sense of anguish and shock among people of India.        
	This is a threat to the very idea of India, the very soul of India that we know, that we love  secular, plural, tolerant and open society. I have no doubt that ultimately the idea of India will triumph, Chidambaram, 63, said.        
	I want to reassure the people of India we will respond with determination. I have no doubt the idea of India will triumph, but I need co-operation. I need support of people of India and of state governments and sub-state organisations.        
	Bureaucrats in both wings of North Block exchanged notes and dialled each other, with the focus shifting from sanctioned projects, an oft-used finance ministry jargon, to sanctions on behaviour and style about to kick in.         
	After 4.30pm, when Chidambaram settled in his new office, life suddenly began to appear different for the mandarins.         
	He is known to be brusque with officers, trashes drafted letters he does not like and decides on his own, said a home ministry official, offering the insight he had picked up from counterparts in the finance ministry. Unlike Patil, a former Speaker, Chidambaram isnt known to entertain long conversations or get bogged down in quibbles over the Constitution.        
	In the home ministry, sweeping changes, some involving senior officers, are on the cards. Over the next few days, mothballed files could be dusted and new concepts, like the appointment of an internal security adviser, introduced as Chidambaram revamps the set-up.        
	Immediately after he took over last evening, he appeared to hit the ground running, meeting national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, home secretary Madhukar Gupta and Intelligence Bureau director P.C. Haldar.        
	By this afternoon, PC, as the ex-finance minister was fondly called in the world of business, wasnt smiling and saying goodbye to pink paper journalists, but asking reporters who cover the home ministry to pose no fun questions.

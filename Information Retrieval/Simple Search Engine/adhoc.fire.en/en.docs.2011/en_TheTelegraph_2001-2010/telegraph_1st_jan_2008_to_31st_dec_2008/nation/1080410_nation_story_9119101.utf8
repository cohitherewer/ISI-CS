          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Bhubaneswar, April 9: A two-year-old girl belonging to a migrant labourers family from Bengal has been detected with polio in Orissa.        
	Orissa health services director Sukadev Sethi has confirmed that Habiba Khatoon, the youngest of four children of Sheikh Maroof, who came to work here from Midnapore in Bengal, was diagnosed with the disease on March 29.        
	She was admitted to the government-run Capital Hospital after days of high fever and her left leg went numb. Doctors treating her confirmed she tested positive for the P-1 virus  the deadliest among three polio strains  after a stool test.        
	This was the third case of polio reported in Orissa in the past five years. Earlier, polio cases were detected in 2003 and 2007.        
	Most of the residents of the Shantinagar slum where Maroof and his family have been living for over a year are migrant labourers. Habibas parents had been to Midnapore about two months ago and may have contracted the infection there, said Sujata Mishra, the programme co-ordinator for pulse polio at Capital Hospital.        
	Dipankar Mukherjee, the regional team leader of the National Polio Surveillance Programme, WHO, said from Calcutta: There is widespread migration of labourers from Tamluk in East Midnapore to Bhubaneswar throughout the year. Moreover, the P-1 strain found in Orissa is only the third case this year after the ones reported from Maharashtra and Delhi.        
	We suspect the baby was not given any polio vaccine as her parents failed to produce an immunisation card, added Mishra. But Rasheeda, the girls mother, claimed that Habiba was administered one dose.         
	Not taking any chances, the Orissa health department has stared a door-to-door survey in the city. Soon after Habibas case was confirmed, an outbreak response immunisation campaign was also conducted in Shantinagar, Sethi said.        
	The department has decided to launch a mop-up round of polio vaccination throughout the state, including the coastal districts of Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore and Ganjam.        
	The drive will be conducted on April 13-15 in 109 blocks. Personnel from WHO and Unicef will be involved in the process, Sethi said.        
	Several residents, said Mishra, belong to the minority community and were against the administration of oral polio drops among children fearing it would affect their virility.         
	The slum-dwellers, however, contested this. Not many health workers come here into the bylanes during the pulse polio campaign, said Salman Qureshi, a resident.

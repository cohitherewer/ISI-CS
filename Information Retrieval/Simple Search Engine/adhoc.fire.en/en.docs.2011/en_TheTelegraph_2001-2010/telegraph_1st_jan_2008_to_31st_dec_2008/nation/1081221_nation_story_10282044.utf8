The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US think tank sees real threat of war 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           US think tank sees real threat of war 
                            
	Dec. 20 (PTI): The possibility of Indian military strikes against Pakistan is very real and palpable, leading US think tank Stratfor has said.        
	Stratfor has termed the action taken by Islamabad against the Lashkar-e-Toiba as token and said New Delhi was unconvinced by it.        
	India is not likely to be satisfied with the banning of a couple of militant groups and a few insincere house arrests, it added.        
	Pakistan has taken some token measures against groups India asserts were responsible for the November attack in Mumbai, but India (and the US) remains unconvinced, said Stratfor, a private intelligence agency that provides strategic inputs on business, economic, security and geopolitical affairs.        
	The threat of an Indian military strike is very real. All available eyes need to watch for troop movements. The diplomatic posturing continues, but the threat of war is palpable.        
	India says Lashkar carried out the Mumbai strikes, an assertion supported by Britain and other world powers, but Pakistan claims there is no evidence.        
	Stratfor said the militant groups that were under Pakistani spy agency ISIs control several years earlier had now increased their autonomy and spread their networks inside India.        
	Pakistan has more or less admitted that its military intelligence establishment has lost control of many of these groups, leaving India and the United States to dwell over the frightening thought that rogue operations are being conducted by elements of the Pakistani security apparatus that no longer answer to the state, it said.        
	The identities of the attackers reveal a strong link to Lashkar a Kashmiri Islamist militant group whose roots lie in Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence agency, but whose weakened ties to the Pakistani state have drawn it closer to Pakistans thriving al Qaida network.        
	Nawaz survey        
	Nearly nine of every 10 Pakistanis believe their country is moving in the wrong direction and six out of 10 would prefer Nawaz Sharif to Asif Ali Zardari as President, a survey has found.        
	Eighty eight per cent of respondents told the poll, conducted by the US-based International Republican Institute, that Pakistan was moving in the wrong direction. While 59 per cent said they would prefer Sharif as President, only 19 per cent backed Zardari.

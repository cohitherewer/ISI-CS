  - Rumours of arrest spark   violence in Mumbai        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raj Thackeray                                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Raj Thackeray was still at home this evening, a day after being booked for last weeks violence, but rumours of his imminent arrest sparked trouble across the state.        
	Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta, worried about the stone-throwing and the attacks on north Indians, buses and cinemas, called Maharashtra police chief P.S. Pasricha six times. But senior state officials insisted the situation was normal and seemed in no hurry to arrest the man they have charged with inciting riots.        
	Mumbai stayed tense. Shopkeepers downed shutters in MNS strongholds like Worli, Vikroli and Parel. Two taxi drivers were attacked in the Kalachowki area of central Mumbai. Office-goers, especially women, returned home early.        
	Rajs party said he would not seek anticipatory bail. Whatever he has said is in the interests of Maharashtra. Where is the question of his seeking anticipatory bail? Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) spokesman Shishir Shinde said.        
	The Samajwadi Partys Mumbai chief, Abu Asim Azmi, booked under similar charges, drove to police commissioner D.N. Jadhavs office and offered to surrender. But he was told his prosecution would be done at an appropriate time.        
	Union minister Arjun Singh suggested paramilitary forces be sent to Maharashtra.        
	Asked about the statement, Pasricha said: We have not heard about this. I have spoken to home secretary (Gupta) six times today. No one is interfering in our investigations. The lodging of FIRs is just the beginning.. We will soon complete the investigation.         
	Azmi had been locked in a verbal battle with Raj over his remarks against north Indians before the February 3 clashes.        
	Security has been stepped up at both leaders homes. Raj, who last night refused to accept a police notice restraining him from speaking to the media and organising meetings, was cooped up at his Shivaji Park home.        
	Wary of courting more trouble, he did not make statements but had a cartoon he had drawn published in a leading Marathi newspaper to send a message.        
	Rumours about his impending arrest sent a group of suspected MNS activists on the rampage in Nashik. Some north Indian fruit vendors were beaten up in the towns Shalimar area.        
	Reports that he had already been arrested triggered violence and stone-throwing in other districts. Pasricha said six government buses were damaged in Pune and clashes reported from a cinema.         
	Mumbai police chief Jadhav, keeping a low profile since Raj was seen at his daughters wedding the day after the clashes, said 23 MNS and 16 Samajwadi workers had been arrested so far.        
	Shiv Sena supporters protested outside the income-tax office at Marine Lines against the move to fill more than 370 clerical posts with outsiders. Over 30 activists were detained.        
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was away in Latur, his constituency, and was expected in Mumbai tomorrow evening.

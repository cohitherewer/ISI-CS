          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: Cable rates are set to go up 7 per cent from January 1 in areas under the conditional access system (CAS) as well as those outside it. But set-top box deposits and rentals have been slashed.        
	The increase announced today by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which doubles as the broadcast regulator, will take the price of each channel to Rs 5.37 in the CAS areas of Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai. Earlier, the rate was Rs 5 per channel.        
	Viewers will also have to pay Rs 5 more for the free-to-air bouquet, up from Rs 77 to Rs 82 for 30 channels.         
	 In non-CAS areas, the increase will be 7 per cent on average. It was felt necessary to provide for inflation-linked increase and accordingly a 7 per cent increase has been provided based on wholesale price index in non-CAS areas, Trai said in a statement today.        
	The deposits and rentals on set-top boxes have been reduced, in line with a fall in their prices over two years.        
	In the scheme where viewers now pay a one-time deposit of Rs 250 and a monthly rental of Rs 45, they will shell out Rs 200 and Rs 34 from next month. In the other plan, where a deposit of Rs 999 is paired with a rental of Rs 30, the revised rates will stand at Rs 750 and Rs 22.        
	In Calcutta, where only a small part on the citys southern fringes is under CAS, operators said the revisions would have little impact. Reducing the security deposit would have little bearing on the industry. In non-CAS areas, set-top boxes are being provided at Rs 300 to Rs 500 (to those who opt for them). The deposit cut is an attempt to draw people into CAS, said Dilip Singh Mehta, chairman of Cable Comm, a multi-system operator, which sends signals to neighbourhood cable operators.         
	After the revisions, a viewer would pay Rs 12-13 more at the most, Mehta said, suggesting the modest increase was unlikely to affect business.         
	Another MSO official disagreed, saying even a small change in rates could prompt people to switch to direct-to-home players like Tata Sky and DishTV in Calcuttas CAS areas, which have a high concentration of low-income families.

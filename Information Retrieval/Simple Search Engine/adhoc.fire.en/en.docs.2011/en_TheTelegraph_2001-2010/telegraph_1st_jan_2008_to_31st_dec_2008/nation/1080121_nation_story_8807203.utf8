 Buzz in Big Cities 

       
	Far too short for the Boss
  
	Sivaji The Boss was celebrating its silver jubilee but it was a starlet invited to the bash who grabbed all the attention  and more than her share of controversy.
  
	Actress Shriya found herself tied in knots for walking into the party, to mark the Rajnikanth starrers record run in theatres, in an attire deemed too skimpy. 
  
	What raised the hackles of purists was that the sultry siren had chosen to wear such clothes at a programme where chief minister M. Karunanidhi was the chief guest.
  
	Such was the indignation at her sartorial audacity that a Hindu outfit, Hindu Makkal Katchi, lodged a police complaint. But before the row could spiral out of control and cast a shadow on her career, Shriya apologised quickly, saying she had no intention to offend anybodys sensibilities and had deep respect for Tamil culture and values. 
  
	The 27-year-old claimed she had come to the venue from the location of a shooting in Thanjavur, suggesting she might not have had time to switch to the right dress.
  
	Wraps off varsity-link plan
  
	An IT plan is on the table to link all higher educational institutions in the capital to facilitate regular exchange programmes related to curriculum and teachers.
  
	A blueprint for the initiative was presented recently by National Knowledge Commission chairman Sam Pitroda to chief minister Sheila Dikshit. 
  
	Dikshit said efforts were being made to put into practice the commissions recommendations to achieve the goal of making the capital the best knowledge destination.
  
	The chief minister said her government had initiated the process of setting up two more universities in Delhi, part of the steps to enhance the reach of higher education.
  
	Dikshit said the initiatives in the blueprint will help enhance community participation in managing government schools and bring in NGOs to decrease the number of dropouts.
  
	Slash, strike in tease fight
  
	Ears and nose bitten off to hands severed  victims of eve teasers in Andhra are using cutting-edge tools to fend off tormentors.
  
	A 23-year-old housewife, fed up with being stalked by an auto driver who tried to kiss her in public, recently hacked his right hand after he broke into her house. 
  
	The 22-year-old Shekhar claimed before police officials in Kadapa that he was deeply in love with Swapna. 
  
	Shekhar was seen screaming in pain as he tried to flee from the house, part of his arm dangling, after Swapna wielded a butchers knife to keep the young man at bay. 
  
	Swapna and her husband surrendered at the police station and explained why they had to take the dire step. Shekhar was hospitalised and then kept in custody for a few days before being released on bail early last week.
  
	The hacking follows several recent eve-teasing incidents in which the victims have hit back with whatever they could, including one where a Karimnagar college girl had bitten off the ears and nose of her assailant.
    
	Shock absorber
  
	An amnesty plan has been proposed for power users suffering because of tampered or faulty meters, giving many reeling under the shock of huge bills a reason to smile.
  
	The power department will devise a proposal and get it cleared by the regulatory commission. The amnesty is proposed for two months from February, power minister A.K. Walia said. The amnesty plan follows complaints of harassment due to tampered meters. Only the cost of the new meter will have to be paid.

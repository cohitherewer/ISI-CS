          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: The West Bengal University of Technology today asked more than 55 private engineering colleges in the state to submit by Thursday a list of students admitted under the management quota this year.        
	Students seeking admission under the quota have to pay higher tuition and other fees.         
	Todays directive is aimed at ensuring that the colleges do not admit more students than they have been allowed to under the category.         
	University authorities held a meeting with the directors and principals of the 55-odd private institutions this morning and asked them to furnish details of such students taken in this year.         
	The information will have to include academic records and the ranks the students had secured in the Joint Entrance Examination.        
	The heads of the institutions have been asked to complete the process of compiling the details of the students who have been offered management seats latest by Thursday, WBUT vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sengupta said after the meeting.        
	Private engineering colleges fill 10 per cent of their seats through the management quota. The rest is allotted to students by the state JEE board through counselling.        
	Students taking management quota seats are required to pay between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 8 lakh for their courses. Those who are admitted through the joint entrance board counselling are required to pay Rs 2 lakh.        
	The university had been receiving complaints over the past few years that some colleges were offering more than 10 per cent of their seats under the management quota.        
	According to officials in the university, nearly 500 engineering seats were not filled this year after many students who had been given allotments through counselling did not join their courses.        
	We want to freeze the management quota before the seats that were allotted but not filled are offered to students on waiting lists, said a university official.

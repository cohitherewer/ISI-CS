	Patna, Feb. 8: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today had to face mob fury for the first time after he assumed charge of the state, that too in Nalanda, his impregnable fortress and second home after Bakhtiarpur.        
	Over 600 protestors, mostly farmers from Pillki at Rajgir foothills, shouted anti-Nitish slogans at the proposed Nalanda university site, where the government has acquired 450 acres. The government will require 500 acres more for the international university.        
	Kumar had accompanied former president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the first visitor at the university site. Kalam was witnessing power-point presentations just a few metres away when Nitish Kumar was hit. Nitish, however, did not seek medical aid.        
	Protestors were demanding adequate compensation for land. The government has already granted Rs 2.36 lakh per acre that includes 50 per cent bonus.        
	The incident took place around 12.45pm when chief minister went out in the open after hearing the commotion. As Kumar went out to the middle of the trouble, protestors threw mud at him. Some threw slippers.        
	Chief minister, later while addressing the media, admitted: I am stunned that the people in Nalanda can think of hitting back. A stone was aimed and hurled at my head. It looks like a pre-meditated attack. My head is still reeling and I would have to undergo a CT scan once late evening after doctor Kalams functions are over. Kumar added that he was saddened by what happened at Nalanda, which is like his home. There was no intelligence reports regarding dissatisfaction, nor any input regarding unrest, or protests from political parties. Farmers had been given liberal compensation. I never received any subsequent demands for more money  so todays attack surprises me.        
	While preferring to not name any party, Nitish Kumar insisted that there seemed to be some conspiracy behind the incident.         
	The attack looks engineered. Had there been a tension over the issue of land acquirement, I could have diffused it. I did not receive any requests for a better price in the past one year.         
	He has directed Nalanda district magistrate Anand Kishore to look into the matter. Despite what the chief minister alleges some villagers of Pilkhi have been demanding international price for an international university.

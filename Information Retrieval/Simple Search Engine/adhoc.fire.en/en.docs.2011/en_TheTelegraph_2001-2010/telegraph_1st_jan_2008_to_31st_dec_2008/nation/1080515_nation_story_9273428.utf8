                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Seasoned Sonia bests Arjun
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, May 14: The Arjun Singh row has revealed a seasoned Sonia Gandhi, equipped to tackle internal factionalism and outwit astute politicians like the HRD minister.        
	In all of three days, Sonia has signalled that games of one-upmanship will not be tolerated. But more significantly, she has shown that the leader of the Congress parivar does not resort to a purge or crack the whip whenever a party leader is seen to be speaking out of turn.        
	Sensing that Arjuns outburst was aimed at some of her key aides, Sonia stuck to her line that the partys internal decision-making mechanism was democratic. But she ignored the clamour for his immediate exit from the council of ministers.        
	Eventually, Arjun had to make amends. He denied any strain in his relations with Sonia on Monday, just three days after he had questioned the way the party assessed its members loyalty.        
	Sources close to Sonia said her assessment of key individuals and their capacity to cause damage came in handy. Arjuns commitment to the Congress ideology and loyalty to the family did not come under scrutiny and perhaps helped ensure his longevity in Shastri Bhavan.        
	When his initial outburst in a book hit headlines, the Congress president was convinced that even a hurt and angry Arjun would not quit the Manmohan Singh government and cause more embarrassment.         
	Congress ministers have a pathetic record on resigning. There are many instances that must have crossed Sonias mind.        
	Arjun had raved and ranted on December 6, 1992, but did not resign, following the Babri Masjids demolition. His long list of supporters, including Digvijay Singh, Ajit Jogi and dozens of other MPs, kept urging him to quit but Arjun avoided creating a crisis.        
	Last year, Shivraj Patil was declared the partys presidential nominee but just as the home minister was set to order new bandhgalas, the Left parties threw a spanner.        
	Patil was not secular enough to move into Rashtrapati Bhavan, they said.        
	Even as A.B. Bardhan and Prakash Karat scuttled his candidature, Patil behaved as if it was business as usual. Loyalty prevented him from contemplating quitting.         
	In different circumstances, Pranab Mukherjee, too, swallowed humiliation. His presidential aspirations were rejected on the ground of efficiency  Pranab was projected as Mr Indispensable for the party. The external affairs minister may not have had strong reasons to consider resigning but in Congress circles, there was near-con- sensus that he had been sli- ghted.        
	Arjun insisted he was not snubbed by the Congress president at the Jamia Hamdard convocation on Saturday. But Sonia, who avoided eye contact with the minister at the convocation, has been pointedly silent on the series of harsh statements issued by Arjuns colleagues against him.        
	The goings-on in the Congress prompted the BJP to attack the party. It alleged that senior ruling party leaders were behaving like pets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Censor nod to film on Cong chief
                                                                                                               Censor nod to film on Cong chief
                            
	Mumbai, March 16 (PTI): A film on Sonia Gandhi can now be released as the censor board has withdrawn the condition that the filmmaker obtain a no-objection certificate from the Congress president.        
	The Central Board of Film Certification had asked producer Thakur Dinesh Kumar to obtain the NoC from Sonia despite giving the film Sonia-Sonia the U certificate in December 2005.        
	Kumar claimed that after receiving a notice from the censor board, he had sent letters to Sonia for the certificate but did not get any reply.         
	The producer approached the board again, saying the absence of a reply may be construed as a no-objection certificate but was not permitted to release the film.         
	The producer then approached Bombay High Court. His lawyer Shyam Keswani argued that the board had no right to impose such a condition.         
	Last week, additional solicitor-general Rajendra Raghuvanshi told the high court that the board was withdrawing the condition.        
	The high court disposed of the petition.

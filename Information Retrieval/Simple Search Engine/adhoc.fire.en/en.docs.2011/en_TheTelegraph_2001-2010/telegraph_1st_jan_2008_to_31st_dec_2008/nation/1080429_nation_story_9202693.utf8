	Water harvest? Its childs play    
	This monsoon, 50 destitute children at an SOS Village in north-west Delhi will play in the rain to help a drying earth regain some of its lost water.    
	A group of NGOs and fast food giant Coca-Cola launched a rainwater harvesting plant at the Bawana SOS Childrens Village on April 22  World Earth Day. The Village will have exclusive rights to the water.     
	The children here are thrilled. They love doing something constructive and taking on responsibilities. For them, the plant is like a new toy. And their toy is their most precious possession, said Harpreet Singh, deputy national director, SOS Childrens Village.     
	The Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) is supporting the project.    
	Depleting ground water levels is a major concern across India, and CGWA officials said they were keen to use children as ambassadors for the drive to restore water to the earth.     
	When children take on a task, adults generally listen. We are evolving a strategy to involve children increasingly in our water harvesting projects, a CGWA official said. SOS India runs 39 Childrens Villages across India.        
	Match made in municipality    
	No more queuing up at courts or toiling to find touts. Weddings will soon be registered at your neighbourhood civic ward.    
	We already register births and deaths, so marriages should not be too much of a problem to handle, municipal commissioner Jairaj Phatak said.    
	The Maharashtra government had issued an ordinance in January 2007 asking municipal authorities if they would be able to register marriages in the 24 ward offices across the city.    
	Civic officials said the move had been in the offing for quite some time. There were some practical problems because of which the implementation of the proposal was delayed, Phatak said.    
	Resident ward officers are now being trained to register marriages, the officials said.

	TN breeds tiger hope    
	Tamil Nadu has a reason to roar with pride. While the tiger count dips across the country, the big cat population is on the rise in the state.    
	The latest figures show there are between 62 and 80 tigers in the Mudumalai reserve forest, and in Kalakkad-Mundanthurai and Topslip in Pollachi, the numbers vary between six and eight, K. Sankar, the co-ordinator of the tiger monitoring programme, said.    
	According to previous census figures, the tiger count in the state was estimated to be 70.    
	Policy planning, better participation and forest protection by officials and people, habitat improvement, consistent monitoring and ecological awareness programmes were responsible for the glowing report card, Sankar said.    
	The number of tigers in India has plummeted to around 1,411, nearly half the previous estimate, according to a government survey.

	Safety axe    
	The wife of a senior Karnataka IAS officer recently stumped the governor with an unusual request  she wants her husband suspended because he faces death threats for his crusade against corruption.     
	In a letter to Rameshwar Thakur, K.N. Jayashree, wife of M.N. Vijayakumar, administrator, Command Area Development Authority, Belgaum, pleaded that her husband be placed under suspension for six months.    
	I have also urged the governor to order an inquiry into the threats as police have not acted on complaints filed in September and December last, Jayashree said.

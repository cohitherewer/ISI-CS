          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amar in Delhi. Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Samajwadi Party iterated its support to the government on the nuclear deal today but made it clear it wouldnt give an extra inch to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh.         
	We believe in the Prime Ministers promise that Indias sovereignty will not be compromised. We will take his word as final. After all he is the entire countrys Prime Minister, general secretary Amar Singh said, setting at rest speculation fuelled by party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs statement yesterday that he was in a dilemma.        
	The Samajwadis would not serve an ultimatum to the government on any issue, Amar added.        
	But he talked tough on Uttar Pradesh where the Congress and the Samajwadis plan to contest the general election together.        
	Leaving aside Rae Bareli and Amethi out of respect for Sonia Gandhi and affection for Rahul Gandhi, there will be no free seats for the Congress, he said.         
	We were told to leave Allahabad, where Rewati Raman Singh is the sitting MP. If we leave sitting MPs seats, then there is no point in running the SP. We might as well have a merger with the Congress, Amar said.         
	Sitting MPs such as Jaya Prada, Akshay Pratap Singh and Chandrabhushan Singh cannot be ignored by the party, he underlined.         
	At present, the Samajwadis have 39 seats while the Congress has nine.         
	In response to Congress leader Digvijay Singhs advice that he should learn coalition dharma from Lalu Prasad, Amar shot back that his party would be ready to spare eight seats for the Congress since the RJD leader had given four out of 40 in Bihar.        
	Digvijay is the Congresss point man for relations with the Samajwadis.         
	Amar also rejected Digvijays suggestion earlier this week that the Samajwadis agree to friendly fights in six seats. Why not have friendly fights in 80 seats then?         
	If the Congress wants seats in Uttar Pradesh, it should offer the Samajwadis seats in states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the general secretary added.         
	The primary aim should be to defeat the BSP, he said. Whether we fight together or not, we will support the UPA, Amar promised.

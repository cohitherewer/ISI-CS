	New Delhi, June 23 (PTI): Delhi High Court today asked the Indian Institute of Planning and Management and the University Grants Commission to amicably resolve a dispute that arose after the regulatory body decided to declare the IIPM a fake university.        
	You consult your respective clients (IIPM and UGC) on this issue and inform the court about possible settlement, a vacation bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdher said. The judge fixed the next hearing on June 27.        
	The courts suggestion came after senior advocate A.S. Chandiok, who appeared for the IIPM, contended that his clients main reservation was over the UGCs use of the word fake.        
	We do not mind being called unrecognised. But the word fake is not correct and this should not be used as it gives the wrong signal, Chandiok said.        
	The court then asked the counsel for the UGC to consider the issue.        
	The IIPM wanted its name to be removed from the list of fake universities. It alleged that the UGC took the decision without giving the institute a chance to place its case before the regulatory body.         
	The UGC, however, said the management schools representative had failed to appear before it.

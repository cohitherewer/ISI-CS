                                                                                                               Soren let off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamtara, March 6: JMM chief Shibu Soren, who was forced to resign from the Manmohan Singh cabinet and spend nine months in jail in 2004 over the death of 11 persons in a clash in 1975, was acquitted today for want of evidence.         
	He was let off, along with 19 others, in the 33-year-old case. Seven accused were, however, declared guilty. The sentences will be handed tomorrow.        
	Though the verdict has left me a free man, but we did not win the case, Soren said. My friends are still behind bars. Let us see what happens to them tomorrow.        
	In 1986, an arrest warrant was issued against Soren and others for his alleged role in the clash between tribals and non-tribals. He was ordered to surrender before September 6, 1986. But Soren did not, leading the court to declare him an absconder.

                                                                                                            The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	House disbanded, shadow on status    
	Some of Karnatakas legislators need help: they need to know if they are still lawmakers in a House that has been dissolved.    
	Facing the dilemma are 70 members of the legislative council who not know their status since Presidents rule was clamped on the state. They are wondering what happens to MLCs, who have a fixed term of six years, when an Assembly has been dissolved.    
	Struggling for answers, they want Governor Rameshwar Thakur to convene a session. But Thakur has chosen to remain silent. The problem is that MLCs are a rare breed and only five states in India have such a chamber.    
	So much is the despair that council chairman B.K. Chandrashekhar called for a meeting with constitutional experts and politicians to settle the question. He believes the suspense, a constitutional crisis of sorts, was affecting the councils institutional integrity.     
	Several former and present MLCs turned up but the meeting was inconclusive. Noted jurist Fali Nariman said rules do not contemplate sittings of the Legislative Council when an Assembly is dissolved or is under suspension. Chandrashekhars hunt for an answer continues.      
	Catch a day for graft cops  
	Andhras graft-busters couldnt have hoped for a better year  at 365 cases registered, they caught one each day.    
	Some believe the such a prolific strike rate spoke more about the muck in the officialdom than the success of those who have been wielding the broom around.    
	Not just connectivity (communication) but corruption also has dissolved borders in the country, says R.R. Girish Kumar, who heads the anti-corruption wing.    
	Kumar and his colleagues ferreted out Rs 53 crore during the drive. The largest number of babus caught with their hands in the till was in the revenue department  supposed to be the states financial guardians.     
	Kumar said the Karnataka model of offering online services was being considered for the revenue department to improve transparency and contain corruption.      
	Lost hostel mates unite  
	A badge bearing his hostel number pinned to his shirt pocket, Manpreet Suri looked around, hoping to catch a familiar face.     
	Surinder Nath, looking similarly lost, decided enough was enough and approached Suri.     
	Excuse me. Im Surinder Nath... from the batch of 1971. As they shook hands, Suris eyes fell on Naths badge  Hostel Number 8. Were from the same hostel. I was in the batch of 1967. Which wing were you in? he screeched aloud.     
	Nath, Suri, and dozens of other alumni of IIT Mumbai, now in Delhi, met last weekend to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of their alma mater. Nath owns a construction company, while Suri works in the retail sector but the two have never known each other. Yet the discovery that nearly four decades ago, they shared a hostel that shaped their personalities was enough to start an animated conversation that ended with promises to meet soon with their families over dinner.     
	We arent friends... but we share memories of a place that shaped us, Nath beamed as Suri nodded frantically.           
	Cold comfort   
	Mumbai got a taste of the chill factor last week when the mercury dipped to 12.6 degrees Celsius.    
	It was the second time in less than a month that Mumbaikars felt they had signs of winter. The mercury had fallen to a similar level on January 2.    
	The city is almost a stranger to cold spells because of the warming influence of the sea. The change was put down to the cold wave conditions in the northern and central regions.

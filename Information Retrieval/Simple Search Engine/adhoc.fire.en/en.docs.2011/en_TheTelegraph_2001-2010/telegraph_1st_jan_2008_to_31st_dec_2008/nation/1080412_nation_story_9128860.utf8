                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Next door, dynasty politics alive but struggling
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          Sujata Koirala campaigns near Biratnagar                                   
	Biratnagar (Nepal Terai), April 11: This is a subcontinental election story. It has been reported ad nauseam from datelines in India and Pakistan, even Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but it refuses to die, or even begin to bore. This is the political dynasty story. It is alive in Nepal, though it is struggling a bit.        
	Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, scion of the legendary BP, installed national deity of peoples power, has been very ill. He barely attends office, he did not contest these elections. When doctors or relations are not watching, he is known to steal a puff or two on cigarettes that hes been prohibited. He is 86; even flirting with the addiction gets the better of him rather quickly these days.         
	He barely made it here to cast his vote  a quick chopper sortie yesterday during which he uttered half a sentence lauding democracy, no more.         
	The story goes when former US President Jimmy Carter came to greet him during a reception for international poll observers hed hosted at his Baluwatar residence in Kathmandu a few days ago, Koirala felt so weak he didnt bother standing up.         
	But if something can get his juices going, it is that other big addiction of his  keeping the Koirala clan at the helm.         
	Like all dynasties, the Koiralas of the Nepali Congress are as riven as they are driven. Too many competing ambitions, all of them contesting the Constituent Assembly elections in the terai, or Madhes, a new nomenclature that symbolises the resurgent political aspiration of Nepals 33 per cent non-pahadi people settled along the border with India.         
	There is cousin Sushil, who is also the acting president of the party; nephews Shekhar and Shashank; and, last but not the least, daughter Sujata.         
	They cannot even stand the sight of each other, says Dhiman Upreti, a local political scientist. And now that GP is at the end of his career, each one is going for broke. The election is a contest to watch, but the battle of the Koiralas may have far more dramatic moments, like a real life soap opera. I would not be surprised if some of them are actively working to pull the competition down in the elections.        
	Much like our Congress back home, the Nepali Congress calls itself a party of internal democracy. But quite like our Congress back home, its a party of internal dictatorship. Command flows from the top and is followed. Succession is merely hinted at and submissively accepted.        
	GPs choice as successor is  guess who  daughter Sujata, a controversial figure to say the least, perceived as pompous and ambitious, alleged to be corrupt, known, for sure, to desperately want the job, should it be available.         
	As part of the merger deal of Nepali Congress factions, Prime Minister Koirala is committed to supporting the candidacy of another former Prime Minister  Sher Bahadur Deuba  as future leader. But as many in the party would tell you, it is just one of those promises; there is no legal binding, there is all the political leeway. Just like there are no permanent enemies in politics, there are no watertight deals. G.P. Koirala is a veteran of many broken ones.         
	Sujata has not much going for her, says a Nepali Congress leader. The one thing she would want to ensure is for her father to leave behind clear word she is the chosen one. Having known the Koiralas, GP will do it, too.        
	But Deuba might yet have hope. Sujata might lose Sunsari, a neighbouring rural constituency that her father held till now. That will not rule her out of the succession stakes, but a loss will certainly weaken her claim.         
	This election is larger than just about Sunsari, admits one of her election managers. This is about what happens to the Nepali Congress leadership. Sometime soon, a new leader will come and Didi (Sujata) has to win to be in the running.        
	It does not help that she is up against Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF), the leading regional formation. The MJF is well funded, has a solid base among the Yadavs, the Mehtas and other backward and lower castes, and, most of all, has the advantage of being an untested vehicle of hope  youve tried them all, try us once, is their slogan.         
	And Yadav, rough and rustic as he is, can be an imaginative improviser. When his Madhesi rights agitation was getting nowhere with the Koirala government last year, he manoeuvred closer to King Gyanendra and eventually teased the Prime Minister into an agreement that he is now selling as his victory.         
	Sujatas campaign office is keeping a brave face  Didi will win even if she sleeps all day, this is the Prime Ministers seat, dont forget  but Didi herself is visibly worried. Wherever she goes in Sunsari, she faces a hail of questions over promises unfulfilled.         
	Look at us, just look, an angered villager tells her in Ineruwa. No roads, no lights, no schools, no jobs and this has been the Prime Ministers constituency... what is there to believe you?         
	Sujata struggles for answers. She knows neither Maithili nor Awadhi, the local lingua, her Hindi is at best faltering. Her only resort is the old Nepali Congresss claim to have brought democracy and unified people across caste and regional lines. Quite the same claim as the Congress back home makes.         
	But quite like in India, the Nepali Congress umbrella, too, has been pulled apart by new and contrary aspirations  it promised too much, delivered too little. Give me one chance, Sujata says. One chance and you will see a new Nepal, I promise you. Last gasp effort.        
	The dynasty is alive, but struggling. More so because GP is no Nehru and Sujata decidedly no Indira.        
	Poll results        
	The Nepali Congress won the first seat to be announced in the capital.         
	The Election Commission said final results would take more than 10 days, with reruns called in 60 out of 20,000 centres.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 26: Recruitment to the Orissa Judicial Service cadre has come under judicial scrutiny with the high court admitting a writ petition challenging the valuation of answer scripts of candidates who appeared for the OJS (main) examination this year.        
	Recruitment process is underway for appointment against 110 posts sanctioned by the state government. Orissa Public Service Commission (OPSC) had initially conducted an OJS (preliminary) exam. While 6000-odd candidates had taken the test, 2,045 of them were declared eligible to appear the OJS (main) exam.        
	Subsequently, only 69 candidates were declared eligible to appear the viva-voce test, which is underway since October 16.        
	Amaresh Nayak and 14 others had filed the petition seeking judicial intervention alleging valuation of answer scripts by inexperienced examiners. When the grievance of the unsuccessful examinees was taken up by for hearing last week, OPSC counsel Bijay Kumar Das pointed out to the court that the OJS rule 24 stipulates that a candidate can be declared eligible to take the viva-voce test on securing 45 per cent aggregate marks and at least 33 per cent in each subject. Besides, experts had been included in the panel of examiners, Das said.        
	The division bench of Justices I.M. Quddusi and B.P. Ray, however, sought details on the allegations made by the petitioners.        
	Buddhadeb Routray, counsel for the petitioners, alleged that teachers associated with coaching centres were included in the panel of examiners.

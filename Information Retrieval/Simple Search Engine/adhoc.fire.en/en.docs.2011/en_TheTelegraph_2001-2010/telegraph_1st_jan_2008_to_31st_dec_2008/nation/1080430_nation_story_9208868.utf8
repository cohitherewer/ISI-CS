          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 29: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today defended the Prime Ministers Office in the T.R. Baalu case, claiming no nepotism was involved in the DMK ministers request for allocation of gas to firms owned by his family.        
	There is no nepotism here. I dont know what nepotism you are talking about, Deora, who will make a statement in Parliament tomorrow, said.        
	Every day we get requests from people. If somebody tells me that this is the question of 2,000 people losing their jobs, I will call my people. I will ask them the truth. We are here to help people, not harass.        
	Yesterday, Parliament had erupted over the PMO forwarding to the petroleum ministry eight letters Baalu had written asking that gas supply be speeded up to companies owned by his family.        
	Although the controversy rocked the Rajya Sabha for the second day, the Congress wondered if the issue was losing steam. Its perception was based on differences between the ADMK and the BJP.        
	ADMK sources said when their MP raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha, the idea was to focus on the DMK and Baalu. But with the BJP targeting Manmohan Singh, they said, their original purpose had been sort of defeated.

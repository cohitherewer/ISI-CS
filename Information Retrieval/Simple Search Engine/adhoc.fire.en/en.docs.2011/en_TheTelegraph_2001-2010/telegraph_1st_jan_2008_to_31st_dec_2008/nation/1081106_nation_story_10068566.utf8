          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, Nov. 5: Uma Bharti today dragged a protg of her challenger in her party by his hair and slapped him twice before dozens of other leaders.        
	Anil Rai, perceived to be close to Prahlad Patel, the de facto number two in Umas Bhartiya Janshakti Party (BJS), resigned soon after.         
	The incident occurred outside the Chhindwara guesthouse where Uma was finalising candidates for this months Madhya Pradesh polls.        
	Rais resignation belied Umas claims that he had accepted her love after she hugged him publicly within hours of the slapping. She said she was upset with Rai for bringing in a huge crowd to the government circuit house. The election observer was in the next room and I was scared he might lodge a complaint.        
	Rai, the partys Chhindwara district president, said the BJS needed chamchas, not self-respecting politicians.

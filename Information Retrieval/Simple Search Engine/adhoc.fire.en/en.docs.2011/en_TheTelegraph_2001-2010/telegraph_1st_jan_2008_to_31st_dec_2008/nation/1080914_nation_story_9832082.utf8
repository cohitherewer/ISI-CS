	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Shivraj Patil escaped with just a small scratch 30 minutes before the serial blasts rocked Delhi.         
	The home minister was, of course, nowhere near Connaught Place or Karol Bagh or Greater Kailash.         
	From 11am he was ensconced in the sanitised Parliament Annexe, 2km from Central Park in Connaught Place, ringed by multi-layered security.        
	The Congress Working Committee (CWC) was in session to assess the partys poll preparedness.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, party chief Sonia Gandhi, senior cabinet ministers and Congress office-bearers were among those present.        
	Singh was lauded for the nuclear deal, expected to be operationalised this month. Sonia exhorted her party to publicise the treaty and debunk the false propaganda of the Left and the BJP.        
	So, how did Patil get the nick? From the partys Jammu and Kashmir leaders, angry with the mess in the state.        
	Central minister Saifuddin Soz, who hails from Kashmir, said the Congress had yielded its turf in the state because it had not sent a tough political message. Elections come and go, but we need to create political conditions to send a message of compassion and confidence to the people, he was quoted as saying.        
	Congress sources felt that whatever good could have accrued from the deal was lost because of Jammu and Kashmir, for which they held Patil culpable.        
	Nobody named him, though. Each time he stepped out of the meeting, not a hair out of place and his beige safari suit creaseless, he smiled benignly at the media.         
	Patils pre-eminence in the Congress hierarchy  he was appointed home minister after losing the Lok Sabha election and would have become President had the Left not objected  puzzles his colleagues.         
	Patil has survived upheavals in Manipur, the rise in Naxalite violence, several serial blasts, the Jammu and Kashmir flare-up and communal violence in Orissa.         
	A source said when called to explain a blast or a riot to Sonia, Patils tone would soften and his invariable explanation would be that things were blown up by the media whom he accused of sensationalism. That is how he is reported to have saved his skin over Kashmir.        
	At the meeting, the Prime Minister identified terrorism as the greatest challenge. Three hours after he spoke, Delhi was shaken by blasts. The question the Congress is asking is, will Patil finally get the rap?

	New Delhi, May 8: Elderly citizens, often spurned by their own kin, may soon find accommodation, health care and the company of others within their own district.         
	The Centre plans to sponsor the construction of old age homes in each district of India, to be built by 2011, under the largest project of its kind undertaken in the country. India has 604 districts.         
	Top government officials said the scheme was motivated by two factors  increasing government awareness about the plight of the aged, and a fear that India may be approaching an elderly explosion.         
	India had 77 million elderly citizens  over 60 years  according to the 2001 census, over 30 per cent of them destitute. Many of those without shelter had been deserted by their children, according to NGOs working with the aged.         
	The Planning Commission estimates that that the number of the elderly in India is likely to rise to 100 million by 2013 and nearly double that number  198 million  by 2030.         
	We appear to be nearing the edge of a boom in the number of the aged, as opposed to a baby boom. The scheme is a recognition of the fact that we need to prepare in advance, a senior ministry of social justice and empowerment official said.         
	The new scheme will be completely funded by the Centre, but state governments will be responsible for identifying the locations  within each district  for the homes and for providing land for the project.         
	The social justice ministry has finalised the blueprint for the scheme, which has received approval from the Planning Commission and the finance ministry, sources said. Social justice ministry officials are now drafting a note to place the scheme before the Union cabinet, they said.         
	Under the scheme, each old age home will house 150 elderly citizens, with separate sections for men and women, the blueprint says. Each home will include a large common room with a television set and facilities for popular games like caroms and cards, it says.         
	A committee of district officials and representatives from among the inmates will manage a homes day-to-day functioning.         
	Residents will be encouraged to take up part-time jobs.         
	Studies  both international and Indian  have shown that the elderly need help and support but they like to contribute to society, a social justice ministry official said.         
	The educated among the residents will be encouraged to teach children from the neighbourhood, the official said.         
	The Centre will provide Rs 2 crore for the construction of each old age home.

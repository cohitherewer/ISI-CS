	 Lucknow, Dec. 13: The Indian Military Academy held its passing-out parade today under the shadow of the Mumbai terror attacks.          
	Thousands of officers, including army chief General Deepak Kapoor, were present at the ceremony wrapped in a tight security cover.           
	Areas in and around the academy had been searched for the last two days and all vehicles entering the city checked. Police and military personnel were posted around the academy.           
	The IMA has been on the terror radar since 2004. In 2005, a suspected terrorist was held near the academy, days before the passing-out parade.          
	The IMA woke up to another intrusion earlier this week when an expelled cadet was found to have gained re-admission under a false name.

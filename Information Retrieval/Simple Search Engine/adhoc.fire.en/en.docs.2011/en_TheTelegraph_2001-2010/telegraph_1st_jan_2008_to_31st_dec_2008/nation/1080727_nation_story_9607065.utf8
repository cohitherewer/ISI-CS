The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bombs shake confidence of victory   Gujarat scare for Congress
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bombs shake confidence of victory   Gujarat scare for Congress
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Ball-bearings found at the blast site in Naroda Bazar. (AFP)                                         
	New Delhi, July 26: Confident on Tuesday, concussed on Saturday.        
	If the low-intensity blasts in Bangalore shattered the Congresss euphoria after the governments trust vote win on July 22, the Ahmedabad explosions have relegated the victory to a distant memory.        
	The shell-shocked party is now hoping against hope the attacks wouldnt communally polarise Gujarat and lead to a repeat of 2002, when some 60 deaths in a burning train in Godhra triggered bloody riots.        
	Gujarat being Gujarat, nothing can be taken lightly, a Congress office-bearer said. In Karnataka, it was a terror attack, in Gujarat it can lay the foundation of dividing society. Karnataka does not have a communal ethos, Gujarat has. If you make blood flow, they can later justify bloodletting.        
	The office-bearer recalled chief minister Narendra Modis action-reaction comment after the post-Godhra violence to support his observation, which came even as BJP leader L.K. Advani threw the gauntlet in the Centres court.        
	Advani demanded that the President ratify pending anti-terror laws passed by BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Gujarat if attacks like these had to be contained.        
	While the Congresss official response has been cautious  chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said religion and terrorism should not be mixed  sources said a clearer line would be firmed up after the party deliberated on the statements emanating from the BJP.        
	Advani, the Lok Sabha MP from Gandhinagar, talked of a sinister design on behalf of terrorist organisations which the Centre was advised to look at seriously but added that conclusions shouldnt be drawn from the fact that the back-to-back blasts occurred in BJP-ruled states.        
	In response to Advanis first assertion, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said: Yes, when India is trying to find a place in the comity of nations those opposed to India are trying to weaken India by taking the government out of this orbit.        
	The blasts came at a time the Prime Minister was focusing on getting the nuclear deal through.         
	Reacting to Advanis statement on the blasts occurring in BJP-ruled states, Tewari said: Whether this is a coincidence or not is something the security agencies will have to investigate.        
	Congress sources said their biggest worry was Advanis leitmotif of running a soft state could detract from the nuclear deal campaign.

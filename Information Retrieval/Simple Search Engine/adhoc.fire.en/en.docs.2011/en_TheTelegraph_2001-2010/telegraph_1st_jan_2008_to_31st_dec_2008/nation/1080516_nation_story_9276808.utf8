          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: The Orissa government today asked Utkal University authorities to explain the justification of filling up a number of vacancies in the university.         
	Chief secretary Ajit Tripathy, who chaired a review meeting regarding the vacant posts, gave this instruction.        
	The review allegedly revealed that presently there are 166 teachers in the university against 340 in the 1990s. The number would further come down to 142 by 2010, when many more teachers would retire.         
	However, as many as 73 posts have been abolished over the years.         
	Vice-chancellor Binayak Rath today asked the chief secretary to react and fill all vacancies within three to four months for the benefit of the students.         
	Rath also sought permanent appointment of teaching staff rather than contractual recruitment and adequate support staff.         
	The government agreed in principle to fill up the vacancies arising out of death or retirement.         
	But the chief secretary asked the university authorities to justify the need for filling up all posts and why those posts should not be abolished.

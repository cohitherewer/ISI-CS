          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 19: Charges of bribery against a senior cabinet minister today rocked the Assembly, with the Opposition demanding a statement from the chief minister.        
	Angry Opposition members stormed the well and shouted slogans against the minister and the government, forcing three adjournments. Normalcy was restored in the afternoon after Speaker Kishore Mohanty said he had directed the government to take necessary steps.        
	Raising the issue during the zero hour, Congress member Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra said it had been alleged that the state women and child development minister, Pramila Mallick, had demanded a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from the employees of State Commission for Women for clearing a file relating to their pay revision. The employees had themselves made the allegation before a section of the electronic media, he said.        
	Opposition whip Satyabhusan Sahu said the employees had said that the minister had demanded Rs 5 lakh and they had given her Rs 50,000 as advance. But she had not done the work.        
	State Congress president Jaydev Jena demanded that the allegation be probed and the chief minister should make a statement in the House. He was supported by party colleague Padmalochan Panda.        
	However, the Speaker said the minister concerned would give a replay within 48 hours. If the members were not satisfied with her reply, he would then ask the chief minister to make a statement, he assured.        
	Outside the Assembly, Mallick refuted the charges and said she was prepared to face any inquiry.

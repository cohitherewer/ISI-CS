                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian cabbies killer faces life term 
          AMIT ROY                                  (From top) Gian Chand Bajar, his body being taken for the funeral and the killer, Luke Aujila                                 
	London, May 28: A 21-year-old youth, Luke Aujila, will receive a mandatory life sentence tomorrow at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent for the brutal murder on May 23 last year of a 71-year-old Sikh taxi driver, Gian Chand Bajar, whom he ran over deliberately with his own cab after a trivial quarrel over the fare.         
	During the three-week trial, which ended today with a guilty verdict, the court was told by forensic pathologist Dr David Rouse that Bajar suffered 39 separate sites of injury to his body, including fractures to his pelvis and ribs and a broken leg and hip joint. The injuries sustained were typical of crushing by a motor vehicle.         
	Aujila, who lived with his parents, admitted he had drunk a stolen bottle of Bacardi and got into fights with various other people earlier in the day. He pleaded guilty last December to manslaughter, which would have attracted a lesser sentence, but the prosecution persisted successfully with a charge of murder. The youth had been taking steroids and using cannabis and cocaine in the weeks before the killing.         
	One householder recalled hearing the sound of bones crunching from inside her home after Aujila got behind the wheel of Bajars silver Skoda and targeted the prone body of his victim whom he had punched and kicked to the ground.         
	Residents on St Benedicts Avenue, Gravesend, a city where 10 per cent of the population is now Sikh, rushed out on hearing the commotion around 10pm and tended to Bajar. He was rushed by ambulance to the Darent Valley Hospital where he died that night without gaining consciousness.         
	Darkness descended on Bajars home on Darnley Road, Gravesend, where his family could scarcely comprehend what had happened. That evening, BBC Radio 4 happened to be broadcasting extracts from Truman Capotes chilling In Cold Blood.         
	Ironically, Bajar met his death on a lonely stretch of road in Kent, which millions of Indians will have heard described as the garden of England. Bajar may or may not have followed cricket but for many others this vision of a green and pleasant land was reinforced when Colin (later Sir Colin) Cowdrey cover-drove serenely for Kent and England. Later, Asif Iqbal, slim of build, lit up the county ground with his fours and sixes. It always seemed a county full of gentle English folk who would spend their spare time tending sweat peas.         
	Bajars story is like that of many other Sikhs in Britain. A former civil servant in his hometown of Karimpur in Punjab, he arrived in Britain in 1971 with his wife, Amarjit, and became a pillar of his community and even chairman of the local Guru Nanak Temple. He was semi-retired and worked three nights a week.         
	He leaves behind his widow, three daughters, Sudesh, 41, Kulwinder, 38, Sundeep, 29, and two sons, Telu, 35 and Kuldeep, 28. He also had three grandchildren, a boy aged twelve and two girls, aged ten and three.         
	Sadly, he had his retirement cut short which has deprived his family of a loving, caring father and grandfather, said Telu. He was held in very high esteem by everyone in both the Asian and white community. He came from a generation with very high morals.         
	Telu said: He worked in construction and was a real grafter  he never took any time off, not even holidays or weekends. In fact, I dont think he had missed a day for 50 years. And he was part of the construction team that built the Channel Tunnel link.         
	His son added: People were always coming to the house so dad could read them letters from home or translate things for them.         
	For Bajars funeral, there were between 100 and 120 taxi drivers who took about 60 cars out in a procession. All displayed black ribbons on the wing mirrors and aerials. And between 250 and 300 people congregated for a short Sikh service held outside the local crematorium at Bluebell Hill. Police motorcyclists escorted the cortege.         
	A statement released today by Bajars family read: We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the police and investigating team for their exceptional efforts and hard work to catch the perpetrators involved in our fathers murder. We would like to thank the local community, including the taxi drivers and many, many ordinary members of the local community for their support, kind words and best wishes throughout this difficult period.         
	Bajars widow, now 68, will be wondering whether the journey which she began nearly four decades ago from Punjab with such hopes was, in the end, worth it.

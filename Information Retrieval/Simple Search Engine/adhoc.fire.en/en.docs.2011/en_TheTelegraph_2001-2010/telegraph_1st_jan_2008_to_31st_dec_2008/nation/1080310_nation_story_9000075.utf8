                                                                                                               Cong, BJP in apathy battle
          OUR BUREAU                          Rahul Gandhi at the Berhampur rally. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 9: Two national parties, BJP and Congress, today sparred over the issue of Orissas neglect in the hands of the Centre.        
	While saffron leaders, especially Vinay Katiyar, lambasted the Congress-led UPA for its step-motherly treatment of Orissa, AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi alleged that BJD-BJP government had failed to utilise Centres funds.         
	Interestingly, the two parties held rallies at the southern town of Berhampur at a distance of just one-and-a-half kilometre. Rahul, who addressed a youth and farmers rally at Berhampur on the last leg of the Discovery India journey, said the UPA was providing adequate assistance to Orissa. There is no dearth of funds, he stressed, alleging that 65 per cent of Centres funds were not being utilised by the BJD-BJP government.         
	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme has been a total failure in Orissa, said Rahul, who was flanked by Union minister of state for rural development Chandrasekhar Sahu. Sahu said the NREGP was implemented in 30 districts due to Rahuls initiative. Rahul said he felt angry when he met the eight students in womens hostel being accommodated in a three-bedded room. The Gandhi scion called upon Orissas youths to join the Congress to change fates.        
	Though the ruling BJD-BJP leaders had stressed that Rahul would not be a threat to their alliance in Orissa, the saffron party however, did not leave anything to chance.         
	Addressing a sankalp samavesh, BJP general secretary and Orissa in-charge Vinay Katiyar and state leaders lambasted the UPA for its step-motherly treatment towards Orissa.         
	Castigating the dynastic rule in Congress, Katiyar criticised its leaders.         
	Katiyar promised 3 acres to landless tribal families and schemes to end the exploitation of farmers at the hands of private moneylenders  if the NDA came back to power.

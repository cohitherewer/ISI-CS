          JAYANTH JACOB                          Qureshi                                  
	New Delhi, June 26: Coincidence or not, meeting BJP leaders forms an important part of the visiting Pakistan foreign ministers itinerary.        
	Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, arriving at a time the Congress-led government teeters on the edge thanks to the nuclear deal standoff, will be dropping in at the homes of A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh.        
	The visit, beginning tomorrow, is the first major political contact from across the border after a new government came to power in Islamabad. On Friday, Qureshi is to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	On Saturday, he will be meeting Jaswant, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, at 15 Teen Murti Lane at 10.15am. Forty-five minutes later, he will be at 30 Prithviraj Road to meet Advani, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the BJPs shadow Prime Minister.        
	An hour later, Qureshi will be arriving at 6A Krishna Menon Marg to meet former Prime Minister Vajpayee.        
	Although the Pakistan high commission is arranging a meeting with Left leaders, including CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, and Samajwadi party MP Shahid Siddiqui, they dont figure on Qureshis official programme list.        
	Foreign ministry sources, however, said that since Qureshi was visiting India for the first time, he would be meeting leaders from across the political spectrum.        
	When Pranab Mukherjee visited Pakistan in May, he had met the top Pakistani political leadership, an official said.        
	South Block sources said India expected a breakthrough on the proposal of letting more pilgrims visit each others country. Delhi would also broach the rise in cross-border infiltration and alleged cease-fire violation by Pakistan, and discuss terrorism, the Afghanistan situation and the Saarc summit in Sri Lanka in August.        
	Also on the agenda is the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The sources said that important issues such as assured supply and the safety of the pipeline remained to be sorted out.        
	Mukherjee is expected to take the pipeline up with the Iran government when travels to Tehran next month.

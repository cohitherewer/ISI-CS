          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Jan. 28: RJD strongman and former MLA Rajindra Yadav, Maoist leader Kirani Yadav and six other inmates have been shifted to Buxar central jail  and better security.         
	The first two were allegedly involved in a foiled escape attempt from the Gaya central jail.         
	Rajindra Yadav at present is serving a 10-year term for a kidnapping case, while Kirani Yadav is charged in criminal cases including being a part of a red attack on Paraiya police station in which four personnel were killed.         
	Jail sources conceded another (unidentified) eight inmates were also shifted to Beur jail.         
	On January 12 midnight Kirani Yadav and some inmates came out of their cells reportedly using duplicate keys.         
	They were almost about to scale the jails boundary wall, when a home guard raised alarm.        
	During subsequent inquiries it was revealed that Rajindra Yadav was also a part of the escape plan. However, he was not among those caught fleeing.         
	Gaya jail officers had then faced a harrowing time dealing with Rajindra, who is considered as one of the most difficult inmates. Rajindra figures as an accused in nearly one-and-half-a-dozen cases.         
	He also escaped judicial custody a year ago, while being escorted to the jail from a Gaya court. He was nabbed several months later.         
	Rajindra Yadav also escaped from being burnt alive during the RJD regime in the Panchaiti Akhara locality of the town due to immediate administrative intervention. He was rescued by a police team led by the former Gaya sadar SDO Rai Madan Kishore after being attacked.

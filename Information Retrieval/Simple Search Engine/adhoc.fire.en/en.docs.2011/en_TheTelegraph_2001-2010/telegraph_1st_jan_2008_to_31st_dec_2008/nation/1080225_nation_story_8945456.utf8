The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On paper, the birth of many possibilities 
                                                                                                               On paper, the birth of many possibilities 
          M.R. VENKATESH                          Jayalalithaas birthday ads in Dinakaran                                   
	Chennai, Feb. 24: If Mamata Banerjee ever wonders how it feels to be wished happy birthday by Ganashakti, she should have been in Tamil Nadu today.         
	The 60th birthday of Jayalalithaa dawned on the southern state to an unusual sight: two papers owned by the Maran family were packed with advertisements from the former chief ministers loyalists and well-wishers.        
	Jayalalithaa could not have hoped to see such paeans in the two newspapers  Tamizh Murasu and Dinakaran  but for the fact that the Maran family scion, Dayanidhi, had fallen out with great uncle and chief minister M. Karunanidhi.        
	The two Tamil newspapers  part of the Maran media enterprise SUN TV Network  cannot be equated with Ganashakti, the CPMs mouthpiece. But the political possibilities behind the birthday blast in Tamil Nadu are as tantalising as a hypothetical Red salute to Mamata in Bengal.        
	The ad shift came with the speculation that Dayanidhi, the Union communications minister who lost his berth after a power tussle within the ruling DMK, would drive to Jayalalithaas home to wish her and deliver Karunanidhi a symbolic snub.        
	The encounter didnt take place, though media crew and photographers swarmed outside the ADMK leaders Poes Garden home hoping to catch a glimpse of the most important one-on-one in Tamil Nadu politics in recent times.        
	The air of anticipation was cleared a little this evening when Maran dismissed speculation about the meeting as rumours and described the ADMK decision to place ads in his familys papers as pure business.         
	But the buzz that the Marans could be warming up to an alliance with Jayalalithaa did not die down completely.        
	Thina Thanthi, the daily owned by media baron Sivanthi Adityan in which the birthday ads had been appearing for years, went without them completely.         
	The change in the ADMKs choice of papers has come at a time when the state government is about to set up Arasu Cable, seen as a potential rival to SUNs Sumangali Cable Vision, which controls 80 per cent of the states cable TV business.        
	ADMK treasurer and former interim chief minister . Pannerselvam had paid for several of the ads.         
	The offices of Dinakaran, one of the two dailies in which the ads appeared, was ransacked last year, allegedly by supporters of Karunanidhis elder son, M.K. Azhagiri, to protest an opinion poll that showed he would lose out in the DMK succession race to younger brother M.K. Stalin.        
	Away from the speculation about a new alliance, Jayalalithaa celebrated her birthday by organising a mass wedding for 65 couples. One such wedding touched an emotional chord when it emerged that the bride, Meenakshi, had been named by the former chief minister as a baby over 20 years back.

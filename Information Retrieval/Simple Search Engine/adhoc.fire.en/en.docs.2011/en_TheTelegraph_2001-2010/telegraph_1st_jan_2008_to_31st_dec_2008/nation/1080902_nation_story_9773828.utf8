	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 1: Rasananda Pradhan was not as fortunate as his brother Motilal and the others. He tried to escape the wrath of rioters at his Gadragaon village in Chakapad in the trouble-torn Khandhamal district last Sunday.        
	But down with paralysis, the well-built Rasananda could not budge until someone lent him a helping hand. His brother, sister-in-law and their children were fleeing to forests behind their house. They were too scared about losing their lives and had no time to carry Rasananda, 35, along.        
	He prayed, screamed for help, and even cursed others. All of you are selfish, he cried helplessly but there was no one around. In no time a mob made in their way into the house. Rasananda pleaded to take him out to the open and then do whatever they wished to the house.        
	But he was mocked at several times before being doused with petrol and burnt alive. Soon, one after another all the houses were burnt in the village. Motilal, with a guilty mind, narrated the incident to Governor Murlidhar Chandrakant Bhandare during his visit to YMCA here today. Motilal and hundreds like him from the riot-hit areas of Khandhamal and neighbouring districts have been coming here during the past couple of days.        
	I could have saved my brother but at that time I ran for my life. I knew otherwise no one of us would be saved, Motilal broke down.        
	After spending days at the forests without food and water, they walked almost 200km barefoot to reach towns which had communication facilities from where they took buses and trucks to reach Bhubaneswar. They got into whatever vehicles they found on the road. We had no money but we told our woes to the drivers and they were kind. They did not charge us a penny to take us here, said Anju Mary Pradhan, 22.        
	My father had paralysis and my mother could not leave him alone. They asked me to escape but I am yet to know of their whereabouts. I do not know if they are alive, she wept inconsolably.        
	At YMCA, the victims have been putting up in a large hall. We have villagers from Rupagaon, Kilingia, Raikia, Batingia, Tiangia, Seepaiju and Bolangia of Khandhamal district, said Swarupananda Patra, the YMCA president.        
	Governor Bhandare talked to the victims and assured then of all possible help.

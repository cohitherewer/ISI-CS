The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin-income couples rock
                                                                                                               Twin-income couples rock
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: He dashes out the door every morning. Her boss drops her home late every night.        
	He wants to switch cities for greener pastures. She feels her current office is like a home.        
	She wants to get back to work because the baby is nearly six months old. He wants her to stay put for a couple more months.         
	Hes a weekend dad. She tries her best to be a round-the-year mom.        
	Marriage on the rocks? You must be kiddin.        
	Life isnt always honey for double-income couples in India, but they arent ready to call it quits yet.        
	One in three does concede that pressures of home and work do raise chances of divorce, but eight out of ten are still satisfied with work-family balance.        
	A survey by global research firm Synovate for the countrys leading staffing company Teamlease Services said the overall satisfaction level of married working couples was as high as 87 per cent.        
	But the survey also found that 34 per cent of the couples felt that two careers substantially increased chances of a difference of opinion leading to divorce, while 63 per cent agreed that fights were common on issues like quality time.        
	Delhi was the sole exception where about 56 per cent of the respondents disagreed about fights being common in double-income families.        
	The survey was conducted on corporate executives married with or without kids across five cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad.        
	Despite the high satisfaction levels about the overall work-life balance, 52 per cent said that, given a chance, they would go for a less lavish life with one spouse working. Forty-eight per cent rooted for a luxury life where both husband and wife are working.        
	Eighty-eight per cent of the respondents in Pune and 66 per cent in Delhi preferred a double-income luxury life, while a majority in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai voted in favour of a single-income but satisfactory marital relationship.        
	Ninety-five per cent of Hyderabadis said they wanted a single-income and less lavish life for the sake of marital bliss.        
	Although the survey said a growing number of men were becoming actively involved in sharing family responsibilities, including rearing a child, it warned that a large number of working couples had become weekend parents.                                
	At least 54 per cent of those surveyed said they were becoming weekend parents, though Bangalore and Mumbai were exceptions.        
	The survey came amid a sharp surge in the number of working couples with increased urbanisation and the need for two incomes.        
	This survey highlights the bitter-sweet implications of two careers. The stress on marriages and childcare is often perceived to blunt the economic upside, Teamlease general manager Surabhi Mathur said.        
	The continued difficulties for women looking to re-enter the workforce after a child break and the high unwilling rerness to move cities to follow their spouses careers highlight the continued challenges for women spouses in the Indian workplace, the Teamlease official added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 1: A tactical error led to the Maoists attack on the elite Greyhound commandos in Balimela reservoir, the Orissa government said today.        
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra said: No doubt Andhra Pradeshs elite Greyhound forces have been effective in countering Naxalites. They have also carried out several successful anti-Maoist operations in border areas. But, this time, they apparently committed a major tactical error.        
	It was a tactical error to travel in a boat in such a large number and cover such a long distance over water.         
	The commandos should have gone in smaller groups and started early in they morning, the home secretary said, adding that this was the expert assessment of the state government.        
	Orissa will not conduct a probe into the circumstances leading to the Maoist attack on Greyhound commandos in Balimela reservoir.        
	Search operation        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today sought six more companies of central paramilitary forces to carry out combing operations in Malkangiri. The search and rescue operation for the bodies of Greyhound personnel intensified today with ONGC divers and six helicopters being deployed. Yesterday, the body of one jawan was fished out with hands tied behind, said home secretary.

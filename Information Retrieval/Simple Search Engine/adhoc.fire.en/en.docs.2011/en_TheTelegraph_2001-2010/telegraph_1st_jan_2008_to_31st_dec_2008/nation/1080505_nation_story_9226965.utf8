	New Delhi, May 4: India will renew its proposals for more road links with Pakistan and seek to push confidence-building measures to a new high during external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Islamabad later this month.         
	With the May 21 visit, during which Mukherjee will hold talks with his Pakistan counterpart Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Delhi will be picking up the threads of a peace initiative, this time with an elected government led by the Pakistan Peoples Party.         
	Following Mukherjees visit, India and Pakistan will start another round of composite dialogue that covers nearly all the subjects involved in bilateral ties, from trade to military confidence-building and cultural exchange.         
	Mukherjee is likely to push for more cross-border transport. He will test Islamabads response to opening bus services between Kargil in Indias Ladakh and Skardu in Pakistans Northern Areas.         
	The Kargil-Skardu road would pass through areas that have witnessed some of the most intense battles in the 1999 border war. Most of the road is motorable. Just a kilometre has to be evened out. The road route was used before Partition.

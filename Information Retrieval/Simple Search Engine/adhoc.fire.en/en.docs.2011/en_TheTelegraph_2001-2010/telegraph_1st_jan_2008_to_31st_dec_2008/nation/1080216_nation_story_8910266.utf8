	Taste of Tunisia at envoy high table    
	The culinary diplomacy went way beyond the lunch table.    
	Tunisian ambassador Raouf Chatty recently organised a lunch for scribes that left many wondering if Tunisia was a better place to settle down than good old Delhi.    
	ongues rolled and eyes popped at the scrumptious platter: tangy green salad, couscous with red peppers and tajine, a quiche with meat and plenty of Tunisian wine.    
	To round off the elaborate meal on a sweet note was an array of traditional desserts. Tiny puff pastries, dripping with honey, a lot like the Turkish baklava, competed for attention with white-sugared almonds. The fare was tossed up by Tunisian chefs in the ambassadors own kitchen  under the watchful eyes of his wife.     
	Olive oil is an integral part of Tunisian cuisine. We use plenty of tomatoes, spices and seafood. Our sweets are delectable with sugar, almonds and dates, Chatty said.    
	If there was a lip-smacking fare on the table, business was on the mind. The ambassador plans to make Tunisian fare popular. Food festivals are high on the menu.        
	School lessons for govt    
	The Delhi government has been given a tough lesson on unauthorised schools.    
	The high court held the capitals civic authorities guilty of phenomenal failure in checking these institutions last week.    
	The authorities was asked to close down these schools if they did not satisfy recognition requirements. The judges said the states inability to provide education facilities had led to the mushrooming of the unsafe, unsatisfactory or wholly-dysfunctional institutions.    
	The orders came on a public interest litigation filed by an NGO, which said the city had over 10,000 of these schools.     
	The directorate of education has been asked to carry out a survey on the institutions and submit a report to the court in six months. Later, the process of granting recognition could be started for those that meet the standards, the court said.    
	Housing bill for strays    
	Mumbai will have to spend Rs 177 crore on housing stray dogs.    
	The civic authorities came up with the figure and told Bombay High Court the money would go into setting up shelters for the canines caught and caged during anti-stray drives.    
	The bill  authorities could think it is a bite given the large sum  will not end there. Another Rs 27 crore will be needed, each year, for the upkeep of these shelters.    
	The submissions in an affidavit came during the hearing of a public interest litigation by an animal rights group.    
	The court had earlier ordered that the houses be built outside the city limits.     
	In keeping with the directive, the civic authorities have taken possession of two chunks of land in Palghar and Wada. Both places are located within Thane, the district that borders Mumbai.        
	Metro screens    
	Life at the Metro just got easier. Giant screens displaying messages on train movements, security and other information will soon be installed to update commuters.    
	Initially, 25 light-emitting diode screens, each with a size of 150 inches, will be installed at eight stations on the Indraprastha-Dwarka line, a Metro official said early this week.    
	Over the next few months, such screens will come up at Pragati Maidan, Ashram, Karol Bagh, Rajendra Place, Rajouri Garden, Janakpuri, Uttam Nagar and Dwarka Sector-9.     
	hey will be three times the LDC screens installed at Connaught Place and Kashmere Gate. A private firm will put up the display units, which will also feature advertisements.  
	Mumbai: This Saturday, watch Bombay Black, a tale of seduction, betrayal, revenge and that leap of faith called love in present-day Mumbai. The play will be staged at Prithvi Theatre at 9pm. The venue is 20 Janki Kutir, Juhu Church Road. Call 022-26149546 for more information.

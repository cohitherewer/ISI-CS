          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Oct. 19: Belgium police claim to have picked up 200 illegal immigrants, mostly men from Punjab, and 15 of their traffickers in a series of dawn raids yesterday.        
	The police said they found 50 of the illegal immigrants hiding in a gurdwara in Vilvoorde, a suburb north of Brussels. Although the claims could not be independently verified, the police believe they have smashed a trafficking ring aimed at bringing people from Punjab to the UK.        
	Prosecutors said some of the Indians had paid up to 20,000 euros (more than Rs 13 lakh) for their passage to the UK via Russia and Belgium. For that kind of money, the Indians would have done better to have remained in India, for jobs are scarce in the UK and illegal immigrants who live in the shadows earn pitiful sums of money.        
	Yesterdays raids, the police said, followed a yearlong investigation into human trafficking. In the current anti-immigrant atmosphere that prevails throughout western Europe, all claims need to be verified.        
	According to Tim de Wolf, an assistant prosecutor involved in the investigation, the ring was believed to be capable of smuggling thousands of people into Britain every year. We think we found and identified about 15 of the organisers of this smuggling of human beings, he said.         
	Those arrested were said to be mainly Indian men aged between 15 and 35, as well as some women and children, he added. They were being kept in miserable conditions while waiting to be taken on the final leg of their journey. We found 24 people crammed inside one windowless room, measuring around 12sqm, he said.         
	Two of those arrested were the brains behind the trafficking operations in Belgium, de Wolf said.         
	They controlled a whole series of little groups, sometimes working together, sometimes competing against each other. We hope that we have broken up the core of the network.        
	In Britain, the government is coming out with anti-immigrant declarations almost on a daily basis.        
	Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, has said that strict limits are to be imposed on immigration amid fears that rising unemployment in the economic downturn will fuel racial tension.         
	He said he wanted to see a dramatic reduction in the number of migrants coming to Britain and that ministers intended to introduce changes in policy to set a limit on migration. This government isnt going to allow the population to go up to 70 million, he told The Sunday Times.         
	In an attempt to keep tabs on identity, it was reported today by The Sunday Times, everyone who buys a mobile phone will be forced to register their identity on a national database.         
	Privacy campaigners fear it marks the latest government move to create a surveillance society.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Job hunt plunges youth into reality dire straits
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, July 15: If Akshay Kumar could pull out a python, what was three minutes under water?        
	Young Anzar would be lucky to tell how it was  if he survives.        
	The 22-year-old was today battling for life in an Indore hospital after a search for a job drove him to FEAR FACTOR  Khatron ke Khiladi, a reality show that was being shot in a posh city mall.        
	Terrifying reality is now staring at his widowed mother, who had to beg neighbours for the Rs 130 bus fare from Sagar, 360km away.         
	Allah, have mercy on my son, Rabia Bi kept crying as another son, Nisar, huddled close to his mother.        
	The walk-in show had asked participants to get into a seven-foot container and hold their breath underwater for as long as possible. Sensing that a few minutes of stunt could get him some money and fame, Anzar had opted for it without reading the fine print: that the sponsors had no liability if anything went wrong.        
	Indore police, however, rejected the clause, and arrested organisers Kunal, Ravi and Ajay of Candid Marketing.        
	Apart from money, the organisers had promised an interaction with Bollywood hunk Akshay. The programme was to be aired next month.        
	At the launch, Akshay had made a dramatic entry on a bike, smashing glass. The actor expressed what fear meant when he suddenly pulled out a python from under a table.        
	Another attraction was the presence of 13 Bollywood bombshells like Yana Gupta and Pooja Bedi competing with one another and their fears.        
	Anzar collapsed within a minute of getting out of water.         
	He is on ventilator, Mayor hospital director G.M. Shah said. His condition is critical. His lungs are filled with water.         
	Asked who was paying for Anzars treatment, Shah said: We have been told by the sponsors that they will bear the entire cost.        
	A sobbing Rabia Bi said she had no idea that Anzar was planning to try his luck at a daredevil show. He told me a few days ago he was going to Indore to search for a job. On Saturday, he told me he would soon give me some news. The news that I got was he was lying unconscious in hospital on a ventilator.        
	Nisar said his brother had strayed into the mall. He was never tempted by easy money. I think desperation for a job made him go for it.        
	Police sources said the organisers fled the scene and some among the audience took Anzar to hospital.

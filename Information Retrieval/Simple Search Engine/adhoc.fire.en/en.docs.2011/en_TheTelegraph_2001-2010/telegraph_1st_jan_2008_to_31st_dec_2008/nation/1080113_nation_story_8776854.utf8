     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: The Forward Bloc and the RSP have decided to skip a CPM rally tomorrow despite the big brothers efforts to clear the air on Bengals industrialisation with its allies.
    
	The CPI has, however, accepted the invitation of its Left Front partner to join the Brigade Parade Ground march to mark the open session of the CPMs five-day state conference from Monday.
    
	We invite our front allies at every Brigade rally, organised after every three years as part of the open session of the partys state conference, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said. Non-participation of two of our allies will send a wrong signal to people across Bengal.
    
	Konar said he did not know why the two allies had decided to stay away. We have already initiated a bipartite dialogue with the Bloc leadership and will soon do so with other front allies to clear misgivings about the states industrialisation, he added.
    
	But the RSP, which had blamed the CPM for the Nandigram killings, stuck to its stand. We are not joining the rally, come what may, state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay said tonight.
    
	The former minister in Jyoti Basus cabinet said his party had got the invite but does not feel it important to be present at a CPM rally. 
    
	Bloc secretariat member Naren De echoed him. Why should we be present at tomorrows rally? the Bengal agriculture minister asked.
    
	Bloc leaders have already announced that the party would fight the May panchayat polls independently.
    
	Asked about the decision of the two other front partners, CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar said: I can say about my partys decision, not that of others.
    
	Front sources said relations between the CPM and its allies could be strained further in the coming days. The situation is coming to such a pass that its becoming difficult to carry on with the CPM because of its big brother attitude, said a front leader.

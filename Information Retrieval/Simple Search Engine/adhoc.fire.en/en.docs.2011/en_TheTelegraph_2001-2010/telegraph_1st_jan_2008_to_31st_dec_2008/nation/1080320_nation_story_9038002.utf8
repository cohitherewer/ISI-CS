The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | High court rejects probe plea
                                                                                                               High court rejects probe plea
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 19: Orissa High Court today rejected a PIL seeking a CBI probe into concessions granted by Industrial Development Bank of India Limited (IDBI) in 2003-04 to facilitate a debt-restructuring package for Indian Charge Chrome Limited (ICCL), a subsidiary of Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys (Imfa).         
	The PILs fate is significant as Imfa is Indias largest producer of ferro alloys with a turnover of Rs 593.54 crore, while ICCL leads the ferro-chrome sector with more than 1,00,000-tonne production in a year.         
	Orissas political parties had also demanded an inquiry into the alleged concessions.        
	Gyanaguru Das, a social activist based in Cuttack, had filed the PIL in September 2007. In October 2007, the high court issued notices to the secretary in the department of banking at the Centre, IDBI, and financial institutions involved.         
	A two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B.N. Mohapatra rejected the PIL at the preliminary hearing stage on grounds of delay in filing of the petition, said petitioners counsel Subir Palit.        
	The bench also took into account the courts verdict rejecting a petition filed on the same issue earlier, Palit said.        
	The PIL was related to concessions allowed to ICCL when it owed IDBI some Rs 500 crore.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 9: Governor M.C. Bhandare today visited relief camps and met riot-hit people in Kandhamal.        
	The governors visit assumes significance in the wake of the Oppositions demand for his intervention and imposition of Presidents rule.        
	The governor visited Kurmingia village near Kalinga and spoke to the people there. He then travelled to a relief camp at Udaygiri and spent 30 minutes there with residents and then went to a camp and a school at Tikabali. Later, at the Kandhamal district headquarters he took stock of the R amp;R measures undertaken by the district administration.        
	Maken jab at saffron        
	Drawing a parallel between the Godhra violence and the Kandhamal clashes, AICC general secretary and Union minister Ajay Maken today alleged that the recent incidents in the district were part of a deep-rooted conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, especially the BJP, with BJDs active support.        
	Both incidents (Godhra and Kandhamal) happened in the election year. They (incidents) began as law and order related incidents and then took a communal turn, said Maken, while addressing a news conference today. In both cases, culprits were not arrested, he pointed out.        
	It was negligence on the governments part, as it failed to protect Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati despite knowing about the threat on the seers life. As expected, the murders triggered violence not only in Kandhamal but in several parts of the state, even in places like Padampur, resulting in the death of a young girl, he said. It seems there was a deep-rooted conspiracy by the communal forces such as VHP, RSS, Bajrang Dal and BJP with the active support of BJD, said Maken.        
	The Union minister, who was denied permission to visit Kandhamal, was critical of the double standard maintained by the government in allowing Saffron leaders into the district.

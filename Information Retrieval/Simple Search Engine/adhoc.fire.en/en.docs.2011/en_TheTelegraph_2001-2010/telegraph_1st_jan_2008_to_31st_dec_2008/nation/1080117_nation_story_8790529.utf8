	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: The students of ADLS Sunshine School are the first ones to get their health cards in Jamshedpur. 
    
	The innovative concept has been designed with the objective to ensure sound physical health of the students. The health cards were today given to students of nursery classes only. 
    
	The cards are to be updated on an annual basis and the students would retain the card for three years. 
    
	We opted for the health card system as it would help us monitor the health condition of our students, said Indrani Singh, the principal of ADLS Sunshine School. 
    
	The school today organised a free medical check up for the students. The results of the check up were quite shocking. 
    
	While some children were tested positive with tonsillitis, quite a few were found affected with tooth cavities. Some were found with hardened wax in their ears, which might lead to ear infection in the near future and in the longer run cause hearing problem for these kids. 
    
	Acting on the basis of results found during the tests, a photocopy of the health card would be kept with the school authorities. 
    
	The school authorities have decided to address parents individually depending on the severity of problems faced by their wards. It would be a wise decision for us to involve parents as students are too young to take care of themselves, said Singh. 
    
	The school plans implement the health card soon in the other classes as well.

	Mumbai, June 5: If you are a Tata Sky subscriber and a sports buff, chances are you will have to shell out more to watch Rafael Nadal or Christiano Ronaldo in action.         
	This is because of a dispute between ESPN Software and Tata Sky over a new channel packaging system introduced by the direct-to-home service provider that the sports broadcaster calls unfair trade practice.        
	ESPN-STAR today said it would move Delhi High Court against Tata Sky for allegedly hurting its brand equity by unilaterally and arbitrarily removing the channels from the basic bouquet. Tata Sky wants to offer ESPN-STARs sports channels as an add-on pack.        
	ESPN-STAR issued ads blaming Tata Sky for not broadcasting ESPN, STAR Sports and STAR Cricket to all its subscribers. Saying there has been no increase in its rates, the ads say the blackout means many viewers will miss out on the French Open, Euro 2008, the Asia Cup, Wimbledon, Formula 1 and ICC Champions trophy.         
	ESPN alleged that that Tata Sky has been demanding unreasonable discounts.         
	Tata Sky recently unveiled new subscription rates that were lower by Rs 50 and separately priced the ESPN STAR channels for Rs 40, Ten Sports for Rs 30, and BBCs bouquet of channels for Rs 15 in the add-on pack. .        
	A spokesperson said: Subscribers can choose add-on packs and pay for them for the month they want them for rather than for the whole year. He alleged that except ESPN, all broadcasters had accepted Trai guidelines that recommend that content prices should be made available to DTH platforms on a la carte basis.

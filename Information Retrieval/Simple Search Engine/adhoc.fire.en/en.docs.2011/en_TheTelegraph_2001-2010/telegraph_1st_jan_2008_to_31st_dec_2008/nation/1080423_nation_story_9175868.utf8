	New Delhi, April 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs special aircraft  on its way back from Jharkhand  was forced to hover around Delhi for 16 minutes after an unidentified blip appeared on the radar screen as the IAF Boeing 737 was preparing to land.        
	The blip, in the planes flight path, seemed to suggest a moving object may have been chasing the aircraft, sources in the Airports Authority of India said.        
	An emergency security drill on the ground followed while air traffic controllers asked the pilot to hover around Delhi for 16 minutes before clearing the plane to land on a different runway.        
	The pilot switched off the aircrafts instrument landing system and guided the plane on a changed flight path manually while making the final approach, the sources added.        
	The AAI has ordered a probe. Sources in the Prime Ministers Office refused comment.        
	The AAI sources said an aircraft carrying a transponder on board linked to secondary radars on the ground could have caused the blip. A system fault in the air traffic control system is also not being ruled out.        
	AAI officials said the blip could also have been a result of a large bird flying at an unusual height.        
	However, investigations by security agencies later revealed that the blip was caused by total internal reflection.         
	This happens in summer because of atmospheric changes, a source claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt slammed for ration grain theft
                                                                                                               Govt slammed for ration grain theft
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers burn furniture to protest against irregularities in the ration system in Birbhum, Bengal                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: The Centre was rapped in Parliament yesterday for its casual attitude to black marketeers grabbing foodgrain meant for the poor.        
	In an action-taken report tabled in the House, the government admitted that its monitoring mechanisms had failed to check large-scale diversion of public distribution system (PDS) foodgrains.        
	This brought it a rebuke from the standing committee on food, consumer affairs and public distribution, which had earlier suggested ways to prevent such diversion.        
	The government had taken a casual stand on the recommendations, the House panel said in remarks added to the report.        
	Told that its monitoring mechanisms had failed, the government did not deny the charge.        
	The recommendation of the committee has been noted. It shall be the constant endeavour of the (food and public distribution) department to ensure proper functioning of various monitoring mechanisms, the government replied.        
	But the committee was not satisfied. It said the Centre should act on its recommendations and not try to mislead the committee by such a vague reply.        
	Of the countrys 35 states and Union territories, at least 24 are blighted by large-scale diversion of PDS wheat and rice, the House committee said quoting surveys by ORG-MARG and the programme evaluation organisation (PEO), a government arm.        
	The hill states are the worst hit, it said, with the list topped by Manipur where 97.7 per cent of PDS foodgrain finds its way to the black market.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, speaking in Parliament, conceded leaks in the system but put the ball in the state governments court as PDS is a state subject.        
	The House panels report, however, shows that Delhi is fully involved in monitoring the system. The Centre has a task force of officials who are regularly sent to the states to find out how well or badly PDS foodgrains are being distributed.        
	Despite several monitoring mechanisms, and the requirement of utilisation certificates from state governments, the diversion of foodgrains continues, the panel said.        
	Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh figure near the top of the diversion list. There is little demand for wheat in Nagaland, sources said, which allows black marketeers to siphon off almost the entire allotment of the grain.        
	Chidambaram, however, told the Lok Sabha that the poor had benefited through increased PDS distribution during the United Progressive Alliances rule.        
	He reeled off figures showing PDS distribution had fallen during the six years the National Democratic Alliance was in power, but rose after the Congress-led UPA formed the government.

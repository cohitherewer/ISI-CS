	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 26: The Orissa film fraternity is not looking forward to the annual state film awards to be presented on February 28.
    
	Most of the members of the film fraternity here, it seems, disagree with the jury selection. While most actors agree that members are indeed stalwarts in their respective fields, if they are fit to judge films and actors remains a debatable issue. 
    
	Judges for the prestigious event are former director-general of police Bipin Bihari Mishra, novelist Bibhuti Pattnaik, actress Jharana Dash, Odissi dancer Kumkum Mohanty and singers Rashmi Mohapatra and Pranab Pattnaik. 
    
	Little can be done in absence of a strict guideline for constituting a jury. But to take in people who are not qualified to be a film jury is a matter of concern as it will be difficult to accept their decisions, said Nirodh Mohapatra, a film veteran. 
    
	He added that there should be an eligibility criterion before one can be a jury member.
    
	This year there is a decline in the number of entries for the awards. While 14 films were released during the year, there are just six entries for the awards. 
    
	Generally the culture department brings out an advertisement inviting entries, while the eligibility criteria remains film details, including synopsis, cast, technical cast and lyrics besides the copyright and censor certificates.
    
	The Orissa film awards started in 1983, while last it year it re-invented itself as a glamourous event. While budgets for such ceremonies reach crores at some places, in Orissa it is just Rs 4 lakh, barely sufficient to manage the event.

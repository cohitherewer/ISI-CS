The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tall toll plans of civic body
                                                                                                               Tall toll plans of civic body
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 9: Wedding processions in the silver city would have to cough up Rs 1,000 as toll every hour to fund civic development programmes under a user-fee concept floated by Cuttack Municipal Corporation.         
	The concept also introduces the concept of parking fee and additional levy on house owners.         
	The plan is to raise Rs 3 crore annually for the civic body to spend on re-paving, reconstructing and modernising roads and drains and improving other civic amenities. Mayor Nibedita Pradhan described the plan as preliminary, adding that the municipal council has not even endorsed the plan at the moment.         
	Its just kind of a draft proposal which would require the support of all parties in the council and only then we would run it and start thinking about the users fees, the mayor said, talking to The Telegraph today.         
	The proposed toll, called User Development Fee (UDF), envisages fixation of an annual fee of Rs 200 for owners of residential premises and commercial premises in addition to the existing holding tax. Slum dwellers and squatters will pay Rs 20 annually.         
	Presently, for a wedding procession, permission from the sub-collectors office, through local police station, is mandatory.         
	But, under the user-fee concept, families would have to register with the CMC for the procession and toll thereof on an hourly basis.         
	Pradhan said: A screening committee would place the draft proposal before the council for approval only after further scrutiny.         
	The screening committee will soon be constituted with advocates representing the political parties  Bharatiya Janata Party, Biju Janata Dal, Congress, CPM and Orissa Gana Parishad, which have Corporators in the Municipal Council, the Mayor said.         
	The committee will also include the mayor, deputy mayor and commissioner.        
	According to the pencilled version of the user-fee concept, motorists in Cuttack would have to pay parking fees of Rs 20. Scooter riders and motorcyclists would have to pay the same levy at the rate of Rs 10 per parking. Bicyclists have not been spared too. They would pay rupee one.

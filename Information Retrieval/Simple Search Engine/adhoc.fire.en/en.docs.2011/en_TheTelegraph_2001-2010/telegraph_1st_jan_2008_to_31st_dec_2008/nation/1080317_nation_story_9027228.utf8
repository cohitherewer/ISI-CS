          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, March 16: The ongoing agitation by lawyers for circuit benches of the Orissa High Court has cast shadow over the elections to the 25-member state Bar council, voting for which ended on Saturday.         
	There was virtually no turnout at any of the five booths set up at Berhampur, said sources at the state Bar council headquarters here. The Ganjam Bar Association had earlier submitted a memorandum to the state Bar council for postponement of the elections in view of the strike. But the Bar council went ahead with the elections yesterday as the electoral process had already started by then.        
	The lawyers in southern Orissa are on strike for the past three months. Consequently, functioning of all the courts had remained paralysed.        
	A clear picture on the voting percentage would only emerge after we receive the official report along with the ballot boxes from all the voting centres, advocate Ramakanta Mohapatra, the returning officer for this years Bar council elections, told reporters.        
	Official sources said 39,900 lawyers enrolled with the state Bar council were expected to exercise single transferable preferential voting against a list of 104 candidates at 138 booths in different parts of state between 10am and 6pm yesterday. The 25 winners would elect the chairman of the state Bar council.        
	Of the 138 booths, 15 were set up in Cuttack, six in Bhubaneswar, five each in Puri and Berhampur and three each in Balasore, Bhadrak, Sambalpur and Rourkela. All the ballot boxes are expected to reach the Bar council headquarters in Cuttack by tonight.        
	The process of counting of votes, completion of which would take over a month, would commence only after April 2. Official sources attributed the delay to the unavailability of Assembly staff for conducting the counting process. They would be available after the completion of the budget session in the state Assembly and the Rajya Sabha elections, sources said.

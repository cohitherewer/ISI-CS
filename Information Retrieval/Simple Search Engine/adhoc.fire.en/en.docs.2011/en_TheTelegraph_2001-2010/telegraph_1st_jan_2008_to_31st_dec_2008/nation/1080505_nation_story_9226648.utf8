  - Untouchable farmer in Sonia backyard who cant cook lunch hopes she will drop in for dinner or tea        TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Dalits in Sandhi Ram village. Telegraph picture                                        
	Sandhi Ram (Rae Bareli), May 4: Ram Adhar, 48, has a dream. Some day, Sonia Gandhi will be his guest.        
	The untouchable farmer has heard how Rahul Gandhi dropped into a Dalit home in nearby Amethi for dinner last January.        
	Id love it if Sonia Gandhi ate at my house  or at least had a cup of tea, Adhar says in Sandhi Ram village, 16km from Rae Bareli. But she has to come after sundown. We Dalits dont cook during the daytime in summer.        
	So, lesson number one for politicians who have spoken of emulating Rahul  Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is one  is: do your homework.        
	We dare not light fires in the morning or afternoon because of the summer gusts, says Raj Kali, Adhars aunt, a woman in her late forties who sports a jhala (metal earring) and hansuli (silver necklace).        
	You see all this dry grass around our homes? The grass may catch fire and then the wind would blow the flames into our homes. Wed all get killed.        
	The Dalits grow grass on their fallow land because they are the traditional sellers of fodder. Tradition also decrees that they live separated from the rest of the village, where even the other lower castes wouldnt mix socially with them.        
	Sonia can glimpse the caste structure from inside her car if she decides to visit Adhar. As her motorcade veers off the metalled road, she would be greeted first by rows of brick-concrete houses. She has to drive past them  the houses belong to the upper castes.        
	The next cluster of homes  made of brick but without plaster  are owned by the Other Backward Classes. Half a kilometre on, beyond a stretch of paddy fields that run across the village like a border, the cars can stop.        
	Here, under thatched roofs, live Adhar and his ilk.        
	Im an untouchable and so are the other 200 Dalit families here, the farmer says in his three-room house. One of the rooms is used as a cattle-shed, another to store the vegetable crop. The third, a 20ft by 7ft bedroom, is where Adhar, his wife, five sons and daughter huddle together.        
	Unless the courtyard is cleaned ahead of Sonias visit, she must watch her steps.        
	On the ground lie heaps of cow-dung cakes and mahua fruits and stacks of mustard plants. Burnt charcoal, peeled potatoes and soiled plates lie strewn about. Its late morning, and the plates should not be needed for several hours.        
	We eat in the morning and go out to work. We return in the evening to cook. We save a part of the food for next mornings breakfast, Adhar says.        
	But he and his wife Khubraja, 38, are ready to make an exception for their journalist guest. They shove bundles of tall, dry grass into the earthen ovens and light a fire.        
	On one oven they put a pot of rice and on the other, potatoes. The wind is unforgiving, and Adhar struggles to keep the fire alive. It takes an hour before steam rises from the pots.        
	Adhar is surprised that the guest is ready to eat at the home of an untouchable. Politicians stop at our doorstep, throw leaflets, ask for votes and go back.        
	But eating at their homes may not turn every grain of rice into a vote, as the Congress now knows after the recent bypolls.        
	We vote for Sonia in Lok Sabha elections and for the Bahujan Samaj Party in state polls, says Radhe Lal, 19, Adhars eldest son who works as a labourer in Rae Bareli. He keeps an eye out on the oven and the grass.        
	A picture of Mayavati smiles from the bedroom door  after all, Sandhi Ram happens to be an Ambedkar village, figuring prominently in the chief ministers welfare schemes.        
	That probably explains why the homes walls are made of brick and not mud, but not much else. There is no electricity, and the three hand-pumps for the 200 Dalit families run dry in summer.        
	Adhars half-a-bigha land can barely feed his family for six months; the rest of the year he works on an upper-caste farmers land. None from the family went to school.        
	We have all the blessings of the chief minister, yet children die of cholera, malaria and encephalitis in the summer. During the rains, people die of snakebite. We have neither medicines nor doctors at the health centre, which is a 1.5km walk anyway, Khubraja says.        
	Daughter Nisha, 13, has had fever for a week, her face swollen from an infection. Khubraja stares at her and says: What kind of life do we live? Just come and see. We dont live life drags us along.        
	Sonia, the Rae Bareli MP, can expect requests to get the village a doctor and some jobs through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Adhar says.        
	Khubraja gets up. The meal is ready, although it has taken over three hours to cook. If a politician comes in the morning, will he wait so long?        
	The plates are cleaned, and tea made with buffalo milk is served. Adhar draws up a charpoy to talk. He believes things are beginning to change.        
	The upper castes now let us sit on their courtyards, although we must sit some distance away from them. But Rahul Gandhis gesture has surprised us all, the farmer says.        
	At least a Brahmin has shown the way. We shall be thrilled if Sonia Gandhi, too, visits Dalit homes and has a cup of tea, says Ratan Lal, 65, who has returned from Delhi after 34 years working as a railway labourer.        
	Who wants to come next? Mulayam? he asks. Hes welcome, too, he adds with a look of amusement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Northeast link, via Myanmar 
                                                                                                               Northeast link, via Myanmar 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Maung Aye                                  
	New Delhi, April 3: The decks were cleared today for Indias land-locked Northeast to be linked to the Bay of Bengal.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and his Myanmar counterpart, U. Nyan Win, signed an agreement last night finalising a Rs 536-crore project to connect Mizoram by road and river to the Sittwe port on Myanmars west coast.        
	This involves building a 169km road from the NH-54 in Mizoram to Setpyitpyin (Kaletwa) in northern Myanmar, then dredging a 225km stretch of the river Kaladan from Kaletwa to its mouth in the Bay of Bengal.        
	Although we are committed to completing it in five years, we can try and do it in four years, said the minister of state for commerce, Jairam Ramesh.        
	The agreement was signed in the presence of Myanmar vice-senior general, Maung Aye, and Indias Vice-President, Hamid Ansari.        
	As Dhaka dithers on granting trade transit through Chittagong port, the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project promises mainland India a crucial, alternative route to its Northeast. It will also connect the Northeast to Southeast Asia.        
	The objective is to provide an access route from any part of India to the Northeast to counter Bangladeshs continued intransigence in providing us transit rights, a foreign ministry official had said in January.        
	The project has three parts, the first involving an upgrade of the Sittwe port and the second dredging the Kaladan till Kaletwa.        
	In the third phase, India builds a 52km road inside Myanmar from Kaletwa to the Mizoram border, and then extends it for 117km up to NH 54.        
	The project, proposed by the Mizoram government in 1994, was kept pending because India insisted on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) method. Last year, Delhi softened and got ready to experiment with what it describes as build-transfer-use (BTU) method.        
	Myanmar promptly agreed to this method under which, after 60 months of execution, the project will be fully owned by Myanmar under mutually agreed conditions.        
	The route is likely to open avenues for investment in power, oil and gas and lead to railway links between the two countries.

	Panaji, Jan. 13 (PTI): A 32-year-old British national was allegedly raped by a motorcycle rider who offered her a lift after a cultural event they both attended in the Goa capital on Friday night, police said.
    
	The lady has complained that she was taken to an open place and raped by an unknown person in Panaji, deputy superintendent of police Mohan Naik said.
    
	We are awaiting medical examination reports of the victim who came to the police station in an injured condition, Naik added.
    
	This is the second case of abuse against foreigners in the tourist state over the past week. Earlier, a Russian woman had complained of molestation against a shack owner in south Goa who allegedly tried to drag her into a Jeep.
    
	Police sources said the motorbike rider who allegedly assaulted the British woman could be tracked down with the help of passes issued for the cultural programme.
    
	The sources said the woman, who had earlier decided to hire a taxi to return to her lodge, agreed to go with the accused on his bike as she had met him at the event.
    
	Later, the sources said, the woman claimed he took her to an isolated spot on the citys outskirts where he assaulted and raped her.

	Cuttack, Dec. 25: The monthly Oriya magazine Cinema Sansar has created a record of sorts with the release of its 100th issue. It has become the first-ever Oriya film magazine to be published uninterrupted for 100 issues.         
	The 100th issue with a whopping 112 pages was released by R. Venkateswar, the director of the Press Information Bureau, Bhubaneswar, recently.         
	Its a creditable achievement as no other Oriya cinema magazine has so far managed to come up with 100 uninterrupted issues, said Pradip Sahu, the member of the Regional Advisory Panel of Censor Board of Film Certification. Old-timers in the Oriya monthly film magazine business such as Chitrapuri and Chalachitra Jagata published from Cuttack since the Fifties and Seventies, respectively, and Banichitra published from Bhubaneswar since the Sixties may have published more than 200 issues, but none managed 12 issues in a year.

	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Indian military establishment, spurred by the nuclear waiver, has begun a review of overseas deployments with A.K. Antony calling on the army, the navy and the air force to be ready for force projection in foreign territories.         
	The comfort offered by national boundaries no longer constitutes effective defence, the defence minister said, setting the tone for discussions initiated by the Integrated Defence Staff. The discussions are being hosted by the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.         
	Indias recognition as a power by the nuclear club was an acknowledgement of the countrys recognition and profile in the world context, Antony said. The Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver for the India-US nuclear deal was evidence of such acknowledgement.         
	Currently, Indian policy for overseas military missions allow for troop deployments only under the UN flag and, in exceptional circumstances, if a friendly country were to ask for military aid involving movement of soldiers.

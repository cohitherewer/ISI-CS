          OUR BUREAU                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 17: The Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha today acted on its threat and withdrew support to the 23-month-old Madhu Koda government, reducing it to a minority.        
	A 25-member delegation led by Soren handed over a letter withdrawing support to governor Syed Sibtey Razi this evening and urged him to explore the possibility of forming an alternative government. The three JMM ministers  Sudhir Mahto, Dulal Bhuiyan and Nalin Soren  also submitted their resignations to the governor.        
	Razi assured them he would maintain constitutional propriety. He has summoned chief minister Koda, who refused to step down, to brief him on the political situation tomorrow.         
	The Koda camp, which includes Independent ministers, and Soren are expected to go to Delhi tomorrow to lobby Sonia Gandhi and Lalu Prasad.         
	Soren, who is eyeing the chief ministers chair, appeared to have failed to muster the magic number of 42. He could manage 33, with the help of the Congress and the RJD (see chart). But the support of the two parties for Sorens bid to become chief minister came with the rider that he would have to personally ask the Independents to back him.         
	The support of the nine Independent ministers  Koda is an Independent, too  did not appear to be coming.        
	Health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi, the spokesperson for the Independents, met Soren early this morning with HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey to persuade him to change his mind on the pullout. But Soren was adamant.        
	The pullout decision has the support of all the 17 JMM MLAs, four MPs and the partys central committee.         
	By evening, party workers hit the streets in large numbers to celebrate what they thought was the stepping stone for their leader to become chief minister.         
	Later, Soren told reporters he had no option but to withdraw support. He would not comment on his plans now, especially his stand on the UPAs promise of giving the party two berths in the Union cabinet. Right now, I am restricting myself to the interests of the state, he said.         
	He said he took the extreme step in the light of deteriorating law and order and the spurt in Naxalite violence in the state.         
	Chief minister Koda, who attended a scheduled official event in the morning, went into a huddle with the Independent ministers, including Tirkey.         
	This is the fourth time Jharkhand is facing political uncertainty since the 2005 state elections. Soren was installed as chief minister but had to step down in nine days because he did not have the numbers. Arjun Munda replaced him, only to be dethroned in September 2006 by Koda.        
	In an attempt to keep up the pressure on Koda, deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto of the JMM said the party was trying to form a government and was in touch with the Independents. We will not allow Presidents rule here. The situation will be clear in a couple of days, he said.         
	The JMM leader claimed the party was forced to withdraw support after Koda refused to quit even though the UPA leadership wanted him to.         
	But that wasnt the message from the Congress. Ajay Maken, the general secretary in charge of Jharkhand, said in Delhi: We are waiting and watching the situation. But we stand by our earlier position that if Soren manages to get the support of the Independents and the numbers for a majority, we will back him as chief minister.         
	Congress sources said the situation was likely to become clear by Monday afternoon. Their own assessment was Jharkhand was perhaps heading for central rule unless the BJP had a change of heart and decided to support Soren.        
	But the BJP is in no mood for that. A party delegation plans to meet the governor at 11am tomorrow to demand the dismissal of the Koda government. We seek a fresh mandate, state party chief P.N. Singh said.

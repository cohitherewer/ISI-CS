          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The Election Commission has called national and Jammu and Kashmir parties for a meeting next Monday to decide when to hold polls in the troubled state.        
	The poll commission has been getting divergent views from the Centre and the state, though panel officials themselves favour timely elections.        
	We decided to settle the matter by inviting leaders of seven national parties and three state parties. The chief election commissioner and his deputies will meet them individually, an official said.        
	It is only after the meeting that we will have a clear view on the possible timing of the elections.        
	Elections in Kashmir are due before November 20, when the term of the current Assembly expires. But as the state has been under governors rule since July 10, the commission has time till January 10.        
	The official explained that time till January was only a notional thing since polls could not be held in December or January as large parts of the state would be under snow.        
	It has to be October or November, or the elections get postponed to March-April.        
	Another official said: It is not an easy decision for the Election Commission to take on its own.That is why the ball has been thrown into the court of political parties.

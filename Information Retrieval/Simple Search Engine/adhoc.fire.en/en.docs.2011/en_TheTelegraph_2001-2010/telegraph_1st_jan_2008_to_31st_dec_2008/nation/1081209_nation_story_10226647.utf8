	New Delhi/Jaipur, Dec. 8: The Maharani has been dethroned, not so much by the Opposition as by her own follies.         
	Vasundhara Rajes fate as Rajasthan chief minister was sealed in May 2007 when she failed to contain the Gujjar-Meena clashes. There was a repeat of the violence in May this year. As many as 70 lives were lost in the two rounds of clashes.         
	The BJP had assembled various castes under its umbrella in the 2003 elections on the promise of justice for all and sops to them as given to the Gujjars, who were assured of tribal status. But once the dominant Meena community, listed as a scheduled caste, opposed the move, Vasundhara backed out, but not without leaving a trail of blood.        
	Her detractors pointed out how her only answer to a show of protest was to order police firing. Whether it was the farmers of north-west Rajasthan who wanted more water from the river flowing in from Punjab or the upper castes crying foul against the governments failure to give reservation to the economically backward castes, whenever they took to the streets, they were fired upon or hit with lathis.        
	Although she tried to empower women through financial schemes, the only issue that played on womens minds was that her government had opened liquor vends all over the state.         
	A refrain was while Vasundhara plastered posters urging mothers to give a glass of milk to their children daily, the women wondered how they could afford this when their husbands spent a chunk of their earnings on liquor.        
	Another complaint was she made herself inaccessible to BJP and RSS leaders and workers. Rajasthans chief ministers have traditionally kept an open house and were expected to meet anyone at any time, even at midnight. But Vasundhara was reportedly unavailable after 8 in the evening, which earned her the moniker 8pm CM.        
	In feudal Rajasthan, which has a complex relationship with its former kings and queens, the reports of a Maharani allegedly giving a free hand to her administration to make money on the smallest of jobs, whether it was filing an FIR or making a land title, went down badly with the poor.         
	In contrast, the Congresss Ashok Gehlot, expected to be the next chief minister, is seen as clean and transparent.

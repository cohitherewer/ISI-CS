          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 22: First Leslie Tripathy and Bidusmita Patra, now newcomer Sonali Pattnaik has sought police protection from a city businessman who claims that the pretty actress is his wife.        
	Asim Amitabh Pattnaik, a consultant, filed a complaint with Pipili police station claiming that Sonali was his wife and sought legal help to reconcile with her.         
	We have known each other since our schooldays. I married her on July 22, 2006, in a Bhubaneswar temple. The marriage was registered in the Khurda office on July 7 and I have all documentary proof and photographs, said the 28-year-old Pattnaik.        
	Rubbishing all claims, Sonali has said: We have been good friends and there was never a marriage. The debutante added that the consultant was stalking her.        
	Apprehending some sort of action from Pattnaiks side, the actress today filed a counter complaint with the Pipili police station seeking police protection.         
	Interestingly, Pattnaiks parents recently approached the womens commission alleging that their son was being threatened.         
	I have been receiving threat calls. My parents will be filing a complaint with the womens commission soon, the businessman said.         
	Pattnaik is a resident of Patrapada in Bhubaneswar.         
	I married her according to vedic traditions. We have been staying together for the past two years and her parents were aware of this.         
	We had a happy conjugal life and I had always supported her. Last month, when she left to met her parents in Pipili she did not return. Her parents now dont allow me to talk to her, the husband alleged.         
	Sonalis debut film Satyameba Jayatey released on June 14 and is currently running in cinemas across the state.         
	In explanation to the photos that Sonali has with Pattnaik, the actress said they were taken by force. He had taken my signatures on blank papers. I have never been to court to get married, she has stressed.

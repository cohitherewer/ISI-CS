          OUR BUREAU                                    
	April 12: Two Indians were killed and five injured in a Taliban suicide attack in Afghanistan today.        
	Two of our personnel have lost their lives and five others have been injured, the foreign ministry said here.         
	The dead have been identified as M.P. Singh, of Uttar Pradesh, and C. Govindaswamy, of Tamil Nadu. The men were killed when a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into construction workers near the Minar area of Nimroz province between 9am and 9.30am.        
	Nearly 400 Border Roads Organisation personnel are engaged in building a 218km highway between Zaranj and Delaram as part of Indias assistance programme. About 300 Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel were sent to provide security to the construction workers.        
	Among the injured, Vikram Singh, Muhammad Nazin Khan and Anil Kumar Thampi were from the ITBP and Bishram Oroan and Mayaram from the BRO.         
	Agencies quoted the provincial governor of Nimroz, Ghulam Dastagir Azad, saying three persons had died, the third being an Afghan driver.        
	Govindaswamy, 47, belonged to Thippanapalli village in Tamil Nadus Krishnagiri district and was a mason, his father, also called Govindaswamy, said.         
	He worked for an organisation called GREFF that assists the Indian Army, Krishnagiri district collector Santhosh Babu added.         
	He is survived by wife Sivakami, three married daughters and a son studying in Class X.         
	Govindasamys family has some agricultural land, Babu said.         
	M.P. Singh worked with the BRO.         
	At the Thampis home in Keralas Kottayam district, T.A. Thampi said he received a call from his son around 8pm. He said he was injured in an accident. He said there would be an operation in his leg and he is now in a hospital and we should not worry, Anils father said.         
	Anil had come home just six months back.         
	An AFP report from Herat said a man claiming to be a Taliban spokesman said his outfit was behind the attack. Identifying himself as Yousuf Ahmadi, he said the Taliban first detonated two mines and then a suicide bomber blew himself up.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was in Bengal today, condemned the attack but said India would carry on its reconstruction projects in Afghanistan.         
	India is constructing an arterial road in Afghanistan. This road will help travel through Iran and help improve communications with West Asia, he said.        
	The foreign ministry spokesperson said: The injured have been moved to Zaranj for medical attention and arrangements are being made for immediate evacuation of the dead bodies and the wounded. Compensation and insurance for the victims will be disbursed immediately.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Separatist cry gains currency
                                                                                                            Separatist cry gains currency
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 2: Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Tariq Hameed Qarra today stepped up the pitch for self-rule by talking of a separate currency for the state.        
	Once we have self-rule in our state, we will have our own currency, the Peoples Democratic Party minister said at a J amp;K Bank programme.        
	With Assembly elections a few months away, mainstream parties have begun raising their separatist pitch.         
	However, each party has defined self-rule by its own unique yardstick.        
	The PDP, which has ruffled many feathers over the demand, has never been able to explain the term in detail.         
	The Congresss ruling coalition partner in the state has swung between claiming that self-rule means negating Jammu and Kashmirs accession to Pakistan to diluting Indias sovereignty.        
	But it has maintained that the PDP demand for self-rule is a larger package than the National Conference call for recast of the administrative relationship between the Centre and the state.         
	Its demand apparently has an internal dimension and an external one that includes Pakistan.        
	Qarra today added to the haze as he looked at pictures of 14th-century coins showcased by J amp;K Bank in its 2008 calendar.        
	We have lost our 500-year-old identity and we are trying to restore it. In earlier times, we had our own currency, he said.        
	These coins, on the one hand, depict that Kashmir had its own economy for which we are striving even today. On the other hand, it displays our unique cultural identity for which we have been fighting for ages now.        
	The state president of the National Conference, Mehboob Beig, dismissed Qarras remark as an election gimmick.        
	It has been six months since they raised the issue of self-rule but they have not been able to define it so far. They should do it now instead of issuing such statements, Beig said.        
	Last month, former chief minister Farooq Abdullah had said that rights abuses by security forces had put a question mark on his father Sheikh Abdullahs decision to support Kashmirs accession to India.

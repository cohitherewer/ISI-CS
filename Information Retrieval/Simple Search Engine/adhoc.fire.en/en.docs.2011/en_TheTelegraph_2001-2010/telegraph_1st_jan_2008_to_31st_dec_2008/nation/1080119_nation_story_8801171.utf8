	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Supreme Court today rejected a rapist fathers plea for leniency and upheld a Rajasthan High Court order sentencing him to life imprisonment, reports our legal correspondent.
    
	Appeal dismissed as there is no merit in the case, a two-judge bench said.
    
	According to the prosecutions case, Hanuman Singhs estranged wife Shanti Devi had filed an FIR against him on October 1, 2000, accusing him of raping their elder daughter, who was then a minor. 
    
	Shanti said she had left Singh as he would often beat her up. She went to Kishangarh to live with her brother, but left behind her son and two daughters with her husband in Ajmer. When Shanti came to meet them, her elder daughter began to cry and begged her to take her along to Kishangarh. 
    
	At Kishangarh, she said her father had been raping her for five to six months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Women ticket by law: Govt
                                                                                                               Women ticket by law: Govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The government has made it clear on the eve of Parliaments budget session that the proposal to increase the number of women in legislatures through distribution of election tickets was not acceptable.        
	A proper earmarked quota in Assemblies and Parliament would be ensured through legislation, it asserted.         
	Briefing the media on the agenda for the budget session, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said: We wont make a mockery of womens quota by leaving it to parties. We know parties will fulfil the formalities by giving un-winnable seats to women. We are seriously working towards a consensus on a legislation to ensure reservation for women and we will soon come up with a legislation.        
	The proposal to make it mandatory for parties to give 33 per cent tickets to women  initially mooted by the Election Commission  has gained credence with the BJP recently raising the pitch in its support. The party, however, diluted its position by saying it was agreeable to other plans as well, including the original one for a fixed quota of 33 per cent seats in legislatures.         
	The BJP had a few days ago given an ultimatum to the government to present a bill in the budget session. Das Munshi made light of the ultimatum, saying the BJP leadership was confused and it would be better if the party made up its mind about the exact nature of reservation it wanted.         
	Das Munshi also hinted that increasing the number of seats in Parliament was difficult at this stage, particularly after the completion of the delimitation exercise.        
	Financial business would be given top priority in the budget session, the minister said.

          OUR BUREAU                          Modi: Marxist surprise                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram/New Delhi, Dec. 29: Pat for Narendra Modi, from a Marxist.        
	A Kerala CPM MP thinks the Left should emulate the development model of the Gujarat chief minister, a man the comrades love to hate.        
	Gujarat is getting investments, and industrialists are fond of chief minister Narendra Modi, A.P. Abdullah Kutty said at an event in Dubai yesterday.        
	The Lok Sabha MP from Kannur, Kerala, went on to add that the Nano small-car project had gone to Gujarat because Modi gave the best alternative proposal.        
	In CPM-ruled Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, blamed for driving the Nano out of the state, can be forgiven if her lips curve in a smile.        
	CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy had said in an editorial in October that Mamata had not only ensured the exit of the project from Bengal but, being a steadfast ally of the BJP, also facilitated the projects relocation to Gujarat.         
	Remember, she (Mamata) continued to remain with the National Democratic Alliance and, thus, in a way endorsed the communal carnage unleashed in the state by (the) Bharatiya Janata Partys Narendra Modi government, the editorial said.        
	Kutty, however, told the Indian Media Forum in Dubai that the Left should ponder why Ratan Tata shifted his project to Gujarat. Several chief ministers, he said, were ready to welcome him but Tata opted for Modi.        
	Asked how he could compliment a man blamed for the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat, Kutty said the 2002 pogrom could not take away the fact that Modi had brought investments to Gujarat.        
	Today, Gujarat is the most investor-friendly state in the country. Thats the only state where every investor gets a red-carpet welcome, no matter how much he invests, he said.        
	CPM central leaders have not yet formally reacted to Kuttys comments. As of now, we have only seen some reports about it, said a central leader.         
	This is not the first time Kutty has taken a stand at variance with that of his party.        
	Known to belong to the camp of Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan  who is at loggerheads with state party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, the leader of the dominant faction  Kutty had earlier embarrassed the CPM by performing Haj.        
	He had also said the CPM needed to change its attitude towards believers. Belief is a personal affair. Nowhere is it said in the Marxist lexicon that a communist should be an atheist. Yet the party frowns on believers who want to follow the Left ideology, Kutty, who does not have even an outside chance of being re-nominated from Kannur, had said in a recent interview.

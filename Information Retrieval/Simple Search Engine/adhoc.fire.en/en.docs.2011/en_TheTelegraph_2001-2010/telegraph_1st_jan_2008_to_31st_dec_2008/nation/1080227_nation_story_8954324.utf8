     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Hyderabad, Feb. 26: The industrialist son of junior Union coal minister Dasari Narayana Rao was allegedly kidnapped this evening amid accusations from his wife that her father-in-law was responsible for the incident.
    
	Harihara Prabhu went missing from a hotel in Chittoor, 730km from Hyderabad, where he had gone on a business trip on Sunday. 
    
	Hariharas wife Sushila filed a police complaint claiming five persons took her husband away. She held her father-in-law, who had disapproved of their marriage three years ago, responsible for the disappearance. Sushila alleged that the ministers henchmen could have kidnapped Harihara.
    
	District police chief Shashidhar Reddy said investigations were on. Checks on highways out of the town have been intensified.
    
	The tussle between Rao and his daughter-in-law had hit headlines last year after the minister separated his son from Sushila. She had filed a case against her father-in-law and an out-of-court settlement had been proposed.

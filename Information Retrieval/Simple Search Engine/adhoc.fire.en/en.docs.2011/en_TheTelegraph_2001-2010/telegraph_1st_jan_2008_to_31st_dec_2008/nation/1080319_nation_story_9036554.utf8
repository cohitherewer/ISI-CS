	Pet peeve dogs police constable    
	The citys police have been slapped with the charge of a false encounter  with a dog.    
	A family in Kharghar in Navi Mumbai has alleged that a police constable, posing as a civic worker, had shot their pet dog on February 22.     
	The Gaikwads were in their home when three-year-old Raja was shot. But their neighbours in the Gharkul complex said they saw the dog falling to the bullets of the cop, who had claimed to be a corporation employee chasing strays.     
	I remember the person very well. He was tall and dark. I also spoke to him before he killed Raja. The day after the incident, I saw him in our complex. When I enquired about him, people told me that his name is Dattaray Chougule and he lives in D1 apartment in the same complex, Nagesh Kadbe said.     
	Kadbe informed the Gaikwad family and they found out that Chougule is a constable at the Belapur police station.    
	The police have started an investigation.        
	130-yr-old puzzle for AIIMS    
	The surgery was no big deal, but a queer problem left doctors at AIIMS puzzled.     
	A sadhu who got his bladder tumour removed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences claimed to be 130 years old. But the doctors said it wasnt possible for such an old man to undergo such a complicated surgery.    
	It is for sure that he is over 100 years old. But whether he is 130 years old or not, I am not sure, said Dr N.P. Gupta, head of the department of urology at AIIMS.    
	Even if Ramanand is over 100, he has created a record of sorts as it would make him the first centurion to have been operated upon.    
	He added that medical science cannot pinpoint the age of a person if he or she has crossed 60.     
	The sadhu tried to convince the doctors about his age by talking about Mahatma Gandhi and lots about the history of India.     
	Court buries Cong bid    
	The Congresss plan to paint housing schemes for the poor in party colours has been shown the red flag by the high court.    
	The court issued an interim injunction against the Andhra Pradesh government order making it mandatory to put up a small statue of Indira Gandhi and hoist Congress flags in each house built under the Indiramma scheme.    
	Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy gave the order after admitting a petition filed by P. Shivashankar Reddy, a resident of Timmapur in Kurnool district.    
	The Andhra housing corporation, which had issued the order, argued there was no harm in installing Indira Gandhis statue as she is a peoples leader and a former Prime Minister.    
	The judge refuted the contention, asking: Then why shouldnt NTRs statue be put up?        
	Gore sermon    
	Al Gore was in India last week to share an inconvenient truth.    
	The former US vice-president, who received last years Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change, is on a mission to turn debates on global warming into action to curb the worldwide threat.    
	Gore addressed a gathering on what India needs to do to tackle the challenges thrown by climate change.     
	The main purpose behind Gores visit was to increase awareness about Indias challenges in the field and upgrade the campaign in India, where it is just a topic of debate, an official organising Gores programme said.     
	An Inconvenient Truth, Gores documentary on global warming, had won an Oscar.    
	Chennai: The Madras Players will present Song of the Loom, a play on the plight of weavers written by craft activist Sabita Radhakrishnan. The Song will be playing at the Sivagami Pethachi Auditorium on Luz Church Road in Mylapore from March 21 to March 23.

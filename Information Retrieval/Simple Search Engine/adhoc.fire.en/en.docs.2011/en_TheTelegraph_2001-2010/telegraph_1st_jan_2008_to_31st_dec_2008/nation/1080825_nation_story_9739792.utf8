	Hosur, Aug. 24 (PTI): The CPI today withdrew support to the Tamil Nadu coalition over the DMKs ties with the Congress. The move will not affect the government.        
	I am sorry to say (chief minister) M. Karunanidhi has chosen to speak in a language to show he doesnt want us. Probably, he has made up his mind. We also dont want to be part of this alliance, CPI chief A.B Bardhan said after the partys state council meeting.        
	The pullout meant a virtual end to the partys four-year ties with the DMK. State CPI chief D. Pandian echoed his senior, saying the DMK was part of the Congress alliance and we cannot be part of it. A resolution was passed saying the CPI would not have any truck with parties that had ties with the Congress and the BJP.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 10: The Archaeological Survey of India has lost two sites in Gujarat to add to its list of 33.        
	Ankotak in Vadodara has been buried under buildings, while Sejakpur in Surendranagar seems to have vanished.        
	Shivanand Rao, the ASI superintendent in Vadodara, said efforts were on to explore both sites. But he is not very optimistic about Ankotak.        
	According to Sonawani, a professor at the archaeology department of MS University, Ankotak, on the western bank of Viswamitri river, was discovered in the 1950s when a porter stumbled on some bronze figures while digging a mound.         
	From the figures, archaeologists derived that the site had been a Jain centre between the 7th and 12th centuries. It was a suburb of Vatapadrak city, as Vadodara was known then.        
	Ankotak, Sonawani says, was like our present-day Bharuch and Junagadh towns, which are built on ancient settlements.        
	But if the recent construction wave has put Ankotak out of reach, the ASI has only itself to blame for losing Sejakpur.         
	Discovered and included in the protected list in 1954, Sejakpur is a microlithic site 20km from Surendranagar.         
	The ASI had found tiny stone tools - probably used for agriculture - bearing signs of human habitation as early as 12,000 years ago.         
	The ASI slept over the find for years and, when officials recently went back, the landscape had changed beyond recognition. The ASI could not trace the spot where more ancient treasures could be buried. It happened because of some oversight, Rao admitted.        
	He, however, said the ASI was still hopeful of rediscovering Sejakpur. We just have to explore it, Rao said, adding that surveyors would soon be sent there.         
	The Union culture ministry recently declared both as lost along with 33 other sites across the country.        
	According to the ASI superintendent, inadequate staff made it tough to monitor and maintain the 202 sites in Gujarat that had been labelled protected. We have only 95 employees throughout the state to look after these sites, Rao said.         
	Y.S. Rawat, director at the Gujarat archaeology department, said many precious sites had been lost because of floods and urbanisation.

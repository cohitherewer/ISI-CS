	Cuttack, April 23: No fresh case of Hepatitis-A was reported from the SCB Medical College and Hospital here today, but the budding doctors are still apprehensive.         
	At least 29 students infected with the Hepatitis-A strain virus are undergoing treatment at the hospital. The medical college principal, P.K. Chinara, assured that investigations were on and blood samples were collected from the all the hostels were being tested.         
	Blood samples of around 100 students have been collected so far and 29 of them were found to be Hepatitis-A positive on Monday. But we have not come across a single case since then, he added.         
	The principal, however, admitted that the pace of blood sample collection had been slow over the past five days as a number of students were staying away from hostels since the outbreak.

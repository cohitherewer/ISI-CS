	Bhubaneswar, May 21: With 470 investment projects involving $125 billion in kitty, Orissa sends out positive message in terms of income and employment, stated a study conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.        
	These investments, if they materialise, are expected to generate an additional gross state domestic product of $35 billion, which alone is twice the size of Orissas GSDP in 2006, said Mahesh Vyas, the man behind the study.         
	The additional gross value add (GVA) that could be generated in 2013 from the 470 investment projects would be 2.3 times Orissas state domestic product in 2004-05 or 1.6 times its estimated SDP in 2007-08, he said.         
	The additional employment that would be generated in 2013 would be around 1.25 million, the same as the total employment in the organised sector in Orissa in 2004-05, said Vyas, who conducted a study on the Impact of current investment intentions on income and employment-the case of Orissa.         
	Pointing at the spurt in investments in the state, the study said the outstanding investments had soared from Rs 2 lakh crore in 2003-04 to Rs 22 lakh crore in 2007-08.         
	Similarly, there had been a phenomenal rise in new investments for Rs 20,000 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 1.90 lakh crore in 2007-08.

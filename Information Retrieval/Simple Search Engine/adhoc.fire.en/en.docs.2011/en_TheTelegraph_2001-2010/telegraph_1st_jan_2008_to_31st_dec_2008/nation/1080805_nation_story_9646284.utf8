	Patna, Aug. 4 (PTI): The war of words between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad continued with the Bihar chief minister today daring the railway minister to have a public debate on who was responsible for the delay in execution of railway projects in the state.        
	Most of the projects which Lalu Prasad claims to have got sanctioned for Bihar are carryovers ... And I am prepared to have a public debate with Lalu Prasad anytime, anywhere, Nitish told reporters on the sidelines of his janata durbar.        
	Nitish dared Lalu Prasad to have a public debate on the entire gamut of allegations levelled by him, including that during the formers tenure the railways ran on huge losses and that the state government was delaying acquisition of land for its various projects.        
	The chief minister said except for the proposed Madhepura electric locomotive factory and few other schemes, all other projects were carry-overs from the past NDA regime at the Centre.        
	Referring to Madhepura engine complex, the foundation stone of which was recently laid by Lalu Prasad, Nitish said the route was yet to be converted into broad gauge and electrified.        
	Nitish asked Lalu Prasad to clarify as to why the old projects were not being executed and said the voters would seek a reply from him during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. I stand by my statement that Lalu Prasad is the reincarnation of Goebbels  the propaganda chief of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler who had masterminded the art of turning a lie into truth by stating a lie 100 times, Nitish added.

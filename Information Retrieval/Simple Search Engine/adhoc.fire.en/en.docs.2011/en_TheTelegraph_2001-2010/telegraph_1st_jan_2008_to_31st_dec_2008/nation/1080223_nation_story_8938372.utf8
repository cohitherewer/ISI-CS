                                                                                                               Good news for FM radio 
          MANDIRA NAYAR                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Celebrity gossip could soon make way for regulated news on the airwaves, if the government accepts a recommendation.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has suggested that private FM channels be allowed to broadcast news.         
	Trai  in its recommendations to the ministry of information and broadcasting  has said the restriction on news broadcast on private FM channels is a barrier to further growth.         
	The telecom watchdog said the move would benefit a large section of the population, especially people without access to the Internet and television. FM channels can conveniently meet their information requirements.        
	However, the watchdog has added that private FM stations should initially be allowed to source content only from Doordarshan, All India Radio and authorised news agencies, limiting them to quoting official sources.         
	The channels believe that being able to air any news at all would be good news.         
	We are a news-crazy nation, said Nitin, a radio jockey from Red FM. Look at all the TV channels, there is always breaking news. Not being able to broadcast news is a big handicap, so allowing us to have any news will be great.         
	Another Trai recommendation has come as music to FM broadcasters ears. It has asked the ministry to reconsider a ban on owning more than one station in a city.         
	This will probably give listeners more variety, Nisha Narayanan, the project head of 93.5 S FM, said. It will give companies the chance to experiment more. Right now, most channels in Delhi are playing hardcore Hindi hits. But this recommendation will allow more niche channels to enter the market.         
	Trai has also suggested that more frequencies be opened up  a long-standing demand by FM broadcasters, especially in big cities. It means more music for listeners and, hopefully, news.         
	Networking of FM radio programmes across entities might be allowed if the telecom authoritys suggestion gets the I amp;B ministrys nod.         
	Giving people in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir options other than AIR, Trai has recommended that the annual fee for FM broadcasters in these areas be reduced to 50 per cent of what is being charged from existing permission holders in other places. The relief will be in place for three years.        
	It has also suggested that the foreign investment cap on FM radio be raised to 26 per cent for those who want to broadcast news and 49 per cent for those playing only music.

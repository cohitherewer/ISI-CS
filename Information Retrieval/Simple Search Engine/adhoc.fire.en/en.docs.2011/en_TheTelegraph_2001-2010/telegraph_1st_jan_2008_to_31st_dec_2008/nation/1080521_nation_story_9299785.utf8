	Islamabad, May 20: India and Pakistan today finalised a consular access treaty and discussed ways to increase trade and cross-border travel as officials met to review the peace process between the neighbours ahead of tomorrows foreign ministry-level talks.        
	Both sides lauded the progress made in narrowing down differences on contentious issues like the Siachen glacier and the Sir Creek estuary during the talks between the two foreign secretaries that also discussed terrorism and infiltration.        
	We are very close to several agreements. We may not sign many but some will be brought to the stage where they can be signed, PTI quoted foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon as saying after discussions with Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir.        
	Tomorrow, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will meet Shah Mehmood Qureshi in his first visit to Pakistan since a new government came to power in the neighbouring country.         
	Mukherjee today met former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari.        
	Several proposals in the political, economic and regional fields are on the anvil for consideration and implementation. We approach the next round (of talks) in a spirit of co-operation, trust and pragmatism Mukherjees arrival statement said.        
	Sources said the consular access agreement would give Indians arrested in Pakistan and Pakistanis arrested in India consular access within a stipulated time frame so that they can avoid remaining in jail on mistaken identity.        
	The agreement is ready and its a matter of timing  whether it will be signed tomorrow itself or not, said a source.        
	About 700 Indians are said to be behind bars in Pakistan while about 200 Pakistanis are probably locked up in Indian jails.        
	Pakistan said it was releasing 99 Indian prisoners, most of them fishermen. India said it had no Pakistani fisherman in its custody.        
	Asked if India had raised the issue of Sarabjit Singh, on death row for his alleged role in bombings in Lahore, Menon said the two sides discussed matters related to all prisoners that needed to be dealt with from a humanitarian angle.        
	Both sides talked about enhancing people-to-people contact by making travel easier and increasing the frequency of cross-border bus services. In the sphere of trade, Pakistan expressed its willingness to export more cement to India.         
	Menon said both terrorism and infiltration came up during the talks. There are dangerous people out here who mean us harm, and they are dangerous to all civilised societies, he said, adding that both sides would strengthen their cooperation in fighting the menace.        
	He said the neighbours had made considerable progress on Sir Creek as well as on Siachen, which he hoped would be converted into a mountain of peace.

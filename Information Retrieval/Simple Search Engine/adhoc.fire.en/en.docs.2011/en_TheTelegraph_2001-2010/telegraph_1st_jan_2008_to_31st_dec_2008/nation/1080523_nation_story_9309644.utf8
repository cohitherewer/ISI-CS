The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM goes out of his way for late Amar 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     PM goes out of his way for late Amar 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, May 22: A 45-minute delay cost Amar Singh his seat at the Prime Ministers dinner table but Manmohan Singh walked the extra mile  actually about 20 steps  to engage his guest for a quarter of an hour.        
	The UPAs fourth anniversary celebrations were all about tables and places, who sat next to whom.        
	Amars guest card had been placed between Shivraj Patils and Sitaram Yechurys at the Prime Ministers table, along with those of Sharad Pawar and Santosh Mohan Dev.        
	Once Singh and Sonia Gandhi were done with their speeches and had released their annual Report to the People, dinner was announced.        
	The guests from parties supporting the government from outside had begun arriving. It has been an unstated norm that only UPA constituents attend the prelude to the celebrations, ostensibly to spare the Left and the others the embarrassment of lauding a government they had lambasted through the year.        
	Prakash and Brinda Karat were ushered to the high table with Sonia at the head.        
	The other privileged occupants were Lalu Prasad, A.K. Antony, T.R. Baalu and S. Ramadoss. Arjun Singh, whose relations with Sonia have been rather volatile lately, was also given a seat.        
	Soup was served. But away from the tables of Sonia and Singh, the Congresss strategists looked anxiously at each other as they stirred their bowls and wondered whatever happened to Amar.        
	The Samajwadi general secretary, virtually shown the door at Sonias dinner for the UPA four years ago, had suddenly become the most sought-after guest of the evening. One Congress leader beseeched a TV reporter to track Amars whereabouts.        
	But neither have the CPI leaders come, declared a minister, as if to say there was still hope. Minutes later, A.B. Bardhan and D. Raja arrived.        
	Bardhan was taken to Sonias table and Raja to the Prime Ministers. When it was time for dessert to be served, Amars place mat was gently removed and Karan Singh took his seat.        
	Journalists prone to pronouncing snap judgements concluded Sonia had got her comeuppance for snubbing Amar in May 2004.        
	Nobody had factored in the rain and the havoc it was wreaking on Delhis streets. Amid the downpour, Amar arrived discreetly with another Samajwadi leader, Ram Gopal Yadav, and took his place on a free-seating table with fellow Uttar Pradesh leaders Ajit Singh and Mehmood Madani.        
	 Amar gingerly walked up to Sonias table, hoping to catch her eye. He did and was met with a tentative smile that said nothing. Only Bardhan shook hands with him. He returned to dig into a plate of food.        
	Three tables away, somebody alerted the Prime Minister. He walked up to the table and took a seat right next to Amar. The Samajwadi leader, looking unsettled till then, relaxed and beamed.        
	It is a reinforcement of the rapport between me and the Prime Minister. Morning shows the ray of light, let us catch the ray, Amar said.        
	The Prime Minister said this was a moment of mutual respect between him and Amar.        
	But unless Sonia responded what good was the bonhomie? Shahid Siddiqui, the Samajwadis Rajya Sabha MP, decided it was time to crack the Congress president.        
	He walked up to her with an invite to his sons wedding on Saturday, reminding her he had close personal relations with Rajiv Gandhi.        
	But you have political relations also, Sonia replied.        
	To Siddiquis answer that on such occasions he always remembered the personal more, the Congress president smiled and said: To me political relations also matter.        
	Amar needs more rays of hope.

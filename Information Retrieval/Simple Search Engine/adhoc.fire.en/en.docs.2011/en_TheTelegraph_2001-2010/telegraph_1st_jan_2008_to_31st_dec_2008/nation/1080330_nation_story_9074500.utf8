          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 29: Motorbike-borne Raj Thackeray supporters vandalised five taxis belonging to north Indians in Mumbai last night and were arrested by police.        
	Around 2am, a gang of four motorcycle riders stopped three taxis in Worli and asked the drivers where they were from. After learning they were north Indians, the four started abusing them and broke the windowpanes of their taxis, a police spokesman said.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers then rode to Lower Parel and allegedly damaged two more taxis. Police patrols have been alerted across the city.        
	The gang was spotted by a police team that patrols the city at night to guard against car theft. When the gang was challenged, the riders tried to flee on their bikes but were caught by another patrol at Worli Naka, the police spokesperson said.        
	The four accused will be produced in court on Monday. Pravin Pawaskar, 28, is a taxi driver while Ashish Parab, 27, and Sameer More, 25, drive private vehicles. Nilesh Shelar, 24, is a courier.        
	MNS leaders played down the incident. There is no anti-north Indian angle to this. Pawaskar had a quarrel with some fellow taxi drivers while parking his cab. They abused him, so he called the others and there was a confrontation. Please do not politicise it, party spokesperson Shirish Parkar said. He accepted that the accused were MNS workers.

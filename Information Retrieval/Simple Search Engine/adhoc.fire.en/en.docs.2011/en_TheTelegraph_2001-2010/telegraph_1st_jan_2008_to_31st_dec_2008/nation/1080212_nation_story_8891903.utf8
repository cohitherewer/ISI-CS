The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat links US ties to election mandate
                                                                                                               Karat links US ties to election mandate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: CPM chief Prakash Karat has told the Congress to take a mandate in the next polls if the party wanted the country to forge a strategic alliance with the US.        
	Karats comments come close on the heels of a now-or-never appeal from US officials to salvage the nuclear deal.        
	Addressing a party conference in Kerala, Karat said: We have made it clear that no government supported by our party and the Left would allow the government to forge such an alliance with the United States. We would like to tell the Congress that if it likes to have a strategic alliance with the US, take these issues to the people in the next Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Left will not allow the UPA to cement and forge a tie-up with the US, including the nuclear agreement, he added.        
	Two days ago, US officials had launched a concerted effort to get India to pursue the deal without further delay, reminding India that we dont have all the time in the world.        
	Karat also slammed the UPA governments economic policies and an Isro move to launch a spy satellite for Israel.        
	The CPM leader hinted that the Church still harboured anti-Communist feelings, adding that the party can thrash out the difference with the clergy through discussions.         
	Mulford meeting        
	US ambassador David Mulford today met foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, apparently to know the progress of the civilian nuclear deal.         
	Mulford was with Menon for about an hour during which the two were understood to have reviewed the progress on operationalising the deal.        
	The meeting came ahead of talks between India and atomic watchdog IAEA expected later this week.

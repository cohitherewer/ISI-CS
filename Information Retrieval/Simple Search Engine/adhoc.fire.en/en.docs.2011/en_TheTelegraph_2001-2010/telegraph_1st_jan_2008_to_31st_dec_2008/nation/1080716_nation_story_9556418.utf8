  - Pat on Advani for ending fight with Karat        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amar Singh shows off at a news conference in Delhi a signed copy of Advanis autobiography that the BJP leader had gifted him. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, July 15: Amar Singh today launched a veiled attack on the Left as he shrugged off the label of dalal that BJP leader L.K. Advani had pinned on the Samajwadis.        
	I congratulate you (Advani) for at last the fight between Red and Saffron is over, he said, stopping just short of branding the Left communal.        
	Advani had accused the Congress of changing its lal salaam to dalal salaam  a reference to the party teaming up with the Samajwadi Party instead of the Left.        
	Till May 21, I was not a dalal (broker) but now lal-bhagwa-hathi (red-saffron-elephant) want to halaal (butcher) me, Amar told a news conference today.         
	The Left, the BJP and Mayavatis BSP  whose election symbol is the elephant  will vote together against the UPA government in the July 22 trust vote.         
	Showing off a signed copy of Advanis autobiography My Country My Life that the BJP leader had gifted him, Amar said the party had never hesitated to do business with dalals when it suited them.        
	Not only had the BJP leader invited him to his books release and gifted him a copy, the Samajwadi general secretary said, Advani had also acknowledged in the autobiography that he met Mulayam Singh Yadav to propose an alliance against Sonia Gandhi. The proposal was rejected by the Samajwadi chief, Amar underlined.        
	The (Narendra) Modi-Mayavati-Advani troika is more dangerous than George W. Bush, he said, sending a message to the Left without naming it. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had approached Mayavati for support in the confidence vote.        
	Shedding caution on clubbing his former allies with the BJP, Amar suggested that the Left had compromised on its own single-minded opposition to the BJP since the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition.         
	By teaming up with Mayavati to vote out the government, Karat was in effect toeing the BJPs line, Amar said.         
	He congratulated Advani several times for his remarks and thanked him profusely for attacking the Samajwadis.         
	I sympathise with Advani because his dream of becoming PM is not being fulfilled. But he is an elder, he is respected and welcome to abuse me. I am highly obliged, he said.

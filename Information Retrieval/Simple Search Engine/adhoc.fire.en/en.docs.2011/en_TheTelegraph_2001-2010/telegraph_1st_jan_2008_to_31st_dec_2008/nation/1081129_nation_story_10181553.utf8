	Mumbai, Nov. 28: After a 27-hour operation involving a scan of some 900 rooms, the National Security Guard freed the Oberoi-Trident from terrorists this morning, rescuing the last 128 hostages.        
	Both the Trident and the Oberoi are under our control and both the terrorists present at these hotels have been killed, NSG director-general J.K. Dutt announced in the afternoon.         
	However, the discovery of 24 bodies today, added to the six found yesterday, meant the terrorists had killed 30 of the over 200 people they had taken hostage.        
	They were ruthless. When they thought a hostage did not serve their purpose or moved too slowly, they killed them, a police source said quoting freed hotel guests and employees.                    
	At least 180 hostages have been rescued since the NSG arrived around 7 yesterday morning  35 yesterday afternoon, 128 at the end of operations today, and the rest in dribs and drabs.        
	 The freed hostages told us the terrorists had called their rooms pretending to be security personnel and asked them to converge in the lobby. Many didnt, but some might have. The other hostages were picked up mostly from the restaurants, the police source said.        
	The operation took so long because the Oberoi-Trident is made up of two buildings. The Trident has 541 rooms, spread across 35 floors. It is connected to the Oberoi, which has 22 floors and 331 rooms.         
	The security personnel entered through the Trident yesterday, and went from floor to floor sanitising the building and evacuating people.        
	The terrorists first entered the Trident and later moved to the Oberoi with the hostages, killing some of them and warning the NSG they would kill more if the elite troops stormed the Oberoi.        
	Gunshot after gunshot, and at least five explosions, had rung out from the twin hotels through Thursday. At one point, a fire broke out on the fourth floor of the Oberoi.        
	People were constantly evacuated in small batches while ambulances carried away the bodies of the dead yesterday.        
	Around midnight, Dutt announced that two terrorists were holed up on the eighth floor of the Oberoi and that combing operations had been completed in the Trident. He said Abu Ismail, an alleged terrorist from Faridkot in Pakistans Punjab province, had been caught from the Trident.        
	The nightlong operation, nerve-wracking for the families of those trapped inside, ended around 10am today, top police sources said.        
	The announcement came nearly five hours later, at 2.45pm, when the NSG, with the help of hotel staff, had finished its room-to-room search and checked every corner of the hotel.        
	The police and government authorities have allowed us access to the hotel. We were granted permission to begin evacuating guests at 10am today, a statement from the Oberoi Group said.        
	Hotel staff accompanied by personnel from the security forces have been proceeding from room to room and escorting guests to the lobby level of the hotel. From there the guests are being led to a nearby facility where first aid and counselling is being offered. Representatives from several consulates are also present to extend assistance.        
	The statement added: After details of each guest are confirmed, our staff are taking them to other hotels in the city where arrangements have been made for their stay. This process is likely to take time as we are going room to room, one floor at a time.        
	Two AK-47 rifles, a pistol and a few unexploded grenades were found on the dead terrorists, the NSG chief said.

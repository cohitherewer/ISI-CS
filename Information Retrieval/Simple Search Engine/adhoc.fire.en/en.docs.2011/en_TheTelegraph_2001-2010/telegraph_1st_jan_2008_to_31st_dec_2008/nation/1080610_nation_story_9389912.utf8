	Axe on freedom of tree-cutters     
	Fell a tree in Mumbai and uproot your chances of staying a free man for 10 years  if a Maharashtra minister has his way.    
	Forest minister Babanrao Pachpute has proposed making the cutting of trees an offence that is equal to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.    
	llegal felling can then be punished with jail terms of up to 10 years. At present, the culprits hardy get the stick: the maximum jail term has been fixed at six months and/or a fine of Rs 500.    
	The plan is aimed at initially reducing, and eventually eliminating, the felling menace in the state, where nearly two lakh trees are wiped out illegally every year.    
	People think it is easy to escape. However, if a more stringent law is applied, we will be able to bring down the instances of felling, says Pachpute.    
	The proposal will have to sail through his cabinet colleagues first and the Assembly later for it to become law.    
	If it does go that far, Maharashtra will become the first state to introduce such legislation.        
	Bribe for death papers    
	Having demanded bribe for a death certificate, a government accountant was taught a lesson that will haunt him for life.    
	Sleuths of Lokayukta police last week trapped Venkatapathy Shetty, on duty in a Kolar district village, while he was taking Rs 3,000 from the complainant. He had already been paid Rs 2,000 but asked for more.    
	Laxmamma, who he had been fleecing, wanted the death certificate of his uncle, Venkata Reddy, issued, as well as a similar document officially testifying his family tree.    
	Laxmamma coughed up Rs 2,000 and pleaded with the official he needed the papers to secure inheritance and property rights. But Shetty refused to settle for less than Rs 5,000 to do the needful. He is now counting days in prison. (PTI)    
	End in sight to check-in woes    
	Travellers at Delhi airport, derisively called a country bus station, can expect the feel of a departure lounge instead of an overcrowded Blueline.    
	The Centre last week approved setting up new immigration counters at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, whose accidents have almost kept pace with flight schedules.    
	The number of counters will almost be doubled, from 56 to 100, in an effort to reduce congestion. The decision, taken by a panel that cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar is heading, is part of the efforts to improve facilities at one of the countrys busiest airports.    
	Another key outcome of the panels discussions was the resolve to increase the CISFs strength.     
	The twin moves follow Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalias earlier meeting with officials of DIAL  which is revamping the hub  where he criticised the chaos at the airport.    
	Ahluwalias strong words, coming after a business leaders comparison to a bus station, had sparked an angry exchange between him and civil aviation minister Praful Patel. (PTI)        
	Fee fracas    
	A government panel has recommended doubling the fee under the management quota in Tamil Nadus self-financed engineering courses, drawing angry reactions from students and accusations of favouring private owners.    
	The fee should go up to Rs 62,500 from this academic year, the panel, headed by Justice N.V. Balasubramanian, said.    
	The PMK, an ally of the ruling DMK, has lined up protests against the increase, saying it will put such courses out of the reach of students of underprivileged families.

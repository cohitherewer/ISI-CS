                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal police out of rebel hub
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 27: The Bengal government today withdrew police camps in West Midnapores Lalgarh, Belpahari and Salboni even as tribals scaled up their protests and dug up the road branching from National Highway 6 and going to Jhargram, cutting off the town from the rest of the state.        
	The protesters removed tree trunks on the road from Ramgarh to Lalgarh just enough for the police trucks to pass and resumed the blockade as soon as the vehicles sped away.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had been demanding the withdrawal of the police camp and police outpost from Ramgarh. But it was not happy today. Our main demand has not been met. The district superintendent of police is yet to apologise to the villagers (for the police action after the mine blast targeting the chief minister), said committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato.        
	The outfit had earlier decided to boycott the police and the civil administration.        
	We tried to persuade them against cutting off Jhargram, but they did not listen, subdivisional officer Tanmoy Chakraborty said.        
	Most of the 700-odd policemen posted in the area moved out by tonight. We did not want to go into any confrontation, said West Midnapore police chief R.K. Singh.        
	The non-tribal residents of Lalgarh expressed resentment. The Ramgarh outpost was there for 15 years. We went there to reports heists and other crimes. Now, we will have to travel 10km to Lalgarh to lodge a complaint, said Debiprasad Banerjee, 55.        
	Assembly ruckus         
	Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya was bodily lifted from the Assembly and taken out by its marshal when he went on disrupting proceedings by squatting in the well and shouting slogans against the Speaker.        
	He was angry for not being allowed to table a motion on Lalgarh after adjourning the House.         
	Bhuniya has been suspended for the rest of the session.        
	Congress MLAs tried to resist the marshal from lifting their leader and a scuffle ensued.

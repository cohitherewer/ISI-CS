          OUR BUREAU                           Koda on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Ranchi, Aug. 18: Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda has been told to prove his majority in the Assembly by August 25 following the withdrawal of support by Shibu Sorens JMM.        
	The date for the trial of strength was set by governor Syed Sibtey Razi after Koda told Raj Bhavan that he had the numbers to win a vote of confidence.        
	You are requested to prove majority in the Assembly on or before August 25, said a Raj Bhavan communique addressed to the chief minister.        
	Razi had met delegations of the BJP and Babulal Marandis Jharkhand Vikas Morcha which asked him to dismiss the government and impose Presidents rule.        
	 We will prove our majority on the floor of the House, a confident Koda told reporters later, perhaps banking on an assessment that Soren, who wants to be chief minister in return for bailing out the UPA government at the Centre, still has not managed the majority milestone of 42 legislators.        
	In Jharkhand, the Congress is backing a government headed by the Independent Koda. If the Congress and the RJD support Soren, the JMM could get 33 votes. The Congress has put on Soren the onus of getting the support of nine Independents, which would help the JMM hit the target.         
	Soren today betrayed a sense of frustration at not being able to convince the nine Independents, whose support was crucial for him to become chief minister, to join him.         
	Dont you think its a big joke that I have 17 MLAs and these Independents (ministers) start to boss me around They are not even sure whether they will return to the Assembly again or not. I know what these ministers did in the last 23 months. Sab hisab dena hoga (Everything they did will have to be accounted for), he told The Telegraph.        
	Ise kehte hain maal nawab ka, aur mirza khele Holi (This is like the princes making merry with the kings wealth), added Guruji, who spent most of his day at his Ranchi residence meeting party MLAs.        
	Later, the JMM chief went over to the party office and planted saplings.         
	In Delhi, Congress sources said if Soren failed to become chief minister, he would be inducted into the Union ministry.        
	Chief minister Koda refused to answer questions on how he proposed to make up for the loss of the JMMs 17 MLAs. Why should I be discussing that with you now. This show will be enacted in the Assembly. But, I will definitely win, said Koda, often referred to as the king of coup after the way he outsmarted Arjun Munda to become chief minister in September 2006.

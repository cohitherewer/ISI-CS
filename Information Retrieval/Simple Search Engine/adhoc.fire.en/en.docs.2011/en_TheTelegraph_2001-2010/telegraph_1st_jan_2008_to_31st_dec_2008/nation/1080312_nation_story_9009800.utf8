The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM gets lash for Kannur killings
                                                                                                               CPM gets lash for Kannur killings
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 11: Kerala High Court has said the only solution to serial political killings in Kannur, a CPM fortress, is timely deployment of central forces.         
	Hearing a petition on the cold-blooded murder of Mohammed Faizal, who left the CPM and joined the National Development Front in Kannur, Justice V. Ram Kumar asked if the entire police force had become puppets in the hands of politicians and referred the case to the CBI.         
	According to the prosecution, 29-year-old Faizal, a newspaper boy, was killed on October 22, 2006, by CPM men.         
	With the Kannur killings  seven have died in clashes between the CPM and the BJP since last week  in the background, the judge wanted the governor to inform the Centre of the need for a permanent mechanism to check violence in the district where manslaughter is a competing sport.         
	If reports are to be believed, Kannur district, particularly Thalassery taluk, has over the years been the hotbed of political violence. Blessed are those who die a natural death in Thalassery, he said.         
	Thalassery is the home ministers constituency.        
	CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the judge was biased. The government will appeal against his verdict.

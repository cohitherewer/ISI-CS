The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hunt for private partners for schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hunt for private partners for schools
  - Centre calls meeting to sell plan to hesitant industry           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, July 28: The Centres first ever attempt to involve industry in building model schools across the country has failed to attract private companies who have complained of a lack of clarity in the structure of the partnership with the government.         
	The ministry of human resource development has now called an emergency brainstorming meeting with industry bodies like Ficci and CII tomorrow to convince them to join the initiative to build schools, top government officials have revealed.         
	In 2007, the Centre announced plans to build 2,500 model schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode during the Eleventh Five Year Plan. Industry bodies and individual companies have expressed a desire to join hands with the government in the education sector on several occasions, but this was the first time the Centre agreed to building schools under the PPP mode.         
	But the project is yet to take off amid complaints from the private sector that the ministrys strategy is too vague.         
	Our problem is that the plans for schools in the PPP mode are too vague at the moment, a senior CII official engaged in the project said.         
	The ministry has now called a meeting with the industry bodies tomorrow, where it hopes to clarify their doubts and understand their concerns, a ministry source said.         
	The PPP mode schools are to be modelled on Kendriya Vidyalayas, and must have a classroom strength between 30 and 40. But the student to teacher ratio must not exceed 25: 1 in these schools under the framework drafted by the ministry, sources said.         
	But the government is yet to decide who will own the schools, and how their fee structure is to be set, ministry sources said.         
	Under the PPP mode arrangement declared in the Five Year Plan, the government provides the land, but the building cost is borne by the private company.         
	Their fundamental reservation, which we believe is behind most of their concerns, is a fear that the government will be unable to provide conducive conditions for them to invest in the PPP schools project. That needs to be countered, a senior school education official at the ministry said.         
	One possible model proposed by the ministry could have the private company owning the school for a few years and then transferring it to the government, sources said. But the fees throughout the life of the school, irrespective of who owns it, will be set by the government, which is not acceptable to the private companies, a ministry source explained.         
	The fees charged by a PPP model school will be higher than the amount charged by an ordinary government school, but lower than a private school, the source said.         
	An alternative  under which the government owns the school for a few years before handing it over to the private company  may not be acceptable to the industry bodies, the source said.         
	The industry argues that the government cannot palm off an effectively second hand school to it, the source said.         
	Under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the Centre has drawn out plans to build 6000 model schools in all, one in the roughly equal number of blocks spread across India.

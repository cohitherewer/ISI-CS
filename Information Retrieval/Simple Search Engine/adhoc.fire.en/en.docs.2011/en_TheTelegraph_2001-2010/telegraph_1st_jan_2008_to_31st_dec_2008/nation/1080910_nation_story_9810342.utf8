  - Unprecedented haul of antique artefacts          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The ivory artefacts seized in Cuttack on Tuesday. Picture by Badrika Nath Das                                        
	Cuttack, Sept. 9: In an unprecedented haul, police claim to have seized antique ivory artefacts, which can fetch crores in the international market.        
	The ivory works of art have motifs similar to erotic sculptures in the 13th century Konark temple. The major haul includes 53 ivory artefacts weighing nearly 20kg. All of them are intricately carved.         
	The rich quality of ivory and the exquisite nature of carvings on them are most striking. They seem to be antique pieces, said deputy commissioner of police A.K. Sinha.        
	It wouldnt be surprising if the current value of the artefacts goes up to Rs 10 crore in the international market, he added. Plainclothes policemen stumbled upon the rare contraband stuff in a bag taking into custody two persons yesterday from the College Square area whose movements were suspicious. The duo were identified as Krushna Kumar Nayak (35) of Kendrapada and Pramod Kumar Mohanty (37) of Jagatpur. They are still under interrogation. But police officers are tight-lipped on the findings of the investigation made so far.        
	Sinha refused to divulge details at this stage but gave strong indications that the antique pieces were possibly of local origin. We are working towards tracing the source of the ivory stuff vis--vis the destination, he said. Besides, we are trying to work out their date with the help of experts, he added.        
	The police suspect an underground network involved in illegal trade in ivory artefacts with its hub in south India was behind the attempt to smuggle out the priceless antiques with the help of local conduits.        
	Meanwhile, the police are working on the modalities of initiating cases with the forest department officials. The nature of case attracts 49-B of the Forest Protection Act, 1972. All trade in the parts of wild animals, including ivory, is illegal under the act. Besides, trade in ivory products was internationally banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna in 1989.

	Beijing, April 14 (PTI): President Pervez Musharraf has said Pakistan was taking a bilateral approach on Kashmir, echoing Indias stand.        
	In his first public comments on Kashmir after the government led by Yousaf Raza Gilani assumed office, Musharraf stressed on resolving the festering issue bilaterally, a departure from Pakistans traditional stance for third-party mediation.        
	The dispute with Kashmir, as far as Pakistan is concerned... may I say very proudly that we are going on a bilateral approach with India, Musharraf, who is on a six-day visit to close ally China, said at Tsinghua University in Beijing.        
	We hope that good sense prevails on both sides to resolve this long-standing dispute amicably... for the economic benefit of people of these two countries, the President said.        
	Pakistan has been insisting on third-party mediation, even suggesting Chinas involvement, in Kashmir, a demand rejected by India.        
	Asif Ali Zardari, the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, which leads the ruling coalition, had recently said the ties between the two countries should not be held hostage to Kashmir. It should be left for future generations, he had said.        
	Pakistans new foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had also said his government would not shy away from taking a different approach on Kashmir.        
	The old disputes have festered. I call old disputes. The Palestinian dispute the Kashmir dispute, Musharraf said, speaking of the 9/11 attacks in the US that had completely changed the world.        
	Kashmir cropped up later, too, but this time as freedom struggle  a term India cannot digest when associated with the Valley. The Kashmir struggle started in 1989. The freedom struggle in Kashmir Musharraf said.

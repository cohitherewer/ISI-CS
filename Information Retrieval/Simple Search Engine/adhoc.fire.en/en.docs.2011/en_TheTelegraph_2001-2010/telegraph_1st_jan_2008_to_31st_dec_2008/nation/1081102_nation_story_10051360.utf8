The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Now, Soren wants to tinker with R amp;R
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Now, Soren wants to tinker with R amp;R
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                          Shibu Soren: Saviour?                                  
	Ranchi, Nov. 1: Chief minister Shibu Soren has asked for further changes in the states resettlement and rehabilitation policy sending conflicting signals to industry which feels it is already weighed heavily against investors looking to set up mega steel and power projects in Jharkhand.        
	At the cabinet meeting yesterday, the chief minister approved coal mining leases to Tenughat Empta Coal Mines Limited  232 hectares  and GBK Power  604 hectares  in Hazaribagh district. At the same time, he instructed deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, who headed the committee that framed the R amp;R policy, to introduce necessary amendments to make it more people friendly. The R amp;R policy, announced in July after a cabinet nod during former chief minister Madhu Kodas tenure, proposes compensatory jobs, a provision to invest up to 50 per cent of the compensation in the companys shares and debentures, housing facilities  for unauthorised occupants too  community development programmes, training centres et al.        
	While several companies have promised to abide by it, the general criticism from industry has been that it was too strongly worded against them. The policy is yet to be tabled in the Assembly.        
	At yesterdays meeting, the chief minister asked both Tenughat Empta and GBK Power to follow the R amp;R policy in toto but also added that it needed changes.         
	Our R amp;R policy is functional, but a few more clauses are likely to be added to make it more people friendly. Yesterday the chief minister asked Stephen Marandi to hold a meeting with ministers and UPA partners to discuss ways to make it more attractive, said Sudhir Mahto, another deputy chief minister, who heads industry and forest and environment. This will be done soon after Chhath festival, he added.        
	The announcement is unlikely to be welcomed by industry which has become extremely critical of the states handling of recent attacks on representatives and premises of industrial houses that have begun looking for land for their projects.         
	On October 23, a mob attacked and burnt down a large part of the 50-acre premises of Bokaro Jaypee Cement Ltd Associates that is setting up a cement plant with the potential of creating over 5,000 new jobs. In September, representatives of Bhushan Steel were assaulted by villagers in Potka block while they were surveying land for their 3MT steel plant project worth Rs 10,500 crore. This was followed by attacks on representatives of Jupiter Cement and later Kohinoor Steel in October.         
	The attacks have led to an atmosphere of distrust in Jharkhand vis--vis industry with several organisations gearing up for agitations to protect ancestral property which they fear would be usurped for industry.         
	An association of 52 organisations will be holding a rally at Charhi block of Hazaribagh district tomorrow to create mass consciousness against land acquisitions. We are not opposed to industry, but we will never give them a single inch of our land. Land donors, mainly poor tribals, have always got a raw deal, Xavier Dias of Jharkhand Mines and Mineral Area Co-ordination Committee, said.        
	Social activist Dayamani Barla, whose Adivasi Moolvasi Astitva Raksha Manch was leading a campaign against ArcelorMittals proposed 12MT steel plant worth Rs 40,000 crore, questioned the real status of the R amp;R policy.         
	She claimed no one was aware of its provisions and that the masses had rejected it. A cabinet decision by the state government cannot be treated as law of the land. And we are not going to sit idle, Barla said.        
	Sudhir Mahto, however, expressed confidence that the misgivings would be addressed by Soren himself as he was planning a campaign to apprise people of the benefits of the R amp;R policy.         
	My only suggestion to industrialists is that they should not proceed with land acquisition work on their own. They should either approach us or seek the help of concerned village committees. It is true that land donors had been given a raw deal in the past, but nothing like that was going to happen now as everything would be done under the chief ministers supervision.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, July 10: St. Stephens College has decided to legally challenge a Delhi University ordinance that gives the varsity vice-chancellor a say in the selection of college principals.         
	The college will challenge the 15-year-old ordinance before Delhi High Court in a bid to thwart any interference from the varsity in the selection of its principal, St. Stephens officials said yesterday.         
	The officials said the decision was taken in response to allegations by a former faculty member that the college was violating university norms on the selection of principals.         
	Ordinance XVII, clause 7(2), of DU states that principals of its constituent colleges must be selected through a process overseen by the vice-chancellor.         
	Although the college governing body shortlists candidates for the post, the final choice is made by a selection committee, including the vice-chancellor, provisional vice-chancellor and two members of the varsity executive council.         
	The selection committee includes a nominee of the college governing body, but St. Stephens officials argue that the college has too little representation in the selection of its own principal.         
	The college will argue that it should be granted exemption from the ordinance as it is a minority institution.         
	M.S. Frank, an appointee of the St. Stephens Supreme Council  the institutions apex decision-making body  is handling the administration of the college after previous head Valson Thampu quit amid a cloud of controversy.         
	Thampu did not possess a PhD at the time of his appointment as administrative head, a requirement for all principals of central university colleges under the guidelines of the University Grants Commission.         
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions, Indias top arbiter over matters pertaining to minority education, held Thampus appointment guilty, leaving him with little option but to resign.

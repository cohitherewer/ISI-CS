	Anand, Dec. 31 (AP): Every night in this quiet western city, 15 pregnant women prepare for sleep in the spacious house they share, ascending the stairs in a procession of ballooned bellies to bedrooms that become a landscape of soft hills.
    
	A team of maids, cooks and doctors looks after the women, whose pregnancies would be unusual anywhere else but are common here.
    
	The young mothers of Anand, Gujarat, a place famous for its milk, are pregnant with the children of infertile couples from around the world.
    
	The small clinic at Kaival Hospital matches infertile couples with local women, cares for them during pregnancy and delivery, and counsels them afterwards. Anands surrogate mothers, pioneers in the growing field of outsourced pregnancies, have given birth to around 40 babies.
    
	More than 50 women in this city are now pregnant with the children of couples from the US, Taiwan, Britain and beyond. The women earn more than many would make in 15 years. But the programme raises a host of uncomfortable questions that touch on morals and modern science, and the most natural of desires  to have a family.
    
	There is this one woman who desperately needs a baby and cannot have her own child without the help of a surrogate. And at the other end there is this woman who badly wants to help her (own) family, said Dr Nayna Patel, the woman behind Anands baby boom. If this female wants to help the other one... why not allow that? Theyre helping one another to have a new life in this world.
    
	Experts say commercial surrogacy  or what has been called wombs for rent  is growing in India. While no reliable numbers track such pregnancies nationwide, doctors work with surrogates in virtually every major city. The women are impregnated in-vitro with the egg and sperm of couples unable to conceive on their own.
    
	Commercial surrogacy has been legal in India since 2002, as it is in many other countries, including the US. But India is the leader in making it a viable industry rather than a rare fertility treatment. Experts say it could take off for the same reasons outsourcing in other industries has been successful: a wide labour pool working for relatively low rates.
    
	Critics say the couples are exploiting poor women in India  a country with an alarmingly high maternal death rate  by hiring them at a cut-rate cost to undergo the hardship and risks of labour. It raises the factor of baby farms in developing countries, said Dr John Lantos of the Center for Practical Bioethics in Kansas City, Missouri. It comes down to questions of voluntariness and risk.
    
	Patels surrogates are aware of the risks. Many of the mothers know one another, or are even related. Three sisters have all borne strangers children, and their sister-in-law is pregnant with a second surrogate baby. Nearly half the babies have been born to foreign couples while the rest have gone to Indians.
    
	Ritu Sodhi, a furniture importer from Los Angeles who was born in India, spent $200,000 trying to get pregnant through in-vitro fertilisation, and was considering spending another $80,000 to hire a surrogate mother in the US. We were so desperate, she said. It was emotionally and financially exhausting.
    
	Then, on the net, Sodhi found Patels clinic.
    
	After spending about $20,000,  more than many couples because it took the surrogate mother several cycles to conceive  Sodhi and her husband are now back home with their four-month-old baby, Neel. They plan to return to Anand for a second child.
    
	Even if it cost $1 million, the joy that they had delivered to me is so much more than any money that I have given them, Sodhi said. Theyre godsends to deliver something so special.
    
	Patels centre is believed to be unique in offering one-stop service. Other clinics may request that the couple bring in their own surrogate, often a family member or friend, and some place classified advertisements. But in Anand, the couple just provides the egg and sperm and the clinic does the rest, drawing from a waiting list of tested and ready surrogates.
    
	Young women are flocking to the clinic to sign up for the list. 
    
	Suman Dodia, a pregnant, baby-faced 26-year-old, said she planned to buy a house with the $4,500 she would receive from the British couple whose child shes carrying. It would have taken her 15 years to earn that on her maids monthly salary of $25.

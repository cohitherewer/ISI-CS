          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 13: The Bihar government has pulled up its socks to check cheating in Intermediate examination starting from tomorrow.        
	Human resource development minister Brishen Patel has asked Bihar School Education Board (BSEB) to arrange for video recording at all sensitive examination centres.        
	Over 5,08,000 students, 48,000 more than last year, would appear in the examination at 399 centres across the state this time.         
	The number of students from arts discipline is 2,55,135, followed by 2,21,794 from science and 31,954 from commerce.         
	Girl students number around 38 per cent.        
	The minister said students would be given answer scripts with watermarks to prevent them from using duplicate paper-sheets. Mobile phones would not be allowed inside the examination centres selected by respective district magistrates.         
	Earlier, the erstwhile Bihar Intermediate Education Council used to select centres.         
	We have given this power to district magistrates for transparency, said the minister, adding that additional 15 minutes would be provided to students to read questions before answering them.        
	 BSEB, which has been conducting Intermediate examination for the first time after Intermediate council was dissolved last year, has also decided to use multiple question sets to check unfair means.        
	HRD principal secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said scanned photographs of students would be on the attendance sheets besides admit cards to help check impersonation.

	Thimpu, May 16: Delhi and Thimpu will build a 25km railway link between Hashimara in Bengal and Phuentsholing in Bhutan.        
	It will make it easier for our economies to work together even more closely, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today. The basic work on the line has already been done, he added.        
	Menon briefed the media on the talks between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Jigme Y. Thinley, saying they could not have gone better. Both countries realise they have a shared prosperity, shared security and shared destiny.        
	About the hydroelectric power that India bought from Bhutan, Singh told Thinley that every time a light is lit in a house in rural India, we thank Bhutan for it.

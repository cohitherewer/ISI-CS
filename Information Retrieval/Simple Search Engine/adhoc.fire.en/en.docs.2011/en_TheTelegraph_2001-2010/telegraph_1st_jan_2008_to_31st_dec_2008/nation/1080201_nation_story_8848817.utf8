     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Lucknow, Jan. 31: Mayavati has suspended four senior officials for praising Rahul Gandhi.
    
	Faizabad division commissioner Venkateswarlu, whose jurisdiction extends to Sultanpur, district magistrate Sanjay Kumar, chief development officer Dev Prasad Rai and assistant information director Pramod Kumar Singh were suspended tonight. 
    
	The officials had contributed articles for a book produced by the central department of field publicity, which the state government said had glorified Rahuls contribution. Titled Sultanpur, Kal aur Aaj (Sultanpur, Past and Present), the book was released six months ago. 
    
	But Mayavati has woken up to it after the young MP shared a meal with a Dalit family and spent a night in their hut in the backward Bundelkhand region. Afraid that the Congress would eat into her vote-bank, Mayavati had lashed out at Rahul at a rally soon after.
    
	Today, the state government release said: The book has underplayed various state government schemes which also contributed to the growth of the district. It accused the officials of violating service rules by publicly praising one political partys role in development.
    
	Rahuls constituency Amethi is part of Sultanpur district. The book talks about the engineering college, power projects, hospital and roads that have come up in the three years that Rahul has been MP. 
    
	Since it was a government publication on the district, Sanjay Kumar wrote the foreword. The district magistrate said he had urged the author, Srikant Srivastava, a central government officer in charge of Sultanpurs field publicity, to write the book.
    
	Kumars phone was switched off and he could not be reached for comment. 
    
	Venkateswarlu, who had contributed an article, said he had no comment to offer. His suspension letter said: The book has exaggerated facts and put one particular political party in bright light and the commissioner was a party to it.
    
	Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh said: The act of the Mayavati government is shocking. It is the height of political vendetta. No one can refute the contribution of the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family in Sultanpur.

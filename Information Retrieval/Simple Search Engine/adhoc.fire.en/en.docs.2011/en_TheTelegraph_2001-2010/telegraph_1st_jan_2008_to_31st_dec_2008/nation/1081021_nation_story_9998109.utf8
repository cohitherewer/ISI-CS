The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tata in, whoever wins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tata in, whoever wins

	Washington, Oct. 20: In a historic US presidential election that still prompts more questions than answers, one of the few certainties is that whoever is victorious on November 4, the coming four years will see more of Ratan Tata in the White House and in the key centres of the next administration than any other Indian outside the government.        
	When Tata strode into the US state departments Benjamin Franklin Room 10 days ago for the equally historic signing of the bilateral agreement to operationalise the Indo-US nuclear deal, it was clear to everyone that the first global Indian businessman had finally arrived on the elite Washington scene.        
	Last weekend, Tata reinforced that image with a $50-million endowment to an Ivy League institution, Cornell University, his alma mater. The endowment will fund a Tata-Cornell Initiative in Agriculture and Nutrition and a Tata Scholarship Fund for students from India to study at the Ivy League institution.        
	Tata is already at the centre of the Indo-US economic architecture. He is the Indian co-chair of the bilateral CEOs Forum, which has become the primary engine for private sector engagement between India and the US. When the CEOs Forum met for the first time on July 18, 2005, its members did not call on US President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who were holding their summit in the White House. Instead, Bush and Singh dropped in on the CEOs.        
	Admittance to the exclusive club of global businessmen who rub shoulders with US Presidents comes gradually and the initiation is very low profile. They include such men as Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and British billionaire Sir Tom Hunter.         
	Like Tata, who donated $50 million to Cornell last week, Hunter was in the news when he gave 100 million to the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, which invests in development projects in Africa.         
	Tatas engagement with Americas establishment took roots under Bush and will be deeper in the next administration because he has already become Indias primary economic ambassador to the US although he holds no office in the government.        
	At one of the meetings of the Indo-US economic architecture in New York, Tata offered to clean up the residue of the Bhopal gas tragedy, which remains a sticking point in the entry of US multinationals into India, according to several people present at that meeting.        
	That offer drifted through the Bush administrations secretaries for commerce and treasury and brought him to the attention of the White House and Capitol Hill, from where the next US President will come  whether it is Barack Obama or John McCain.        
	Ironically, the offer that Tata made then was to enable Dow Chemicals to get into a massive industrial project in West Bengal. Those were the heady days when Tata was besotted with West Bengal and the Singur project was in full steam.        
	Tatas growing recognition here as a global Indian entrepreneur is, however, not entirely owed to his work on Indo-US economic relations. Some time ago, the Tatas bought one of the most coveted pieces of Manhattan real estate, the historic Pierre hotel, across the street from Central Park.        
	After a $100-million renovation, the 105-year-old, 200-room landmark will reopen as the Taj Pierre in early 2009.Similarly, two years ago, the Tatas acquired Bostons Ritz-Carlton, often described as the crown jewel of hotels in New England: it is now the Taj Boston.         
	But it was the acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover that put the seal on the emergence of the Indian brand on the global scene as seen in Washington.        
	Last week, when CNN reported that Corus was cutting steel production as a fallout of the international financial crisis, it described the company as Tata-owned Corus. That is the kind of media profile that will make Tata a name that will be often mentioned in the White House under its next tenant.

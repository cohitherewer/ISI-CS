	New Delhi, Feb. 12 (PTI): The Supreme Court has directed a high court to examine the validity of a Punjab law authorising land allotment to the displaced.        
	In 1995, the Punjab government had amended the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961, and empowered itself to legalise land allotted illegally to displaced people.        
	A panchayat from Ludhiana had filed a writ in the high court alleging the amendment was a ploy to get around a 1985 apex court order holding such allotments illegal. The high court dismissed the petition but the panchayat went on appeal.        
	The apex court said, The dismissal of the petition in such summary manner without indicating any reason is indefensible. It added that the high court hadnt addressed the central issue: whether the amendment was valid in law.        
	Todays order saying the law needs a review could become a precedent for states like Bengal, where land is being acquired for industrial projects.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mehbooba in Srinagar on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, April 8: Mehbooba Mufti today proposed an intra-Kashmir regional council with representatives from both sides of the Line of Control to resolve key issues.         
	The council could take up matters like the Wullar barrage water problem and the contentious Kishanganga hydroelectric plant, the Peoples Democratic Party president said, a day after returning from Pakistan.        
	The panel could also formulate a joint agriculture policy, she added.        
	Mufti had gone to Pakistan to attend a conference organised by Pugwash, a US-based think tank.        
	We have 20 to 25 seats in our Upper House, which can be allotted to representatives from the other Kashmir in the regional council, Mufti told reporters. It will be a kind of joint mechanism and we feel public representatives are more powerful and can solve problems.         
	The PDPs proposal is a step ahead of the Opposition National Conferences campaign for maximum autonomy.         
	Mufti said her partys proposal was in line with that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs joint mechanism seeking to integrate the two Kashmirs without undermining the sovereignty of India or Pakistan.         
	The regional council will be at the top. We have to work out modalities on how the members will be elected for it. Our MLAs elect the members of the Upper House. They (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir), too, will have to find the mechanism to elect the members of the council.         
	Mufti said the proposal for an intra-party council was part of a self-rule document, yet to be unveiled.         
	We have a roadmap which will accommodate all regions of Jammu and Kashmir. We want to have an equal power-sharing mechanism so that nobody, in Ladakh or Jammu, will feel deprived, she said.         
	The PDP is looking to cash in on the Pakistan connection with state elections due in a few months.         
	But the Congress, the PDPs coalition ally, differs on the intra-Kashmir council.         
	No external power will be allowed to interfere in our internal affairs. The solution to the Kashmir issue lies in political discourse within India, Congress minister Abdul Gani Vakil said.        
	 The PDP was planning to celebrate Muftis return from Pakistan with a grand rally, but it was postponed after her grandmothers death last week.         
	Mufti said she was given a warm welcome in Pakistan by leaders like Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif. She addressed a joint news conference with Zardari, leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party.

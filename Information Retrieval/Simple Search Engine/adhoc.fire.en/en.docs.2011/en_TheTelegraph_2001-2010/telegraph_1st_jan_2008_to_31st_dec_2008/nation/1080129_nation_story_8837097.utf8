          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Indian and US educators are in talks to double the flow of scholars from each country under the Fulbright programme.        
	The US spent $2.5 million under the programme in 2007 for 120 scholars and it has now proposed that the Indian government put in an equivalent amount for the scholarships.        
	The funds may be either from the government or from private enterprises, US ambassador David C. Mulford said today.         
	India is one of the countries that does not contribute to the Fulbright programme. There are still some issues to be sorted out, he said.         
	The US mission in India was also easing visa distribution in India, Mulford claimed. The US issues 60 per cent of its H1B visas (for software professionals) in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Water truce till May poll
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Water truce till May poll
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karunanidhi: Ally aid                                  
	April 5: The Hogenkal water project will be on hold till the May Karnataka polls, Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi announced today.        
	The statement was greeted with relief across the border, where major political parties decided not to make the controversy an election issue.        
	Karunanidhis announcement is being seen as merely a temporary respite  a friendly gesture to ally Congress so it can avoid uncomfortable questions during the Karnataka campaign. It was timed to coincide with Sonia Gandhis visit to Tamil Nadu to attend a rally in Karaikudi, which is part of finance minister P. Chidambarams constituency.        
	The controversy over the project has led to bandh calls in both states, a ban on Tamil movies in Karnataka, and parallel protests by the film industries of both states.         
	The drinking water project is on the river Cauvery  the subject of a bitter water-sharing dispute between the two states.        
	The Karnataka Rakshane Vedike called off its April 10 bandh after Karunanidhis statement.        
	Let bygones be bygones. Let the future be bright, the chief minister said. We will wait till an elected government assumes charge (in Karnataka). I hope the popular government will understand our demand and abide by the 1998 agreement to implement the scheme.        
	The stress on the 1998 agreement, however, did not go down well with former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna. He welcomed elder statesman Karunanidhis gesture but said there was an option to approach the Supreme Court on the issue.        
	Karunanidhi, too, seemed to be bracing for a standoff when he added: If the situation continues even after the polls there, we will tell the world that Tamils, even at the cost of their lives, will not be people without self-respect.        
	The Hogenkal project is not part of the Cauvery tribunals award to Tamil Nadu. A recent visit to the site by a Karnataka BJP team had brought a warning from Karunanidhi, triggering the current controversy.

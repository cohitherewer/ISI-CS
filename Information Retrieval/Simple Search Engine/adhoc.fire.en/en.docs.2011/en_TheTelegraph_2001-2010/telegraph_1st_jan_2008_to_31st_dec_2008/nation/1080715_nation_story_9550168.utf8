  - Transparency order in corruption complaint against judiciary         SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, July 14: An open court will hear a provident fund corruption case involving a Supreme Court judge and 13 serving and retired high court judges, the apex court decided today.        
	The move followed calls for transparency and several petitions that demanded a thorough probe into allegations that the judges had defrauded the Ghaziabad court treasury in a Rs 23-crore scam.        
	The bench listed the matter for July 17 after arguments in the privacy of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnans chamber.        
	Everyone was unanimous that the matter should be heard in court, solicitor general G.E. Vahanvati said minutes after the closed-door hearing this afternoon.        
	Open-court hearings mean the public can be present and the media can report the proceedings, though the court might at a later stage decide on in-chamber proceedings, where only lawyers are allowed.        
	Former law minister Shanti Bhushan said open-court hearing was important as the public got to watch the proceedings and see how a decision is taken.         
	It instils a sense of confidence in the public, the veteran lawyer added.         
	Among the petitions were a public interest litigation that sought a CBI investigation and a plea by the local bar association for a probe by a sitting or a retired judge.        
	Another petitioner, Transparency International (India), also called for a CBI probe or one by a police officer of unimpeachable integrity if the judiciary wanted to nip the growing perception that it was closing ranks and trying to brush the role of judicial officers under the carpet.        
	Ghaziabad police have already filed FIRs against 82 lower court staff for allegedly siphoning off Rs 7 crore from the provident fund of employees. But no FIR has been registered so far against the apex court judge, seven high court judges and 10 district judges.        
	Nor has an FIR been filed against six retired high court judges and two retired district judges alleged to be involved in the scam.        
	Instead, the district police had written to the Chief Justice seeking permission to go ahead with investigations against the accused judges.        
	Balakrishnan has since allowed the cops to send questionnaires to the judges outlining specific charges against them. He has also said he would permit interrogation of those judges whose answers were unsatisfactory.        
	Although rare, this isnt the first time a case involving a Supreme Court judge will be heard in a courtroom.        
	A corruption case against former Madras High Court Chief Justice V. Ramaswami, who was later elevated to the Supreme Court, was heard by the apex court, which ordered an inquiry.        
	The probe found him guilty and recommended action but a Parliament motion to impeach him fell through.        
	Ramaswami didnt resign but didnt get any work for the rest of his term.

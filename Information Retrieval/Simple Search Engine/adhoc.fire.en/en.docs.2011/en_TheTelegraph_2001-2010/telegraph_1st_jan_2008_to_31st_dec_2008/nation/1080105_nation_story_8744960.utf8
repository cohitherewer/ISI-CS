The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuke deal hope alive, says Pranab 
                                                                                                            Nuke deal hope alive, says Pranab 
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): The government has not given up on the Indo-US nuclear deal and there is no link between the Congresss recent election defeats and progress with the Left on the issue, Pranab Mukherjee said.         
	The foreign minister also dismissed the possibility of mid-term polls to the Lok Sabha in the wake of differences with the Left allies.        
	Mukherjee, a key negotiator with the Left on the deal, said time is running out for completing the processes to execute it. But one cannot help it.        
	No, I have not given up. We are working on how we can proceed, he said in reply to a question whether the government had given up on the deal because of the Left opposition.        
	He dismissed suggestions that the deal may be put on the backburner if the Left steps up pressure in the wake of the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh poll outcome, saying their position is not linked with electoral successes and reverses.        
	Asked about the possibility of snap polls, Mukherjee said: Ultimately, we will reach the day when polls will be held on time.        
	He sidestepped queries on a specific time-frame for operationalising the deal, but said he hoped negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency on a safeguards treaty would be completed by the end of this month.        
	Mukherjee said the Left leaders had no objection to the IAEA as they knew that India was a founder member of the global nuclear watchdog and had been a member of its board several times.        
	The Left leaders have also made it clear that they have no quarrel with the IAEA, he said.        
	The Left had a problem with the US and had been opposing the civil nuclear cooperation agreement as soon as an amended act was passed by US Congress last December, which was an enabling legislation to the 123 Agreement, Mukherjee said.        
	The Lefts opposition is to the US. But we are having some arrangements. We bought some reactors from Russia, we bought some materials from France and some nuclear energy programme is going on in this country.        
	Asked whether the Congress would continue cooperation with the Left after the next general election, Mukherjee said the question was hypothetical as democracy is a game of numbers.         
	India for stable Pak        
	India reacted to western concerns about nuclear weapons falling into jihadi hands by noting that President Pervez Musharraf was in command.        
	Mukherjee said he was hopeful that the people of Pakistan would be able to overcome the current crisis.        
	We wish them all success in their endeavours because we believe that a strong, stable and prosperous Pakistan will be helpful to us, he said.

  - Sanjay, Maanyata move to withdraw marriage plea        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sanjay and Maanyata soon after their wedding                                        
	Mumbai, Feb. 28: Sanjay Dutt and Maanyata have filed a request to withdraw their marriage application in Goa.        
	The couple were married according to Hindu rites in Mumbai on February 11, four days after they had moved the application before sub-registrar Chandrakant Pissurlekar in Margaos Salcette, in south Goa.        
	The withdrawal request follows an investigation into the veracity of the couples documents. The officer who admitted the application without key papers is also being probed.        
	Divorce decrees must be filed along with the application under Goas regulations if one or both partners have had a previous marriage.         
	Sanjay is believed to have only attached a rojnama (court noting) from the Bandra family court in Mumbai.         
	The divorce decree should have been attached. The rojnama doesnt carry the signature of the judge and is not attested by a gazetted officer, a law department official said. Without the order, it isnt possible to establish if divorce proceedings were complete, he added.        
	Maanyata has claimed in her residence certificate that she is unmarried but the affidavit says she is a divorcee. Law department officials confirmed having received the application for withdrawal but made it clear that they would consult their seniors before any action.        
	Sanjay sought a reduction in the six-month period for a marriage to be declared legal.         
	Either the bride or the groom must be a resident of a state for at least six months if their marriage is to be registered there. Sub-registrar Pissurlekar had relied on a certificate issued by the office of the mamlatdar (a senior official) but the latters signature was found to have been forged by a clerk. The clerk has been suspended.        
	Maanyata and Sanjay, who is on bail in an arms possession case, could face charges of polygamy, perjury, forgery and bribery of a government official if the state believes it has a case after investigations, sources said.         
	The registrars office, which suspended the marriage pending the investigations, has court powers and submitting a false affidavit to it amounts to perjury.        
	The couples troubles began two weeks ago, when Meraj-ul Shaikh, a jailed eve-teaser, moved a Mumbai family court saying he had married Maanyata in 2003 and, while the two had been living separately, neither had sought a divorce.         
	Meraj also claimed they had a son, over two years old, from the marriage and the child was staying with Maanyatas mother in Hyderabad. He has sought legal proceedings against Sanjay and Maanyata for violating Muslim laws.

	Kathmandu, April 11 (Agencies): Maoists appeared to be doing well in the Nepal elections, with early trends tonight showing the former rebels leading in at least 32 out of 40 constituencies.         
	The Nepali Congress won the first seat to be announced in the capital. But Maoists were doing well in several others and their leader Prachanda was well ahead in his constituency.        
	The Election Commission said final results would take over 10 days, with reruns called in 60 out of 20,000 centres.

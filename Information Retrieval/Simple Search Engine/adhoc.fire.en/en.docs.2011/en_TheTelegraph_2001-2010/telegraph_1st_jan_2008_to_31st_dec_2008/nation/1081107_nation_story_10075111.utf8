	Washington, Nov. 6: Bill Clinton brought jazz, Rhodes scholars, a slice of Arkansas and all-night pizza policy sessions. When George W. Bush arrived, Texans took over the town. Blue jeans were out; coats and ties and cowboy boots were in.        
	Now comes Barack Obama: young, hip and multicultural, with a Harvard law degree, a writers sensibility and a smooth left-handed jump shot  not to mention two little girls who, America learned on Tuesday night, will soon get a new puppy.         
	His historic election brings political and generational change to the nation, but it also brings something else: cultural change in Washington, and a sense that the citys social fabric is about to be ripped up and restitched.        
	At weekend soccer games, parents wonder aloud which of the citys exclusive private schools might win the presidential sweepstakes by enrolling Malia and Sasha. (The Obamas could, of course, go the Jimmy Carter route and enroll their daughters in public school.)        
	This city has had eight years of a President who goes to bed at 9pm; Laura Bush, the first lady, once said she and Bush did not come to Washington to make new friends. With the Obamas, the capitals hostesses are hoping to get back into high gear.        
	Yet the Democratic establishment here is still oriented around former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Just four years ago, Obama was a senator from Illinois. After nearly two years on the campaign trail, he remains, here in Washington, an outsider, a virtual unknown.        
	Is there anybody in Washington that really knows them? No, Esther Coopersmith, who has raised millions for the Clintons and other Democrats, said of the Obamas.         
	He went home every weekend, or he went campaigning and was never here, and she lived in Chicago, she said.        
	So Washington is left to imagine what cultural tone the Obamas will set. Will Bruce Springsteen perform at the inaugural  or maybe Yo-Yo Ma? Will Obama make frequent use of the presidential box at the Kennedy Center? Or will the Obamas, whose idea of fun is playing board games with their daughters, be the type to stay in at night, helping the kids with their homework? Will Hollywood stars take up residence in the Lincoln Bedroom, the way they did during the Clinton years?        
	Hes a cool cat, said Christopher Buckley, the political humorist, and I think hes going to bring cool catness back, if it ever existed at the White House.        
	Cool, maybe, but not too cool; during the course of his long campaign, Obama, wary of seeming too glamorous, took pains to make himself almost boring, a hint that his presidency may hew more closely to social convention than many people think.         
	They wont want to shock the nation, predicted Letitia Baldrige, who was White House social secretary to Jacqueline Kennedy.         
	As for sports, the big question is whether the new President will install a basketball court at the White House. President Bush had T-ball games; will Obama bring B-ball to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?         
	When America elects a President, the country votes and moves on. When Washington gets a new President, the shift can be tectonic, changing ordinary lives in ways both profound and mundane.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: A Delhi police team has left for Assam in search of seven Indian Mujahideen militants suspected to have triggered the September blasts in the capital, as the hunt for missing terror links widened.        
	Rajasthan police also sent sleuths from their anti-terrorist squad to the blast-ravaged northeastern state to find out if there were any common features between Thursdays explosions and the May 13 Jaipur blasts that killed 66 people.        
	The Delhi police team left for Assam yesterday to track the seven militants following a tip-off from investigators in the northeastern state about a text message to a mobile connection in the capital.        
	The police suspect Sajid, Khalid, Junaid alias Ariz, Shadab alias Mallik, Sehjad alias Pappu, Salman and Arif  said to be part of a 13-member module allegedly behind the Delhi blasts  might also be involved in Thursdays Assam explosions that killed over 80.        
	Assam police have already picked up a man, Naziruddin Ahmed, from Morigaon district, from whose cellphone several texts were sent regarding the blasts, one of them to the Delhi number.        
	The text, claiming responsibility for the blasts, was sent in the name of an outfit called the Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen. However, the face of the 26-year-old Ahmed does not resemble the photograph on the SIM application for the mobile.        
	Our team has gone to Assam to find out if the seven had any link with the Assam blasts. We also need to find out if Ahmed is part of the Indian Mujahideen, said a police officer.        
	Sources in Delhi said the Assam blasts were carried out by a local militant outfit aided by Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bangladesh and that the absconding seven might be holed up there.        
	Assam police, the sources added, had also tipped off their Delhi counterparts about two intercepted congratulatory messages from Bangladesh that mentioned alleged terror masterminds Tauqeer and Jehangir.        
	Tauqeer, said to be from a Mumbai suburb and who police think is the technological brain of the Indian Mujahideen, is believed to be hiding in Bangladesh where he is being sheltered by the DGFI, the neighbours main intelligence network.        
	Jehangir, another alleged jihadi, is also suspected to be in Bangladesh.        
	The team from Rajasthan left for Assam on Saturday.

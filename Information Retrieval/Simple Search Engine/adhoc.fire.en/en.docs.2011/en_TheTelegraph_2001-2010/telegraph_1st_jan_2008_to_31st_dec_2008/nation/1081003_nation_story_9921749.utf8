	Brussels, Oct. 2 (AFP): Customs authorities at Brussels airport have seized over two million counterfeit medical pills from India  the biggest haul ever in Europe, officials said today.        
	Blister packs of Tramal, a strong analgesic, or painkiller, made by German pharmaceutical company Grunenthal, and Switzerland-based Roches anti-malarial treatment Fansidar were discovered in large bags, the customs service said in a statement.        
	They were sent in three shipments by a company based in Mumbai and were bound for two companies in a western African country after transiting in Casablanca, Morocco, it added.        
	To our knowledge, this is the biggest seizure of counterfeit medicine ever carried out in Europe, Lieven Muylaert, spokesperson for the Belgian customs and excise department, said.         
	But, he added, he could not immediately evaluate the cargos worth in the open market.        
	Customs officers suspicions were aroused because the pills were not transported in boxes and there were spelling mistakes on the packs.        
	According to World Health Organisation estimates, fake medicines represent 10 per cent of the global pharmaceutical industry and are worth around 45 billion euros. They have started to penetrate drug markets in the developed world, the WHO says.        
	The amount of counterfeit medical drugs intercepted at European Union borders rose by 51 per cent last year after soaring by 400 per cent in 2006.        
	In France, such seizures, mainly of Viagra from India on its way to Africa or Latin America, shot up by 31 per cent last year.

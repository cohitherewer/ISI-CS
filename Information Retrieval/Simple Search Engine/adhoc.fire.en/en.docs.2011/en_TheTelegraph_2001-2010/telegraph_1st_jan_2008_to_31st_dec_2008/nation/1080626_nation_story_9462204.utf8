	Cuttack, June 25: Officials of Board of Secondary Education in Orissa today held new syllabus responsible for the 5.95 per cent fall in the pass rate in High School Certificate (HSC) Examination 2008.         
	The pass percentage plummeted this year for the first time in four years and officials singled out the new syllabus, with reintroduced optional papers, as the main cause.        
	Declaring the results, minister for school and mass education Sanjiv Sahu said: The success rate among regular candidates was 53.14 per cent (54.52 per cent among boys and 45.48 per cent among girls) as against a record 59.09 per cent last year. The pass rate was 56.4 per cent in 2006 and 55.66 per cent in 2005.         
	BSE president A.K. Samantaray said there was nothing unusual about the result.         
	Optional papers, withdrawn more than a decade ago, were reintroduced in the new syllabus. Some of the options had practical tests. While previously, students were permitted to write one optional paper, those who took the exam this year, two optional subjects were compulsory and the aggregate marks was increased from 750 to 800.         
	According to the result sheet released by the BSE: 31,4,442 students of 7,127 high schools had appeared for the examination in the regular category in 1,722 centres. Of them, 16,0707 had passed (27,968 in the first division, 62,946 in the second division and 91,883 in the third division). While Balasore (69.35 per cent) came up with highest success rate, Cuttack and Khurda followed with 67.66 per cent and 67.30 per cent, respectively. Kalahandi district registered the lowest success rate of 32.58 per cent.        
	Not satisfied        
	Though happy with his success, Saurav Patnaik of Sri Aurobinda Institute of Integral Education and Research, who ranked eighth in the state with 752, said he had expected better marks.         
	He told The Telegraph: My target was 760. His mother, Sujata Patanik, too, alleged that students of western Orissa were not meted justice in the tests.

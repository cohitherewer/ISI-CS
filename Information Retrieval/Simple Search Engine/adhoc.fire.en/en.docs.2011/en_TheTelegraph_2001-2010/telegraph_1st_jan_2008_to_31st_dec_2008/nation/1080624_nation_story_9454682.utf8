	Canberra, June 23 (Agencies): Australia today ruled out export of uranium to India, giving Delhi a taste of what a power shift entails in the middle of a nuclear deal stand-off at home and ahead of a change of guard in the White House.         
	We just signed a couple of treaties. The Australian Labor Party has a long-standing position which is well known. We dont export uranium to a country which is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), foreign minister Stephen Smith said after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee here.        
	The previous Conservative Party government had in principle agreed to export uranium but the Labor government has strong views on the issue.        
	In August last year, the former Australian government had started negotiating a uranium trade pact with India. The negotiations marked a major policy shift for Australia, which demands that all its uranium customers ratify the NPT and ensure that radioactive material is not put to military use or passed to a third country.        
	Australias former Prime Minister John Howard argued that his country, which holds 40 per cent of the worlds known uranium reserves, could increase export earnings while helping India reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.        
	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd defeated Howards government in the November elections and reaffirmed the ban on uranium exports to India. Earlier this month, however, Rudd announced the formation of a committee that he hopes other countries will join to review the NPT by the end of 2009.        
	Mukherjee himself sought to downplay the issue, saying India was aware of the Labor governments position and he had not come to change Canberras view on that. He said Indias commitment to non-proliferation is second to none.        
	Mukherjee said it was too early to refer to uranium sale as political discussions back home on implementing the Indo-US nuclear deal were still on. Smith said if and when the 123 Agreement reaches the IAEA or the NSG, Australia would consider what its stand should be.        
	If the nuclear deal does not come through before early next year, it will have to face the uncertainties that accompany the departure of President George W. Bush from the White House.        
	Barring uranium, there appeared no sticking points in ties between India and Australia with the two sides signing treaties on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters.

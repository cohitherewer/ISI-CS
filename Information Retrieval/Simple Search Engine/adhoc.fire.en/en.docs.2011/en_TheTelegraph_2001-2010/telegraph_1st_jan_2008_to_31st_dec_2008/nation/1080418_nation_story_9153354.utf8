          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Raja Acharya                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 17: Ninety-six hours after the murder of Biranchi Das, the main accused Raja Acharya pleaded his innocence through local media, even as director-general of police G.C. Nanda submitted a report to the chief minister regarding allegations that a section of the police was shielding the absconding gangster.        
	Gangster Acharya sent video CDs to a television channel and dailies stressing that he was not involved in the Biranchi Das murder case.         
	Rather, an IAS officer and the president of the Judo Association, Priyabrata Patnaik, Biranchi Das and Oriya actress Leslie Tripathy were threatening my family. They asked me to pressurise my brother, Deepak Acharya, to withdraw a case against Leslie and her father, Raja claimed in the video clipping.         
	On March 6, Leslie had filed an FIR alleging that Raja was sending her threatening SMSes after she spurned his romantic overtures. On March 7, Rajas brother Deepak lodged an FIR against Leslie and her father naming them as responsible for a shootout near the Acharyas residence. Raja was arrested on the basis of Leslies complaint, but was released on bail later. Police suspect that Raja killed Biranchi after he intervened in the matter.         
	There are allegations that Biranchi intervened in the case after Priyabrata Patnaik asked him to  an accusation that Patnaik and Leslie have denied.         
	I am ready to surrender before the DGP, but not before the Bhubaneswar and Cuttack police, the TV channel quoted Raja as saying.        
	DGP Nanda, on the other hand, today submitted a report to the government on the alleged nexus between Raja Acharya and a few police officers. However, Nanda declined to divulge the contents of the report to the media. If there is any allegation or any prima facie evidence, we will certainly take stern action against that particular officer, he said. Lets not demoralise the entire force by generalising any allegation, said the DGP.         
	Yesterday, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had sought a report from the DGP on the alleged gangster-police nexus.        
	On Tuesday, police commissioner B.K. Behera had admitted that an alleged nexus between Raja and some officers was a possibility.

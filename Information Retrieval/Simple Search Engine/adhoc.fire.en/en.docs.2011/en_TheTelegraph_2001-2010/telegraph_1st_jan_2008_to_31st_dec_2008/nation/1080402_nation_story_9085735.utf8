The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Music jars as creators amp; companies clash
                                                                                                               Music jars as creators amp; companies clash
  - Tiff over song ownership          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Javed Akhtar wrote most of the lyrics of Om Shanti Om                                         
	New Delhi, April 1: Bollywood composers and lyricists have dragged a four-year battle for ownership rights of their songs to the government, seeking changes in the copyright regime that they claim favours music companies over them.         
	The Indian Performing Rights Society, tasked with collecting money from licensed users of songs under the countrys copyright law, is not paying them the royalty they deserve, the composers and the lyricists have alleged.         
	The society has denied all the charges.         
	Lyricist and scriptwriter Javed Akhtar and six other Bollywood artists met human resource development minister Arjun Singh at his home late last week, complaining that the society was biased against them.         
	The ministry is the nodal agency for implementing the law. Sources said Singh has asked officials to look at possible means of intervention. The society is a non-government organisation, but is recognised by the Centre as the body representing copyright concerns of performers.         
	Although the society was started as a group of Indian artists  composers, authors and lyricists  today it is controlled by the music companies. They do not want to share their earnings with the people who create the songs that fetch them money in the first place, Akhtar told The Telegraph.         
	The society was started in 1969 by M.B. Srinivasan, a south Indian composer and an active trade unionist, as a lobby group for composers, authors and lyricists. It, however, had no official status and needed to bargain with each user for compensation in an environment where few recognised copyright as a right. The users range from restaurants to FM channels.        
	In 1994, music companies joined the group and in 1995, it became a recognised society, mandated under Section 33 of the Indian Copyright Act to collect funds from users.         
	The society was also tasked with distributing the money among the owners of the copyrights. It gives 50 per cent of its earnings from each song to the music company, 30 per cent to the composer and the remaining 20 per cent to the author or the lyricist, according to officials of the society.         
	Several composers and lyricists have not been paid by the society for the past two years. We brought all this to the notice of the minister, Akhtar said.         
	But Rakesh Nigam, the CEO of the society, said: It is untrue that we have not paid composers. Yes, there may have been a delay on one occasion, but everyone is paid.        
	The companies  copyright owners  compensate performers almost as a favour, and can stop all royalty if they wish, critics of the society and the current law point out.         
	But the performers must realise that we are no trade union. Those aggrieved should go and fight their battles in court, Nigam added.         
	They have, but against the society itself. In 2004, the composers and the lyricists appealed to Calcutta High Court against decisions taken at that years annual general meeting (AGM). The court passed an injunction, putting all decisions taken at the AGM on hold.         
	For the past three years, the society has been holding AGMs, but the protesting artists boycotted those meetings.        
	Anu Malik, A.R. Rahman and the trio of Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy are some other prominent members of the society, but their stand on the controversy is not clear.

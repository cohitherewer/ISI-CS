          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, July 17: The National Institute of Design has expelled two students for physically ragging a fresher from Calcutta, who has returned home traumatised.        
	The 18-year-old faced brutal ragging from Day One after joining the NID on June 18, his father, a university teacher, told the institute in a written complaint earlier this week. He threatened legal action if the NID failed to punish his sons tormentors.        
	The two expelled students, who are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, were directly involved in ragging the fresher, sources said. Three others have been told to leave the hostel for indirect involvement.        
	Institute PRO Mohir Bholey denied that any ragging had taken place but registrar (academics) Vijaya Deshmukh said: We have already taken stern action against the guilty students. Two students directly involved in the ragging have been expelled and three others have been asked to leave the NID hostel.        
	She added that the fresher would rejoin the institute next week.        
	The Calcutta boys ordeal had begun within half an hour of entering the hostel, his fathers complaint says. Two boarders began ragging him immediately while a few others enjoyed the show, which amounted to sexual harassment.        
	When the terrified fresher called up his father, he consoled the boy and asked him to stay put, saying things would improve. But the torment continued.        
	The seniors would barge into his room at all hours and force him to do strange, obscene things. An NID student said the boy was terrified to even step into his room, and slept on the terrace of an adjoining building.        
	The boys father flew in from Calcutta this week. When he handed his complaint to the authorities, he was promised immediate action, sources said. But he chose to take his traumatised son home.

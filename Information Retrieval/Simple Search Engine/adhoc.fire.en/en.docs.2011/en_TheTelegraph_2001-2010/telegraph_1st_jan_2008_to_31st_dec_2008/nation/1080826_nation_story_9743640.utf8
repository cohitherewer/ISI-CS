  - Europe comes up with quicker amp; cheaper technology         G.S. MUDUR                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: A four-year-old European initiative to reduce the cost and time of software development could intensify pressure on Indias software industry to find ways to retain its traditional cost advantage.        
	The eight-country, academic-industry collaborative project has worked out a new software development methodology that can be applied in several areas, ranging from automotive and consumer electronics to telecommunications.        
	In pilot studies, involving more than 1,700 software engineers from 17 companies, the project has shown that the new Agile software methodology can reduce development costs and time by 70 per cent, said Pekka Abrahamsson, project co-ordinator, VTT Technical Research Centre, Finland.        
	If we can sustain and extend these results on a large scale in Europe, it could become cheaper to outsource from India to Europe than the other way round, Abrahamsson said.        
	Although the cost of software development in India has been steadily growing, the Agile software methodology could build more pressure on Indian (software) companies to adapt, he said.        
	A key element of the methodology is its ability to accept changes in software requirements even at a late stage in project implementation, said a news release from Eureka, a European consortium for market-oriented research and development.        
	The Agile strategy allows new features to be incorporated into a product only days before it hits the market, according to Eureka.         
	Indias software industry estimates exports of $40 billion in 2008 and plans to touch $60 billion by 2010.         
	A spokesperson for a top software company said it was a myth that software was outsourced to India for its relatively low cost. Weve been working on ways to improve software engineering since the 1970s. We have software tools that automate software engineering, said Shivanand Kanvi, vice-president, special projects, with Tata Consultancy Services in New Delhi.         
	The quality and reliability of a software too influences outsourcing decisions, an industry analyst said.        
	Indias software professionals have launched their own efforts to shift to Agile software, the analyst said.        
	Abrahamsson acknowledged Indias Agile initiative, but argued that the European project had set a benchmark, demonstrating unsurpassed improvements in time, cost and quality. We have been able to go beyond what is being done in the US currently, putting Europe ahead. While development teams in India and other countries have set up their own technologies in this area, Europe now has a competitive edge, he said.         
	The project was part of an ongoing effort to enhance Europes software prowess and included teams from Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and the Netherlands. The next phase of the project has attracted 30 million euros in funding and will be aimed at extending the methodology to various industries, Abrahamsson said.

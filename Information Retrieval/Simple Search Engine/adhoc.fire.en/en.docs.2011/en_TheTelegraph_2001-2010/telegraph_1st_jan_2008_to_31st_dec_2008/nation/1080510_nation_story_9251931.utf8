	Mistaken identity puzzle for police    
	The capitals cops are caught in a mistaken identity mess.     
	Jitender, an Uttar Pradesh resident, has told a Delhi court that someone misused his identity proof at the time of being arrested in an assault case. The accused also got bail under this allegedly assumed identity. As a result, Jitender, supposedly innocent, was forced to appear in court.    
	Metropolitan magistrate Ajay Gupta has asked the station house officer of Subzi Mandi police station to reinvestigate the case after Jitender claimed he had never been arrested.    
	He sought immediate discharge from the case on the ground that he never visited the capital. He said the investigating officer, who had allegedly arrested him earlier, was not identifying him as an accused now.    
	The court was hearing a case lodged on March 16 last year against five persons, including Jitender, travelling in a tempo who had allegedly assaulted a car driver following an accident. All the accused were later released on bail and after filing of the chargesheet, the court had summoned them on April 28 for trial.

	Kamalahasan hits VHP wall  
	Controversy and Kamalahasan seem to go hand in hand.     
	After facing obstacles over controversial references in his earlier films like Virumandi, Mumbai Express and Vasool Raja MBBS, the actor-director has hit another wall.    
	The VHP has threatened to stall the screening of the film Dasavatharam  he plays 10 roles in it  because the movie is said to contain a clash between Shaivite and Vaishnavite saints during the 16th century. The outfit wanted Kamalahasan to remove such scenes.     
	HP international working president S. Vedantham said: We have information that the film contains the 16th century clash between the Shaivites and the Vaishnavites during which idols were damaged.    
	If these objectionable portions are not removed, the VHP will stall screening of the film and will also stage agitations before the theatres, he said.

	Monkey in court  
	A monkey kept Bombay High Court busy for over two hours recently.    
	The animal was spotted on the top floor of the court around 1.20 in the afternoon. The chambers of the judges are located there.    
	Since it could not be chased out by the court staff, fire brigade personnel were called in. After two hours, the monkey was caught and taken away.    
	Fire brigade officers were clueless from where the simian came. The area around the high court is full of big trees, but there is no grove nearby.    
	Another monkey had entered the Borivli magistrates court

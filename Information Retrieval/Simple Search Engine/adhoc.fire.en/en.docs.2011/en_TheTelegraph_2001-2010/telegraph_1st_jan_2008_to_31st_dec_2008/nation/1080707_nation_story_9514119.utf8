	Lucknow, July 6: If you are curious about the landscape on which dinosaurs strutted around, you may soon be able to get a peek.        
	In about a year, eastern India is expected to have its first fossil park, showcasing plants from the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, at Sahebganj on Jharkhands northern tip.        
	Six decades ago, palaeobotanist Birbal Sahni (1891-1949), a giant in the study of fossils in the subcontinent, would hop off a goods train after asking its driver to slow down near Sahebganj, not connected by passenger train at that time. He would then trek up the Rajmahal hills, looking for fossils.        
	Lucknows Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP), which he founded, is turning the area he investigated into a fossil park. The institute signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government and the National Building Construction Corporation in January, and handed in the project report in May.        
	Sahebganj is about 340km from Howrah  a six-and-a-half-hour journey by train.        
	It will be the fifth fossil park in India but the first in eastern India. It will have the oldest fossils in the country, BSIP scientist A.K. Srivastava said. The fossils are estimated to be 150-200 million years old.        
	Sahni had begun his work in 1928 and, between 1946 and 1948, amassed huge samples of fossils from the area.

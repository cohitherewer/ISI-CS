The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mercy plea for Sarabjit before exit
                                                                                                               Mercy plea for Sarabjit before exit
          GAJINDER SINGH                          Burney                                  
	Chandigarh, March 26: Pakistans caretaker human rights minister, Ansar Burney, met President Pervez Musharraf before stepping down yesterday and requested him to commute Sarabjit Singhs death sentence to life imprisonment.        
	I met President Musharraf in the afternoon and pleaded with him to pardon Sarabjit and convert his death sentence to life so that he can be released after undergoing his remaining punishment in the next three to four years. This was my last act as minister, Burney said over phone last night.        
	Sarabjit, tried in Pakistan as Indian spy Manjit Singh, has completed 18 years on death row and this should be considered enough punishment for his alleged role in five blasts that killed 14 people in Lahore, Kasur and Faisalabad in 1990, Burney said.        
	I pleaded with President Musharraf that even if Sarabjit is guilty of terrorism in Pakistan, he should be pardoned, he said, adding that the President listened to him attentively.         
	Sarabjit would have been hanged on April 1, but Islamabad postponed the execution by a month amid appeals for mercy from Delhi.        
	His family denies that Sarabjit was a spy and claims he was drunk when he crossed the border.         
	Burney, an advocate in Karachi, said he would soon visit Sarabjits family in India. I want to know more about the case and gather proof on Sarabjit and hand it to the new government.         
	His Ansar Burney Welfare Trust in Karachi fights against human rights violations and provides aid in disaster-hit areas.        
	Sarabjits family has decided to apply for visas to go to Pakistan to submit a fresh petition seeking clemency.        
	I will go to Delhi tomorrow to apply for the visas, his wife Sukhpreet Kaur said, adding that daughters Swapandeep and Poonam would accompany her.         
	Now that we have got our passports, we hope to get the visas soon, Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur said.        
	The family would try to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, ruling Pakistan Peoples Party chief Asif Zardari and Musharraf, she said.        
	The family also plans to submit to Pakistan authorities the statement of Saleem Shaukat, an eyewitness who had said he deposed against Sarabjit on the instructions of the prosecution counsel and had never met the Indian.        
	They will also meet the relatives of those killed in the 1990 blasts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 29: Sanjaya Baru, the media adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, will put in his papers shortly to take up a prestigious academic assignment in Singapore.        
	From August this year, Baru will do a two-year term at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at Singapores National University which is headed by global strategies expert Kishore Mahbubani.         
	Baru confirmed his departure and said he had informed the Prime Minister sufficiently in advance.         
	He will be in the Prime Ministers Office until July. Sources close to him said a big impetus for the relocation was that his daughter got into Singapores Lasalle College of Arts.        
	Barus exit has set off speculation in the Congress on whether Singh will again have his hand-picked nominee as the media adviser or allow his party to recommend a person the rest of the UPA governments tenure.         
	Barus appointment had initially caused heart-burn in the Congress as some in the party eyed the job or had short-listed their candidates for it. But Singh had made up his mind on who he wanted as his media adviser.         
	There were murmurs on whether an outsider (a non-Congress person) could effectively package and project the governments achievements from the partys perspective.        
	At the end of Barus four-year tenure, the Congress reserved its verdict.         
	Baru is the third official in the PMO to move out.         
	Last year, two joint secretaries, Javed Usmani and Sujata Mehta left: Usmani for the World Bank in Washington while Sujata, who is from the foreign service, was posted as ambassador to Spain.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 12: The state vigilance directorate has confirmed circulation of huge amount of fake medicines in markets vis--vis a trade mostly dealing with generic spurious drugs.        
	The state vigilance, in its report submitted in Orissa High Court yesterday, further added a thriving racket in the supply of substandard drugs and transfusion fluids for government hospitals. The corrupt officials of the state health department, responsible for purchase and storage of drugs in crores, are suspected to be hand in glove with manufacturers, the report said.        
	In most cases, spurious drugs circulation is carried out with the knowledge and connivance of officials of the drug controller, Orissa, and local drug inspectors who are on the payroll of unscrupulous dealers, it added.        
	The spurious drugs issue had reached the high court after a PIL was filed in the wake of busting of a major fake drug manufacturing and supply racket in the state in July last year. Several PILs seeking judicial intervention against alleged circulation of spurious drugs in the state were filed subsequently.        
	The report also indicted the Utkal Chemists and Drugs Association, the apex body of retailers and wholesalers in the state, which had apparently turned into a power hub in controlling the trade and the industry through clandestine drug deals involving huge amount of money, the 17-page report observed.        
	Seed uproar        
	The alleged supply of substandard groundnut seeds to farmers sparked an uproar in the Assembly today with the Opposition demanding a high-level probe into the lapses. Even ruling party members alleged about the short supply of seeds and fertiliser and requested the agriculture minister to rise to the occasion.         
	However, agriculture minister Surendra Nath Nayak said only certified seeds had been supplied to farmers.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          On which side of law?                                  
	Cuttack, Aug. 17: Two policemen and a civilian were arrested and remanded to jail, on charges of robbery and ransacking a licensed shop on Independence Day.         
	The theft was allegedly committed in the Manglabag area of the city on Friday. Cases have been registered against the three under Section 394 (IPC) for voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery, said Manglabag inspector in charge P.K. Jena, talking to The Telegraph today.         
	Cases against them have also been registered under Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act, Jena added.         
	If convicted the two could end up with rigorous imprisonment for a term that may extend to 10 years.         
	The two personnel were arrested after licensed shopkeeper (name withheld) lodged a case against them and a preliminary investigation was conducted.         
	In his statement, the shopkeeper told the police that two Armed Reserve Police (APR) personnel  Laxmidhar Behera and Diptiranjan Behera  forcibly entered his shop and ransacked it with civilian Purnachandra Pradhan.        
	One of the men was carrying a revolver.         
	Together, the three forcibly took away Rs 14,000 from the shopkeeper.         
	Manglabag inspector in charge P.K. Jena explained that a country-made revolver was also seized from Purnachandra Pradhan during the course of the arrest.         
	All three have since been denied bail and are now lodged at Choudwar Jail, some 11km from the silver city.         
	Meanwhile, observers allege that the state police have been trying to portray the theft as one committed in a drunken spree.

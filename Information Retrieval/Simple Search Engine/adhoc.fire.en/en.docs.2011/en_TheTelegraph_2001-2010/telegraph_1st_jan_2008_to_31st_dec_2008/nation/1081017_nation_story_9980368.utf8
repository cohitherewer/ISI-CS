	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 16: Medal-winning weightlifter Ranu Mohanty may be compelled to quit athletics.        
	For, she does not have the minimum Rs 2.35 lakh needed to fly to Canada for the mandatory dope test for the forthcoming world powerlifting championship.         
	The Orissa Cricket Association has given Rs 50,000 for Ranu, who has been selected to represent India in the forthcoming world powerlifting championship in Canada from November 2 to 7.        
	The state government has offered merely Rs 10,000 and there is no time to look for sponsors, said her coach Hariprasad Patnaik.        
	Ranu said: I have to deposit the money with the India powerlifting federation for the dope test and travel by Tuesday. To beg is demeaning.

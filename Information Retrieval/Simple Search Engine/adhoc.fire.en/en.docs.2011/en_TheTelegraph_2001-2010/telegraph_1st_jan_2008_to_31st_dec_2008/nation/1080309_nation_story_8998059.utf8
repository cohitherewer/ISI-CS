          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 8: A fractured verdict in Meghalaya triggered high political drama today, with Meghalaya Progressive Alliance, a new non-Congress combine, challenging the single largest partys claim to power.         
	After being elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party, D.D. Lapang met acting governor S.S. Sidhu this morning with only a list of the partys 25 successful candidates and staked claim to power.         
	He was accompanied by Union tribal affairs minister P.R. Kyndiah, AICC secretary in charge of Meghalaya Maj. (retd) Ved Prakash and PCC chief .L. Nongtdu.        
	Sidhu was told that the Congress would be able to form the government and prove its strength on the floor of the House with the help of like-minded parties.         
	In the afternoon, leaders of the NCP, UDP, Hill State Peoples Democratic Party, Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and the BJP, along with Manas Chaudhuri and Donkupar Massar, the two Independents, met Sidhu under the MPAs banner.         
	They submitted a list of 31 names and claimed that two more Independents were in touch with them.         
	They requested that the new combine be allowed to form the government with UDP president Donkupar Roy as chief minister.         
	The NCP, the party in the MPA with highest number of seats, is projecting Roy as chief minister and HSPDP president H.S. Lyngdoh as his deputy.        
	However, late tonight, NCP leader Purno Sangma floated the idea of sharing power with the UDP, with he and Roy being chief minister for two-and-a-half years each.        
	Roy said the MPA leaders had pledged to stay united to provide a stable government. We hope that we can win over the remaining Independents.        
	However, of the other three Independents, A.T. Mondal is pro-Congress and the party claims support of Limison Sangma and Ismail Marak.         
	Sidhu said he would assess the claims of the two sides and consult legal experts.        
	Following claims by the Congress and counter claims by the new coalition to form the government, I have to consult legal experts.         
	The swearing-in of legislators could be held on Monday.

          Our Correspondent                                    
	Chandigarh, May 12: A young nurse who says she was gang-raped on May 6 night tore off parts of her kurta at a police station yesterday in frustration because the rapists had still not been arrested.        
	It led to her own detention for a day.        
	The police in Yamunanagar, 140km from here, who say the 25-year-old woman also attempted suicide at the police station, put her behind bars but she got bail this afternoon.        
	Yamunanagar superintendent of police C.S. Rao said the woman had tried to smash her head with a brick and also tried to grab a live wire.        
	Rao said the nurse had arrived at the police station with television crews from several channels who filmed her actions. She was instigated by some journalists. We have identified them and will take action against them. Police personnel had a trying time ensuring she didnt harm herself.        
	Eyewitnesses said she tried to strip in anger and invited the policemen to attack her as the rapists had.        
	The woman says she was gang-raped when she went out to fetch water while visiting an acquaintance, Sonia. Her family claims the rapists are influential persons and have been pressuring the police not to act.        
	SP Rao, however, said: She has been reluctant to show where the incident happened, nor is she naming the persons who she says raped her.        
	He added that a gang-rape case was registered on May 7 but the medical examination report was inconclusive. Her inner garments have been sent to the forensic laboratory at Madhuban (150km from Chandigarh) for further tests.        
	Rao added: Although the medical test did not confirm rape, we have arrested two persons, Sonia and her husband Balwinder, on the basis of her complaint.        
	The couple were sent to a days police remand today on the charge of being party to rape. The magistrate had at first sent the nurse to judicial (jail) custody in the morning but changed his mind in the afternoon and gave her bail.        
	According to the police, the nurse was returning home from work on May 6 when she met Sonia on the way.        
	She went with her to see her (Sonias) mother-in-law who was not well. Investigations have revealed she went out to get some water and came back to the house after a long time, Rao said.        
	Rao added that Sonia and Balwinder had a shady past. He said: Sonia was Balwinders second wife. She had been staying with another person, Bittu, who is a bad character in police records. But she returned to Balwinder on May 5, the day before the alleged crime.

	Mumbai, April 9 (PTI): A corrupt government officials wife benefiting from his ill-gotten wealth is equally guilty, Bombay High Court has said.         
	The court held Mangalabai Wagh guilty of abetment in a disproportionate assets case involving her husband Bhaskar, a zilla parishad cashier. Upholding a three-year jail term handed by a trial court, it said Mangala had immovable properties and a vehicle in her name, though she did not have any income of her own.

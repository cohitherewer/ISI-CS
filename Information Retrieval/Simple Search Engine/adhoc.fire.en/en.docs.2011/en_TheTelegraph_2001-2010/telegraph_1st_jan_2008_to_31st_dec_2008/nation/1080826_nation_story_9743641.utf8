The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Where to? Shackled Taslima in dilemma
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Where to? Shackled Taslima in dilemma
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Taslima Nasreen has kept the Centre guessing about her plans, with officials saying the 45-year-old writer is apparently undecided on where to settle.        
	An official in charge of her security, at an undisclosed Delhi location, said the Bangladeshi author was uncertain about what to do.        
	Her first aim was to get a permanent resident visa. When that was refused, she said she would be happy with a visa extension for the time being, the official added.        
	But having got the extension, Taslima is not sure if she wants to stay on.        
	She had unhindered freedom in Sweden after she left India for five months. It is difficult for her to go back to a shackled life, the official said.        
	The controversial writer is said to be thinking of leaving India  where her movements have been restricted because of security concerns  for Europe. She arrived here two weeks ago.        
	Taslima had hoped for a change of heart on the part of the government in Bengal, from where she had to leave in a hurry amid protests last year.        
	She had thought tempers would cool and all would be forgiven and forgotten. She had apparently not taken into account the animosity of hard-line Islamic groups and the CPM, the official said.        
	But now with the feedback she has got, she is not insisting on going to Calcutta.        
	In Delhi, the writer is not moving around much despite assurances that she would be given all possible security. She is also believed to have wound up her Calcutta residence with the help of friends and relatives.        
	Taslima hasnt told the security and intelligence agencies whats on her mind. She has a valid visa. She isnt making unreasonable demands. She can take her time and decide, the official said.

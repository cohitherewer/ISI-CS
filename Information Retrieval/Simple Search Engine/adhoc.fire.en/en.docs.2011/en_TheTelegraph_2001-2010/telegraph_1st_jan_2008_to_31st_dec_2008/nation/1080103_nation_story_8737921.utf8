	Dhubri, Jan. 2: Curfew was clamped in Lakhipur town and the army asked to move in after a three-day bandh that began this morning left a trail of death and destruction in Goalpara district of Lower Assam.        
	Seven persons died when police fired on bandh supporters who had turned violent. Two police officers and a CRPF jawan were among the 20-odd people injured in the violence. Several vehicles were torched.        
	The bandh was called last night by the Non-Rabha Co-ordination Forum and the Non-Tribal Protection Forum to prevent officials from reaching polling stations for the second phase of panchayat elections.        
	The state election commission tonight indefinitely postponed polls, scheduled for January 4 and 9, in the entire Goalpara district.         
	The two organisations were protesting against the governments decision not to hold panchayat polls in parts of Kamrup and Goalpara, administered by the Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council. Rabha groups had opposed the election in their areas, a demand the government accepted, without polls to the council being held.        
	Lakhipur town bore the brunt of the mob violence, but the first incident of the day occurred at Bhalukdubi in Goalpara town around 11am.        
	The protesters hurled stones at polling personnel who had assembled there before heading to the booths assigned to them. The police baton-charged the mob.        
	The violence then shifted to the main market in nearby Lakhipur town, where thousands had gathered to enforce the bandh. When a section of the crowd started throwing stones and damaging vehicles around noon, a police team arrived to disperse them.         
	The protesters outnumbered the police team. The officers-in-charge of Lakhipur police station and the Jaleswar outpost, Gobinda Saikia and Irfan Khan, were injured.        
	When caning failed to stop the mob, the police opened fire, killing four persons.        
	As news of the deaths spread, thousands of people marched to Lakhipur police station and attacked the police personnel. Three persons died in the firing that followed.

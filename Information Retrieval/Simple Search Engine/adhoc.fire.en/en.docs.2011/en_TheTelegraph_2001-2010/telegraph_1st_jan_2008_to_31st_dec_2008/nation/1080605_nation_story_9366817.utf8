          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, June 4: The CPI-CPM rift in Keralas ruling Left Democratic Front has started to reflect on the process of procuring rice from Left-governed Bengal.        
	The co-operative department, under a CPM minister, brought 2,000 tonnes of rice from Bengals private mills even as a formal request from the civil supplies corporation, run by a CPI minister, was being processed.        
	After clearance from the Bengal government, the Kerala Civil Supplies Cooperation, the states nodal agency for grain procurement, officially wrote to the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation.        
	But while the process of tendering was on, the co-operative department tried getting rice on its own from Bengal. The CPIs C. Divakaran is the food minister, while the CPMs G. Sudhakaran heads the co-operative department.        
	The co-operative department request, sources said, was pushed by CPM leaders in the state and the rice was procured from mill owners in Bardhaman district quickly. The co-operative department runs outlets under the consumer federation banner, like Triveni Supermarket Neethi Stores.        
	Kerala is short of rice. The problem has been compounded by the Centres reduction in its quota of PDS (ration) rice.

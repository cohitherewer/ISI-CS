	Chennai, Jan. 31: A group of Dalit students today squatted outside the Tamil Nadu Assembly against the Centres proposed move to link merit to scholarships in higher education.
    
	As the protesters tried to break through barricades near the Assembly, one of them climbed atop a signal post and threatened to commit suicide. Police cajoled the young man to jump off and then arrested him.
    
	The Centre has proposed to make a Plus Two score of 60 per cent mandatory to qualify for scholarships in higher education.

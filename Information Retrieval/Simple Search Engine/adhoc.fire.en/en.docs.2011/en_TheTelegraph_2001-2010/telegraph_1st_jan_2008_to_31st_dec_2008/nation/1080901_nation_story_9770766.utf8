          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Aug. 31: The Malda district administration is planning to evacuate over 10,000 people.        
	With the Kosi overflowing in Bengal too, nine villages in the Islampur panchayat area and Ratua block have been inundated.        
	The river, which has marooned lakhs in flooded Bihar, joins the Phulahar and the Ganga in Malda.         
	District magistrate Chittaranjan Das said he had sent Chanchol sub-divisional officer Debashis Sarkar to Islampur this morning to find out how many people needed to be shifted.        
	Nearly 10,000 people have been affected. I have given orders to shift as many people as possible because most of the water carried by the Kosi is passing through our district, Das said.        
	Irrigation department sources said the Phulahar was flowing 40cm above the extreme danger level of 28.35m.        
	In Ratua, 34 villages in the Mahanandatola and Bilaimari gram panchayat areas have been flooded, the district magistrate said. About 15,000 people have been affected, said Das. The number in Ratua may be higher, but in Islampur, the scale of damage is more.         
	The deputy pradhan of Islampur, Bhabes Mondol, said more than 1,000 mud huts had been washed away.        
	We are setting up tarpaulin tents. The affected people have taken shelter in five school buildings in the area, Mondol said.

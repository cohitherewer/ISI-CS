          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A burnt down church in Kandhamal. (PTI)                                  
	Cuttack, Nov. 8: Utkal Christian Council (UCC) has challenged the validity of the appointment of former Lokpal Justice S.C. Mohapatra as head of the one-man commission constituted to probe into the murder of Laxmananda Saraswati.         
	The state government formed the commission to analyse the sequence and circumstances leading to the murders of the seer and four of his associates on August 23 at a Kandhamal ashram and the incidents of violence that followed the deaths.         
	The petition has contended that the appointment of Justice Mohapatra under the Commission of Inquiries Act, 1956, is not valid as he is ineligible to hold the post under Section 5(3) of the Lokpal Act.        
	The petition will be taken up for hearing on Monday, UCC counsel P.K. Nanda told The Telegraph today.         
	UCC secretary Jyotsna Rani Patra filed the petition on Friday afternoon, calling the appointment a deliberate attempt to frustrate the ultimate result of the commission if it goes against a fundamentalist group.         
	While Justice S.C. Mohapatra automatically becomes a public servant when he assumes the post of the head of a judicial commission, Section 5(3) of the Lokpal Act forbids the appointment of a Lokpal to such post.        
	The Section 10 of the Commission of Inquiries Act states: Every commission member appointed under this Act shall be deemed a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 of the IPC.        
	Earlier, the UCC had also filed a petition seeking a CBI probe into the death of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23. But, the petition was waved aside.         
	Meanwhile, the one-man judicial commission led by Justice S.C. Mohapatra, a retired judge of Orissa High Court, had invited individual statements and affidavits through an advertisement in local newspapers on November 2.         
	The commission, while fixing November 15 as the deadline for submission of the individual statements and affidavits, had also invited people to appear before it at its office on November 28.         
	The commission has said that it will also probe the role, conduct and responsibility of states individuals, organisations, groups and agencies in precipitating and committing the crimes.         
	it has assured that it would investigate whether the measures taken and the quantum of force used in handling the situation was adequate.

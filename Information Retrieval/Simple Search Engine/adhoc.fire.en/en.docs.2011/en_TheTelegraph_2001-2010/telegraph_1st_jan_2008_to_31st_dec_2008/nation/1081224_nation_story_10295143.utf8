          NASIR JAFFRY AND NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Interpol secretary-general Ronald K. Noble at the news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                  
	Islamabad/New Delhi, Dec. 23: Interpol secretary-general Ronald K. Noble said in Islamabad today that until India shared information, investigators around the world would be groping in the dark on the identity of the Mumbai attackers.        
	To date, Indias government has not authorised Indias police agencies to enter any data relating to the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai in Interpols databases, Noble said. The information Interpol has about what happened in Mumbai is the same information that you have, he told reporters.        
	The official said Interpols instant response team had been sent to India several days ago to gather evidence to be shared with police databases around the world, but all the information it had so far had been gleaned from the media.        
	Noble, who had met home minister P. Chidambaram in Delhi last week, said it was a countrys right to decide when it should share information but it was unacceptable for authorities to pass accurate information to the media without sharing it with Interpol.        
	So far no names have been provided by India to Interpol to enter in its databases for Pakistan or any other countries to determine whether or not they have information or link to those individuals, he said.        
	We cant enter newspaper information in our police databases, we can only enter information that we receive from police authorities.        
	In Delhi, CBI director Ashwani Kumar said all evidence about the terror attacks in Mumbai could be shared with Interpol only when the investigation was over. We have shared some evidence, Kumar said. The CBI is Interpols nodal office for India.         
	Kumar said sharing of evidence would depend on how, when and what the investigating agency wanted to share. And here, the investigating agency is Mumbai crime branch, Kumar added.         
	In Mumbai, police commissioner Hasan Gafoor said: We have shared necessary information about the 10 terrorists with the CBI.        
	Sources said the government was keen to avoid haste that could introduce half-baked data which could eventually blow up in its face and gift Pakistan a chance to demolish the entire case. The investigators are trying to verify whether Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the captured terrorist, provided them with genuine names.        
	The sources said the Centre was also wary of giving out too much information that might fall into Pakistani hands and compromise Indian intelligence operatives.         
	China reluctant        
	China appeared reluctant to put Pakistan in the dock, saying the identity of the mastermind of the carnage awaited further investigation by concerned countries.         
	India had yesterday said the world had not done enough to persuade Pakistan to take action.

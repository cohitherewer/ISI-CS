The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM to dissect power-and-protest dilemma
                                                                                                               CPM to dissect power-and-protest dilemma
          JAYANTH JACOB AND BISWAJIT ROY                          Prakash Karat                                  
	Coimbatore, March 28: The nuclear deal and the third alternative can wait. The biggest challenge before the CPM party congress that begins here tomorrow is matching its words in Delhi on neo-liberal economic polices with the deeds of its three state governments.         
	Party sources said the six-day meeting of the CPMs biggest decision-making body would deliberate on alternative policies to be adopted by the state governments within the framework of the Centres stand on liberalisation and globalisation.         
	Insiders feel that this exercise and subsequent guidelines will help find an answer within the CPM on its outlook on economic polices and fight accusations of double standards in states where the party is in power.         
	The debate will also try to tackle the dilemma the party rank and file faced when violence erupted in Nandigram. The discomfiture was acute in states where the party is not in power and cadres are used to spearheading campaigns against similar government policies.        
	In short, we are trying to find an answer to a dialectal question  running governments and running peoples movements in the country without contradicting the two positions. The answer should be found within the framework of the central governments policies, a source said.        
	The sources said the CPMs state governments could take measures that would mitigate the impact of the neo-liberal economic polices of the Centre, which the party opposes.         
	They cited as an example the surcharge the Kerala government recently proposed on goods purchased from organised retailers. The levy ensures a level-playing field for the unorganised retail sector, the sources said.        
	The surcharge reflects the CPMs policy on regulating big retailers. As the Centre had not imposed such a tax, the party can underscore the difference and claim that its policy takes care to protect the unorganised retailers for whose sake it is opposing foreign direct investment in retail.         
	On special economic zones (SEZs), too, the party will try to come up with measures that would set it apart, although the segment is a central subject.        
	As part of the effort, the party has been talking of better compensation for and proper rehabilitation of not only the landlosers but also sharecroppers and agriculture labourers. Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen, who has helped shape the policy framework draft, has said the state government would like to retain the right to acquire land rather than leave it to individual investors as preferred by the Centre.        
	The alternative policy for the Left-ruled governments will be part of the political and organisation report the party congress will adopt.         
	It will be an interesting discussion on the alternative policies of the Left Front governments, politburo member Brinda Karat said.        
	Explaining the need for the discussion, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat wrote in party organs that the Left-ruled states are working under severe constraints in the wake of the neo-liberal policies of the Centre. The framework is needed to guide the Left-led governments. The Left governments have to implement the pro-people projects and highlight the alternative policies within these constraints.        
	With the CPM trying to penetrate states in northern India and southern states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the dilemma is over whether the party should adhere to a national policy framework or toe the line that suits the unique situation in each state.        
	Prakash Karat has been stressing agrarian crisis as one of the thrust areas and the partys units in Andhra, Bihar and Rajasthan are spearheading campaigns seeking land for the landless and opposing acquisition for SEZs.        
	Although Prakash Karat and other central party leaders have vigorously defended Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees drive for industrialisation, the cadres in other states have found it difficult to counter Opposition taunts.        
	Against this backdrop, Prakash Karat has advised the need for finding a balance. While articulating their policies and taking action, our state units and the leadership of the state governments must remember that their action is having an impact on the party workers and mass movements in other parts of the country. (On the other hand), it will be the entire partys responsibility to appreciate the given situations in which these governments are working and make their pro-people steps and alternative policies popular, he said in a recent article.        
	The alternative framework is expected to fine-tune the last party congresss document on certain policy matters that had called for engagement with existing world realities. It will stress on balanced development of industry and agriculture.

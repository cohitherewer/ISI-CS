The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left on streets against hike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left on streets against hike
  - Cry for windfall tax on firms, attack on BJP          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Consumers wait for fuel at a Delhi petrol pump. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, June 4: The Left parties today said they would hit the streets to protest the fuel price hike while blaming the BJP for its double standards in slamming the increase.        
	In a joint statement signed by the general secretaries of the CPM, CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc  Prakash Karat, A.B. Bardhan, T.J. Chandrachoodan and Debabrata Biswas  they called for powerful countrywide protest movements from June 5 to 11.         
	The Left parties will mobilise people to conduct hartals, strikes, picketing, rail roko, rasta roko and demonstrations to protest against this unjustified burden, they declared, demanding a review of the hike. The Centre, the leaders said, should cut excise duties more and impose windfall taxes on private oil companies.        
	The increase in the price of diesel, in particular, will have a cascading effect on all-round prices as it will drive up transportation costs sharply. The rise of Rs 50 in the price of an LPG cylinder will be a crushing burden on the family budget of ordinary people.        
	The government also came under fire for not imposing the windfall profit tax suggested by the communists.         
	Later, the CPM said in a separate statement that with crude prices rising, the only sustainable solution lay in restructuring duties on petroleum products and in a transparent pricing policy where oil marketing companies and refineries dont retain hefty profits.         
	What is at stake today is not the market capitalisation of oil companies but the livelihood of people already suffering back-breaking inflation, the CPM said.        
	It attacked the BJP for its double standards, saying the party had raised fuel prices several times.        
	Central secretariat member Nilotpal Basu said: We are protesting the price hike and the BJPs double standards. During the NDA regime, they had increased the price of oil products eight times. When they came to power, kerosene was priced at Rs 2 and they made it Rs 9.         
	The CPM did not say whether the protests would also be held against oil cartel Opec or Arab countries for the rise in crude prices. It trained its guns on private firms. So many private companies are making profit and the government is not ready to impose any windfall tax, Basu said.

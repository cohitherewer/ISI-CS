The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Milk goes down the drain, to river
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Milk goes down the drain, to river

	Cuttack, Nov. 21: Milk finally flowed on the streets of Naveen Patnaiks Orissa, but fish probably drank it.        
	An army of milkmen poured 5,000 litres of milk on the road outside the Cuttack collectors office today, demanding a higher price from government dairy Omfed.        
	White streams ran across to adjoining streets, some flowing into the drain outside the State Bank of India (main branch), some into the gutter before the Criminal Bar Association office.        
	Its not clear how much the fish in the Kathjodi river, where the citys main drains empty, enjoyed the binge but experts said cows milk would provide fish with important proteins.        
	That could be good news for fishermen but the citys tea vendors were disappointed. I usually sell nearly 1,000 cups of tea a day. But I sold less than 100 cups today because I did not get Omfed milk, said Aparti Barik, 42, handing out a cup of lemon tea to a group of regular customers.        
	D. Rama Rao, 51, who sells over 1,000 cups a day at his stall near Buxi Bazar, said: I arranged for some buffalo milk from the neighbourhood but had to close shop after a couple of hours.        
	The milkmen, demanding Omfed pay them Rs 18 a litre instead of Rs 10.40, did not supply any milk to the dairy today. On any other day, milkmen from four coastal districts supply 3 lakh quintals to Omfed, which sells at Rs 20 a litre.        
	The 5,000 litres the milkmen wasted today would have made 25,000 litres of tea, which comes to about 3,25,000 cups.         
	Some 3,000 milkmen carrying cans had marched 7km through Cuttacks streets to reach the collectors office.        
	We poured 5,000 litres of milk (on the street). No milk was supplied to Omfed today. Supply of milk and milk products to Cuttack was also discontinued for the day, Orissa Milk Farmers Mahasangh general secretary Pradip Behera said.        
	Since there has been a sharp rise in the prices of all cattle feed, the state government should safeguard the interests of the milk farmers, said Subash Chandra Behera, working president of the Utkal Yadav Mahasabha.

	High spirits after entry of bar girls    
	They were eager to serve. Now, the bar has finally been raised.    
	Karnataka High Courts permission to allow women bartenders in the state has raised the spirits of those wanting to break into the job, one of the last male bastions that hadnt crumbled all these years.    
	The petitions had been filed by two women, Roopa and Anasuya, saying the excise act forbidding women from being employed in places where liquor was served should be amended.    
	Potential employers didnt seem to have a problem. Sanjay and Jayaram, who own bars and restaurants where liquor was served, had told the judges they did not have any objection if permission for the move came through.    
	The government had taken a more cautious line, saying any decision on allowing women into the job should take into account security concerns.     
	Bartending has long been risky, a fact brought into focus by the April 1999 murder of Jessica Lall, a celebrity barmaid in a Delhi restaurant, over a quarrel that had allegedly arisen from serving liquor. (PTI)                  
	One hoax, five schools shut    
	After serial blasts, the new threat seems to be serial hoaxes.    
	Five Chennai schools had to abruptly shut down and send their students home after one got a call warning of bombs.    
	The first call came as early as 6.30am at Holy Queen Matriculation school in Chrompet saying a bomb had been planted and would go off any time. Children already inside the campus were herded out and those coming in stopped. But a police check found no truth in the claim.    
	As the word spread, parents of children in four other schools in nearby Pallavaram and Anakapathur panicked. They rushed to the institutions and demanded that the authorities declare a holiday and send children home. In no time, five schools had closed because of one hoax call. (UNI)              
	Rush to secure ancient cradle    
	An outback high on ancient Indian history is turning a hotpot.    
	Kotilingala isnt exactly the place to host an academic conference but a stream of historians and politicians have been creating ripples at the Karimnagar site.    
	The place, said to be sitting on evidence of the Satavahana dynasty (230BC), will go under water once the Sripada Sagar project takes off.     
	A team of historians led by Raja Reddy, Jitendra Babu and Jaikishan has made trips to Kotilingala along with K. Kavitha, TRS boss K. Chandrasekhar Raos daughter.     
	Kavitha heads the Telangana Jagruthi, a TRS affiliate that has held a series of conventions to highlight the need to preserve the heritage sites of the region. Reddy stressed the need to secure the area from the Sagar project, saying Karimnagar was a treasure-trove of historical artefacts. A 1978 excavation had thrown up inscribed coins linked to the Satavahana dynasty founder, Simuka.                  
	Blow for jobs    
	A big step for some teachers, a leap for job-oriented education.    
	The Delhi government recently decided to upgrade part-time vocational teachers, handing them the status of permanent employees.     
	Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely made the announcement, saying the decision reflected the high importance the government attached to vocational training.    
	The Delhi government has remained ahead in providing facilities to teachers, Lovely said.     
	The move is being seen as a shot in the arm for vocational education, which has become popular among youths looking to sign up for job-oriented courses.

The event brings together industry leaders, government officials, experts and regulators. The venue is the Bandra-Kurla Complex. Call 26605550.

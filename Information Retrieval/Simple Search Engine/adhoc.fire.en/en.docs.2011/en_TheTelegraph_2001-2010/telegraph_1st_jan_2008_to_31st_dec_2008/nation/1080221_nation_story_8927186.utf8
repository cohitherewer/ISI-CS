  - Three-day journey back to roots ends in evening          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                 Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam with wife, Veena Brizmohan, in Bodh Gaya. Picture by Manish Bhandari		    
	Patna, Feb. 20: Mauritius prime minister and his family today visited Nalanda and Gaya during his three-day Bihar trip.        
	Nalanda public relations officer Shambhu Nath Jha told The Telegraph: The prime minister landed at the Rajgir helipad at 11.36am and drove straight to Nalanda.         
	Ramgoolam and his family members were accompanied by culture and sports minister Janardhan Singh Sigriwal. The minister took the visiting group to sites across Nalanda and to the archaeological museum, where Ramgoolam stayed till 12.55pm showing great interest in all exhibits and their details.        
	Nalanda ruins have of late witnessed a bevy of VIP tourists with President Pratibha Patil visiting the place last week. Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is smitten with the idea of an international university in Nalanda. He has agreed to be a member of the mentors group with economist Amartya Sen.         
	So far, the Bihar visit has been an emotional one for Ramgoolam. Yesterday he visited his ancestral village (Harigaon) in Ara and announced a welfare package of Rs 1 crore for the hamlet. On the first day of his Bihar tour, Ramgoolam was visibly overwhelmed while inaugurating the statue of his father, Seewosagar Ramgoolam, at Patnas Exhibition Road.         
	Ramgoolam, who has spoken in Bhojpuri in all his meetings, laid stress on strengthening cultural ties with Bihar. He also announced scholarships for two students from Bihar and offered them a chance to study in the University of Mauritius.         
	Not to be left behind, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reciprocated Ramgoolams gesture by flagging off a single-window system to help Mauritius people trace their Bihar links.

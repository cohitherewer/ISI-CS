The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | FBI slow, says CBI
                                                                                                            FBI slow, says CBI

	New Delhi, Feb. 5: CBI chief Vijay Shankar was far from happy today, accusing Pakistan of not co-operating and the FBI of slow investigation in the Kandahar hijack case.        
	The FBI had registered a criminal case because a US national, Jeanne Moore, was on board the hijacked flight.         
	Shankar said that while the CBI had concluded its investigations and secured the convictions of the three men it had arrested, the US agency had failed to complete its probe eight years after the case.        
	The Indian government and the CBI assured and gave full cooperation to the FBI. We shared all our evidence. Their investigation teams visited India more than six times in connection with the investigations, and the CBI rendered them all possible assistance, said Shankar.        
	The CBI director suggested that the agency had done all it could to push the investigations in the US.         
	This important aspect has been taken up at the highest level in the US government and with FBI director Robert Mueller during his visit to India in January 2002. I myself took up the matter, as additional director, in April 2004, for the investigations to be concluded at the earliest to bring Grand Jury indictment against the seven absconding Pakistani accused. The matter was later raised with John S. Pistole, the deputy director of the US agency, when he came to India in November 2006.        
	Shankars most strident criticism was targeted at Pakistan which, he said, continued to shield terrorists and stall cooperation.         
	Seven of the main accused in the case were said to be in that country, as were Masood Azhar, Ahmad Umar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar, the three terrorists released by India to secure the release of the 189 passengers and crew.        
	We have overwhelming evidence that the planning for the hijack took place in Pakistan and the accused are all there. We have taken up the matter through diplomatic channels and through the Interpol. They (Pakistani authorities) have been completely non-cooperative. This is not the only instance where Pakistan is shielding the accused.

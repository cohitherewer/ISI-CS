                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Poll date to dampen Childrens Day spirit
  - Chhattisgarh elections on November 14          SHEENA K.                          Actress Raima Sen at a Childrens Day event. The elections in Chhattisgarh will rob kids of such programmes this year                                        
	Raipur, Oct. 19: Children would miss Chacha Nehru  the first Prime Minister of India  this year in Chhattisgarh. For, the state will go to the polls on Childrens Day.        
	According to the schedule announced by the Election Commission, the first phase of polling in Chhattisgarh would take place on November 14  the day observed as Childrens Day across the country to mark the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru.        
	The second phase of polling will take place in the state on November 20.        
	The decision of the poll panel to conduct election on Childrens Day has come as a big surprise to the education fraternity in the state. About 54 lakh students in the state would miss to remember Chacha Nehru, as the countrys first Prime Minister is fondly called by children.        
	Being a public holiday on the polling day, schools will remain close while most of the government teachers would be engaged on election duty. Even the private schools buildings are converted in polling centres to ensure smooth election.        
	Many schools here preparing to make the Childrens Day a great show postponed the programmes after the election dates were announced yesterday. Besides children, school principals and teachers are disappointed to miss an annual event like this.        
	It sounds astonishing that the state will go to the polls on Childrens Day, said N. Kujur, principal of government higher secondary school here. The Election Commission should have taken the fact into account as no function could now be held to celebrate the birth anniversary of Nehru, he added.         
	Pratibha Rajgour, the principal of a private school, said it would have been better if the polling was held on some other day as the children were enthusiastic with the preparation.         
	Since it is the decision of the poll panel, everyone has to accept, she added.

	Bhubaneswar, April 29: Two weeks after the death of coach Biranchi Das, his wife  Geetanjali Das  took over as the general secretary of the Orissa Judo Association.         
	The decision to nominate her was taken in an emergency meeting convened by the state body on Sunday.         
	We knew his dreams and will certainly work towards meeting them. We will keep up the name of our mentor, said Sivananda Dey, a judoka.         
	Like her husband, Geetanjali, too, has been working for the promotion of judo in the state. I was always associated with the body. I am happy to have been nominated and I hope I will meet expectations, said Geetanjali.        
	Earlier, she worked as the joint secretary of the judo body, besides, working as a coach, national referee and a judge. Geetanjali was a student of National Institute of Sports (Patiala). She has been a part of the profession since 1995.         
	Today, the new association chief made some announcements. We have decided to train at least 100 students for free annually. We will also be taking in an international coach. We aim to take judo to international standards here. After the huge loss, our students are back with new energy and drive to make a difference, she said.        
	After a long time there was the usual rush at the Orissa Judo Association Hall on Monday. Two weeks after Das was brutally gunned downed outside the hall premises, the empty hall saw the presence of a large number of young judokas, who turned up for the nomination ceremony.         
	Not wasting any time, the young widow got down to business and promised a new future to the students and urged them all to remember the dreams of Das. Das is survived by his wife and a three-year-old son.

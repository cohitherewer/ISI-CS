          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, June 2: Gaya district administration has decided to stop the process of dumping waste and debris into the Falgu river flowing through the city, as it is adversely affecting the water quality and level.        
	Falgu remains the only source of water for the half-a-million residents living in 45,000 holdings under the Gaya Municipal Corporation.         
	An estimated 40 per cent of Gaya residents are directly dependent on the Falgu as the Gaya Municipal Corporation pumps out sub-surface water from the river and supplies it to the households through municipal pipes.         
	The remaining 60 per cent of the towns population are indirectly dependent on Falgu and draws water through hand pumps and private pumping machines even if they dont have the municipal connection. Also, the towns watertable is dependent on the sub-surface water of the Falgu.        
	In a letter addressed to the muncipal corporation staff, the Gaya sadar sub-divisional officer, Navneet Ranjan Tiwari, has cautioned the corporation officials against indiscriminate dumping of waste in the Falgu.         
	The letter threatens to take penal action against those who dump municipal waste and debris on the Falgu bed. Confirming the letter, commissioner S.K. Tiwari held an agency, Lodging House Committee, responsible for indiscriminate waste dumping in the Vishnupada area of the town.         
	The municipal corporation was not dumping waste in the Falgu bed, he clamed further. The commissioner added that the corporation dumped the city waste in 25 acres near Naili village. However, he conceded that all municipal waste did not go to the Naili dump  because the approach to the dump yard was not proper.         
	Besides, municipal waste, drain water also flows into the river effecting sub-surface water in the Pita Maheshwar area  a recent test conducted in the PHED lab showed that the sample there contained high amount of nitrate.         
	According to Lalji Prasad, the municipal corporator representing the so-called worst-polluted areas, mere letters would not save Falgu.         
	A task force to effectively implement a ban on waste and debris dumping was required, he said. Prasad also hoped that citizens groups would come forth to protect the Falgu.

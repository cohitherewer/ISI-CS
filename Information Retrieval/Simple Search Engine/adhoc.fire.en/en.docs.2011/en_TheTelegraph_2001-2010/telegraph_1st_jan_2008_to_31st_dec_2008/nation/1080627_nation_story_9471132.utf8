	New Delhi, June 26: Dentist Rajesh Talwar, accused of murdering his daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, will remain in jail as a sessions court today rejected his bail application citing CBI suspicion.          
	Talwars lawyer had argued that the CBI had not found anything to incriminate him. But the CBI said that it was a blind murder case and Talwar continued to be the prime suspect.                   
	London (PTI): A charity group on Thursday accused British retail giant Tesco, which has been mulling an India foray for long, of exploiting workers at a Bangalore garment factory, saying employees are paid only half the minimum wage. War on Want, a group fighting against poverty in developing countries, charged that workers making clothes at the factory for the UK retailer were toiling long hours for as little as Rs 14 an hour.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): The Kalka-Shimla railway in Himachal Pradesh, an engineering feat, and Assams Majuli, the worlds largest mid-river deltaic island, are among 47 global sites that the UN will consider for inclusion in its world heritage list. The Unesco committee will begin a nine-day meeting in Quebec, Canada, from July 2 to consider the nominations, which include 13 natural sites and 34 cultural sites. Both of Indias nominations are in the cultural category.

	Bhubaneswar, June 8: The first thing that I did after I reached the summit was to offer a prayer to Lord Jagannath. Now I would like to sincerely thank all the well-wishers whose prayers brought me back, said Kalpana Dash, the first Oriya woman to conquer Everest, after her arrival here        
	The ill mountaineer reached Bhubaneswar by a flight from Calcutta late last night and was carried by an ambulance to her home in Dhenkanal.         
	At the Biju Patnaik airport, where she landed, family, friends and fans that included hundreds of enthusiasts and government and administration officials, greeted her.         
	When I get well and if I continue to get such support I will try my best to scale more heights, said a tired Kalpana, with tears in her eyes.         
	We have talked with the administration and have been instructed to take care of her, said director of sports Narayan Parasad Das.         
	All medical assistance required by Kalpana would be borne by the state. We will be assisting her in all her future expeditions, said Das.         
	After she gets better, we have plans for a felicitation ceremony in Bhubaneswar, he added.         
	Kalpana returned after weeks of treatment at the Norvic International Hospital at Kathmandu. She was suffering from high altitude syndrome and dehydration. The 38-year-old fell ill soon after reaching the base camp on May 21.         
	When the authorities informed her family, her brother, Pradip Das, travelled to Nepal. Later, as Kalpanas condition deteriorated, she was air lifted from the base camp to the ICU at the Kathmandu hospital.         
	The Indian Embassy of Nepal co-ordinated the procedure. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik reportedly had asked resident commissioner L.N. Gupta to provide all help.        
	Doctors J.P. Jaiswal and Nandita Ghimeri were attending to my needs all the time. I have been asked to take rest till I regain my strength and will be under medication for some time, said Kalpana, still dependent on her wheelchair.         
	She was among 27 climbers who scaled Everest as members of High Altitude Workers of HAD-International Everest Expedition-2008.         
	She led a team of five that included Ryszard Kurdziel from Canada and three Nepalese  Lhakpa Rangdu Sherpa, Kusang Tenzing Sherpa and Ngima Nuru Sherpa.

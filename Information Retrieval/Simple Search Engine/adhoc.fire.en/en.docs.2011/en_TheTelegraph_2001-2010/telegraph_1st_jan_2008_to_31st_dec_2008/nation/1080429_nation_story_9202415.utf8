          M.R. VENKATESH                          People watch the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C-9 blast off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Sriharikota, April 28: India today fired 10 satellites into space in a single mission, coming close to Russias record of 13 simultaneous launches and emerging a major competitor in the multi-billion-dollar space market.        
	Only two of the satellites carried by the polar satellite launch vehicle, PSLV-C9, were Indian. The rest had been built for research by foreign universities, which paid the Indian Space Research Organisation over Rs 2.4 crore for launching them into orbit.        
	G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of Isro which had never before sent out more than four satellites together, was over the moon as he described this mornings more than textbook flight.        
	We have set a record by launching 10 satellites simultaneously, a feat few countries except Russia have achieved, Nair said.        
	He added that the results of the Russian experiment of launching 13 remains unknown to us but Isro has now shown it has mastered the process of multiple launches that needs pinpoint precision to avoid collisions.        
	Our team is so thrilled, they want to get ready for the Chandraayan (the unmanned Moon mission) from tomorrow, Nair added.        
	Space experts said the missions success carried tremendous commercial potential for India, which wants to compete with the US, Russia, China, the Ukraine and the European Space Agency in offering its satellite launch services. Delhi charges 30-40 per cent less than these other countries.        
	The PSLV-C9 lifted off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre here, 90km from Chennai, piercing a cloudy sky at 9.24am and leaving behind a trail of orange and white smoke.        
	Within 14 minutes and 45 seconds, it had ejected the 690kg main payload  the Isro-built remote-sensing Cartosat-2A  from an altitude of 637km.        
	The all-weather satellites camera takes sharp black-and-white pictures of even minuscule objects on Earth, and will help economic planners reinforce the countrys urban and rural infrastructure and manage its land and water resources.        
	Some 45 seconds later, it had placed in orbit the second Indian payload, the 83kg Indian mini-satellite (IMS-1) that will provide technological data.        
	Within 19 minutes and five seconds of lift-off, the mission was complete with the ejection of the eight foreign nano-satellites, which together weighed some 50kg.         
	Officials said ground stations, including one in Mauritius, had begun receiving data from the satellites and that the two Indian satellites were in good health.        
	Well have fantastic pictures coming out with better spatial resolution when the Cartosat-2A camera is switched on two days later, Nair hoped. The mini-satellites cameras come alive tomorrow.        
	The mission had been cleared only around 11pm last night. There were anxious moments as cloud formed near the Andamans, but it was a false alarm.        
	The Rs 120-crore Cartosat-2A has a five-year life span but may be able to continue for two more years, while the Rs 22-crore mini-satellite will last two years. The PSLV itself cost Isro Rs 80 crore.        
	Nair sounded bullish on the Moon mission, saying the date should be in the third quarter of 2008.        
	The mission will put a modest satellite, weighing 500kg, in an elliptical orbit to map the Moons terrain and mineral resources. Within two years of the launch, well have a complete map of the lunar surface, Nair said.        
	PSLV-C9 was the 12th successful PSLV flight from Sriharikota in a row, and launched the 49th and 50th satellites built indigenously by Isro.

	Patna, May 6: RJDs Siwan MP Mohammed Shahabuddin, who faces over 40 criminal cases already, is in fresh trouble.        
	Now, a special court on Siwan jail premises has charged him with illegal arms possession after firearms and cartridges made in Pakistan were recovered from his ancestral house at Pratappur in 2005. The special court has been hearing the illegal arms possession case.        
	The RJD MP is already facing life sentences in three separate cases and is lodged in the Siwan jail.        
	The Pratappur arms case has created flutters in political circles as it suggests that the Siwan MP enjoyed alleged links with the Pakistan underworld.         
	This February, Shahabuddin was charged with poaching endangered animals at Valmiki National Park, Bihars sole tiger reserve. In March 2007, Shahabuddin was convicted for attacking the CPI-MLs Siwan office in 1998.         
	Last May, he was sentenced to life for kidnapping and murdering Chhote Lal Gupta, a CPI-ML worker in 1999.        
	Shahabuddin was concurrently sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for attacking he former Siwan superintendent of police S.K. Singhal some 11 years ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 5km run kills would-be cops
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     5km run kills would-be cops
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, May 3: Three young men have died and scores fallen ill after being made to run 5km in 25 minutes as part of a police recruitment test in sweltering Andhra Pradesh.        
	Despite the casualties over the past week, and a request from the chief ministers office (CMO) to drop the gruelling test, the police recruitment board is continuing with the run.        
	Some 8 lakh youths have applied for 34,000 constables posts and about 5 lakh are yet to appear for the run, being held at centres across the state.        
	On Thursday, when Kantha Rao, 21, collapsed and died in Khammam district, 35 other candidates had to be admitted to hospital across Andhra. Today, the figure was 21 though there were no fatalities.        
	Rights bodies and athletics experts say the run, introduced three years ago by then director-general of police (DGP) P. Ramulu, is brutal and unnecessary.        
	Its an inhuman and impossible task. Only athletes who have practised a minimum three months can do 5km in 25 minutes, said K. Venkat Reddy, director, Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh.        
	Doctors say the temperatures of 42-44C prevailing in the state, four degrees above a normal years, have made it worse. The runs are held after 10am, often in the afternoon.         
	This is a step to ensure that constables are fit, said D. Bhoopathi Babu, inspector-general in charge of police recruitment.        
	But other officers spilled the beans: faced with a flood of applications, the police had devised the test as the easiest way of weeding out most candidates before the real recruitment process began. Only about 30 per cent candidates clear the run.        
	Applications are pouring in  with recommendations from ministers, the Speakers office, even the CMO. What else can we do? an officer said.        
	No one was killed in the previous two years because the run was held in June, when the monsoon lowers the temperature. But this year, there were so many applications that we had to start early, the officer said.        
	Public anger at the deaths had prompted the CMO to ask the police whether such a run was compulsory in any other state or the central police organisations. If not, drop it here, too, the CMO had said.        
	Sources said a few states did have such a provision but hardly ever followed it. They contested the Andhra police claim that the test can ensure fitness in the force.        
	Its a one-off exercise carried out only during recruitment. The police have been dragging their feet on a recommendation by the previous DGP, Swaranjit Sen, to set serving personnel fitness targets and send them on leave if they fail to meet them, a source said.        
	Home minister K. Jana Reddy has asked the police to hold the runs between 5.30am and 9am or after 6pm, and to keep an ambulance and cardiologists on stand-by.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 13: A student of Allahabad University was killed after a campus altercation snowballed into a clash between rival groups which, witnesses said, fought with rods and cycle-chains as the bleeding 20-year-old lay on the ground.        
	University officials said Pankaj Gautam was brutally assaulted this afternoon but the warring groups had no political affiliations. It was group vendetta that led to the killing, a spokesperson said. The deceased received gaping head injuries, said assistant proctor Abhinav Gupta.        
	He said one student, Prabhakar Sahu, suspected to be involved in the fatal attack, had been arrested.        
	Witnesses said the altercation broke out near the Senate Hall and soon turned ugly. The students used rods and cycle-chains, one witness told police.        
	University sources said the rival groups kept fighting even after Gautam had collapsed. The second year undergraduate student was later taken to Swaroop Rani Hospital, about 2km from the university, where he was declared brought dead.        
	As news spread, hundreds of students poured into the street. Several ransacked the hospital and started throwing stones at the police when they came to take the body for post-mortem. They snatched the body from the police and marched down the road in protest. The situation was brought under control after nearly an hour-long battle.

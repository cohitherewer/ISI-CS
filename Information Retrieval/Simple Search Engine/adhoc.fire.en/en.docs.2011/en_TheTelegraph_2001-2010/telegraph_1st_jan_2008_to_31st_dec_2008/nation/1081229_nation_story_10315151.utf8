          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 28: A member of the Orissa State Bar Council has challenged the process of selection and recommendation made by the full court of the high court to the district judge in the Orissa Superior Judicial Service for 2008.         
	In a petition filed in the high court, lawyer Laxmi Narayan Sahoo has questioned the propriety of arbitrarily fixing of cut-off marks in the interview on the ground that it was unreasonable, unconstitutional and contrary to the settled position of law.         
	On April 11, 2008, the registrar-general of the high court had offered 16 posts through an advertisement.         
	About 1,456 candidates appeared for the written examination conducted on July 20. Of them, 22 successful ones were called for interviews on September 27.         
	The full court of the high court conducted the interview and recommended the names of only five, without giving any reason for not filling up the remaining 11 posts from that of the 17 others who faced the interview.         
	The advertisement had categorically specified that the merit list will be prepared on the basis of marks obtained in the written examination and viva-voce, but there shall be no cut off marks in the viva-voce test. The cut-off mark in the written examination was fixed at 60 per cent for general candidates and 50 per cent for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates.         
	Selecting candidates on the basis of minimum qualifying marks in an interview amounts to changing the procedure of selection which is entirely illegal, said Sahoo, who alleged that he had sought his statement of marks secured in the written examination and interview but the deputy registrar-general-cum-information officer had refused to furnish it.

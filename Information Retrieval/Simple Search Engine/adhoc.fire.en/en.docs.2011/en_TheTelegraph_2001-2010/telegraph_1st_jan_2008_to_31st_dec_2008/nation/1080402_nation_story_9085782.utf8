                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Info babus deaf to MP queries    
	Extracting details from an information commission can be a tough task, even for an MP, M.V. Mysura Reddy has realised.    
	The Rajya Sabha member, who under the Right to Information Act wanted to know the basic functioning of state information commissions, has failed to get proper replies to any of his questions. Reddy had asked the commissions for details on appeals filed and disposed of by them and the number of cases that went in favour of or against the applicants.    
	The stipulated time for replying to an RTI application is 30 days, but Reddy said 18 of the 26 state information commissions did not bother to acknowledge his application. Those that did, came up with absurd, unsatisfactory answers. The Kerala and Goa state commissions cited hands and resource crunch. The Bengal and Himachal Pradesh commissions gave vague replies that were not related to the questions at all. Even in his home state, Andhra Pradesh, the MP failed to get any reply. If this is their response to a member of Parliament, I wonder what their response would be to a common man, Reddy said.    
	Ads go mobile on LCD    
	A young man standing with an LCD screen in a shopping mall or an airport may become a common sight soon.    
	Interactive nomadic advertising may take off in the country with Canadas Pixman in association with Mass Media Makers (MMM). Clients are looking for out-of-the-box advertising ideas, Pixman vice-president Cristina Romero said.    
	We can target people wherever we want, she said.    
	A backpack weighing around 8kg with various accessories, like a DVD player and a computer, will be carried by the man and the output of the accessory will be on an LCD screen, she said. The interactivity comes in by giving Internet connectivity to the computer.     
	Pixman has tied up with MMM and is in an advanced stage of talks with leading telecom manufacturers to implement the strategy in India. Pravin Chudasama of MMM said the people may see nomadic advertising at Mumbais malls soon.    
	Drunk jawan gets HC relief    
	Delhi High Court has come to the aid of an ITBP jawan who lost his job almost eight years ago for being chronically alcoholic.    
	The court bench ruled that Mukesh Chand Bhat be reinstated as the decision to dismiss him was uncalled for.    
	Although it accepted the report of a medical board, which said Bhat was suffering from chronic alcohol dependence syndrome, the bench said documents found that he was not put on a de-addiction programme.    
	The jawan, who was undergoing treatment at the unit where he was posted in Kashmir, should have been sent to a specialised de-addiction centre, the bench said. Bhat was a patient of alcoholic syndrome, for whom taking alcohol was an irresistible desire.     
	But instead. of adopting a humane approach... it is adding insult to the injury by charging him for offence, the court said.        
	Smoking alert    
	Delhi police have asked all restaurants to put up no smoking boards outside their doors, else a cop may soon knock and demand a fine of Rs 500.    
	It is mandatory for the owners to display this signboard in the premises or otherwise they will have to face the punishment, a senior police officer said.    
	The warning to restaurants, hotels, guest houses and cinemas was issued under the Delhi Prohibition of Smoking and Non-Smokers Health Protection Act, 1996. Section 10 of the act says the owner or manager of any public place should display a board prominently, both on and outside the premises, stating it is a no smoking zone and that smoking is an offence.    
	Mumbai: Roll up your sleeves for a beginners pottery course. Bilmat Zeramicz, the citys only exclusive gallery for ceramic art, is teaching basic hand-building and wheel techniques along with elementary glazing through April. The gallery is in south Mumbais Fort.

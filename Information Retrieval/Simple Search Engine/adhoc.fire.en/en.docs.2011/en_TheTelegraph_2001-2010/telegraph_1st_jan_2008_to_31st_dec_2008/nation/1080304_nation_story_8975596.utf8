     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, March 3: Residents of a Munger village last evening lynched a 40-year-old man, who accidentally shot dead a five-year-old.
    
	The incident took place around 5pm at Shampur-Santhali, a tribal village under Kharagpur police station, around 225km from here.
    
	Forty-year-old Chaitanya Soren had come to his in-laws place at Shampur-Santhali. He opened fire from his country-made pistol in an inebriated state, and the bullet hit Babulal, who was playing in a field with other children. Babulal died on the spot. 
    
	As soon the news of the boys death spread, irate villagers armed with wooden sticks, stones and blunt iron rods surrounded the residence of Chaitanyas in-laws  where he had come for a short visit. 
    
	In a fit of rage the villagers forced Chaitanya out of home and beat him up mercilessly, while his relatives fled the spot in panic. Chaitanya, hit mainly in stomach and chest, died on the spot.
    
	Kharagpur police station officer in charge Vishwanath Prasad reached the village with his team after an hour of the incident even as the village is barely 4km away from his office.
    
	Munger superintendent of police Shalin told The Telegraph: It was a case of rage. Prima facie investigation suggests that the entire village was a part of the killing. The police have recovered a country-made pistol, four rounds of live cartridges and an empty cartridge from the spot.
    
	The recent cases of mob justice is unfortunate. But this case looks more like an act of revenge because of the death of the child, the superintendent of police added.
    
	This is the sixth case of mob violence and justice in less than a year.

	Srinagar, Aug. 18: Hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani today opened a front against the Indian media with a sweeping allegation that all of them were part of New Delhis war machine.        
	They all come here on behalf of the Indian establishment to sabotage the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination, Geelani said, addressing a huge gathering this afternoon.         
	Geelanis attack angered even local journalists. This is an outrageous allegation and could threaten the lives of journalists in such a surcharged atmosphere, the editor of a Srinagar-based daily said.         
	Worried that he may have alienated the entire media, Geelani was quick to offer a clarification. Speaking at a news conference within hours of the rally, Geelani said: My charge is only aimed at owners of newspapers and television channels from India, I did not intend to target any individuals.

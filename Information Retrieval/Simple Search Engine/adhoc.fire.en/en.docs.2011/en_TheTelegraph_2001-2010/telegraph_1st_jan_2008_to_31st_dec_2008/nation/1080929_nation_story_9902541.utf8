          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 28: A supposedly unscheduled one-to-one between Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam Singh Yadav at Lucknow airport last evening has sparked talk of a thaw in Congress-Samajwadi Party relations, grown frosty after a breakdown in seat-sharing talks.         
	The 25-minute meeting at the airport -- followed by talks on the 40-minute flight, according to both partys sources -- may pave the way for a fresh seat-sharing dialogue in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha elections, sources said.         
	Sonia was on her way back to Delhi after a two-day visit to her constituency, Rae Bareli. Mulayam was scheduled to board the same flight.        
	When Mulayam learnt that Sonia was in the VIP lounge, he immediately rushed to her, a Congress source said.         
	Sonias aide Rajendra Matto and her representative in Rae Bareli, K.L. Sharma, were with her but they left as soon as Mulayam arrived.        
	Congress sources did not deny the possibility of an ice-breaker, but said Sonia was unlikely to have discussed seat-sharing at a public place. The Congress president, they said, would step in at the last stage.        
	They claimed the meeting was not scheduled.        
	Samajwadi leaders said last evenings talks were positive. Some of them, however, said the meeting was pre-planned and that Sonia had been waiting for Mulayam in the VIP lounge.        
	The airport chat has come as a morale-booster for many Congress and Samajwadi leaders who were fretting as the new allies relations again got strained.        
	The Congress has been demanding 20 to 22 of the states 80 Lok Sabha seats but the Samajwadis have not been willing to cede more than 15.        
	Sources said the Congress was demanding seats that have sitting Samajwadi MPs, such as Pratapgarh, Rampur, Farrukhabad and Padrauna. The Congress now holds nine Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh said the Congress was demanding more seats than it could win. He alleged that two Congress ministers at the Centre, both of them from Uttar Pradesh, were trying to sabotage the talks.        
	A few days ago, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi too had had an unscheduled meeting with Mulayams son and Samajwadi youth wing chief Akhilesh Yadav. They had gone to Deoria to review the flood situation in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

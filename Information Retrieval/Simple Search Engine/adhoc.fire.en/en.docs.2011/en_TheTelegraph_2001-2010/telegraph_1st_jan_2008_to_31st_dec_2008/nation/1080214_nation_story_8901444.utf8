The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia EC notice
                                                                                                               Sonia EC notice
                                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Election Commission today decided to issue a notice to Sonia Gandhi on a disqualification petition, reports our legal correspondent.         
	Election commissioner Navin Chawla struck the only dissenting note in the majority decision, suggesting that only a letter be issued to the Congress chief.         
	But he was overruled as there was no such legal provision. The poll panel can only issue legal notices.        
	However, the commission will have to seek more details on the matter from the foreign ministry as was recommended by the two election commissioners. Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy had not agreed with the view.        
	The President had forwarded the petition against Sonia (in picture) receiving a Belgian state honour to the poll panel.         
	The complainant, an advocate from Kochi, had argued that the Congress chief should be disqualified from Parliament as accepting the honour amounted to owing allegiance to the Belgian Constitution.        
	Belgium had decided to confer the Order of Leopold, the countrys second highest civilian award, on Sonia in 2006 for her constructive nationalism and efforts to foster a tolerant, multicultural society in India.

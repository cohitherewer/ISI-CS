The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Special quota to douse Gujjar fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Special quota to douse Gujjar fire
  - Poll-bound Raje woos upper castes, too        OUR BUREAU                          Raje and Bainsla in Jaipur on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                        
	Jaipur/New Delhi, June 18: After 27 days and 39 deaths, the Rajasthan government today gave in to the Gujjars by awarding them additional 5 per cent reservation under a special category.         
	The Vasundhara Raje regime, under fire for allowing the agitation to snowball, also announced a separate quota of 14 per cent for upper castes in an election year.        
	Rajasthan now has a total reservation of 68 per cent, among the highest in the country, which could face legal scrutiny as it is way above the 50 per cent cap set by the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu has quotas of 69 per cent.        
	Panachand Jain, former judge of Rajasthan High Courts Jodhpur bench, said: This move can definitely be challenged in court. How have they given 5 per cent to Gujjars under a special category? They have to compromise somewhere and naturally it will be done from the general category. Moreover, such orders have to be properly notified first by the Assembly. So far, Rajasthan has had total quotas of 49 per cent  16 per cent for SCs, 12 per cent for STs and 21 per cent for OBCs.        
	The 5 per cent reservation to the Gujjar, Banjara, Raika and the Gadiya Luhar communities will be granted under a new category that identifies them as the most backward and deprived among the other backward classes, without disturbing the SC/ST/OBC list. It will cover government jobs and educational institutions.         
	An upbeat K.S. Bainsla, who spearheaded the campaign demanding Scheduled Tribe status for the Gujjars, said he would call off the agitation once he reaches Pilupura in Bayana, the nerve-centre of the movement, tomorrow. At least 39 people have died in police firing and clashes since the protests erupted last month.        
	At a joint press conference in Jaipur, Bainsla thanked chief minister Raje and hoped there would be no such protests in future.         
	Raje sought to allay fears of other groups, especially the dominant Meenas, who were opposed to Gujjars inclusion among STs, saying the special category would not affect other groups. The state has around 4 million Gujjars.        
	The Meenas didnt appear perturbed. Raguhbir Singh Meena, MLA from Sarada in Udaipur, said: What was the need to make public suffer and waste time and money if the government intended to give this quota ultimately?        
	The chief minister, however, sprang a surprise and announced an additional 14 per cent reservation for the most backward and deprived among general classes, which would include Brahmins, Vaisyas and Kayasthas.         
	Raje said the decision followed an interim report presented today by the Economically Backward Commission. The panel was set up in 2007 to study the needs and welfare measures for the economically backward classes.         
	Sources said the speed with which the government accepted the suggestion of the panel indicated the BJPs anxiety to ward off a possible backlash from the upper castes, seen as the partys prime vote bank.         
	The BJP central leadership had worked on the quota formula, meant to ensure the Gujjars didnt compete with the Meenas for the quota pie. We have managed to resolve one of the worst crises without creating ground for fresh social hostilities, a party leader said.        
	 Reports that Raje cared little for Gujjars  Jats and Meenas formed her core support  had created an impression that the BJP could pursue a divisive agenda for narrow political gains. L.K. Advani, the partys prime ministerial candidate, and other senior leaders compelled the state leadership to take a broader perspective.         
	However, uncertainty remained over the letter that is to be sent to the Centre recommending ST status for Gujjars. Both sides have signed the letter but it is yet to be despatched.

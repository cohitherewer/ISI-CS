	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 7: The state government would formulate guidelines for peripheral development and undertake a study on industry-local area relation to facilitate release of a World Bank loan of around $250 million.        
	This was disclosed after a meeting between a World Bank team and state government top officials, chaired by development commissioner R.N. Bohidar here this afternoon.        
	The visit of the World Bank team here was to discuss the sanction of third tranche Orissa Socio-Economic Development Loan. So far, the state has availed two parts of loan from the bank  the first one to get itself out of severe financial crunch and second one to achieve economic growth.         
	The third tranche is intended for achieving inclusive growth, Bohidar said, adding that a loan assistance of around $250 million was expected this time.        
	A concept note is being prepared by the finance department mentioning the purpose of availing the loan and its mode of utilisation, he said. We are here on an exploratory trip to take stock of Orissas economy, said Alena, one of the members of the team. Right now, we are taking stock of Orissas economy and reform programmes, she said.        
	Alena said the government did not submit any specific proposal. We will be happy to respond to any proposal, she added.        
	The team wanted to know about utilisation of previous bank loans and what the government was going to do with the third part, said Bohidar. The government officials said the funds would be utilised for development of backward and peripheral areas.         
	We said we are going to formulate a guideline for the peripheral development and also institute a study on industry-local area relation, he said. Issues like development of infrastructure, including roads and electricity, were also discussed at length.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Oct. 5: Karnataka today took a Tata Motors team on a recce of the plot where the company could relocate its Nano project.        
	Government officials escorted MD Ravi Kant and his colleagues to Dharwads Belur industrial area, 10km from the town on the Bangalore-Pune national highway, to check out 770 acres  500 acres in one plot and 270 acres a few metres away. They also suggested locations about half-a-km away for the remaining 230 acres and took the team there for a look.        
	All the land is part of an industrial estate and belongs to the government.        
	The officials briefed the team about infrastructure plans, the availability of power and water and connectivity to ports and highways.         
	Since Singur erupted, B.S. Yeddyurappas BJP government had been among the first to offer to house the Nano. A long list of promises was made to Kant when he visited Bangalore on September 18.        
	Kant last night met the chief minister, who assured him the state would go the extra mile to meet the demand for 1,000 acres of contiguous land, sources said.        
	Yeddyurappa told Kant that water and power requirements would be met before the plant was commissioned. He said port connectivity at Karwar, 175km away, was being upgraded to berth larger ships and to handle more container traffic.        
	The chief minister said the feasibility of setting up a rail line to the area and linking it to the nearby Dharwad-Miraj line was being explored.        
	The only area of concern is that we have 770 acres in close proximity, including a big plot of 500 acres. The rest of the land is a little away but within the industrial area, industries minister Murugesh Nirani said.        
	The Tatas are very keen to have 1,000 acres in one piece. We have given them various options, including locating a part of the vendor park in the 900 acres already allotted to them.        
	The Tatas have two 450-acre projects running in Dharwad: Telcon, which manufactures construction equipment, and Tata Motors, from where Marco Polo buses are expected to roll out next month.        
	Nirani said Kant had promised to bring group chairman Ratan Tata to Bangalore at the earliest as the company was actively considering the offer.        
	Karnataka has offered to waive stamp duty on land registration and tax breaks for three to five years. The Centre is expected to waive VAT for 18-21 years.        
	The government had initially offered two locations: Bidadi, 30km from Bangalore, and Dharwad, 430km away. The company was keen on Dharwad because of its proximity to Pune and because they already have two units there.         
	The Tatas were also keen on Dharwad as they already had two units there, each on 450 acres, a source said.

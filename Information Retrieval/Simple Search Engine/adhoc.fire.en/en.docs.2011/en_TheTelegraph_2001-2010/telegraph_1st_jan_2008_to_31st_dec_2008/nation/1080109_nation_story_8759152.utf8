The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | B-schools fail result test
                                                                                                            B-schools fail result test
  - Students on edge as single website gets clogged        OUR BUREAU                          A class in progress at IIM Ahmedabad                                        
	New Delhi/Calcutta, Jan. 8: The IIMs new strategy for smoother delivery of CAT results bellyflopped today, prolonging the painful wait for candidates already on edge for months.        
	The Indian Institutes of Management released the much-awaited Common Admission Test results at 3pm but access to the only web portal that published them  www.catiim.in  got clogged almost immediately.        
	The leading B-schools had given the students a text-messaging option, too. It delivered incomplete results.        
	I have been at my terminal from noon. I expected the past few months tension to be released today; now it appears I shall have to wait longer, Kapil Yadav, a Delhi University English student, said at 8pm.        
	By then the IIMs were slowly waking up to the reality that they might have to return to a tried-and-tested system of result delivery that had been abandoned in favour of a method considered more student-friendly.        
	The six IIMs compete for Indias top management students and till last year posted the results of all those who made their lists on their individual websites. That, however, meant the students had to scour through six websites.        
	This year, the institutes decided to simplify things by posting all the results on a single website with a larger bandwidth  a broader entry gate  than any of the six individual websites.        
	It wasnt broad enough.        
	If the single website doesnt become accessible by tomorrow, well have to go back to the earlier system and put the results out on our own website, said Ashis Bhattacharya, admission-in-charge at IIM Calcutta.        
	The results portal was built to inform the candidate about his overall percentile score, as well as his marks in individual subjects. Most important, the website was to tell the aspirant which, if any, of the IIMs he had cleared.        
	With the portal inaccessible, many turned to the SMS option. The reply did contain the candidates scores but was silent on which IIMs he or she may have cleared, institute officials conceded.        
	Lokesh Batra, an IIT Kharagpur graduate now working with a Calcutta software firm, said his SMS reply showed a 99.5 percentile score. That was all it said.        
	For a person with work experience, a 99.5 percentile score should definitely fetch calls from some of the IIMs. The institutes should sort this chaos out soon, said Aarti Saxena, deputy director, TIME coaching classes.        
	Batra should qualify for IIM Calcutta. The institute at Joka has declared 98.86 as the cut-off percentile for the general category, 85.12 as that for the Schedule Castes, 81.85 for the Schedule Tribes and 78.83 for the physically challenged.

	Anti-deal pulpit: Jantar Mantar    
	The MPs held forth in the House, the decibel-beaters did so outside.    
	As the UPA fought for its survival in Parliament on July 22, civilian groups not aligned to the Left or the BJP protested the Indo-US nuclear deal a kilometre away, signalling a growing debate on the controversial pact.     
	Led by the Lok Raj Sangathan, a civil rights group that consists of engineers, doctors, executives, teachers and industrial workers, the activists accused the government of pushing the deal without adequate public debate.     
	They more than matched L.K. Advani and Mohammed Salims aggression in slamming the accord in the House. Their pulpit was Jantar Mantar, the activists almost seemed to be competing with the MPs in raising a din.     
	Shouting slogans against the decision of the UPA to go ahead with the agreement, the activists demanded amendments to the Constitution requiring the government to get parliamentary approval before signing international pacts. At present, the executive, the Union cabinet, need not seek such sanction before signing such accords with the governments of other countries.        
	Tuskers battle enemy within    
	Elephants battling poachers, trains and disease seem to have a new enemy  assailants within the herd.    
	A 55-year old camp elephant gored by another a month ago in Coimbatores Annamalai Tiger Reserve died last week, defeating a team of vets who tried to save him.    
	Pallavan had abdominal injuries so severe that a part of his intestine was protruding from the body. Doctors had to fix of a giant belt around its belly, forest officials said.    
	Since he was attacked, Pallavan had been kept under medical observation at the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary at Pollachi, in Coimbatore district. Experts from Kerala and Chennai had been brought in to save him. A pall of gloom descended on the sanctuary after his death. Officials buried him at a camp within the reserve.    
	Show time for old airport    
	The new airport is for business, the old for spectacles.    
	The Centre appears to have agreed to utilise the old Hyderabad airport for general aviation services and air shows.    
	The airport at Begumpet has been closed to regular flights since March 23 after the spanking new Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad took wing.    
	Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy has written to Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel suggesting the Begumpet hub be used for national emergencies and air shows. The proposal has received in-principle approval.    
	Several international groups that organise such shows are said to have evinced interest in the idea. These include Farnborough International, a subsidiary of the UKs Aerospace Trade Association, Aerospace Australia and the French Aerospace Industries Association.    
	Reddy said the new airport needed to be marketed as one of Asias best aviation destinations and a transit hub between Europe and China. (PTI)        
	Speed control    
	Karnataka has reaffirmed its pledge again to speed governors, though it is a bone of contention with transport firms.    
	The states advocate-general told the Supreme Court recently that the directions of Karnataka High Court, which made the devices mandatory, were being followed. The devices have been installed in all new vehicles. The old ones will have them by end-September.    
	Karnataka truck owners have long complained the governors put them at a disadvantage against other states, whose vehicles dont have such speed-curbing mechanisms.

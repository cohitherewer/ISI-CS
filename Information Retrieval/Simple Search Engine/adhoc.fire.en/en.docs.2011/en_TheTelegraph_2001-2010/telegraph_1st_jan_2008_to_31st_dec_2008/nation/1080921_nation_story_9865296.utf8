          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Kamlesh hasnt cooked for seven days at her home in Gaffar Market, numbed by the loss of eight loved ones in last Saturdays bombings.        
	Miles away in Jamianagar, Zaid Ahmad is still chilled to the bone by the thought of what might have been  he could have lost family members to bullets yesterday morning.        
	Police, the 21-year-old says, took on a group of alleged militants without warning just as residents were leaving for work or sending their children to school.        
	We were right here. I live next door. No one came to warn us to get out of the house. Any bullet from either side could have hit me or my family, he says angrily.        
	Anger and bewilderment unite the families of the blast victims and Jamianagar residents, but their targets are different, showing up a divide.        
	This isnt the work of God. My innocent grandchild wasnt supposed to die this way, cries Basanti, who was holding two-year-old Kisan to her chest, singing a lullaby, when the Gaffar Market bomb went off.         
	The boy died in her arms, his blood splattering her face and clothes.        
	What had he done? People get sick and die, thats acceptable, but suddenly out of nowhere if one loses their loved ones, then you cannot forget it, says Meera, Kisans mother.        
	What have we done? Zaid has the same question, for the police.         
	Dont we have the right to live peacefully? You cannot treat us as dirt just because we are Muslims. No one from this locality would have helped them escape if they were terrorists; then why were we left to fend for ourselves and not given protection?        
	Like Zaid, Kamlesh, 25, too saw terror from yards away. Her home in a cluster of poorly built buildings, where she is recovering from shrapnel wounds, is just 50 metres from the Gaffar market blast site. Local shopkeepers have been providing her with food this past one week.        
	I have a six-year-old daughter. I dont know what I shall do, where I shall go. They have given us money, but who will use it and for what? All the male members of my family are dead. I just wish we had died with them, she says.        
	The ones who were spared, after cowering for an hour to the sound of firing around their homes yesterday, stared back with frightened faces from the narrow lanes of Jamianagar. Adult men shrank back when approached.        
	The locality, which boasts the Jamia Millia Islamia campus with its parks and ponds, is also a labyrinth of cramped colonies packed with claustrophobic apartments, uncovered drains and potholed roads.        
	Usually buzzing with activity at its all-night henna stalls and shops selling Lucknow chikan and Pakistani suits, the area known as Mini Chandni Chowk wore a forlorn look today. People got together for namaaz and then retreated into their homes.        
	Its incidents like these that give a locality a bad name. Now Jamianagar will be remembered only for this encounter, says Mohammad Idris, who runs the Super Fine Dry Cleaners yards from Batla House, the scene of the shootout.        
	Yes, I am afraid and perhaps will always be, he adds. Its not every day that you hear gunshots and see hundreds of policemen.

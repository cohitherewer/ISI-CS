	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Nano or not, Maruti Suzuki India is unwilling to touch the ultra-low-cost segment.
    
	Maruti, the countrys largest carmaker, has also decided not to cut the price of its bread-and-butter flagship M 800. 
    
	Shinzo Nakanishi, the managing director of Maruti Suzuki India, told The Telegraph: We are not planning to come out with a car in this (Rs 1 lakh) price segment. For us, safety and environmental issues are very important.
    
	He added: The Maruti 800 at its current price is the cheapest we can offer right now and there is no room for us to discount this price.
    
	Asked if the Rs 1-lakh car would have any impact, he said: Some impact, maybe. We have to see how this 1 lakh car fares in terms of performance and then make a comment.
    
	Nakanishi added that our thinking is that a consumer who is looking to buy a Maruti 800 or Alto will never settle for the Tata car because of the difference in value propositions.
    
	The company said the impact of the Tata car would be felt more by two-wheelers, and every Nano owner would be a potential buyer of Maruti cars.
    
	But Maruti has conceded that it no longer hoped to maintain a stranglehold on the market.

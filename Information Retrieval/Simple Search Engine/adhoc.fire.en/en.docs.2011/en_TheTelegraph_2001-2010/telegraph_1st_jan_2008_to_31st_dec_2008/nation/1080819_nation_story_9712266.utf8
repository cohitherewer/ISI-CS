	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Australians can start licking their lips in anticipation of juicy offerings from India, of a different kind from Sreesanths long hops and Zaheer Khans half volleys.        
	Indian mangoes are to be imported to Australia from next year, with Canberra flashing the green light following recommendations from an expert body dealing with import risks.        
	The fruits, however, must fulfil certain quarantine conditions, Australias acting high commissioner, David Holly, announced here today.        
	India grows about 13 million tonnes of mangoes every year  more than half the worlds produce  but exports just 1 per cent of the yield.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, April 21: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar appeared headed for a showdown with the Congress after he told Parliament today the government couldnt take new responsibilities of waiving farm loans till commitments made in the budget were implemented.        
	The NCP leaders statement, many politicians said, was an indirect criticism of Congress MP Rahul Gandhis demand that the loan waivers be extended to farmers who owned more than two hectares in dry areas.        
	The waiver package, announced in the 2008-09 budget, had set a limit of two hectares for outstanding farm loans to be completely forgiven to help farmers come out of a crippling debt trap that has forced many to end their lives. Later, about a month back, Rahul had told Parliament the land ceiling should be based on productivity.        
	In the Lok Sabha today, Pawar said the government was not in a position to take new responsibilities till the present commitments  the Rs 60,000-crore farm loan waiver package  were implemented.         
	The NCP boss said the governments priority was to implement the loan waiver among 81 per cent of farmers who owned less than two hectares.        
	Let us first implement the farm loan waiver scheme presented in the budget and see the results, he said in reply to supplementary questions. The government, he added, had no scheme to help farmers who had taken loans from moneylenders.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said the waiver was part of finance minister P. Chidambarams budget speech. During the discussions, various viewpoints were given. We have to see what he finally announces, he said in response to Pawars statement.        
	Congress sources said the food and agriculture minister was playing politics with the issue and trying to show who was the boss as far as the waivers were concerned.        
	Ministry sources, however, said Pawars reply had been prepared by officials and no political message should be read into it.        
	The Congress had projected the waiver announcement as Sonia Gandhis gift to the aam aadmi  the common man  and sought to use it as a counter against inflation. The Congress chief even said the government would keep its promise.         
	NCP sources had never concealed their resentment at the Congresss over-drive to claim the waiver move as its own.        
	The Congress-Pawar equation, never smooth, took a turn for the worse over the issue of food shortage. Congress sources privately blamed the NCP chief for messing up things and suggested that Pawar, who also heads the Indian cricket board, ought to farm out his ministry to a more conscientious person.        
	The sources said even the Prime Minister, who used to have a good rapport with Pawar, was said to be miffed at the NCP leaders lack of interest and commitment to his ministry.

                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Opportunity for aspiring directors    
	After singers hitting the right chord and the jackpot, a contest for those who cant wait to don the directors hat.    
	Aspiring filmmakers now have the chance that those with other skills in show business have long had  a platform to showcase their talent before a grand jury.    
	Osians Cinefan will hold a six-day workshop where the winners of the hunt in Delhi will present their works. The event will be held alongside its annual film festival in July.     
	Applicants will need to send a short film  which could be of either one minute or five minutes  directed by them on the subject Everyday Journeys. Those keen on scriptwriting can send a 3,500-4,000 word story.     
	An independently selected committee will winnow down the applicants to 30 for the final workshop. Entries must be submitted by May 10 (see www.osians.com). Wannabe filmmakers will have the opportunity to meet established directors and script-writers.     
	There contenders will also get the chance to watch some films that will be screened at the festival.        
	Marriage scales Great Wall    
	Ramalingam probably hasnt seen the Great Wall. But with his marriage, he crossed a barrier much bigger.    
	The youth from Cuddaore swapped wedding vows with a Chinese lady whom he first met at a religious camp.     
	The ceremony was low-key and one of the simplest that Vadalur, his hometown famous for the shrine of Tamil saint Ramalingaswami, had seen in recent months.    
	The only bright spots in the non-frills Sanmarga-style wedding were the shades on bride Saprina Lingyan Chus traditional Tamil silk saree.     
	Chu was a regular at spiritual lectures organised by a local trust to help propagate Ramalingaswamis teachings.     
	Land scurry for water    
	Take over land to pay for water  that is what the Andhra government is accused of doing without scruples.    
	Such is the rush to raise money for Jalayagnam, the states multi-crore irrigation scheme, that authorities are taking over land apparently lying unused with central agencies and public sector undertakings. The aim is to put the plots to commercial use and generate cash. An unofficial April deadline has been set to wrap up the process.    
	We have been conducting an audit (survey) to identify unutilised land given to government and private agencies, says V. Seshadri, the joint collector of Ranga Reddy, one of the districts bordering Hyderabad.    
	But the land takeovers have ruffled too many feathers. We have plans to construct buildings for research. Our land was given to us decades ago for expansion, said V.P. Dimri, director of the National Geophysical Research Institute, whose 200 acres could be acquired.     
	Airport Authority of India almost had its plot in Gachibowli, a suburb teeming with software firms, taken away before courts clamped a stay.        
	Blueline blight    
	Delhis speed demons are on the prowl again.    
	Fresh police figures show Blueline buses have run over 13 people in the two months of this year after last years bloody trail that claimed 128 lives and prompted a clampdown. In 2006, the casualty count had been put at 109.    
	The authorities appear helpless in dealing with the errant drivers. One such culprit who knocked down a factory worker in Jahangirpuri this week escaped after the accident.     
	Mumbai: This Tuesday, you can catch Naari, an exhibition of painting of recent works by Ananya Banerjee, Bharti Jain, Gauri Seth and Chaitali Mukherjee at Legacy Art Gallery. The venue is located at Maker Chamber V, Nariman Point. The show is on till Feb. 28.

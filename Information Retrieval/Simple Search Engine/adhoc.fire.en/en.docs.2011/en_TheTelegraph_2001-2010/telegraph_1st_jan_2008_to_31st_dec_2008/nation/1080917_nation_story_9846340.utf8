The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panel push for new terror law
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Panel push for new terror law
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              (From top) Four sketches of two Barakhamba suspects, a sketch of the Gaffar Market suspect                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: A government-appointed panel today stressed the need for a comprehensive anti-terror legislation, in sharp contrast with the Centres stand that existing laws were enough to tackle the menace.        
	A comprehensive and effective legal framework to deal with all aspects of terrorism needs to be enacted, the second administrative reforms commission said in its eighth report titled Combating Terrorism.        
	Releasing the report three days after the Delhi blasts, commission chairman M. Veerappa Moily said the new legislation should have tough provisions and adequate safeguards to prevent misuse.        
	The timing of the report appears to suggest the Centre is coming round to the view that a tough law is necessary. The BJP has long been clamouring for a law like the Prevention of Anti-Terrorism Act.        
	The report has recommended that a legal provision to deal with terror could be incorporated in a separate chapter in the National Security Act, 1980. No person accused of an offence punishable under the NSA should be released on bail, it said.        
	Moily refuted the charge that the UPA government was soft on terror and said the demand by BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Gujarat for a Maharashtra-type anti-terror law was not the answer.        
	On the BJP demand for a law like the Prevention of Terror Act, Moily said it was not a comprehensive measure and could be misused.        
	The report suggested a federal agency to investigate terrorist offences. It said a specialised division should be created within the CBI to deal with terror cases. It also recommended that exclusive fast-track courts be set up for trial of terror-related cases.        
	The panel has suggested changes in financial intelligence too, proposing measures to block the flow of funds for terrorist activities.        
	Suspect sketches        
	Delhi police today released two sketches of each of the two suspects behind the Barakhamba Road blast and one of the suspect in the Gaffar Market blast. Police are hopeful that two of these sketches would reveal the whereabouts of Qayamuddin Kapadia and Tauqir, the prime suspects in the Delhi and Gujarat blasts.

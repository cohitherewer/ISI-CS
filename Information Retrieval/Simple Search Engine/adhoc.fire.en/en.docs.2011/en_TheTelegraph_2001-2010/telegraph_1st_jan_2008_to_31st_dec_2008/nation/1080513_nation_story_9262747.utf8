The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP sends signal to minorities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP sends signal to minorities
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          BS Yeddyurappa                                  
	On November 12, 2007, B.S. Yeddyurappa was sworn in chief minister of Karnataka, becoming the first BJP head of government in a southern state. Under an arrangement with H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular), the BJP had supported H.D. Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowdas son, as chief minister for 20 months.        
	Now, it was the turn of the JD(S) to return the favour and support Yeddyurappa for 20 months. But barely a week after he was sworn in, the JD(S) withdrew support.         
	The BJPs face in the ongoing Karnataka Assembly polls, Yeddyurappa, is set for a tough battle in his pocket borough Shikaripura in Shimoga district. On May 16, he takes on S. Bangarappa, another former chief minister who is contesting on a Samajwadi Party ticket but is supported by the Congress and the JD(S).         
	Yeddyurappa campaigns from 9am to 10pm but says he never misses his morning walk.         
	In an interview to The Telegraph at his Shikaripura residence exactly six months after he first became chief minister, Yeddyurappa rejected any possibility of a post-poll alliance with the JD(S) and blamed Sonia Gandhi for the mid-term elections. He exuded confidence that the BJP would get a majority in the elections and outlined his plans for the state.         
	He would follow Narendra Modis model of development if he became chief minister, he said, but promised to take Muslims and other minorities along with him.         
	Excerpts from the interview:         
	Q: From municipal councillor to chief minister, Shikaripura has seen your political career evolve. What does Shikaripura mean to you?         
	A: Shikaripura has given me everything I have today. I am an ordinary farmers son, born in Mandya district. But for four decades, people here have elected me, first as a municipal councillor and then as an MLA. I owe all that I have to them.         
	Q: The BJP has projected a chief ministerial candidate, while the Congress has not. Is this helping the BJP?         
	A: One hundred per cent. Theirs is a cricket team without a captain. How do they expect people to support them? They say they will choose a captain after the match (laughs). The truth is that they are unable to decide among themselves whom to choose as chief minister.         
	Q: Although the BJP may do better than the last Assembly elections, a hung Assembly appears possible, some would say even likely.         
	A: Let me tell you, there is absolutely no doubt that the BJP will get a majority on its own. We may get as many as 140 seats (out of a total Assembly strength of 224).         
	Q: In case there is a hung Assembly, are you open to any alliance with the JD(S)?         
	A: I repeat, there will be no hung Assembly. But under no circumstances can we have any alliance with the JD(S). How can we? They cheated they are cheaters.         
	Q: Does that episode, when the JD(S) completed its 20 months in power but pulled out when your term came, still hurt?         
	A: Absolutely. They betrayed and it is not just me who feels hurt, the people of Karnataka feel they were cheated.         
	Q: Who do you hold responsible for that fiasco?         
	A: Both the Congress and the JD(S). Both saw the impact that I made with my budgets as finance minister and were scared of what might happen when I became CM. The orders (to withdraw support) came from Sonia Gandhi.         
	Q: There are some who say that the BJP plans to convert Karnataka, like Gujarat, into a Hindutva laboratory. Will you look to emulate the model followed by the party in Gujarat?         
	A: What is wrong with Gujarats development pattern? Even the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has lauded the state governments performance there. In terms of infrastructure, other development, Gujarat has done wonderfully under BJP rule.         
	Q: But in terms of minorities, their concerns?         
	A: I promise there will be a senior Muslim minister in my cabinet. In the 20 months that the BJP shared power with the JD(S) in Karnataka, there was not a single riot. Before I became finance minister, the Congress had a minority development fund of Rs 15 crore.         
	As FM, I raised the fund to Rs 123 crore.         
	Q: Can you assure the minorities that you will take care of their concerns?         
	A: I will take them along. I will take all the people of Karnataka with me. One hundred per cent.         
	Q: S.M. Krishna (former Congress chief minister of Karnataka) is known as the man under whom Karnataka developed into the IT hub of India. What is B.S. Yeddyurappas vision for Karnataka?         
	A: He (Krishna) focused only on Bangalore. There are so many farmers fleeing from their villages to the cities. Rural Karnataka needs a lot of attention. At the same time, urban centres will also be developed further.

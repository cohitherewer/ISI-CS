	Kasauli, April 13: A fighter pilot died in a road-rage clash with a middle-aged lawyer, who stabbed him in the thigh with what was probably a pocket-knife, police said.        
	Flight lieutenant Anubhav Rao, 24, died of excessive bleeding from slashed veins on Friday night, while being driven from Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh to the Command Hospital near Chandigarh  a two-hour journey.        
	The young officer had just begun a vacation in the mountains with three friends on Friday when they ran into lawyer Hari Dutt Tanwar, 40, who was driving with his family, the police said.        
	Anubhav, posted at Ambala air force station in Haryana, was on his way to Shimla with fellow flight lieutenant Samir Yadav and two local friends, Ashish Chaudhary and Shamkar Deep. Midway, they changed their mind and decided to stop at Kasauli, a hill resort, police sources said.        
	Their Honda City had reached Garkhal, 3km from Kasauli, when the young men saw Tanwars Hyundai Accent parked on the wrong side of the road.        
	It isnt clear if the Accent was blocking their way or the young men acted out of high spirits, but they began admonishing the lawyer, police sources here said.        
	An angry Tanwar, who practises at Kasauli court, told them off and they left  but only to wait for him on the highway 1km away. As the lawyer passed them on his way home, a car chase began.        
	At Mashobra, 1km from Kasauli, the young men caught up with Tanwar and a quarrel broke out.        
	Suddenly the lawyer attacked Anubhav with a sharp weapon, said S.R. Rana, additional superintendent of police, Solan.        
	Anubhavs friends took him to the small military hospital in Kasauli, which referred him to the Command Hospital at Chandi Mandir. He was declared dead on arrival.        
	The lawyer was arrested. Today, he was remanded to three days police custody, Rana said. The police are yet to find the weapon.        
	We condole with the unfortunate and untimely demise of one of our fine and promising officers, said the air force spokesman, Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani, in Delhi.        
	He said the air force was co-operating with Himachal Pradesh police to bring Tanwar to justice.        
	Anubhavs body was handed over to his family, who live in Hissar, Haryana. They were too shocked to speak to the media today.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 28: The Orissa government today woke up to the price rise in the state by deciding to launch a special drive against hoarders and revising a licence system for traders of essential commodities.        
	Licensing for traders of essential commodities will be reintroduced in the state and deviant hoarders will be dealt with a strong hand, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik, at a meeting to review the price situation today.         
	For the revival of the licensing system, the concerned district collectors will enforce control order in all the districts from today. Under this order, retail and wholesale dealers will have to obtain licence from the government and would be required to show existing stock and sold amount every day, failing which their licences will be cancelled, said food supply and consumer welfare minister Manmohan Samal.         
	It was also decided to intensify anti-hoarding operation by setting up special squads to conduct raids on hoarders and activate public distribution system from May 1.         
	This special drive will continue for the next two months.         
	District collectors have been asked to keep a close watch over the price situation and food supply position and report to the government.         
	At the state level, the food supply and consumer welfare secretary will conduct the review and report to the development commissioner, who in turn, will monitor the situation and apprise the government.         
	The chief minister said he had urged the Centre for higher allocation of wheat, rice, pulses and edible oil for Orissa. He has requested the Centre to supply 2kg of pulses and 1 litre of edible oil at subsidised prices to each ration-card holder and also raise the wheat quota.         
	Earlier on April 10, the chief minister had written to Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar asking for an additional rice quota of 65,000 tonnes. The Centres response is awaited and Naveen said he would send a reminder to Pawar.

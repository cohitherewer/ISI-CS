                                                                                                            The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Broken: Cops New Year jinx    
	Finally, policemen in Antop Hill can let their hair down on New Years Eve. For, the jinx seems to have broken.    
	Till last year, December 31 has claimed at least one cop from this central Mumbai police station since 2004.    
	Constable Tulsidas Raimane, 35, was the first victim. He died in a road accident. The next year, another road crash killed sub-inspector B.D. Patil, 42. In 2006, Prakash Kakasaheb Pawar, 46, met his end when he was hit by a train while chasing a robber.     
	This year, too, the policemen sat with their fingers crossed. The most scared were the constables as they are the ones who have to be in the frontline dealing with drunk revellers and speeding drivers besides criminals on the prowl.    
	It can be any one of us. We know one of us is going to die for sure. Those who have their weekly off on that day are lucky. The rest of us are very scared, a constable had said before the magic hour struck.        
	NRI lessons for doctors    
	If the countrys medical students are in a mood to study  veering off the protest path that they seem to be frequenting a bit too much lately  there are lessons coming all the way from the US.     
	Twenty-six years after leaving India, US-based lung specialist Hemant Patel is engaged in a process that he hopes will improve medical education and healthcare in India.    
	Patel, who heads the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, is part of a delegation that was in the capital recently to share knowledge about the best practices in six areas of medicine.     
	The associations triangular partnership with the Medical Council of India and the Indian Medical Association will focus on diabetes, heart diseases, mental health, asthma and allergy, HIV and emergency medical services.    
	The meeting is expected to pave the way for a series of disease-specific recommendations covering prevention, diagnosis and treatment.     
	This is a two-way exchange of ideas. India has a wealth of knowledge that we can learn from, too, Patel said.     
	Shed khaki, get khadi    
	The men in khaki now want to be in khadi.     
	With Assembly elections round the corner, a series of policemen are announcing retirement to jump on to the political bandwagon.     
	Already three policemen have opted for premature retirement. While one is an IG-rank officer, the other two are assistant commissioners of police.     
	H.T. Sangliana, an officer from Mizoram, had shown the way. He is currently the BJPs Bangalore North MP. There are others who have risen to the level of state minister.     
	So what prompts the lawkeepers to want to turn lawmakers?     
	Its the pro-people image they cultivate. Many times, there have been protests if policemen are transferred from a certain police station or even a district. This is when their persona takes over and they feel they are bigger than the department, smirks a senior officer.     
	Now, one can only pray that these cops clean up the stables of corruption rather than strengthen the criminal-police-politician nexus.        
	Job shower    
	Jobs came pouring into the capital last week. Web portal Naukri.com held a fair, offering 2,000 jobs under one roof.    
	Thirty companies participated in the event, including ING Vaisya Insurance, ICICI Securities, Dell International Services and Intercontinental Hotels Group.     
	 quot;Delhi is a vibrant job market. While jobs abound, the challenge lies in finding the best job in the shortest time. The Naukri.com job fair is a platform for jobseekers and an instant solution for companies, said Hitesh Oberoi, the portals chief operating officer.   
	Delhi: The 10th Bharat Rang Mahotsav is on to mark the golden jubilee of the National School of Drama. The 18-day festival will feature 76 plays, including productions from Afghanistan, China, Japan, Poland and Switzerland. The Northeast will bring a bouquet of 10 plays.

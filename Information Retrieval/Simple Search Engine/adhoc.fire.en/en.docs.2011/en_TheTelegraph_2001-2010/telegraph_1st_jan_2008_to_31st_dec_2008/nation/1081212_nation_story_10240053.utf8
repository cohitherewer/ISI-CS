	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, which once planned an exclusive Muslim political outfit, has in an afterthought decided to float a party pitched as a grand coalition of Dalits, OBCs, Adivasis and Muslims, reports our special correspondent.        
	The announcement could be made next month.        
	Jamaat-e-Islami president Amir Jalaluddin Umari said the focus of the new party would be to counter communal fascism. It will work for the cause of genuine democracy... for social justice for all marginalised communities such as Dalits, Christians, Sikhs as well as Muslims.

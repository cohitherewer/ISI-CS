	Panaji, April 13 (PTI): Some vital organs of Scarlett Keeling, the British teenager murdered in Goa, were allegedly found missing during an autopsy on her body in the UK.        
	Vikram Varma, the lawyer representing Scarletts mother Fiona Mckeown, said: Fiona is disturbed about this when she came to know.         
	The coroners court in Devonshire found that during the second-level post-mortem, Scarletts stomach, kidneys and uterus were missing.        
	Two autopsies were conducted on Scarletts body in Goa Medical College and Hospital by two sets of doctors.        
	Scarletts bruised corpse was found at Anjuna beach on February 18.        
	The letter for formal confirmation on the facts of missing body parts has been sent by Fiona to the coroners office in Devonshire, Varma said.        
	The lawyer said he would also take up the matter with Goa authorities.

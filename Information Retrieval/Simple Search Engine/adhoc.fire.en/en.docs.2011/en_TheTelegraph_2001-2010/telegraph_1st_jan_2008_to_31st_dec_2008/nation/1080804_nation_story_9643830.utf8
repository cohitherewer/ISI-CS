          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shimla, Aug. 3: Army and police patrol has been intensified on the 486km Manali-Leh road following a threat from the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji).         
	Weve been alerted by the Intelligence Bureau about the Huji threat. We are not seeing any immediate threat but were taking precautions and anti-bomb squads have been deployed in Shimla, Dharamsala and Mandi, Ashwani Kumar, the Himachal Pradesh police chief who has now taken over as CBI director, said last week.        
	Intelligence reports say the terrorists may use trek routes to destroy the Manali-Leh road.        
	The route, known as the lifeline of the Indian Army, was used to transport the ammunition and other supplies during the Kargil conflict.         
	Although no terrorist activity was reported earlier on this route, the present threat should not be ignored as the terrorists can destroy the route and bridges of military importance, said Lt Gen. (retd) Bhupender Singh Thakur. Thakur was the additional director-general, military operations, during the Kargil conflict.         
	Himachal chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said: Were ready to face any threat and the help of the army will be sought whenever necessary. Besides patrolling the Manali-Leh route, the police have been asked to review security arrangements in other sensitive areas.         
	The police are patrolling sensitive parts of the Manali-Leh route and attention is being paid to the 17 important bridges on the route, especially the Taandi and Daarcha bridges, Anurag Garg, deputy inspector-general, Himachal police, said.         
	The superintendents of police of Lahaul and Spiti and Kullu districts have been asked to deploy more police to meet any threat, he added.        
	The state government has also sounded a high alert in Chamba, Una, Solan, Shimla and Sirmour districts, which share borders with Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.         
	It has also asked security agencies to keep an eye on the Sarchu border, Chansarinala-Khangsar and Mayad Valley borders, as well as the trek routes connecting Himachal to Kashmir.         
	The threat is likely to affect the tourism industry. Although the domestic tourist season is almost over, foreigners throng the Valley in large numbers during this time for treks.         
	Media reports about the Huji threat can affect the tourism industry. The foreign tourists are worried, Tek Chand, the president of the Manali Hotels Association, said.

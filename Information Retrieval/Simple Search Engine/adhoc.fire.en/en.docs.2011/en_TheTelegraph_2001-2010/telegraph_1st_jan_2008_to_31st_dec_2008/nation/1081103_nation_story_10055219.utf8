          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pragya: Terror Tussle                           
	Bhopal, Nov. 2: The Congress today called for a thorough probe into the activities of all religious outfits spreading terror, in a signal to the Sangh parivar that it wasnt only targeting sadhvi Pragya Singh and others linked to the outfit.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said his party would welcome the quick disposal of the mercy petition of Afzal Guru, facing death for the 2001 attack on Parliament.        
	He clarified that at no point had any Congress leader sought to defend Afzal.        
	In the run-up to the November 27 Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls, the ruling BJP has been constantly accusing the Congress-led Centre of targeting the sadhvi, suspected of having a hand in the Malegaon blasts, and other Sangh affiliates while being soft on Muslim fundamentalist organisations.        
	Digvijay denied the BJPs allegation that the UPA government was dithering in Afzals case. The matter is with the President. There are over two dozen mercy petitions pending, including those filed by people charged with involvement in Rajiv Gandhis assassination, he said.         
	It is his (Afzals) constitutional right to appeal. There are bureaucratic and legal processes involved.        
	Digvijay, however, questioned the BJPs move to defend Pragya and other suspects in the Malegaon blasts. What is the propriety of a minister calling on relatives of the accused and sending legal aid? he asked in a reference to state public works minister Kailash Vijayvargiyas visit to a suspects home.        
	Digvijay said it was worth probing how and why Indore keeps cropping up in several terror-related incidents.         
	He recalled that Haryana police had arrested some people in Indore for alleged involvement in the 2007 Samjhauta Express blasts near Panipat that left 67 dead. The police had found that the cover of the suitcase in which the bombs were planted had been stitched in Indore.        
	Months after that, some newspapers used to pack explosives for the Ajmer Sharif bombing were traced to Indore and Ujjain, the Congress leader said.         
	Digvijay claimed the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government would lose the state polls as it had failed to keep its promises to the people and indulged in corruption.

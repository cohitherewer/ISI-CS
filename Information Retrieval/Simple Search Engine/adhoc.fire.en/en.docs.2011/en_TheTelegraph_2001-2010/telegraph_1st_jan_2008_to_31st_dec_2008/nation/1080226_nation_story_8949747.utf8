          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: St Stephens College acting principal Reverend Valson Thampu today approached Delhi High Court against the minority education panels declaration of his appointment as illegal.        
	Delhi University, too, has said Thampus recently acquired PhD in theology does not qualify him for holding the post of principal in its colleges.        
	Thampu today claimed the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions move violated the Constitution. St Stephens accused the commission  which said the appointment violated the norms of Delhi University and the University Grants Commission  of encroaching on its minority status.         
	The court issued notices to the commission and DU but did not grant a stay on the minority panels order.        
	At the hearing today, the DU counsel said St Stephens advertisement for a new principal had violated the university norms. The court responded by asking the college to comply with DU regulations.

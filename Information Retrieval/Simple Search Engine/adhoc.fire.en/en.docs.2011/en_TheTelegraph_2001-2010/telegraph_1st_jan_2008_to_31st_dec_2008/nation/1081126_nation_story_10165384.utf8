          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Mohammed Rahil Ata-ur-Rehman Sheikh, a key suspect in the July 2006 serial train blasts, has been detained in the UK on an Interpol lookout notice, Mumbai police said today.         
	Sheikh, 31, who was in Birmingham when seven bombs killed 187 people and injured over 800 on July 11, 2006, had been evading the police ever since. He is alleged to have helped send funds for the bombings.         
	Mumbai police commissioner Hassan Gafoor said this evening he had a formal letter from Interpol confirming Sheikh had been detained in Manchester. We have received the letter from the CBI, Delhi, which represents India in the Interpol. We will provide them with the necessary evidence against Sheikh to enable them to begin the extradition process, Gafoor said.         
	A former Simi activist, Sheikh was alleged to have been in touch with Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Azam Cheema alias Babaji, identified as the main handler of the terror operation for the ISI.         
	Rahil played a key role in arranging the funds. He was a Simi operative and was part of the same syndicate, additional director-general (railways) K.P. Raghuvanshi said.        
	Raghuvanshi was chief of the anti-terror squad (ATS) in his last posting, and headed the train blasts probe.         
	A resident of the Naya Nagar neighbourhood at Mira Road in Thane district, Sheikh is the eldest of three brothers  all of whom have been named in the train blasts.         
	Faisal, 30, and Muzammil, 22, who was a software engineer in Bangalore, have already been arrested by the ATS.         
	Sheikh worked closely with Mohammed Rizwan Daware, a Pune youth who funnelled funds through hawala channels, the ATS officers said. Around Rs 60 lakh was routed to Faisal, who allegedly supervised the assembling and planting of bombs in six trains, they said.         
	Sheikhs name had surfaced in at least three investigations before the July 11, 2006, probe. He and Zahibuddin Ansari were identified as the key suspects in the Aurangabad arms haul in May 2006. He was also named a key operative in the attempted bombing of an Ahmedabad-Mumbai train.

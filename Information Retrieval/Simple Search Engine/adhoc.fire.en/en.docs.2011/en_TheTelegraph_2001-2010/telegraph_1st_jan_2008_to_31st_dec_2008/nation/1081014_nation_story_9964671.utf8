          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 13: Acrimony has once again surfaced in the ruling NDA with a section of BJP ministers openly accusing a raw deal to them by the big brother JD(U).        
	Peeved about the manhandling of his son and daughter-in-law recently by the police, public health engineering minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey went to the extent of offering his resignation at the BJPs core committee meeting today. Then one can easily imagine the plight of the common people, he said.         
	Choubey is not alone in expressing his anguish. Urban development minister Bhola Singh and the JD(U) MLA from Chapra, Rampravesh Rai, have been spitting venom against each other for the past two weeks. Rai alleged that Bhola takes bribes even from the MLAs. Some BJP leaders also alleged that the Nitish Kumar government had not been consulting them in carrying out welfare work for the minority communities.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          File picture of Mansur Ali         
	Patna, March 10: Chief minister Nitish Kumars plans of encouraging one India by inviting people from other states to study and work in Bihar has received a jolt with the disappearance of a Bengal youth in Bhagalpur.         
	Mansur Ali (21), who was pursuing BA (geography) at Murarka College in Sultanganj under Bhagalpurs Tilka Manjhi University, around 225km from Patna, has been missing from the town since January 9, 2008.         
	Ali had been staying in Sultanganj for the past two years. His family spoke to him around 6.30pm on January 9 last.         
	A resident of Maheshnayanganj under Bhagwantola police station of Murshidabad, Ali went missing from a lodge at Sultanganj, about 22km from the district town of Bhagalpur. Ali had been staying in Iqbal Lodge at Moazzem Chowk of Habibpur on the banks of Ganga. A missing report was lodged at Habibpur police station on January 31.         
	That was converted into an FIR on March 1. The family went to the police after waiting for his return for almost three weeks. The police are clueless about Alis whereabouts so far. Nor, has the family received any ransom call.         
	Alis mother Farida Bewa and elder brother Mohammed Faruk Azam today came to Patna to request chief minister Nitish Kumar to expedite the investigation process.         
	The two could not meet Nitish because the Assembly was in session, but the secretariat received and forwarded their application to the Bhagalpur police. The two met home secretary Afzal Amanullah.         
	Bhagalpur superintendent of police Jitendra Singh Gangwar said: We are seeking statements of the young mans mobile phone conversation around the time he went missing.        
	Habibpur police station in charge G.P. Thakur said: The progress now depends on finding out the persons with whom Ali spoke before he went missing. His fellow-mates at the lodge said Ali would often return to Murshidabad after collecting class notes.        
	Thakur added that Alis roommate was not in Sultanganj when the young man went missing. A friend from Sultanganj saw Ali last on January 8 while his mother called him up on January 9 and spoke with him. As of now, we suspect no foul play, said the officer.         
	Farida, a schoolteacher in Murshidabad, said: I came to Patna after all efforts failed. I lost my husband Abul Kashem in 1995 and now with my son missing, I am shocked.

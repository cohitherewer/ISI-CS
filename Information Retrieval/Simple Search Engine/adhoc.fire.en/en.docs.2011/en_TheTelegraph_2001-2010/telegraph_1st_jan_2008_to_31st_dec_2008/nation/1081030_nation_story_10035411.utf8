          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: A priest, who had managed to escape attackers during the Kandhamal riots, died at a private hospital in Chennai last night where he was being operated on for injuries sustained in the clash.        
	Priests are making preparations to receive the body of Fr Bernard Digal (48) that would land here tomorrow morning. Fr Digal was attacked during the riots that gripped the district two months ago following the killing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23.        
	Fr Digal was the treasurer of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar archdiocese and had been on a visit to the Sankarakhole parish when the violence broke out on August 24. He was shifted to Mumbai after the initial treatment at Kalinga Hospital in Bhubaneswar. He had suffered multiple fractures on his body besides serious head injury and had to be subsequently taken to Chennai for advanced treatment.        
	Fr Digal had told close associates to get his last rites done at his native place in Raikia. Bhubaneswar vicar general Fr Joseph Kalathil said: We will receive the body tomorrow around 11am.        
	Fr Digal apparently developed health complications because of internal injuries that he had received earlier and was admitted to St Thomas Hospital in Chennai where he was operated by the doctors to remove blood clotting from his brain. However, his condition further deteriorated and he slipped into coma. His lungs had collapsed and he passed away at 9.30pm yesterday, said Fr Kalathil.

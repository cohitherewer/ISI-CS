          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, June 15: The father has taken a wife, but it was the son who said amen.        
	The son the father, that is.        
	Doesnt make sense, does it?        
	To Antony Kannampuzha, at least, it did, even though he may have had to address his son as Father.        
	Father Andrea Kannampuzha solemnised the marriage of his father, Antony, 64, and Brigit, the 59-year-old bride, at St Sebastians church in Chalakudy near Thrissur yesterday in the presence of a select group of relatives.        
	But what made Antony tie the knot again so late in life? Not that theres any law against marrying late.        
	Solitude in old age is worse than jail, said the happy groom, who had been lonely since his first wife Rita died a few years ago.        
	His eldest son, Andrea, had become a priest. His younger sons had finished their studies and taken up jobs in the Gulf, leaving him in the care of their wives.        
	Still, the elderly widower was all right as long as his daughters-in-law were there with him. But then both went back to their homes to care for their ageing parents. Antony was left all alone.        
	So it was I who mooted the idea of another marriage, he said.        
	Yesterday, Brigit, dressed in a white sari and light pink blouse, and Antony, the eligible bachelor, rode up to the church and waited to be ushered to the altar.        
	Waiting for them at the altar was Andrea.        
	The priest blessed the couple and pronounced them man and wife. Let no man put asunder what God has united, he said, ending the ceremony.        
	How did it feel blessing his father and his future mother?        
	Andrea was not available for comment, but the groom didnt mind answering a few earthly queries.        
	To him, it was nothing short of divine intervention. Even if it meant calling his son Father.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Jan. 14: Hockey is passing through a tough phase in the state. 
    
	After the Orissa Steelers semi-final defeat in Premier Hockey League, the players and the officials of Orissa Hockey Association (OHA) have got involved in a verbal duel.
    
	The secretary of Orissa Hockey Association (OHA), Pratap Satpathy, ignited the war of words. The debate intensified after former India captain Dilip Tirkey alleged last week in a news conference that the man lacked sincerity. 
    
	Defending himself from allegations he faced after Orissa Steelers defeat, Tirkey fired the salvo at the OHA secretary. 
    
	Apparently shocked over the Steelers exit, Satpathy had said: Tirkey did not commit himself totally to his game. He lacked sincerity and occupied his place in team despite being unfit and backed out from the tie-breaker in the semi-final in the last moment. 
    
	The secretary also said that defender William Xalxo did not perform up to the expectation.
    
	Retaliating to the criticism, Tirkey alleged in the news conference that the secretary did not accept suggestions offered by senior players or the captain and selected players as per his whims and fancies. 
    
	The hockey official also replaced coach A.K. Bansal for Ramesh Pathania even as seniors wished the former to continue. Tirkey, an international defender, bared his heart out before the newspersons last week. 
    
	As the controversy continued, the hockey associations joint secretary Pranab Kishore Patnaik addressed a news conference yesterday marked by the absence of Satpathy and tried to give his boss a clean chit. 
    
	Patnaik, on his part, chose to lash out at Prabodh Tirkey, a senior member of the state hockey team, for issuing unwarranted statements while passing the buck on to the Indian Hockey Federation.

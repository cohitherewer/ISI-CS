  - Party takes hint after PM refuses Amar demand for judicial probe         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                              Manmohan Singh      
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: The Congress has decided to put a lid on the Jamianagar encounter and given a subtle hint to leaders to stop raising questions about the official version of the incident.        
	The unstated diktat came after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rejected a demand from Amar Singh for a judicial probe into the September 19 shootout in the Delhi neighbourhood that followed the serial blasts. The Samajwadi Party general secretary had called on the Prime Minister on Thursday.        
	According to sources privy to their discussion, the Prime Minister said there was no need for an independent probe when a police inquiry was underway. It might undermine the polices morale at a time they were combating terrorism across the country, he is reported to have told Amar.        
	Congress leaders construed this as a subtle hint to sceptics  even within the party  who, over the past two weeks, have been asking for answers to a list of doubts and questions drawn up after interacting with Muslims of Jamianagar and outside.        
	Congress leaders Salman Khurshid, Kapil Sibal and Digvijay Singh had called on the Prime Minister sometime ago after a nudge from party president Sonia Gandhi to convey their apprehensions over the political fallout of the shootout and their desire for a judicial probe.        
	Congress spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily today echoed the Prime Minister. There were certain concerns and fears, which are for the police to investigate. A judicial inquiry is not on in a terror attack. Terrorism has to be treated on its merit but while handling it, care should be taken not to victimise any community and innocent persons.        
	The Prime Ministers refusal had Amar piping down his demand. If a judicial probe is not possible, the government should consider setting up a committee of eminent persons to look into the misgivings about the encounter, he told reporters yesterday.         
	The Congress is eyeing the minority vote-bank in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, but sources said the opposing perceptions of the encounter would polarise the polity to such an extent that eventually when we campaign, we will be forced to take sides.        
	Based on feedback from places as far afield as Jamianagar in Delhi, Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, the cradle of several terror suspects, and Dhule in Maharashtra, where Muslims were recently attacked by alleged Bajrang Dal activists and policemen, the sources said the community saw every police action  provoked or justified  as an excess.

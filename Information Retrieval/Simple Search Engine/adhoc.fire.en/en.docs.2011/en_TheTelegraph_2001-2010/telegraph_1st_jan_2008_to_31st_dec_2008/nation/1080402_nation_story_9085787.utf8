	Ranchi, April 1: Police gunned down eight Naxalites after a three-hour fight in the light of their night-vision bombs in the Makhatu forests of Garhwa district.        
	A self-styled sub-zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist), Basant Yadav, two area commanders Lalanji and Rajendraji, and a woman member, Chotki, were among the rebels who fell to the police bullets on Monday midnight.        
	The rest of the gang beat a retreat, leaving behind a self-loading rifle, four .303 rifles, four .315 rifles, a double-barrel gun, a country-made pistol, 50kg gelatine sticks and 400 rounds of ammunition.        
	Sources said the night-vision bombs  para bombs used to illuminate an area  had been of great help to the police.         
	They made it relatively easy for us to identify targets and take aim. Also, the Naxalites could not take advantage of the darkness, a policeman from Garhwa said.        
	The Maoists opened fire moments after the police intercepted them at a checkpost near the forest, 200km from Ranchi, around 12.45am.         
	A group of around 20 rebels was heading to Rangpura village from Khatwa More on a tractor when the police stopped them for a routine security check. They immediately opened fire, state police spokesperson R.K. Mallick said.        
	After a fierce gun battle that lasted almost till dawn, the eight Naxalites lay dead.        
	In the first half-hour, there was continuous exchange of fire. Later, it became intermittent  a shot from one side was followed by a reply from the other. Finally, the firing stopped around 3.30am, an officer from Garhwa said.        
	Had the rebels not fled, the firing would have continued, the officer added.         
	Director-general of police V.D. Ram, who visited the spot this morning, has declared a cash reward for the policemen who took part in the operation.

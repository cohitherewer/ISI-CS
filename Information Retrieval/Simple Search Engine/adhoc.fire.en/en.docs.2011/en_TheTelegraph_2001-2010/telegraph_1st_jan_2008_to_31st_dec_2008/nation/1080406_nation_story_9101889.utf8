          MUZAFFAR RAINA                        Survey support                          
	Srinagar, April 5: Kashmirs dead have found a voice.         
	The first extensive survey by an association of parents, looking for their children who disappeared during the militancy of the last 18 years, has documented nearly 1,000 nameless graves in three pockets of north Kashmirs Baramulla district.         
	An additional thousand graves have been found carrying nameplates, which describe them as foreign militants killed in encounters with security forces.         
	These 2,000 men have been buried as foreign militants but the association claims they could contain the secret behind the mysterious disappearances of Kashmiri youths.        
	This could be just the tip of an iceberg, said Khurram Parvez, an office-bearer of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons, which has published a report called Facts Under Ground, the first of its kind.        
	We believe such graveyards are present across the length and breadth of the state at places like Gurez, Ganderbal and Lolab, said Khurram.         
	The revelations have come 13 months after the state government took the lid off a fake encounter scam in which five innocent Kashmiris were killed and passed off as foreign militants by security forces for rewards and promotions. Many police officers, including senior superintendent H.R. Parihar, were arrested and are facing trial.         
	The association claims there are 8,000 to 10,000 people in the state who have been victims of enforced disappearances.         
	The official figures have varied from a few hundred to 4,000, most of whom have allegedly crossed over the Line of Control to receive arms training.

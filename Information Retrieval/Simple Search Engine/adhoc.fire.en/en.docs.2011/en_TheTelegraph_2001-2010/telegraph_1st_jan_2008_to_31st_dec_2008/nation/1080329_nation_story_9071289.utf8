          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 28: A man accused of molestation died in a Nalanda jail today fuelling mob fury on the woman who had levelled the charge.        
	The police arrested one Devendra Paswan (60) on March 25 from Adda Par village under Soh Sarai police station in Nalanda district in response to a written complaint lodged by one Biran Devi (35) of the same village. Biran Devi had complained that Paswan had tried to molest her and outrage her modesty. The Nalanda civil court had then forwarded Paswan to judicial custody.         
	Soon after jail officers informed the family of Paswans death, the members barged into Biran Devis house and beat her up. Police, however, rescued Biran and brought her to Soh Sarai station.         
	But, the irate members, along with villagers, attacked the police station. Superintendent of police (Nalanda) Amit Kumar confirmed the incident. He said additional forces had been deployed.        
	The situation is in control now, he added.

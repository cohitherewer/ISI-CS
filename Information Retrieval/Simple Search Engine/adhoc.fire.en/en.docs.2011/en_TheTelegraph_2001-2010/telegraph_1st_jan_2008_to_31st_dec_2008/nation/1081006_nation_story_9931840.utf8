          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 5: In a brute display of khaki power, a policeman manhandled a young woman near a shopping complex on the busy Frazer Road this afternoon.        
	However, little did the erring cop know that Surabhi (25) happened to be the daughter-in-law of public health engineering minister Ashwini Choubey of the BJP.        
	Surabhi later said: As soon as I get down from our car, the policeman came to me asking to take the car away. CM ka movement hai (The chief ministers cavalcade has to pass through the road).        
	My husband, Prince alias Aviral Choubey, was at the wheels, said Surabhi. He was negotiating the car to park at a proper place. But the policeman was not ready to give even a second and caught hold of my wrist. He slapped me when I raised an alarm, she said. Surabhis father and mother were also sitting in the car. Surabhi and Prince married in May.         
	The passers-by blocked the traffic in front of the crowded shopping complex demanding immediate arrest of the policeman when they came to know about the manhandling of a woman.         
	Later, chief minister Nitish Kumar  who was scheduled to pass through the Frazer Road to attend a minority welfare department programme at SK Memorial Hall near the Gandhi Maidan  took another route after he learnt about the incident. DSP Amar Singh said that an FIR had been registered against the policemen in question.

          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          Colonel Jojan Thomas with his family                                  
	Bangalore, Aug. 23: The lingering ring of the phone told Beena Thomas that it was a long-distance call, probably from Kashmir where her husband Colonel Jojan Thomas was posted.         
	The call was from Kashmir, but Jojan wasnt on the other end of the line. It was a stranger telling Beena that her husband would never call again  he had died fighting militants in the Valley.        
	The voice also informed Beena today that it had taken Jojans colleagues more than seven hours to find his body in the dense forests of Machchil where the encounter had taken place.         
	Beena and her children  Meghna and Philomen  had spoken to Jojan two days ago. Today, they were preparing to receive his body at Bangalore airport.         
	He was here on a months leave and left only on August 9. The memories are haunting me, Meghna said as she fought to hold back tears.         
	The 19-year-old has just completed her basic flying training in the Philippines. Her brother studies in Class V.        
	For Jojan, the son of Captain P.I. Thomas, the army was always the only career option. One of his brothers is an officer in the navy.         
	After Jojan was promoted as colonel last year, he was sent to Kashmir where he commanded a quick-reaction team of the Rashtriya Rifles.         
	Col Thomas K. Jacob, who had met Jojan weeks ago, said he had a long way to go and was one of the brightest officers in the force.         
	It was a Sunday when we met up with some friends, he said. Thomas was a very determined person and would stop at nothing. Having known him closely, I would say that he liked to accomplish any task given to him. He was full of initiatives and had the tenacity to succeed.         
	At the familys Manekshaw Enclave flat off M.G. Road, Jojans uncle Abraham Kurien is busy organising details of his funeral planned for Monday.         
	Its a bad time for the family. I cannot believe it as he was here and left only on August 9 to join his unit in Kashmir. It is very tragic.        
	Kurien recalled that he had asked his nephew when he would be back. Not so soon, Jojan had replied.

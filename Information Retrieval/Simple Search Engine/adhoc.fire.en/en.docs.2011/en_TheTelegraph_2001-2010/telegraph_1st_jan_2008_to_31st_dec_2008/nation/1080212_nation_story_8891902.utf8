	Mumbai, Feb. 11: Sanjay Dutt today married Maanyata, possibly for the third time, at a low-decibel ceremony in a friends house but his sisters Priya and Namrata were missing.        
	Dressed in a cream sherwani and maroon dupatta matching with his brides cream sari with maroon zari border, the 48-year-old star betrayed no signs of unease about hitching up with the woman his sisters are apparently not too fond of.        
	I am a happy man. I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for being so positive about this. I remember telling you all that I would inform you when I got married and I have kept my promise, Sanjay said after the noon ceremony conducted according to Hindu rituals.        
	More than the wedding -reports say the two had a registry marriage in Goa on February 7 and a private ceremony last November at their Bandra home - the talking point today was the rift between the siblings that is now in the open.        
	Priya, who had run from pillar to post to get bail for Sanjay in the Bombay blasts case last year, looked shocked and shaken when asked why she had not gone for the wedding.        
	We werent even invited. Its thanks to the media that I now know that Sanjay is married. I dont even know where the ceremony is taking place. I wish them all the best and a happy married life, she said.        
	Asked if she had a problem with Maanyata, she told PTI: Sanjay is a grown-up man and I dont think it is a matter of acceptance or not. Its a matter of wishing the very best for each other in the family.        
	Sources said the actor had drifted from his sisters after they disapproved of his intimacy with the 32-year-old Maanyata, a small-time item girl earlier married to one Mairaj Rehman who got into trouble with the law for sending obscene text messages to Bollywood starlets.        
	Sanjays daughter Trishala is also apparently uncomfortable about Maanyatas hold on Sanjay. The star broke up with long-time friend Sanjay Gupta and pulled out of a production house they jointly launched after he began dating her.        
	This mornings ceremony was held at the Versova home of Pradeep, one of Sanjays friends. Some others - Bunty Walia, Suniel Shetty, Nitin Manmohan and Yusuf Nulwalla - were there, all dressed in white kurta-pyjama and identical pink dupattas.        
	We are not going out anywhere because I am shooting for EMI at the moment. We are going to think about all that later, Sanjay said after the ceremony, exchanging a quick glance with his bride.        
	I am exhausted after all the rituals and I am so happy that I cannot explain the feeling in words, Maanyata said.        
	Although there have been rumours that the siblings differed over Maanyata, it is surprising that Priya and Namrata - who live in the same building as Sanjay - had no idea about the wedding. Sources said matters came to a head after the newly weds recently finalised a land deal in Goa, where they might settle.        
	One of Sanjays friends said the couple had big plans lined up for Valentines Day. But the gifts - a Rs 21-lakh watch from Maanyata and a Rs 30-lakh jewellery set from Sanjay - have been exchanged three days in advance.

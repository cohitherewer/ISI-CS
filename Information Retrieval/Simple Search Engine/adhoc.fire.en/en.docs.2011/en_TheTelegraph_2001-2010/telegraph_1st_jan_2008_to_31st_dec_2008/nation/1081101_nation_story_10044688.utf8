          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 31: The National Conference today released a good governance charter that shuns the soft separatism theme of mainstream rivals who have tried to link the Assembly elections with the Kashmir issue.        
	We havent touched issues like political resolution and bilateral relations of India and Pakistan as these dont come in our jurisdiction. We believe the elections are for solving day-to-day problems, not resolving the Kashmir issue, party chief Omar Abdullah said.         
	The polls will be held from November 17 to December 24.        
	He unveiled a vision document, a roadmap to develop the state over 12 years, with an emphasis on generating jobs, rehabilitating militancy-affected people, attracting investment, promoting tourism and ensuring return of migrants.        
	Only two of the documents 53 pages are devoted to the peace process in Jammu and Kashmir but a demand for greater internal autonomy is mentioned prominently.        
	The NCs document appears a far cry from the campaign plank of its main rival, the Peoples Democratic Party, which last week released a set of self-rule proposals demanding shared sovereignty, a dual currency for Kashmir and a trans-border upper House that will include PoK representatives and Islamabads nominees.        
	Under the PDP plan, no all-India service employee  IAS, IPS, bank or railway official or teacher  can be appointed in the state, with all jobs going to local people.         
	The NC charter is also silent on the relations with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), a matter that is becoming a favourite with separatist and mainstream parties.        
	Peace and the resolution process (of the Kashmir issue) shall go together. But it doesnt mean development will suffer. We want to solve day-to-day problems like water, electricity and unemployment, Omar said.        
	The NC promised to rehabilitate the youth who went to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for arms training and wanted to return, a matter earlier addressed by one of the five panels set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004.        
	Conditions shall be created for the youths to return home and settle down as law-abiding citizens, Omar said.         
	On unemployment, Omar promised stipends for educated unemployed youth and jobs for the uneducated. Unemployed doctors will be paid stipends of Rs 3,500 a month. They will be deployed in district hospitals or community dispensaries. Unemployed engineers will get a similar stipend and diploma-holders Rs 3,000.        
	The NC will also implement the Prime Ministers proposals to pay compensation to migrants who had lost properties in the Valley before they left, besides 6,000 jobs.

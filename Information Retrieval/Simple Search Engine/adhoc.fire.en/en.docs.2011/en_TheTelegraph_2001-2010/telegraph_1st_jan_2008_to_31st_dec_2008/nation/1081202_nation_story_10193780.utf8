The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Back to business, but volcano seethes   Residents fume at resilient tag
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Back to business, but volcano seethes     Residents fume at resilient tag
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          A girl playfully chases away pigeons in Mumbai on Monday. (AP)                                        
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: The crowds were back, the rush to eke out a living has begun, but the maximum city has never known anger as it has now.         
	Residents of a megapolis under siege for well over 60 hours last week resumed their usual routine but underneath the workmanlike professionalism lurked a fury caused by the belief that they had been betrayed.        
	All talk of Mumbais resilience is doing a disservice to its people. Life has to go on, we have jobs to do. What do you expect the self-employed to do? If they stay at home, others will take over their business. Local trains obviously will be packed as usual. You dont expect people to come walking from Borivli to Nariman Point. But we the residents of Mumbai are shaken and angry, very angry. We cannot be expected to get hit by bullets just because there is no one to protect us, said S. Sen, a top executive with a foreign investment bank.         
	Sen did not, but many others feeling the same way took time out from their office lunch hours to quickly visit the three sites  Taj and Oberoi hotels and Nariman House  where a handful of militants wreaked havoc from Wednesday night.        
	I walked down to the Taj with a friend. I am shocked and angry, and I wanted to see the destruction for myself, to ingrain the images in my mind so that I never forget what these callous politicians did to our beloved structures. Its a tourist spot now, people want to see it, to keep their anger alive, says Anand Mohanty, an executive in a private firm.        
	The three tourist spots teemed with people who moved from one scarred structure to another, seething with anger, politicians being the main targets.        
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh should be left on the streets of Mumbai without his bodyguards, then he will realise how it feels to be a Mumbaikar. He is on his way out, but he will live with the burden of being an incompetent leader who led his city towards disaster, said Satish Nattu, a shopkeeper in Colaba market, near Nariman House, who has been sitting idle all day.        
	Popular jewellery and curio shop Popli wore a deserted look in a season in which it usually bustles with tourists. Having lost many friends in the Oberoi carnage, the father-mother-son trio cannot forget that day when the massacre started.        
	I spent two sleepless nights. Two foreign couples had come to my shop and bought some stuff. They asked me which was the best Indian restaurant around here and I recommended Kandahar. Some 20 minutes later, I was praying for them to be alive and well. Its now the time in Mumbai when all of us can start believing that we can be shot down anytime in the city, said Akshay Popli.        
	His mother, Shesham, reflected the mood when she said: We might be going on with our daily routine. We might be laughing, we might be visiting these terror sites, but underneath all this is a necessity to go on  to earn our daily bread, to get succour to move on. Look, how quiet Mumbaikars have become.        
	Shesham is right. As Mumbai locals chugged into Churchgate, the once lively platforms, despite the presence of thousands of Mumbaikars, wore an eerie calm.         
	The volcano is still seething, the day it explodes, God knows whats going to happen, said Rajesh Thadnani, a shopkeeper in Colaba.

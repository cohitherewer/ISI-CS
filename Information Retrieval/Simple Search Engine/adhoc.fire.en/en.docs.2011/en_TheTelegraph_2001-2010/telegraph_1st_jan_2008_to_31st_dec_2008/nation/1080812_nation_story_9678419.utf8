	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 11: Electronic voting machines would be used for the first time in the state civic polls, scheduled to be held on September 19.         
	The state election commission today issued notification for conducting general elections to 92 urban local bodies.

	State Election Commissioner Sanjib Chandra Hota told reporters here that the model code of conduct to be observed by the government, political parties and candidates in concerned urban areas was brought into force today in the noon.        
	While normal development works and programmes that have already started, relief and restoration works, expenditure for which have been voted by the legislature and the schemes commenced with the assistance of Union government or international agencies will continue, no new schemes or projects shall be started. Also, no financial concession can be promised or announced by government or any official agency that would have the effect of influencing directly or indirectly the voters of the urban areas entering election, Hota added.        
	There are 103 urban local bodies in the state. The tenure of seven municipalities including Belpahar, Burla, Balimela Redhakhol, Sunabeda, Paradeep and Kendrapara will expire during 2010-11.        
	The commission will be appointing 23 IAS offices as election observers and 23 OFS officers as expenditure observers to supervise and oversee the municipal elections.        
	As many as 1,548 councillors will be elected from the 92 urban local bodies of 30 districts. Women would fill one-third of the seats.         
	Reservation of seats have been made in the municipalities for SC and ST candidates according to the population and 27 per cent of seats have been reserved for other backward caste candidates.        
	About 25.40 lakh urban voters are expected to participate in the polls.         
	The counting of votes would be taken up on September 20 and the results will be declared after the counting is over.        
	The SEC informed that restrictions had been imposed on vehicles to be used by candidates or political parties. Each candidate is to use a maximum of two vehicles (either three or four wheeler). Each political party can provide an additional vehicle for candidates contesting in an urban local body.

	Besides, the candidates have to submit affidavits mentioning their educational qualification, property and criminal antecedent, if any.

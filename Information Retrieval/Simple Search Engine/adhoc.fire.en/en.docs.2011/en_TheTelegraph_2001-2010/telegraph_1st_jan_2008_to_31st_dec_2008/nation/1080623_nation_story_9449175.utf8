          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 22: Are Oriya women too conservative to take up the profession of a tourist guide, or do they prefer to stay away because they lack the skills of being one?         
	The deputy director of the state tourism department, Indrani Mishra, believes that the otherwise brave women of the state hesitate because many of them lack fluency in English.         
	But, S.K. Lenka, the nodal officer of Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management, insist that the state and its women are yet to come out of their conservative cocoon and see girls and women conducting tours.        
	As the argument behind the gender divide continues, Orissa suffers from a lack of women guides, as groups of women travelling together, senior citizens, VIPS and foreigners often prefer women guides as a safer option.         
	There may have been scores of training programmes meant for guides run by the tourism department in the past five years, but not a single woman made it to the classes, or to the career.         
	The state tourism department has sanctioned Rs 16.28 lakh for organising state-level training programmes for capacity building under the service providers scheme.        
	However, no woman (young or old) has come forth till date to take advantage of the training. There were a couple of girls in the past who appeared for interviews, but they were too poor in terms of basic skill and English fluency, Mishra admitted.         
	There were others who took the training but left midway to join as front line staffs with tour operators. None of them was keen to take the job of a guide, she said.         
	Eight programmes were organised by the department in association with IITM in 2006-07  the state guide training, eco-tourism guide training, district guide training, Buddhist guide training, monument guide training and foreign language guide training were some of them.         
	Qualifying as a guide is not an easy task.         
	A person has to be a graduate or a diploma-holder from a tourism institute and has to have at least six-months training in a regular course and in a foreign language course from a recognised institution.        
	Besides, fluency of English is essential. The candidates have to pass a 200 mark written test and an interview after a basic screening to qualify for the final training.         
	The training ranges from nine weeks to 15 days and produce a total of 676 candidates from 26 districts.         
	The 15-day training includes classes on Indian society and culture, an overview of tourism, travel and hospitality industry and behavioural skills.         
	We are always keen to take in women guides. There is a greater scope for them and they can do wonders if they are really dedicated. However, the response so far has been nil, said Mishra.         
	There is definitely a huge market, but Orissa is still a conservative state. Women possibly do not feel free to venture out and make a night halt with a group of unknown strangers and tourists. But, we are trying our best to shed this mindset and start day time tours to accommodate the women, said Lenka.

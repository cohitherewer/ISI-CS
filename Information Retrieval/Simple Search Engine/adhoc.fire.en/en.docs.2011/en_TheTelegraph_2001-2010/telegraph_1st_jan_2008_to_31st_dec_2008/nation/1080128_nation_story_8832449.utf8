The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Falling soon: bus-sized spy satellite
                                                                                                            Falling soon: bus-sized spy satellite
                                  
	Washington, Jan. 27 (AP): A spy satellite the size of a bus is out of control and could crash into Earth in the next few weeks, US government officials have warned.        
	The satellite could contain hazardous materials and it is unknown where on the planet it might come down, they said.        
	The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is classified as secret. It was not clear how long ago the satellite lost power or under what circumstances.        
	Appropriate government agencies are monitoring the situation, said Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, when asked about the situation after it was disclosed by other officials.        
	Numerous satellites over the years have come out of orbit and fallen harmlessly. We are looking at potential options to mitigate any possible damage this satellite may cause.        
	He would not comment on whether it was possible for the satellite to be shot down by a missile. He said it would be inappropriate to discuss any specifics at this time.        
	A senior government official said lawmakers and other nations were being kept apprised of the situation.        
	The spacecraft contains hydrazine  which is rocket fuel  according to a government official who was not authorised to speak publicly. Hydrazine, a colourless liquid with an ammonia-like odour, is a toxic chemical and can cause harm to anyone who comes in contact with it.        
	An uncontrolled re-entry could risk exposure of US secrets, said John Pike, a defence and intelligence expert. Spy satellites typically are disposed of through a controlled re-entry into the ocean so that no one else can access the spacecraft, he said.        
	Pike added it was not likely the threat from the satellite could be eliminated by shooting it down with a missile because that would create debris that would re-enter the atmosphere and burn up or hit the ground.        
	Pike, director of the defence research group GlobalSecurity.org, estimated that the spacecraft weighed about 9072kg. He said the satellite would create 10 times less debris than the Columbia space shuttle crash in 2003.         
	Satellites have natural decay periods and it is possible this one died as long as a year ago and is just now getting ready to re-enter the atmosphere, he said.        
	Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow with the National Security Archive, said the spacecraft was most likely a photo reconnaissance satellite. Such eyes in the sky are used to gather visual information from space about adversarial governments and terror groups, including construction at suspected nuclear sites or militant training camps.         
	The satellites can also be used to survey damage from hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters.              
	The largest uncontrolled re-entry by a NASA spacecraft was Skylab, the 78-ton abandoned space station that fell from orbit in 1979. Its debris dropped harmlessly into the Indian Ocean and across a remote section of western Australia.        
	In 2000, NASA engineers successfully directed a safe de-orbit of the 17-ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, using rockets aboard the satellite to bring it down in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean.        
	In 2002, officials believe debris from a 3175.18kg science satellite smacked into the Earths atmosphere and rained down over the Persian Gulf, a few thousand miles from where they first predicted it would plummet.

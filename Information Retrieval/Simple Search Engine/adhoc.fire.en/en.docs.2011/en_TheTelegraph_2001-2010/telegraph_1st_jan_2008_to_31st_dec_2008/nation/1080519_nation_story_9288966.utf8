          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 18: The BJP today expressed doubts whether Manmohan Singh would implement the proposal for a federal agency to counter terrorism that he spoke of yesterday.        
	Party general secretary Arun Jaitley, while accusing the Prime Minister of being soft on terrorists for vote bank politics rather than security considerations, said: It is ironical that after being in office for four years, the Prime Minister has finally woken up to the harsh and cruel reality that prevention and investigation of terrorism in India is on the verge of collapse.         
	Singh had yesterday urged state governments to stop resisting the setting up of a federal investigation agency if India was to battle terrorism effectively.        
	Will the Prime Minister have the political courage to strengthen the content of Indias anti-terrorist laws? he asked.         
	Jaitley also wanted to know if the UPA partners and the Left parties would support him on this. He claimed that whenever the inter-state council and the home ministry mooted the federal crime agency, state governments, mainly those run by the Congress, opposed it.        
	Besides, who investigated the offence was not the only important part, he said, but also the content of the law under which the crime was probed.        
	The Prime Minister, his government and the party had consistently opposed a strong anti-terror law, Jaitley said.         
	He asked if the federal agency would not feel helpless if confessions of suspects were inadmissible as evidence and bail was easily possible.         
	Faced with a state of helplessness in view of the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the BJP-ruled states such as Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have enacted laws against organised crime. These laws are almost identical to Pota. Unfortunately, the Union government has deliberately not given presidential assent to the three BJP governments to operationalise the law, he said.        
	Jaitley claimed this would cripple investigation into the Jaipur blasts.        
	The BJP would discuss the proposal to create a federal agency only if it involved change in the content of the law against terror.        
	Bangla caution        
	The Bangladesh government has asked the media in that country not to jump to a conclusion about the Jaipur blasts.        
	Bangladesh-based outfit Huji is suspected to be behind the attack.         
	The media should not jump to a conclusion before investigations are completed, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said in Dhaka last night.

             Water woes hit rural folks
                 
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: Tubewells are being dug and water bodies are being treated with bleaching powder at Sindhekela in Bolangir district but the residents feel that the action has been taken, little too late.
    
	The village lost two children to contaminated drinking water yesterday. Even today 55 more people have reportedly fallen sick after drinking water from pipes. 
    
	Sindhekela, situated about 80km from the district headquarters, receives water from Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) project. 
    
	The water that reached Sindhekela in the early hours of Friday was lethal and two children, Rakesh Sahu (2) and Jharita Behera (4), complained of stomach ache minutes after they drank it. 
    
	Few moments later, froth came out of their mouth and both started vomiting. 
    
	While Rakesh died at home, Jharita succumbed on the way to the hospital.
    
	Villagers who checked the supply pipe reportedly found dead insects, birds, lizards and snakes jammed in the tube. 
    
	As more people started complaining of similar symptoms, several were rushed to Bolangir district headquarters hospital. Most of them were released after treatment, though. 
    
	The patients in a critical condition were shifted to VSS Medical College and Hospital at Burla, where condition of most is said to be stable now.
    
	The district-level officials have rushed to the spot with medical teams. 
    
	Experts suspect that iron particles in the rusty and cracked pipes may have caused the accidents. Also, infected water may have seeped in from unknown source.
    
	The pipeline was disinfected today, while drinking water was being supplied in tankers. The water supply would be provided till the repair process is complete, said Nayak. RWSS authorities have been informed and advised to start disinfecting the pipeline immediately. 
    
	We are taking proper care of the patients and more doctors have been pressed into service. Water samples have been sent for tests, said Bolangir collector R.S. Gopalan. 
    
	Now the situation is under control and we also will be taking care of the medical expenses, he added. 
    
	Two groups of police have been deployed at Sindhekala to maintain law and order. Yesterday, there was a commotion before the Sindhekela primary health centre, as residents vented their ire at poor pipe maintenance. They also complained of maltreatment of patients.
    
	Chief district medical officer A.C. Nayak also said the situation was under control. He said no new patient ill after drinking water had been admitted to the hospital since yesterday afternoon. Two doctors have been posted at Sindhekela primary health centre for emergency.

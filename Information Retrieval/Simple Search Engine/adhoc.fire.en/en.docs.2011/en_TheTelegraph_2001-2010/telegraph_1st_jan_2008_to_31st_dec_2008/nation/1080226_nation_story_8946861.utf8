The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sit-in after NH repair cry
                                                                                                               Sit-in after NH repair cry
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: CPMs Bonai MLA Laxman Munda, with elected representatives of the area, today sat on a dharna in front of Naveen Nivas, the official residence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, demanding repair of National Highway 215.         
	The highway extends from Rajamunda to Panikoili and connects western Orissa with the coastal districts. The 270-km stretch connects Keonjhar, an iron ore belt, with Panikuili on the NH-5 that connects Calcutta with Chennai.         
	The road is in such a shape that an iron ore carrying truck can proceed on this road only at an average speed of 4km to 5km per hour. As a result of this, congestion marks the road for better part of the day.         
	Munda sat on an indefinite dharna about 100m away from the chief ministers residence as district police did not give him the permission to stage protests before the chief ministers house. The NH-215 has turned into a death trap for vehicles plying on it, said Munda adding that he would sit on an indefinite hunger strike until their demands were met with.         
	Accusing the government of dilly-dallying on the matter, the MLA said: The government extracts crores of rupees as toll from the area, but hardly bothers to spend a part of it on renovating or repairing the highway.         
	Previously, a suggestion was submitted to turn the highway into a four-lane road. A detailed project report was also submitted for the project. But before that, immediate repairs of the road seems to be the need of the hour  without which the new project cannot start.        
	We wont budge till the issue is resolved, thundered Munda. Chairman of Koida Panchayat Samiti M. Toppo and elected representatives have also joined the dharna.         
	Meanwhile, residents have also blocked the road at spots across the district  including Tensa and Koida.

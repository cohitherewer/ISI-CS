	Mumbai, Nov. 28: An anxious crowd cheered when a group of hostages, including an infant in its fathers arms, was escorted out of the Oberoi-Trident. But for some, heartbreak was to follow.        
	Italian chef Emanuele Lattanzi and his baby this morning became the face of the Oberoi-Trident rescue, where the NSG killed two terrorists and freed the remaining 128 hostages. But they also found 24 bodies.        
	One of them belonged to Yes Bank non-executive chairman Ashok Kapur, found on the 19th floor in the evening. His wife Madhu Kapur had been waiting anxiously for him after her rescue yesterday.        
	My husband and I had come to Kandahar restaurant for dinner with another couple, she said. When everybody rushed out towards the staircase, she had thought her husband was running behind her. When I turned around, he was not there.        
	Some 93 hostages walked out after operations ended around 10am  an Air France crew of about 20 among them  and another 35 at 4.45pm. Many were not strictly taken hostage  they had panicked and hidden inside their rooms. One of them, Israeli national Lila Shihab, said: I will never come back to Mumbai. I come from a place where these things are common, but this was the worst.        
	Munir Bahshra, an Iraqi, however, wouldnt mind returning. He and a friend had locked themselves inside their room. We didnt dare come out to see what was happening. We stayed there without food for two days.        
	Briton Mark Abell, who peeped outside his room, will never forget the sight: The lobby had blood and body parts all over.        
	Hundreds of worried relatives hung around the adjacent Air India building, which became the rescue centre, control room and morgue.         
	Nitin Mehta arrived there to find out about uncle Kanubhai Patel, 78.         
	My uncle has blood pressure, diabetes and Parkinsons disease. He has a business of diamond-cutting tools. He went to Kandahar restaurant with two French nationals and a friend, who is a CEO. Hotel staff helped the French people escape and the CEO managed to flee with a bullet injury. Some people said my uncle got stuck on the 14th floor, Mehta said. Patel was later found dead.        
	Actor Ashish Choudhary was inconsolable after identifying the bodies of sister Monica Chhabria and her husband, who were dining at Tiffin restaurant with friends.

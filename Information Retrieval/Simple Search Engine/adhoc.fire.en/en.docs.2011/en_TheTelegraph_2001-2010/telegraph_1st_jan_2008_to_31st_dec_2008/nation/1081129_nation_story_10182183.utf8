	Nov. 28: In 2003, barely out of their teens and newly married, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and wife Rivka moved from Brooklyn to Mumbai. Their mission: to manage a mix of educational centre, synagogue and social hall known as a Chabad house, one of about 3,500 outposts around the world run by the Lubavitch Hasidic movement.        
	The place soon became a year-round magnet for Israeli backpackers and the Jewish businessmen and tourists who flock to Mumbai, as well as for the Iraqi and Indian Jews who live in the city.        
	Rivka served visitors coffee and home-made kosher delicacies. Rabbi Holtzberg always offered a helping hand to someone who was sick or stranded, often calling worried parents or spouses miles and miles away to calm them.        
	The roles were reversed since Wednesday -- when the Mumbai Chabad house became an unlikely target of terrorists who took the couple and several others hostage -- with the Holtzbergs friends and families forced to spend anxious hours worrying for them. This evening, Mumbai police confirmed that all five hostages in Nariman House were dead.        
	The couples two-year-old son, Moshe, and a cook managed to escape about 12 hours into the siege.         
	It wasnt clear if the Jewish centre was strategically chosen. But if the centre lacked the size and prominence of the attackers other targets, the news of its fate had reverberated among Chabad houses in Australia, Argentina, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Norway and 67 other countries over the past two days. But perhaps nowhere was it felt more strongly than in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the nerve centre of the Lubavitch community and the neighbourhood where Rabbi Holtzberg grew up.        
	There, men had filed into the synagogue all day to pray for the Holtzbergs safe release. In a separate room, women swayed on their knees as they read the Torah. In the offices upstairs, rabbis and friends of the couple manned telephones, staying in contact with a sizeable network of volunteers at the house in Mumbai, waiting for news.        
	We were up all night, trying to sort fact from fiction, figure out what their status was, Rabbi Dovid Zaklikowski, 28, a friend of Rabbi Holtzberg since high school, said.        
	Gavriel and Rivka were born in Israel, though he and his siblings were brought to Crown Heights as children by their parents. The couple married a year before they went to Mumbai to fulfil a role that Zaklikowski said fit perfectly with Gavriels personality.        
	He had a huge heart, always willing to help somebody in need, the rabbi said. Its natural that he would give himself to the community.        
	Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky, who directed the Chabad emissaries conference, described Rabbi Holtzberg as a very dynamic, energetic individual who turned Mumbais Chabad house into a home away from home for thousands and thousands of Jews.        
	At mid-afternoon in New York on Wednesday, the first reports of the attacks in Mumbai hit the news, but no one in the Lubavitch headquarters knew exactly where they had occurred  and no one suspected that the Chabad house had been hit. Still, some friends wanted to make sure that the Holtzberg family were all right, so they phoned. There was no answer.        
	Yacov Young, Gavriels cousin, said he had been at home in Crown Heights, celebrating the birth of his son and a brother-in-laws marriage, when his phone rang about midnight. Our hearts sank when we heard the bad news, Young said.        
	Gavriels parents, Noah and Freida, spent most of Thursday holed up in their house in Crown Heights, but left for Israel late in the afternoon. Rivkas parents, Rabbi Shimon and Yehudit Rosenberg, who live in Israel, boarded a plane to Mumbai. They were accompanied by a crew from the Israeli relief organisation Zaka, said Dov Maisel, a medic with the group, by telephone from Israel.        
	They are on a mission to get their grandson, but they are very, very nervous about their daughter and son-in-law, Maisel said yesterday. Some 24 hours have passed, and they have heard nothing.

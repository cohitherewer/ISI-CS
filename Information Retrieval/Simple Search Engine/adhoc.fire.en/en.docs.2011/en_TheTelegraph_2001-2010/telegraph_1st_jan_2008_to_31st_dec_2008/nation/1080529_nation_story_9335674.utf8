          OUR BUREAU                          Gujjars at an agitation at Karwari-Pilupura village in Bharatpur on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	May 28: Bodies rotted in the sun and a stench hung in the air amid allegations that the Rajasthan government had cut off ice supply to throttle the six-day-old Gujjar agitation even as more forces moved into the protest epicentres.        
	In Haryana, authorities issued orders for security arrangements in all districts that are part of the national capital region after Gujjars in the state threatened to snap milk and vegetable supply to Delhi from tomorrow.        
	Gujjar protesters in Bayana and Sikandra Chowk, squatting with bodies of comrades killed in police firing, accused the Rajasthan government of cutting off supply of ice to force them to hand the bodies over.        
	Sources said the stench from the bodies  12 in Bayana and six in Sikandra Chowk  was already all over the place and there could be an epidemic if nothing was done soon.        
	Principal secretary S.N. Thanvi, who is camping in Bayana, denied that the administration had stopped supply of ice.        
	No, we have not ordered closure of ice shops in the surrounding areas for the dead bodies. Ice is available but, yes, we want the dead bodies cremated as soon as possible.        
	Thanvi said the state government was ready to conduct post-mortem of the bodies at railway tracks as demanded by the Gujjars.        
	But they are now demanding that the four bodies kept at Jaipurs Sawai Mansingh hospital be also brought to the tracks for post-mortem. We can still comply with their demand but their other condition that once the post-mortem is over, the bodies be handed over to them is holding us back. We want them cremated by the next of kin immediately after the procedure.        
	Thanvi added that hardliners surrounding K.S. Bainsla, including wanted dacoit Jagan Gujjar, was not letting him negotiate freely with the agitation spearhead to resolve the deadlock over Scheduled Tribe status.        
	Authorities moved in more forces to pre-empt a fresh flare-up tomorrow, the first anniversary of the Gujjar agitation that began on May 29 last year in Dausa district and left 26 dead.        
	Over three dozen have died in the protests this year, including a policeman who was lynched.        
	Forty more army vehicles rolled into protest zones and 10 companies of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary and Rajasthan police have been deployed.        
	Sources said the army had constructed five helipads in Kalakoh, Bandikui, Sikandra, Mahwa and Manpur.        
	Home minister Gulab Chand Kataria said the situation remained peaceful today while bandhs and chakka jams were reported from places like Jhalawar, Baran, Bundi, Kota, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand and Bhilwara.        
	Security around BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindias palace in Dholpur was tightened after dacoit Jagan threatened to blow it up.        
	Raje today said the reservation should be done at the central level and asked community members to use their wisdom, a day after Delhi reportedly put the ball back into the states court.        
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar, now camping in Jaipur, held a closed-door meeting with party leaders. The issue can only be resolved through talks and we are putting our best efforts in it, he said.        
	In Haryana, the administration put Rewari, Narnaul, Gurgaon, Sonipat, Panipat, Faridabad and several other districts on alert.

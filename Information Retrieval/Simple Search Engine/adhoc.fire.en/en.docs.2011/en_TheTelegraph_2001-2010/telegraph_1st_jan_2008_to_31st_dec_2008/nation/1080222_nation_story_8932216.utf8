                                                                                                               Stormy budget session in store
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nitish Ready                                  
	Patna, Feb. 21: The RJD-led Opposition is gearing up to make the month-long budget session to start from tomorrow a stormy affair.        
	The Opposition reportedly would be discussing the Kahalgaon police firing in which three people were killed and the poor implementation of central schemes in Bihar. We will put the government on the stand for its poor performance and the bad law and order situation, said RJD chief whip in state Assembly, Ramchandra Purevey, after emerging from a joint-meeting of the RJD, Congress and the Left parties.         
	The parties sat together on the eve of the budget session to chalk out strategies.         
	But the ruling establishment is confident enough that they would thwart any moves. The JD(U) is now riding high on the recent victory in Bikramganj and they would be pointing out to the decline in abduction cases, conviction to Bihar dons as positive changes.         
	The police officers responsible for the Kahalgaon incident have been suspended. The victims kin have been paid compensation. The government has ensured power supply in the area, pointed out JD(U) chief whip, Shravan Kumar. The JD(U) and BJP, too, had their joint meeting on the eve of the session.         
	Governor R.S. Gavai will address the joint session of the states bicameral legislature.         
	While talking to the media, Shravan Kumar explained that the JD(U) have little to fear as work under the central and state schemes were being conducted on a war footing in the states hinterlands.         
	Construction of roads, schools and health centres are on, said Shravan Kumar, adding: The Opposition clearly doesnt know what to do before a truly functional government.         
	However, Congress leader Ashok Kumar described the ruling establishments claims as overestimated. Bihar government has failed in implementing the central schemes particularly the National Rural Employment Programme. We will ask the government to prove its claim on the floor, Ashok Kumar added.         
	The CPI, too, refuses to buy the ruling establishments argument.         
	Bihars law and order situation has worsened, commented a spokesman, after emerging from the joint meeting. He also added that there was rampant corruption in the bureaucracy.        
	For now both camp show signs to begin the session on a stormy note.

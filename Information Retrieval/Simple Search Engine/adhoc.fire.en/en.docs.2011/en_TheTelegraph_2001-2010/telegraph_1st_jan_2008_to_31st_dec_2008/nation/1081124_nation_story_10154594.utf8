The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | At 90, a swansong for democracy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           At 90, a swansong for democracy
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                        Ghulam Rasool Kar: Soldiering on                                  
	Sopore (North Kashmir), Nov. 23: At 90, your shoulders have begun to droop and shrink, barely able to support their own reduced burden. But heres a 90-year-old not only squaring up to the ravages of time, hes also carrying off two concurrent rebellions  one against his party, the other against Sopores formidable secessionists.        
	Ghulam Rasool Kar, member of the Constituent Assembly, friend of Nehru and Indira, for decades the helmsman of the Congress in the Valley, has been denied a ticket by new party bosses whom he apprenticed into politics. Worse, hes besieged in a town that has long been the arrowhead of Kashmiri self-determination.        
	Sopore is to Kashmir what Ulster and Derry used to be to Northern Ireland  an obdurate and violent outpost against integration whose defiance neither persuasion nor military pogrom has been able to tame. It does not help Kars cause that Sopore is also home to Kashmirs most resilient separatist, Syed Ali Shah Geelani.        
	But hes making a furious and eloquent battle of whats decidedly his last fling. There are lessons I have learnt that I now must begin to teach, both to my party and to these secessionists, he tells you, wagging his still robust fingers.        
	Nehrus soldiers must at least sing their song out loud before they die on this frontier. I fought the tribal invasion of 1948, I fought off the Pakistanis again in 1965, I am not giving up so easily. This is my last song, you call it something in English, dont you? Swansong or some such thing?        
	Kars campaign managers  his itinerant wife Habla Begum chief among them  arent unaware of what they are up against. Not the Congress or its nominee Abdul Rashid Dar  they seem least bothered by them  although Kars personal hurt is a sore carbuncle he isnt shy of baring.        
	I have seen workers betray a party, I have never seen a party betray its workers in such fashion, he says. Denial is the medal they have chosen to award me at the end of 70 years in the party. Ill wear that badge and battle on.        
	Signs that the Congress isnt a troublesome front for the veteran are already apparent. The decision to dump Kar has riled local party ranks; they are leaving in droves and swelling up on the front lawns of their leaders mansion just off Sopores mud-ridden, tonga-infested high street.        
	Kar savours the thickening flock from his verandah perch, a karakul cap peaked high on his forehead, a pashmina thrown across his back, a faint and proud smile playing on his lips. At least my workers havent gone away, that is prize enough.        
	Village pramukhs, block presidents, district-level workers, young and old, men and women, all pushing their identity papers in your face, should you be sceptical.        
	The Congress here is Karsaheb, the party is his child, says Abdul Khaliq, a district secretary. If the Congress is not with him, we are not with the Congress. Hell win handsomely, youll see, hell poll more than the rest put together.        
	Their worry, though, should be just that: the poll. Sopore is notoriously shy of the polling booth; in 2002, less than five per cent voted, the boycott won the day. And it isnt as if the spectre of Geelani has gone away six years later; it hangs as low and as hauntingly as it did then.        
	Across both halves of Sopores warren-like neighbourhoods that hug a wide swathe of the Jhelum, the mention of elections is heresy --- theyll swat it with a swing of the arm or run off as if sacrilege were in their pursuit.        
	Theres bustle enough in downtown Sopore --- it is, after all, the prosperous hub of apple traders --- but none of it owes to electioneering. No posters or banners, no rallies, no street-corner meetings, not even the odd leaflet dropped off a scurrying vehicle.        
	Election? asks a policeman struggling to signal sense into the chaotic mill of traffic, What elections? Havent you heard elections mean curfew in Sopore? This is Geelanis turf, even the birds know, even they wont bat about that day.        
	Kar has been in Sopore too long not to be wise to the challenge --- or the dangers. His campaign headquarters is located deep inside a police camp, shuttered with metal gates and sandbanks. Gunmen and metal detectors monitor entry and as if to take no chances, armoured vehicles guard the quadrants leading off from the gates.        
	His workers arrive furtively, cutting through the maze of Sopores lanes; they slip out only by dark. It is not easy running a campaign here, admits one of them.               
	Even my neighbours dont know what I am up to, but Karsaheb needs our help.        
	Their leader isnt making any promises he will turn Sopores trickle into a tide on voting day. He all but admits it is the sway of secessionism rather than his age that prevents him hitting the trail.        
	There is fear, you can sense it, but I have people, he argues defensively when asked why he does not venture out. And they will spread my message. My mission is to make people understand that real aazadi

My mission is to make people understand that real aazadi will not come through guns or boycotts but through democracy; that is what will solve their problems, nothing else.        
	But Geelani has long gnashed at such sentiment and Sopore remains his nettled nest. Who knows, the hawk may yet throttle Kars swansong.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun says no to pal 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun says no to pal 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, April 6: The Centre has rejected Banaras Hindu University vice-chancellor Panjab Singhs application for a second term amid allegations of favouritism, corruption and saffronisation of the campus.        
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry has struck Singhs name off the list of aspirants for the vice-chancellors post, which falls vacant on May 3, officials said.        
	The decision came after the Prime Ministers Office forwarded a list of complaints against Panjabs administration, many of them received during Manmohan Singhs visit to the university last month, ministry sources said. On March 15, the Prime Minister had received an honorary doctorate in literature from Panjab.        
	The vice-chancellor is learnt to be close to HRD minister Arjun Singh. Indias education boss, however, has not yet explained the reasons for dropping him, Panjab told The Telegraph.        
	No one, not the minister nor any of his officials, has yet explained the reasons for dropping me from the list. But life does not end here. I will accept whatever the ministry decides, he said. He denied all the allegations against him.        
	Usually, a vice-chancellor nearing the end of his term is informed whether his political bosses are favourable  or at least open  to an extension, the sources said. If an incumbent receives signals that it is time for him to go, he rarely, if ever, seeks reappointment.        
	When the selection process began this year, Panjab was the first to reapply. He has since then visited the ministry headquarters in Shastri Bhavan several times to meet Arjun.        
	Arjun, however, did not meet him the last time the vice-chancellor came to Delhi, the sources said.        
	Several faculty members and administration officials in BHU have been calling for Panjabs removal for over a year now. They have been joined by the Congress MP from Varanasi, Rajesh Kumar Mishra.        
	More than 50 per cent of the appointments he (Panjab) made were biased. At least 10 family members have received permanent appointments. And now, he is spending over Rs 100 crore to build a second BHU campus near his village (just outside Varanasi), Mishra alleged.        
	Panjab had invited Ram Madhav, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader, to a function at BHU even while calling for depoliticisation of the campus, Mishra said.        
	Students taking out a procession on Gandhi Jayanti were arrested. Its a victory for truth and for academics if Panjab Singhs plea for a second term has been rejected, the MP, a former vice-president of the BHU students union, added.        
	Panjab, who banned students unions from the campus, has his share of supporters. He is a victim of political decisions, a member of the administration said.        
	The complaints and the demands for Panjabs resignation have the support of some ministry officials, too, but he succeeded in completing his tenure thanks to Arjun, the sources said.        
	Their proximity is legendary. But there is little even the minister can do when the PM himself intervenes, an official said.        
	The BHU vice-chancellors post  which has a three-year tenure  is coveted in academic circles, the sources said. The university was set up more than 90 years ago by Right-wing Congress leader Madan Mohan Malaviya.

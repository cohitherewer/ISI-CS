	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Come what may, the Supreme Court has vowed to protect individual rights and liberties from executive encroachments. 
    
	If any executive authority encroaches upon the freedom of the people, this court will interfere, come what may, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said today.
    
	It is our solemn duty to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, he asserted, close on the heels of the Book Fair judgment in Calcutta where the high court evicted the event from Park Circus Maidan citing violation of fundamental rights.
    
	Balakrishnan made the remarks as a Blueline bus operator quoted Justice Markandey Katjus judgment on judicial overreach to argue that Delhi High Court was wrong in disciplining the capitals buses involved in fatal accidents. 
    
	The observations were also an attempt to clear the air on the high courts powers to deal with public issues. In the wake of adverse observations from Justice Katju, the high court had for a while refrained from issuing any directive against Blueline buses. 
    
	The assertion also follows a perception among politicians that the judiciary is encroaching into the domain of the executive. Expressing concern, the political class had also coined the term judicial activism. 
    
	The counsel for the bus operator, Puneet Bali, today said the Motor Vehicle Act had to be the same for everybody and Blueline drivers and owners could not be treated differently.
    
	The high court can neither impose fines higher than those prescribed by the act nor place the owner behind bars, Bali said. That will amount to violating all penal laws. 
    
	The chief justice expressed concern that the number of fatalities involving these buses was on the higher side. You dont have a right to kill people, he said. 
    
	Bali, however, contended that even if accidents were taking place, the bus owners and drivers could only be penalised in line with the existing law. 
    
	He said the high court had passed as many as 10 orders against Blueline operators that were in excess of the law. The orders were passed even without hearing the bus operators, the counsel said. 
    
	But the Supreme Court rejected his plea and asked him to take his grievances to the high court.
    
	The high court had asked the Delhi government to draw up a plan to phase out the Blueline scheme by November 15, 2008. It was also told to initiate criminal proceedings against unfit drivers involved in fatal accidents.
    
	The government was also asked to impound all buses involved in such accidents. Some 600 of them had been impounded and their licences cancelled since then. At least 4,500 Blueline buses ply in the city daily.

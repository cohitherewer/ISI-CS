                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gas burden gets heavier
  - Oil firms hike LPG deposit for new connections, not cylinder price        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, May 26: Customers will now have to pay Rs 400 more as security deposit for new cooking gas connections.        
	Oil companies today hiked the refundable deposit from Rs 850 to Rs 1,250 a cylinder, but did not raise the LPG prices themselves. The price of a gas regulator has been raised from Rs 100 to Rs 150.        
	Uncertainty prevails over a possible hike in petrol and diesel prices. The government may increase petrol prices by a small amount  about Rs 2  while keeping diesel prices intact, sources said.        
	A rise in diesel prices will raise trucking costs, and therefore the prices of all commodities, impacting an already high inflation rate.        
	The security deposit for new LPG connections has been increased to meet the growing input costs, an industry official said. The security deposit in the Northeast has been raised from Rs 500 a cylinder to Rs 900.        
	The present security deposit was grossly inadequate. Steel prices have gone up and we were making huge losses per cylinder, the official said.        
	But cooking gas prices stay the same since they were last increased by Rs 20 a cylinder in November 2004, when the global crude price was $34 a barrel. Now its $133.        
	Petrol is now sold at a loss of Rs 18 a litre and diesel at that of Rs 28 a litre. The loss per cylinder of LPG is Rs 360 and that per litre of kerosene is Rs 37.        
	Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have been pressuring the government to increase fuel prices. But the Karnataka poll results could lead the Centre into a bout of populism while compensating the oil companies through bonds and a duty rejig.        
	The petroleum ministry wants the government to decontrol the price of petrol and let market forces determine it. But Delhi is unlikely to accept such a suggestion in an election year.        
	The ministrys suggestion would raise petrol prices by Rs 16-17 a litre, the official said.        
	The tax component in the retail price of petrol is around 53 per cent and in diesel, 34 per cent.        
	Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lost Rs 77,304.50 crore on fuel sales in 2007-08. The government now compensates 42.7 per cent of the revenue loss by issuing oil bonds. This may be raised to 50 per cent.        
	A third of the losses are compensated by companies like ONGC and GAIL. The oil companies are likely to face losses of nearly Rs 200,000 crore this fiscal.        
	Crude oil now attracts an import duty of 5 per cent, officials said, suggesting that waiving this would lower the Rs 272,699-crore oil import bill for 2008-09. Customs duty on petrol and diesel is 7.5 per cent.        
	In the 2008-09 budget, the finance minister had changed the structure of excise duties on petrol and diesel by making these specific (that is, the tax is levied on the basis of quantity and not value).        
	The move protected the oil companies from a higher dose of taxation. Petrol and diesel now attract an excise duty of Rs 14.35 a litre and Rs 4.60 a litre, respectively.        
	However, the customs duties are levied on the basis of value and add to the governments revenues when import prices of crude go up.        
	Officials said there was a strong case for similar specific rates for customs duty and local levy on oil to moderate the taxation of petroleum.        
	The customs duty in the petroleum sector contributed Rs 10,043 crore to the exchequer in 2006-07, and excise duty (including cess on indigenous crude oil) contributed Rs 58,821 crore.

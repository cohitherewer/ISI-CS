	Islamabad, June 23 (PTI): Indian national Sarabjit Singh, on death row in a Pakistani jail, is unlikely to benefit from the governments proposal to commute all death sentences to life imprisonment.        
	The remission would not be applicable as Sarabjit has been convicted of terrorism and espionage, sources in the interior ministry said.        
	Only those who were not involved in crimes like terrorism, bombings and spreading sectarian hatred could benefit from Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilanis recent announcement about asking President Pervez Musharraf to commute death sentences , sources told the Daily Times newspaper.        
	Senior officials in Pakistan are now trying to find a way to send Sarabjit back to India in exchange for Pakistanis detained in India, sources said.

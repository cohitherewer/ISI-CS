     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 25: A four-seater government plane carrying a minister and his aides landed at Jaiprakash Narayan airport today.
    
	Airport authorities said the crash was due to technical snags and the planes wheels stayed locked and subsequently it started emitting smokes. States public works department minister Monajir Hassan jumped out of the plane and in the process sprained his legs. His aids also followed him sustaining some minor injuries. The plane was damaged.
    
	The director-general of civil aviation Vinay Karmsheel has ordered an inquiry into the incident. Only an inquiry report can say what went wrong, he said. The minister and his aids had gone to Chapra in north Bihar on an official visit. The mishap struck when the plane was on its way back to Patnas airport.

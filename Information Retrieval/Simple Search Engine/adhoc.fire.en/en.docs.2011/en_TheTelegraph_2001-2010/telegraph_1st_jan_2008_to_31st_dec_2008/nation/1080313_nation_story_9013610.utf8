The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Future flying machine in a suitcase
                                                                                                               Future flying machine in a suitcase
          G.S. MUDUR                           A micro aerial vehicle hovers over a building                                  
	Agra, March 12: On a stretch of land that the Indian Air Force calls the Drop Zone, an array of futuristic flying vehicles waited this morning for strong winds to calm so they could display their mettle in a mock hostage rescue mission.         
	But the winds persisted and Lt Col Eric Stierna from the US Army, the operations officer for the first American-Asian demonstration of micro aerial vehicles (MAV) and unmanned ground vehicles, took a call that the flights would begin tomorrow.        
	MAVs are flying machines, which are battery-powered and small enough to go inside a suitcase.         
	Twelve teams from India, the US and six other countries have assembled here to compete in a mock rescue mission in which the MAVs would have to locate obstacles, detect landmines and hover at rooftop altitude to observe mock terrorist guard teams.        
	These prototypes will be flying in an operational scenario, Stierna told The Telegraph.         
	In the competition, the MAVs have to fly a distance of about a kilometre, use onboard cameras to look for landmines, evade detection by patrolling guards and use a combination of sensors to detect the room where hostages are held. Each MAV scheduled to fly in the competition is no bigger than 30cm.         
	Most previous demonstrations of MAVs of this size have been developmental tests, said Stierna, the commander of the southern Asia office of the US Army International Technology Centre in Singapore.         
	Well programme the mission details but the MAVs fly on their own, said Hemandra Arya, an aerospace engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, who heads one of the four teams from India.         
	The IIT team has brought in two MAVs  one of them has four tiny rotors  and a ground vehicle to help defuse the landmines.         
	The four-rotor vehicle has the capacity to hover and land on uneven surfaces, Arya said.         
	Researchers in the US, Europe and Asia have been pursuing the development of MAV systems for nearly a decade, but engineers caution that most MAVs are not ready yet for real-world missions.         
	The MAV demonstration  organised by the National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore, the Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment here and the US Army International Technology Centre  is part of an effort to identify the most promising prototypes and to understand the challenges in this technology.        
	Theyre tactical systems and could become part of a toolkit of the future, said S.G. (Sam) Sampath, engineering director of the US Army International Technology Centre, Singapore.

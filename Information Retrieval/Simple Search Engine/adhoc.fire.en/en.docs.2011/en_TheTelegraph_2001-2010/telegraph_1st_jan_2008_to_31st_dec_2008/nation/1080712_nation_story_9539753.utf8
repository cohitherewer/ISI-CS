	New York, July 11 (PTI): The name of an Indian-born doctor who went missing from the World Trade Center here after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks has been put back on the list of victims after a four-year legal battle by her family.        
	Sneha Anne Philip, 31, was removed in 2004 from the list by city officials who said they could not confirm her presence in the World Trade Center at the time of the attack as she did not work there and had left her home a day earlier.        
	However, Snehas family moved the state supreme court which decided in their favour on January 31, overturning a 2006 decision by a lower court.        
	Its a relief. Losing our daughter is bad enough, but having to go through this whole process was terrible, Ansu Philip, her mother, was quoted as saying by Newsday.        
	Chief medical examiner Charles S. Hirsh said a death certificate had been issued for Sneha, whose body was never found, listing her as the victim of the attacks.        
	He said the death toll in the tragedy had risen to 2,751 after it had been updated. New York City set the first death toll four-and-a-half years ago.        
	The court took into consideration the fact that Sneha was last seen in a videotape buying shoes at a store opposite the Center a day before. Her family believed she attended a party in a hotel nearby and died while helping the wounded after the towers collapsed.        
	Her family plans to attend this years ceremony on September 11, in which the names of those who died are read out. They had attended the ceremony for two years before her name was omitted.         
	Snehas husband Ronald Lieberman, also a doctor, had moved a Manhattan court to get his wife recognised as a victim of the attacks. Officials had claimed that Sneha, a resident physician at a Staten Island hospital, could have disappeared on her own to escape a troubled marriage.        
	The evidence shows it to be highly probable that she died that morning and at that site, whereas only the rankest speculation leads to any other conclusion, the court said.

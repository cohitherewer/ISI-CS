          LAURA KING                              
	Islamabad, Aug. 18: In Wasif Khans cramped grocery store, the perspiring crowd gathered around the little television set behind the counter erupted in wild cheers when they heard President Pervez Musharraf utter the word resignation.        
	Two taxi drivers hugged each other, then ran straight outside to their cabs to sound their horns in celebration.        
	Musharrafs dramatic declaration, the culmination of months of political turmoil, was part public spectacle and part nation-wide soap opera played out in homes and offices, in teahouses and airline lounges, in sundry shops and mosque courtyards.        
	For perhaps the last time, the country came to a near-total standstill to listen as the President delivered a live address to the nation.        
	Flanked by the national flag and a portrait of the nations founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Musharraf spoke mainly in measured tones. But his voice rose in agitation as he accused his political foes of conducting a vendetta against him.        
	Musharraf, who turned 65 last week, spent an hour extolling the achievements of his nearly nine years in power, including a lengthy roll call of road construction and industrial output, before he finally paused, blinked, looked straight into the camera and announced he would quit.        
	The response was electric and instantaneous.         
	Outside the headquarters of the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, ecstatic supporters waved posters of their slain leader, chanting Bhutto lives! Some wept.         
	Lawyers, who have spearheaded an anti-Musharraf campaign since he tried to sack the chief justice last year, stormed out of courts in Multan shouting Down with the American stooge.

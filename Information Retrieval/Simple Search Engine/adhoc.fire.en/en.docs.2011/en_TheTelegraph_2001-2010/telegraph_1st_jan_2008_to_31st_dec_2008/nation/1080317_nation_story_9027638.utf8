The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PDS dealer in jail for charging Rs 3 extra
                                                                                                               PDS dealer in jail for charging Rs 3 extra
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 16: A Bihar court on Wednesday awarded three years of rigorous imprisonment to a trader for charging (approximately) Rs 3 extra over the stipulated price of sugar and kerosene.         
	The judicial pronouncement that puts Upendra Ram behind bars may spell doom for his family, as Ram is the sole bread-earner of the family.         
	The verdict, which was pronounced on Wednesday, comes 11 years after the case was filed. One Soti Mandal, a resident of Rangatol under Falka block in Katihar district, lodged two separate cases against Ram, a public distribution system (PDS) dealer, on November 27, 1997, and December 6, 1997, in the Katihar district court.         
	Mandal accused Ram of charging Rs 25 for 2kgof sugar against the governments stipulated rate of Rs 11.52 per kg. In the second case, Mandal charged Ram with taking 90 paise excess to the stipulated price of kerosene.         
	The two cases had been troubling Ram and his family to the hilt, as the PDS dealer kept running to the district court for some 11 years and spent more than Rs 10,000 as lawyers charges and court fee.         
	Around 11 years of running from pillar to post proved futile as Katihar chief judicial magistrate Narendra Prasad pronounced the sentence rejecting all his pleas for mercy and sent him to jail, midweek.         
	We have been in trouble ever since he (Upendra Ram) became a PDS dealer. We hoped that the dealership would help us earn enough to maintain our family. But now we have lost everything, said Munni Devi, Rams wife and mother of three children.         
	It would have been better had my husband not got the PDS dealership and had continued to work as a cobbler, she said.        
	Ram got the PDS dealership as he belonged to the cobbler community, as a part of a government policy that grants dealership to BPL families.         
	We have lost faith in judiciary. Its hard to digest a verdict that jails a poor man for three years just for charging Rs 3 extra, cried a relative.         
	He stressed that the family was ready to move the higher courts for relief.         
	While district officials maintain that the order has generated mass resentment among other PDS dealers in the Katihar region, Soti Mandal is a happy man.         
	I am happy with the courts order. The sum of Rs 3 is not the issue. I had lodged the case against Upendra Ram to deter a malpractice, he said.         
	The court has justified my move by granting the punishment. Customers cheated by such traders also belong to economically weak section of the society. We have right to justice as well, said Soti Mandal.

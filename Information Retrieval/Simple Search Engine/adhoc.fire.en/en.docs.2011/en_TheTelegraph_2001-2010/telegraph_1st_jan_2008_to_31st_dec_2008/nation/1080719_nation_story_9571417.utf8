          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 18: The BJP today accused the Congress of spreading cash to lure the fence-sitters and fanning communal passions to split the Opposition ranks.        
	Vijay Kumar Malhotras outburst appeared to have been prompted mainly by the fear that Shibu Soren was slipping out of the NDAs grasp, as well as the confusion among Akali Dal members over whether they should vote against a Sikh Prime Minister.        
	(The) PMO and 10 Janpath have been turned into a mandi (market) and a hunt for saleable commodities is on, Malhotra, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, said.        
	Sources said Soren was using the Oppositions offer of the Jharkhand chief ministers post as a bargaining chip to bag a better deal from the UPA.        
	Although the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief has been non-committal, BJP leaders feel he was inclined to strike an understanding with the UPA because of pressure from his MPs.        
	The sources explained that the JMM members of Parliament would get nothing if Soren became Jharkhand chief minister with NDA support, whereas the UPA was in a position to offer the party something at both the state and central levels.        
	The BJP, which has tried its best to persuade Soren, is now angry with the Congress for offering money, ministerial berths and other kinds of largesse to parties and individual members.        
	Malhotra also accused the Congress of trying to confuse the Akalis in Punjab through a shameful communal game.        
	Congress leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has called for upholding the prestige of the pagdi (turban), and Amarinder Singh has written to (chief minister Parkash Singh) Badal to support the first Sikh Prime Minister. Somebody is holding a religious akhand path in favour of Manmohan Singh. These are blatantly communal acts, Malhotra said.        
	The BJPs strong reaction betrays apprehensions of a split in the Akali Dal, whose leadership today issued a whip to its MPs to vote against the government.

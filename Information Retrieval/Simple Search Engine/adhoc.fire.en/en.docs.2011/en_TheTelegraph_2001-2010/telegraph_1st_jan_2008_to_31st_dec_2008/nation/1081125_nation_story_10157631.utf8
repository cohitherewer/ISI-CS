	Cuttack, Nov. 24: Organisers of the India-England ODI are cautious than ever before as bees will once again make a part of the gallery at Barabati Stadium inaccessible to spectators during the match on Wednesday.        
	Pitch invasions by bees are not totally unheard of at the stadium where honeycombs have been a part of the gallery structures for over a decade. On January 10 last year, players and umpires of an Orissa-Assam Ranji Trophy tie were forced to go to the ground with faces down when a swarm of bees made their way to the playing area. Fortunately, no one was injured. With an ODI between India and West Indies was scheduled the same month (January 24), the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) had taken assistance of bee collectors and experts to do away with the honeycombs. But the honeybees have proliferated again on the outer roof of gallery No. 5 at the Mahanadi end and produced a massive honeycomb.         
	OCA secretary Asirbad Behera said: We are taking steps on priority basis to get rid of the honeycomb to prevent possible bee invasion during the match.        
	Players and umpires had to lie flat on the ground when a swarm of bees invaded the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi on the third day of the third Test between India and Australia on October 31.

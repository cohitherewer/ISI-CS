The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rivals rail at slow Centre
                                                                                                               Rivals rail at slow Centre
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Raj Thackeray moments before his arrest at his residence in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Opposition feels the Centre has bungled in Maharashtra and wants an all-party meeting to discuss the sensitive issue of regional chauvinism.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh told The Telegraph the violent incidents and sectarian rhetoric in the state could affect Indias social fabric.        
	Arguing that the UPA government should have handled the issue with greater maturity, Rajnath said: Such politics will only deepen the crisis of credibility of the political class.        
	The BJP chief stressed the need for a moral and spiritual approach towards such sensitive issues and urged parties not to do anything that could aggravate the situation.         
	What Raj Thackeray said almost amounts to breaking the family of Lord Shiva. Ganesh is Shivas son in Hindu scripture and hence Varanasi (the heartland of Hindi-speaking people) and Mumbai cannot be separated by a political diktat.        
	Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav, who asked for the all-party meeting, was more political in his exposition, questioning the silence of veteran leaders in Maharashtra like Sharad Pawar and Sushil Kumar Shinde.        
	He also criticised cabinet ministers such as Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, who represent Bihar in the Manmohan Singh government, for not mounting pressure on the Congress to act against the perpetrators of the violence.         
	The Dal (U) leader, however, conceded there was little hope from the Congress leadership as Sonia Gandhi and Rahul - both represent Uttar Pradesh in Parliament - maintained a stony silence when the poorest of the poor were being beaten up in Maharashtra.         
	He said the 10-day delay (in Rajs arrest) would not have happened had Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh acted responsibly.         
	The BJP has raised the pitch against the Congress leaderships role since L.K. Advani came out with an unambiguous response to the Maharashtra incidents.         
	Party spokesperson Prakash Javdekar went to the extent of alleging a nexus between the Congress and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief. The Congress has instigated Raj so as to harm the Shiv Sena, he said.         
	The BJP has been attacking the Congress leadership for not doing anything in Assam, where Biharis had been massacred over the last three years.         
	BJP leaders have hailed Advanis categorical response to the crisis in Mumbai despite the risk of annoying the partys oldest ally, the Shiv Sena. They described his conduct as more prime ministerial than any other aspirant for the top job, including Manmohan.         
	The BJP leaders feel the Congress was slow to respond primarily because it had little stake in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

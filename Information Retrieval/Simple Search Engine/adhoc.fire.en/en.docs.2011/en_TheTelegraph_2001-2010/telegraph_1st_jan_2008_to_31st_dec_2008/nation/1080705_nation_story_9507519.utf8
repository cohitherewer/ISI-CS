The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The agony of being Left out   When Samajwadis strike, it must be comrades at the receiving end 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The agony of being Left out     -  When Samajwadis strike, it must be comrades at the receiving end 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                              Sonia Gandhi. File Picture      
	New Delhi, July 4: Suddenly shut out of the power equation and roundly snubbed by a partner that has switched consorts before formal divorce, the CPM must wonder what it is about the strange alchemy of the Congress and the Samajwadi Party that leaves it singed time after time.        
	Nine years ago, when Sonia Gandhi was stood up as Aprils great fool on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, famously claiming a majority of 272 when she had only a minority of 252, the real humiliation had been general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeets.        
	Intent on keeping the BJP out of power, the tireless CPM boss had undertaken a fanatical  and he thought successful  mission to sew up the numbers behind Sonia. But Mulayam Singh Yadav turned all his wiles to woe, vowing support to him in the backrooms and vacating it unabashedly on live television.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee rode to office on that betrayal.        
	Sonia rode home basking in the consolation of victimhood.        
	A stunned Surjeet, who had neither power nor glory to gain from his efforts, could do no more than flail hed been taken for a ride. The buzzing open-house at the Surjeet home in Teen Murti Lane was sullen and shut that evening.        
	Sorry is all he was prepared to say. Sorry but I have nothing to say.                  Mulayam Singh Yadav after meeting Manmohan Singh on Friday. (AP)      
	Today, as the Congresss top in tandem entreated the Samajwadis  Manmohan Singh and Sonia playing separate hosts to Mulayam and Amar Singh  the CPM again bore the wounds of collateral damage.        
	Nine years ago, it was about the Samajwadis slipping away from the Congress despite promise and persuasion. Today, it was about the Samajwadis getting stuck to the Congress despite all dissuasion.        
	The ironies of the emerging compact between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party cant escape too many; for CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, they must have an added bitter ring as he mulls the overnight turn in fortunes from being power behind the throne to being thrown into irrelevance in the UPAs scheme of things.        
	Nowhere did ironies resound as tellingly as in that stray rhetorical jab Amar flung at journalists: But why should Comrade Karat be upset? He is the one who has been wanting us to be with the Congress all this while.        
	That the Samajwadis should have shaken hands with the Congress over a chasm through which the Left has fallen is itself a quirk of realpolitik. Mutual interest, and little else, has driven the Congress and the Samajwadi Party to reverse a relationship thats mostly been about insult and invective.                  Mulayam Singh Yadav with CPM leaders Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet in New Delhi in 2000      
	The Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections were a no-holds-barred slanging match between Sonia and Mulayam, Rahul and Amar. It wound down perhaps only because Mayavati ran away with the prize and suddenly there was no Mulayam-Amar criminal raj in Uttar Pradesh to rail against.        
	And even so, even after Uttar Pradesh had been lost by both, there was little that seemed to settle between the two. If nothing else, there was enduring fuel of that personal affront that kept relations febrile.        
	As the UPA celebrated victory against the run of play in May 2004, Surjeet  again him, the unlearning enthusiast of anti-BJP concord  dragged Amar along to a soiree at 10 Janpath. Never mind that you havent a personal invitation, Im there.         
	Surjeet may not have minded, but Sonia did. Amar was made to cool his heels in the outhouse where the invited guests filed in.        
	It was a slight Amar would never forget, or so it seemed till this afternoon when the unwelcome gatecrasher of 2004 became the courted saviour at 10 Janpath.         
	The thought may have occurred to a sardonic few that Surjeet wasnt around as Sonia welcomed Amar into her study. And successor Karat had verily been cast away. Somehow, the CPM doesnt become the Congress-Samajwadi alchemy.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New opportunities                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Undergraduate and postgraduate biology students from select universities across India may soon get an opportunity to plunge into cutting-edge research to find new drugs.        
	A new consortium strategy to discover drugs against problem diseases launched by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will pick 30 universities, officials said. We want to use the energy and the enthusiasm of the brightest young people, CSIR director general Samir Brahmachari said.        
	The council has just launched its Open Source Drug Discovery programme, which invites researchers from different institutions.        
	Instead of doing repetitive experiments in their practical classes, they could help address real-world problems, Brahmachari said.         
	The drug discovery programme is intended to complement the traditional patent-based method that has failed to find new drugs for diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, kala-azar (leishmaniasis) and dengue.         
	The patent system hasnt worked well for such diseases that affect our part of the world, said science and technology minister Kapil Sibal. This will be a new model for drug discovery and development.        
	Any new drugs developed will be generic, and thus cheaper than patented drugs.        
	Drug discovery problems will be posted as challenges on the programmes website. Researchers from across the world and students from the 30 universities would be asked to pitch solutions.         
	We may ask students to clone a gene or purify a chemical or derive a number of structures from a given chemical structure, said Jyoti Yadav, a protein biochemist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi.         
	This will also allow students to prepare for research careers, Yadav said.         
	The drug discovery consortium has so far picked two of the 30 participating centres  the chemistry department at Saurashtra University and the Institute of Life Sciences in Hyderabad.         
	The first phase of the programme will aim at finding new drugs for tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which is a leading cause of death and for which no new drugs have been discovered since the 1960s.         
	The CSIR hopes to involve about 1,000 BSc or MSc students in the programme. Students may address the research problems as either part of course work or summer projects.

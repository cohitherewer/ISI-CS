          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 28: The Utkal Christian Council has filed a writ petition in Orissa High Court seeking a CBI probe into the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and his associates, expressing doubt over the effectiveness of the judicial inquiry ordered by chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	The petition has reasoned that only a probe by the central agency into the murder and the following statewide violence can reveal the truth, while it has also sought a speedy trial by a special court. It has dubbed the judicial inquiry as pointless.        
	The councils doubt is, apparently, based on the progress made so far by the Justice Basudev Panigrahi Commission appointed by the government to probe into the violence in Khandhamal in December 2007 and its recommended preventive measures. The government had extended the one-man commissions term that lapsed on August 8 by six months as little progress had been made by then. The petition has also sought the rescue and rehabilitation of all victims.        
	In a related development, the high court recently directed the government to ensure security to people and institutions of all communities in Khandhamal by deploying force. A division bench issued the direction on Wednesday while disposing a PIL seeking rehabilitation for the victims of Khandhamal violence and increased protection to the people by deployment of paramilitary forces like CRPF.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Aarushi                                  
	Lucknow, July 13: Mayavati has agreed to act against the state police officers who may have botched the Aarushi Talwar-Hemraj murder probe, but only if the court finds them guilty of lapses.        
	The state police investigated the case for two weeks and some actions were taken. The CBI investigation is still continuing, state principal secretary (home) K.F.B. Singh said.        
	If both the CBI chargesheet and the court judgment indict these officers and action taken by them are found to be uncalled for, the state government would start proceedings against them.        
	Before the case was handed over to the CBI, Noida police had arrested Aarushis father Rajesh, who walked free yesterday after the central agency said it had no evidence against him. Some of his relatives have demanded action against the police officers, most of whom have been transferred.        
	Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today criticised the polices character assassination of Aarushi and her family, and demanded the resignation of additional deputy-general Brij Lal.        
	Those under the scanner are the then Meerut inspector-general, Gurdarshan Singh, then deputy inspector-general P.C. Meena and the then Noida senior superintendent, Satish Ganesh.        
	Gurdarshan had supplied the murder motive saying Rajesh had caught Aarushi and Hemraj in an objectionable position. Ganesh had aired the honour killing theory. Neither took calls from Friday evening through Saturday.        
	The police had egg on their face earlier when they failed to find Hemrajs body on the terrace, and declared him the chief suspect in Aarushis murder.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Bengal today signed a pact to build an airport in Burdwans Andal and the developer said Singapores Changi was keen to operate the new hub.
    
	Under the joint venture development agreement signed by Bengal Aerotropolis Projects with the government, the 2,300 acres needed for the airport will be bought by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation directly from the owners and leased to the developer.
    
	Commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, who signed on behalf of the government, said the developer would have to use the land for the purpose specified. If they fail to complete the project, the land will come back to us. 
    
	Partho Ghosh, director of Bengal Aerotropolis, said the airport would come up within 30 months of the land allotment. We have received a good response from various companies. Changi has written to us expressing interest in operating the airport. Indian (Indian Airlines earlier) has said it would put the airport on its route.
    
	The company has identified 5,000 acres, more than twice the requirement, to ensure that the project goes ahead even if some landowners refuse to sell, Ghosh said. Other than the runway and terminal, everything is flexible. We want to build it with everybodys co-operation.
    
	Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the airport would cater to a large area, setting at rest doubts about its viability in a place like Andal. It is an industrial hub. More steel plants are coming up. The Asansol-Durgapur region (of which Andal is part) cannot be served from Calcutta in future. So, there will be demand.
    
	Ghosh said a study carried out by a research agency has projected 4 lakh travellers from the airport by 2010-11. The results of a pre-feasibility study have been sent to the civil aviation ministry. A techno-economic feasibility report, being prepared by L amp;T Ramboll, will be submitted this month-end for the ministrys final approval.
    
	The initial investment will be around Rs 150 crore, though the total cost will be Rs 10,000 crore, the money being pumped in over seven years. Bengal Aerotropolis will team up with other firms to build parts of the project. 
    
	The construction will take place in three phases. Initially, the runway will be 1,800 metres long, good enough to handle small planes like ATRs. Later, the length will be increased to 3,200 metres, making it suitable for A320s. Night landing facilities will be added later.
    
	A maintenance, repair and overhaul hub and a cargo-handling unit are also planned, as is an aviation academy.

-Court bars concert in silence zone          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Licence to sing: A rock concert in Mumbai in August                
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The Supreme Court has said sleep, rest and silence are biological necessities and refused to relax noise-pollution norms to allow musical soirees at Mumbais lone open-air theatre, Rang Bhavan.                          
	Bombay High Court had banned loudspeaker use within 100 metres of a hospital or educational institution, areas known as silence zones, in September 2003 and the apex court had upheld the order.        
	F.K. Wadia, the CEO of Power Productions, an audio studio and concert promoter, had sought to book Rang Bhavan for an Independence Day rock concert in 2004. The state government-run theatre, which falls in a silence zone, can seat up to 4,000 people and charges only a nominal fee.        
	Rang Bhavan authorities denied Wadias request citing the high court order and Noise Pollution (Control amp; Regulation) Rules, 2000, which ban loudspeakers in silence zones. The Azad Maidan police station and the directorate of cultural affairs reaffirmed the Rang Bhavan decision.        
	Wadia challenged the decision in the high court but lost the case. He then approached the Supreme Court.         
	He claimed Rang Bhavan should not fall in a silence zone and that some educational institutions and hospitals were themselves using loudspeakers. He urged the apex court to allow the theatre, virtually unused since the high court ruling, to stage concerts and other cultural programmes.        
	Wadias lawyer also argued that Rang Bhavan, even if it fell in a silence zone, should get an exemption since it was not possible to hold a musical event at any other place in Mumbai at such low rates. But the apex court refused to do so.        
	A citizen has certain rights, (these) being necessity of silence, necessity of sleep and rest, which are biological necessities and essential for health. Silence is considered to be golden. It is considered one of the human rights as noise is injurious to health which is required to be preserved at any cost, it said last Friday.        
	Wadia had said he would hold the concert between 6pm and 9pm. The court said that states had the power to grant exemption from the loudspeaker rule (which bans their use from 10.30pm to 6am), but not in silence zones.

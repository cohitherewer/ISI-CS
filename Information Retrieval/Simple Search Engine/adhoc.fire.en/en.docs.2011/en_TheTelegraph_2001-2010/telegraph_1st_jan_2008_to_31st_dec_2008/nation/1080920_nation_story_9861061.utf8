  - Varsity will decide whether to teach essay: SC        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Supreme Court has left it to Delhi Universitys vice-chancellor and its academic council to decide whether a controversial essay on Ramayan should be taught in the history course.        
	Three Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation, written by the late poet A.K. Ramanujam, has been part of the universitys history course since 2005.        
	This year, the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and other organisations staged protests on the campus saying some references to Hanuman in the essay were offensive.        
	Several individuals had filed a petition in Delhi High Court seeking to have the article withdrawn from the course.        
	But the high court refused to entertain the plea on the ground that it was not the legitimate or competent authority to take a decision on the matter. The petitioners then moved the Supreme Court.         
	The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the BJPs student wing, had accused historian Upinder Singh, Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs daughter, of compiling the text that includes the essay. The Prime Ministers Office later clarified that Upinder, who teaches in the universitys history department, had nothing to do with the articles inclusion in the course.         
	The university referred the matter to an experts committee, but that is yet to submit a report.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan today said it was up to the vice-chancellor to refer the matter to the universitys academic council or any other competent authority.        
	The apex court added the vice-chancellor would give those opposed to the article an opportunity to make a representation before the experts committee. On receipt of the (committees) report, the VC will refer it to the academic council or any other competent authority, the bench said.         
	Anyone who has a grievance after the varsity takes a decision can approach the court, the judges said, after hearing the petitioners arguments.         
	The petitioners counsel, M.N. Krishnamani, described the essay as derogatory, defamatory and hurtful to the sentiments of Hindus.         
	Hindus are passive, weak-minded and do not resist. Therefore, their sentiments can be easily hurt, he argued, daring the university to teach a similar sacrilegious piece about any other religion.        
	The article claims that Sita was born out of Ravans nose when he had sneezed.         
	The obvious motive behind prescribing such course material is to distract young minds from their revered gods and goddesses, Krishnamani said.

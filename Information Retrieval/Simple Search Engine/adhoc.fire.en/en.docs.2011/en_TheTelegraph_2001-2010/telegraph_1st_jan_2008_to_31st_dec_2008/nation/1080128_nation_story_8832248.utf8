                                                                                                            Union nod to Bihar IIT plot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 27: The governments of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have received the nod from Union human resources ministry to start the process of selecting a temporary campus before the admissions for the first batch of IIT students.         
	The Union ministry informed Bihar that the new batch would be based in the temporary campus, till the former finalises the permanent area. With the Union green signal, Bihars IIT dream seems tangible.         
	Bihar human resources secretary Ajay Kumar confirmed the news.        
	The government has received a formal letter from the Union human resources ministry to start with the temporary campus before receiving the first batch of students. We have started the process over 500-600 acres, some 100km from Patna, more towards the west, he said.         
	The campus would have separate hostels for boys and girls and residential quarters for teachers and staff.         
	Sources in the human resources department said only a few students would be admitted in the first batch for a limited number of disciplines.         
	Andhra Pradesh government also received a similar nod, while Rajasthan would have to wait for its political heavyweights battle it out to select the campus before it receives the nod.         
	It seems that each politician wants the Iit to come up in their home constituencies.         
	A similar controversy arose in Bihar, too, when IIT-Roorki experts raised questions regarding the suitability of a Bihata land (on Patnas outskirts) pointing out to waterlogging problems. The teams sought a hydrological profile of the area.         
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad, too, added fuel to the controversy by stating that he was interested in shifting the proposed site to Chapra  the constituency he presents in the Lok Sabha. But the bickerings seems to have died, at least for now. Kumar said they ready to start classes.        
	Everything is settled now. We are set to receive the first batch in the next academic session. The problems of logistics and permanent campus will be solved in due course, the human resources secretary added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Magadh University                                  
	Gaya, Aug. 17: The division commissioner (DC) of Magadh, K.P. Rammaiah, is likely to submit the inquiry report into the alleged lapses in the Magadh University (MU) appointments to the government within a couple of days.         
	Earlier, the government had given a weeks time to the DC and his deadline expired on August 12.         
	The need to conduct an inquiry was felt after officials found discrepancies in 187 appointments made across departments and colleges.        
	It was alleged that before the appointments were made finalised, no advertisement was issued, no interview boards were constituted and appointments were without the compliance of the reservation rules.        
	Some of the colleges and department that are under the DC scrutiny are BS College, Danapur, JLN College, Khagaul, Arvind Mahila College, Patna, AM Law College, Gaya, the university botany department and the MU library.        
	Though the DC is tight-lipped about the findings, sources believe that he found evidence of irregularities and rule violation pertaining to the Sections 10 and 35 of the Bihar Universities Act.         
	MU Vice-Chancellor B.N. Pandey, in a letter written to the DC on August 14, 2008, admitted that reports of irregularities had been received.         
	The letter also stated that the appointments had since then been cancelled.         
	However, the letter does not mention the identities of those who made these appointments or the steps taken by the university against those responsible.        
	The issue was first raised a couple of months ago by JD(U) MLA Jagdish Sharma at the university senate meeting. The matter was again raised at the monsoon session of the Bihar Legislative Council.         
	The HRD department subsequently referred the matter to the division commissioner for inquiry.        
	A social group called Jan Jagran Manch has submitted a six-page charter of demands addressed to the Chancellor-cum-Governor, R.L. Bhatia, demanding a thorough probe into the university affairs. The manch also demanded an inquiry into the movable and immovable assets of the vice-chancellor. Copy of the memorandum has been sent to the Income Tax commissioner for a follow-up.

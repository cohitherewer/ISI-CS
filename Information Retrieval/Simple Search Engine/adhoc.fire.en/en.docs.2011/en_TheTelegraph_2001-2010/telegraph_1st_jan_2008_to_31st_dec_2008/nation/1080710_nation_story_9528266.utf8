          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, July 9: Communal tension gripped tribal-dominated Khandhamal district yesterday after a lull of six months yesterday, but there were no reports of major incidents of violence or casualty.        
	The BJP and VHP, however, called a 12-hour district bandh today over the issue of cow slaughter.        
	The situation is under control now and measures have been taken to prevent violence, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik today.        
	Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahu and deputy inspector-general of police (southern range) R.P. Koche have rushed to the district, said the chief minister.        
	Todays bandh passed off without major incidents, even as there was palpable tension, said Kandhamal police superintendent Nikhil Kanoria.        
	Shops, schools and some banks were closed during the bandh and vehicles were off the streets. The bandh affected Tumudibandha, Baliguda, Kotagarh, Raikia, G. Udaygiri and Phulbani.         
	The district had witnessed intense communal strife in December 2007, in which three persons were killed and houses, schools, hospitals and churches were burnt.        
	This time, the tension erupted in Tumudibandh area, which was almost unaffected by the communal carnage last time.        
	While last time there was communal tension during Christmas celebrations, the contentious issue of cow slaughter triggered tension this time.        
	Reports from the district said a group of armed people reportedly assaulted Bula Baba of Jalespatta Vanavasi Kalyam Ashram, run by VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati, in Malipada when Baba protested against the practise of cow slaughter. The VHP leader has begun a hunger strike from today.        
	As news spread, ashram residents with VHP activists blocked the NH-217, connecting Berhampur with Raipur. Laxmanananda Saraswati, who was present in the ashram, staged a dharna in front of the Tumudibandha police station demanding the arrest of the culprits.

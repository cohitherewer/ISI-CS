	Vienna, July 18 (Reuters): Senior US and Indian officials met the International Atomic Energy Agency chief on Friday and briefed IAEA governors to resolve questions about Indias plan for expanded nuclear inspections.        
	India negotiated the safeguards scheme with IAEA experts and the text is to be considered by the UN watchdogs 35-nation governing board in a special August 1 session.         
	Indian foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon consulted with IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei on Friday hours before an afternoon briefing with agency governors as well as delegates from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).        
	Mostly technical questions came up at the briefing but no participants expressed opposition against the safeguards proposal, according to a diplomat who attended the meeting. Menon and diplomats coming out of the meeting had no comment.        
	Technical questions were posed by a number of countries and Menon addressed them all, the diplomat said. He stressed that this was a standard safeguards agreement under the IAEA statute.        
	ElBaradei also received US undersecretary of state William Burns for talks on India. Burns was making a brief stopover in Vienna en route to Geneva where he will join talks with Iran on its disputed atomic work.        
	ElBaradei has endorsed the US-Indian deal as a boost for non-proliferation and peaceful use of relatively clean nuclear energy in the developing world. IAEA lawyers have vetted the India inspections draft as consistent with safeguards standards.

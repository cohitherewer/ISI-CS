	New Delhi, July 23: Delhi Sikhs seem to be loving the new warrior robes Manmohan Singh flaunted yesterday.        
	Long used to watching a genteel politician on television, many in the community were excited to see the Prime Minister cross swords with his detractors, their way.        
	Changa munda hai, har baat ka usne muh tor jawab diya is baar (hes a strong lad, he replied strongly to each allegation this time), gushed Yatharth Puran Singh, alluding to L.K. Advanis jibes in the confidence debate.        
	The 65-year-old retired government employee in east Delhis Lakshmi Nagar lamented not having had the chance to hear the Prime Minister, because of the ruckus over bribery charges, but he relished the text of his speech.        
	Among the biggest draws in the speech is Singhs advice to the BJPs shadow Prime Minister, Advani. At his ripe old age, I do not expect Advani to change his thinking. But for his and Indias sake, I urge him to change his astrologers, Singh had said.        
	Many cant seem to have enough of the sarcasm. One of them is Jaspreet Singh. That was superb. Even a month ago, I couldnt have imagined the Prime Minister say such scathing things. He has given it back to the Opposition in their language, he said.        
	Jaspreet, doing his post-graduation in political science at Delhi University, also feels the Prime Ministers combative attitude has helped him defy his 76 years.        
	He looks younger these days. He stood his ground and emerged a leader who isnt afraid to take risks. As a Sikh, I am proud of Manmohan. I like this aggressive man who doesnt take things lying down, Jaspreet said.        
	Tarvinder Singh, 21, who owns a gift shop in the Khan Market, cant seem to get over Advanis nikamma (worthless) swipe. How can anyone call him the weakest Prime Minister and a nikamma? Advani not only insulted him but also the people of the country. I would never have respected him if he hadnt rebuffed that.        
	Some are uneasy, though, Manmohan quoted Guru Gobind Singh in his speech, pointing out that he had invoked him only when in trouble.

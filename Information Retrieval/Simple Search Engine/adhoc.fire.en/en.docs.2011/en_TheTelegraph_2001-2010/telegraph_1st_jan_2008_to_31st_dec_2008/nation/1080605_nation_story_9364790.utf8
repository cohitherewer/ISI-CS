          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, June 4: In the wake of allegations of tender fixing and murders of contractors by tender mafia, the government has decided to go in for a safer option of e-tendering from July 1.         
	We will be switching from the manual tendering to e-tendering, said state information technology secretary P.K. Mohapatra. Mohapatra said that the e-tendering would be introduced in four engineering departments  water resources, works, rural development and housing and urban development  for the first phase of the plan.         
	The departments account for 90 per cent (approximately) of the construction works executed by the government in Orissa. The decision to opt for e-tendering was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today.         
	This will make the system more transparent and prevent tender fixing and corruption, said chief secretary Ajit Tripathy.         
	Contractors, in the past few years, often were at the receiving end of the mafia, especially in Kendrapara and Bhubaneswar, cases that exposed the existence of a tender fixing racket. With the introduction of e-tendering, contractors need not purchase and submit tenders physically. Tenders worth more than Rs 50 lakh will be floated through government website.        
	Contractors will access the portal and download the tender papers and will then submit the tenders on line. Gradually, the process will be extended to procurement of goods and services, confirmed the IT secretary. The system was introduced in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu recently.         
	S.K. Panda, the director of National Informatics Centre, sad the centre would be providing technical support for the system.

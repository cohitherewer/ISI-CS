          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Parthiv Patel during the match. (Gajanan Dudhalkar)                                  
	Mumbai, June 1: The discovery of low-intensity crude explosives in a theatre hall in Vashi last night prompted police to step up security for the Indian Premier League final at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.         
	Today, over 1,500 men were deployed by Navi Mumbai police at the stadium in Nerul, which is about 10km from the spot where the explosives were found.         
	At least three bomb detection squads along with dogs were inside and around the stadium where the Chennai Super Kings clashed with the Rajasthan Royals.         
	With them were several police officials in civvies to ensure nothing untoward occurred in the 54,000-capacity arena. No bags, water bottles or mobile phones were allowed in, police sources said.        
	The police have not come up with any leads on the explosives, found by a spectator during the staging of a Marathi play.        
	The low-intensity explosives, containing gelatine sticks, a white powder suspected to be ammonium nitrate, a timer device for detonation and a circuit, were found between the rows of seats at the Vishnudas Bhave Natyagruha in Vashi.         
	Four gelatine sticks were attached to a timer device along with two detonators and 1kg of the white powder mixed with kerosene, police sources said. The bomb detection squad took the bomb to a ground and defused it.         
	We are yet to find eyewitnesses , said Navi Mumbai police commissioner Ramrao Wagh. The police said had the bomb exploded, it would not have done much damage, but created panic and possibly led to a stampede.

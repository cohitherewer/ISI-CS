                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CPM asserts right to strike 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The CPM politburo today distanced itself from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees anti-bandh remarks but some in the party seemed to suggest unions could consider keeping essential services and IT firms out of strikes.        
	The CPM firmly stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right. It has consistently supported the all-India general strikes of the trade unions against the neo-liberal policies of the central government, the politburo said in a statement here.         
	On Tuesday, the Bengal chief minister had told a Calcutta business gathering that he kept mum when his party called bandhs but would speak up next time.        
	Todays politburo statement, to disassociate itself from certain remarks made by comrade Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in a meeting of the Assocham, was meant to clarify the partys stand on bandhs. It came a day after CPM Bengal secretary Biman Bose said people did not go on strikes for fun or a whim but as a last resort.        
	Citu, the partys labour arm, had denounced the chief ministers remarks hours after he had spoken to the barons, terming the anti-bandh line his personal opinion.        
	But, in a sign that a relaxation could be offered to some businesses in Bengal and Kerala, there seems to be a view that unions can decide if bandh exemptions are necessary.        
	Unions should sit together to think about how to deal with the issues of essential services and 24x7 industries like IT in the event of a strike, Kerala industry minister Elamaram Kareem said, when asked whether strikes were coming in the way of industrialisation.         
	Kareem, a former Citu leader, is holding presentations before industrialists and diplomats in Delhi on the advantages of setting up ventures in Kerala.

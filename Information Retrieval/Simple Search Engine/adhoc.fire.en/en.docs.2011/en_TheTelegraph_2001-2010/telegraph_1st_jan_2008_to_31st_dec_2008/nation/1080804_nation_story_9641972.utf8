	Colombo, Aug. 3: The faces of Manmohan Singhs security officials suddenly turned ashen yesterday  a man with a gun was running after the Prime Ministers convoy.        
	It was an unthinkable breach of security: Singh wasnt yet out of Sri Lankas presidential secretariat after a meeting with President Mahinda Rajapaksa.        
	More panic: the man had caught up with one of the rear cars and was tapping on its window. His security forces uniform was clearly visible.        
	This in a country where a naval rating had swung his rifle butt at then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 21 years ago in an assassination bid before TV cameras.        
	But yesterdays incident  reported by The Sunday Leader today while another newspaper mentioned a second security lapse involving national security adviser M.K. Narayanan  ended amid sighs of relief and a few red faces.        
	Unlike the navy man who attacked Rajiv, senior superintendent of police Kapila Jayasekera bore the current Indian leader no ill-will. He was merely trying to take his job of protecting the Prime Minister seriously.        
	The confusion could have been avoided had Jayasekera, assigned Singhs personal security officer during car journeys, been equally serious a few minutes earlier. But he had gone missing when Singh emerged from the meeting with Rajapaksa and climbed into his car, The Sunday Leader reported quoting sources.        
	The newspaper said that when the SSPs absence was noticed, an Indian security officer, who was in a back-up vehicle, got into the Prime Ministers car.        
	That was when Jayasekera re-appeared on the scene and, seeing Singhs convoy had begun moving, made his ill-timed dash. Rajapaksa later questioned the SSP and told him to be more alert in the future, the paper said.        
	Another newspaper, The Sunday Times, reported that Rajapaksa had ordered an inquiry.        
	It also said that Narayanans guards, car and escort vehicles had failed to turn up at the Saarc conference hall the same day, forcing him to take a cab to his hotel.        
	When the sessions got over on the summits opening day, Narayanan waited for a while at the entrance of the hall. He then hailed a taxi seeing that it was carrying the logo of Taj Samudra, the hotel he was staying at.        
	Narayanan persuaded the driver to drive him back to the hotel, the report said. Deputy inspector-general S.M. Wickremasinghe, who is in charge of security, later met Narayanan and apologised.        
	The Sunday Times said the lapses annoyed the visiting Indian team and high commission officials here. No Indian or Sri Lankan official was, however, immediately available for comment on the newspaper reports.

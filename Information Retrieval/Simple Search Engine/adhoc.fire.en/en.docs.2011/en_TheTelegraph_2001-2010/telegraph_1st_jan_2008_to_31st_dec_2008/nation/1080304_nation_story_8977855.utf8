 - Cloud seeding to combat drought in Bundelkhand

	Lucknow, March 3: The Uttar Pradesh government will turn to artificial rain-making in Bundelkhand to combat a four-year-old drought.
    
	Help will be sought from Andhra Pradesh scientists who have caused rain successfully over the past decade, state agriculture minister Laxmi Narayan told The Telegraph today.
    
	Well do it within the next two months to save the lives of the people and cattle. Seven officials visited Andhra recently to study the process, and handed in their report to chief secretary P.K. Mishra last week, Narayan said.
    
	We have allocated Rs 20 crore for the first phase, which will aim to moisten the soil across a 50km stretch in the two worst-hit districts, Banda and Chitrakoot.
    
	In India, artificial rain-making was first tried in Visakhapatnam in the nineties by scientists led by T. Shivaji Rao, director of the Centre for Environmental Studies under the Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (Gitam) in the port city. The experiment led to moderate rain within hours.
    
	Raos team had seeded the clouds with silver iodide fumes from the ground and common salt from the air. The technique was later used successfully in Hyderabad and drought-prone Anantapur district.
    
	The scientists say the technique is not expensive at all, costing 75 paise per 1,000 litres of rainwater produced.
    
	Officials said cloud seeding might at least moisten Bundelkhands soil enough to revive its greenery. If done on a large scale, it may help produce a good crop during the next monsoon season. It can also mitigate the harrowing summer.
    
	The average rainfall in Bundelkhands seven districts has been 3mm over the past four years, and the water table has sunk very low. 
    
	Unofficial estimates put farmer suicides in the region to at least 750 during this period.
    
	The prolonged drought has caused extensive migration, with those staying behind surviving on a money order economy. Adult males work as daily wagers in other states and send money home for the women and children.
    
	Mile after mile of farmland lies barren in Banda and Chitrakoot. The grass has disappeared, with no food left for the cattle. The condition in Lalitpur, Jalaun and Jhansi is nearly as bad, while Hamirpur and Mahoba are slightly better off.
    
	Artificial rain is produced by injecting clouds with expensive chemicals like silver iodide or cheaper ones like solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) or finely powdered common salt. It causes rainless clouds to become heavy and burst.
    
	The chemicals can be sprayed from aircraft, fired from the ground on rockets, or sent up as fumes from a furnace. The technique is used in several countries, including the US, China and Russia.

  - Boost to steel plant amp; bauxite mine stalled over land         OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Supreme Court has struck a blow for industrialisation at a time a land-acquisition debate is raging in Bengal by clearing two long-delayed projects in Orissa involving diversion of large swathes of forest land.        
	A green bench today allowed South Korean steel giant Posco the use of 2,900 acres of forests in Jagatsinghpur to build a Rs 51,000-crore plant  Indias largest foreign investment  and Sterlite India Limited to mine bauxite in hills held sacred by an ancient tribe.        
	But local opposition from farmers and tribals, fiercely protective of their land, is expected to continue.        
	Orissa had promised Posco 4,004 acres of land  three-fourths of it forests  but so far managed to provide just a few hundred acres amid resistance from villagers, who barricaded roads in a Nandigram-style war and kidnapped company officials.        
	Since forests cannot be diverted for non-forest use without apex court permission, the matter was placed before a court-appointed committee, whose clearance the bench endorsed today.        
	The bauxite-mining project of Sterlite, a subsidiary of Britains Vedanta Resources Plc, was cleared after the company pledged over Rs 100 crore for ecology, wildlife and tribal development around the site in Kalahandis Niyamgiri district.        
	The stand-offs over the projects reflect a larger anger among Indian farmers and tribes fighting to save their land from factories as the countrys economic priorities shift from agriculture to industry.        
	We will continue our protest; we will not give up our land, said Prasant Paikray, an anti-Posco leader who claimed the plant would displace 20,000 people.        
	Even if you kill us we will not give up Niyamgiri. Our souls are in Niyamgiri, our food, water, homes are in Niyamgiri, Jairam, an activist of the Dongria Kondh tribe, said outside the court after the Sterlite ruling.        
	Sterlite wants to dig open-cast mines on a 660-acre site to feed a refinery it has built nearby and is running with bauxite bought from other states. The local Dongria Kondhs say the mines will destroy the hills they consider sacred, force them from their homes and destroy their forest-dependent livelihoods.        
	Environment groups say both projects threaten bio-diversity, and are worried the bauxite mine will disrupt key water sources that supply springs and streams and feed two rivers that irrigate large tracts of farmland.        
	The companies welcomed the milestone court order. Posco India will build the most exemplary steel plant in Orissa, executive director U.B. Patnaik said.        
	The (Sterlite) project will bring significant employment and economic livelihood for the local people and overall development for the region, said C.V. Krishnan, a senior Vedanta Group official.        
	Poscos project, expected to produce 12 million tonnes of steel a year, had been left hanging for over two years after it signed an agreement with the Orissa government in July 2005.        
	Its plan to lease an iron-ore mine too had gone awry with the state-run Kudremukh Iron Ore Company laying stake to the Kandahar mines. But Posco told the court today the Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC) had promised uninterrupted iron-ore supplies from a nearby site.        
	The court had initially refused to clear the proposal by Sterlite, which has the OMC as its joint-venture partner, saying Vedanta was a UK-based company and could not be held to its commitments made in court.        
	On the courts suggestion, Sterlite then submitted a proposal committing itself to earmarking 5 per cent of its net profit or Rs 10 crore, whichever was higher, for tribal development. It also pledged Rs 55 crore as net present value of the land and another Rs 50.3 crore for conservation and management of ecology and wildlife in the area.

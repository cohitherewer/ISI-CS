	Bero, Nov. 14: All students have left Rajkiya Adivasi High School where five boarders died yesterday after having milk served with the afternoon snack of chira and bananas.         
	Ranchi deputy commissioner Rajiv Arun Ekka and the special secretary in the welfare department, B.C. Nigam, visited the government-run residential school in Bero, 45km from Ranchi, to persuade students to stay. But parents who had rushed to take their children home would not hear of it.        
	I will not send my child back. I do not want him to eat unsafe food. I would rather educate him in my own village, said Gopal Oraon, of Lamkana village, pointing to the dirty kitchen with broken doors and windows.         
	A dead cat, who parents said had drunk the same milk, lay on the deserted campus.        
	All the teachers fled after 76 of the schools 248 children fell ill yesterday.         
	Doctors at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, where 23 critically ill students and the hostel superintendent were brought, said toxicology test reports were still awaited. Eleven students were moved to Apollo Hospital because their condition was not improving.         
	It appears to be a case of food poisoning, said Tulsi Mahto,the head of the forensic sciences department at RIMS.        
	Pratima Devi, a widow supplying milk to the school for two years, was arrested today. But villagers blamed the school. One boy, Mange Bhagat of Class IX, drank the milk soon after Pratima handed it over to the school. He is fine, said Kedar Tiger, a villager. The milk became poisonous between 10am and 4pm.        
	About 5km away, a mother was saying her final goodbye to her son. After the Puja holidays, I could not see off my child when he left for school. I had never thought I would live to see this day, cried Parvati, the mother of Surendra Bhagat, a Class VIII student.         
	The sister of his classmate Jackson Minz would not stop crying. Her brother was the only family she had, their parents having died earlier. We dont know what to do how to stop her, said a villager in Makunda, 20km away.        
	All Childrens Day programmes were cancelled and the state set up a four-member team to probe the incident.

          AMIT ROY                           Gujral                                  
	London, July 9: Gurmeet Singh Gujral, a property dealer from India, has arrived in the UK to look at houses in the 1-2.5 million bracket in London, Manchester and Birmingham, pick them up at bargain prices while the British housing market is depressed, convert them into flats and sell them mostly to Indians at a discount.         
	Gujral will make the apartments attractive to Indians by including such features as a Puja room and somewhere to store outside shoes near the entrance  extras that British developers have so far not thought of incorporating into their designs.         
	We dont bring our outside shoes into the house, he points out.         
	Gujral, 32, who is the managing director of a Delhi-based company, Maryada, Projects amp; Developers Pvt Ltd, has been hunting for large houses to buy, accompanied by his general manager (marketing), Pushpinder Ahluwalia, who will be shifting from India to set up a base in London.         
	With house prices continuing to tumble across the UK, as the country heads for a recession, Gujral reckons he can pick up properties suitable for development at between 20 per cent and 30 per cent below the levels they were fetching even six months ago.         
	Sipping a Coca Cola in the caf of the National Film Theatre on the South Bank, he looks at Londons impressive skyline by the Thames and declares: There is potential here. This is the time when you can get good bargains when its a buyers market.         
	Gujral intends selling his redeveloped apartments at between 350,000 and 400,000, which he hopes will be below the prevailing market price in order to encourage quick turnover.         
	Having been in the property business for 10 years, he is modest enough to admit he is not in the big DLF league but predicts: The property market in the UK will go down, stabilise and then go up again. If we dont immediately sell, we can rent them out.         
	The conveyancing, searches and compliance with UK law will be the responsibility of Ajit Mishra, resident partner at FoxMandal Little, the Indian legal firm which has established an office in the City of London. He does not think Gujral will have any difficulty raising the money for the purchases from British banks, even though the lending institutions have cut back on what they are prepared to give to ordinary buyers.         
	Mishra, who is to be a fiduciary director until Maryada can established a UK branch, says that since Gujral is cash rich enough to put down a 40 per cent deposit  the sums have apparently all been cleared by the Reserve Bank of India  British banks have indicated they will be more than happy to come up with the rest.         
	His client, he adds, has offered 2.5 million on a large Victorian property in Queens Park, north London.         
	Mishra also discloses that Maryada had brought a team of 15 Indian craftsmen, including carpenters, electricians and plumbers, into the Czech Republic, who could also be used in the UK, although local British firms would be employed on structural changes.         
	However, since the Home Office may be reluctant to give work permits to Indian craftsmen, arguing British workers should be employed, Gujral concedes: If we dont get the work permits, we will employ British workers.         
	He may not be aware that British workers have the reputation of wanting to exert themselves even less than the babus of Writers Building in Calcutta, since they like to begin the day with a leisurely breakfast, followed by 10 minutes for tea and a cigarette, followed by stoppage for rain, when it is time for lunch, and when they return, its almost time to pack up.         
	Gujral may be happier with the Indians though he would risk negative coverage in local papers if he paid them at rates lower than those of their British counterparts.         
	Gujral has been looking at the way the British live and isnt impressed.         
	There is hardly room to move in the bedrooms, he observes. They should be, at least, 10ft by 10ft. I will also make the kitchens bigger.         
	Looking to the future, Gujral says he wants to build service apartments in London for Indians who come to the UK for holiday or business.         
	What he plans to do certainly makes a change from the more normal business of selling homes in India to NRIs.         
	At the moment, I am just dipping my toe in the UK property market, he says.

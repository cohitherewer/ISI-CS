          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A congested Delhi road                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: A 5.6km bus corridor aimed at easing Delhis traffic chaos has ended up creating more serpentine snarls than usual.        
	The Bus Rapid Transport System that faced the first onslaught of rush-hour traffic on Monday left commuters fuming as it took them two extra hours to get past the corridor that starts from Ambedkarnagar and ends near Greater Kailash.        
	It is a mess, said Ramesh Rai, a commuter.         
	There is no discipline at all. The concept may have worked in Pune and Indore, but in Delhi we are dividing up a road that already has a huge volume of traffic. No wonder people have to wait for hours to get past it.        
	The corridor, built by dividing up the road into lanes with dividers, aims at giving buses priority and encouraging motorists to give up their cars.        
	So far, however, the corridor has found few supporters, and with lane driving not a habit with Delhi drivers, there was chaos on the streets on Monday.        
	Yesterday, the Delhi government set implementing agencies a 48-hour deadline to set things right. It also modified the only-buses stricture, allowing commercial passenger vehicles  taxis, autorickshaws and school buses  to use the corridor.        
	This led to confusion among traffic marshals, tasked with ensuring that vehicles move in the right lane. While one marshal claimed only buses could ply in the corridor, another disagreed.        
	Despite this, things were a little better. People are at least following the lanes, said a traffic marshal. There were problems during rush hour and traffic was slow, but at the moment it is manageable.        
	Policemen posted along the corridor agreed there was less chaos yesterday but said in private the scheme was doomed to failure.        
	The moment we take away our force, there will be lawlessness on the road again, a cop said.        
	Designed by IIT, the corridor was initially meant to be for high-speed buses of high capacity. But this plan was shelved after differences arose between chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Union minister of state Ajay Maken.        
	Government officials said the chaos on the first two days was just teething trouble. Delhiites are a pampered lot, said chief secretary Rakesh Mehta. They are used to getting things easily and when they have to endure a little pain they get upset. Things will settle down soon.

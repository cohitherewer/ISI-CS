	A large number of policemen and private security personnel engaged by the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) toiled hard during the sale to manage the huge crowd. Heavy rush was witnessed at the counter for low-priced tickets. The tickets were priced at Rs 500, Rs 400 and Rs 200 for gallery class and Rs 1,500 for special enclosure. The other denominations ranged from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for seats near the pavilion.        
	Over 11,500 tickets were sold out by 1pm. In fact, tickets for two of the four galleries were exhausted by then, said a UCO bank official at the counter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Massage in Modi message
                                                                                                            Massage in Modi message
  - Gujarat CM exceeds brief to praise BJP high command        SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani with Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Narendra Modi is staying local but speaking national.        
	Taking the podium to report on his states achievements, Modi exceeded the brief of BJP chief ministers at the partys national council meeting, holding forth on issues of vital concerns to India, challenging the Prime Minister and patting the Prime-Minister-in waiting.        
	Modi devoted time to many topics except Gujarat, bolstering his image as the first among equals in the BJPs line-up of chief ministers.        
	The audience sat spellbound: even Rajnath Singh, who kept reminding other chief ministers of the time limit, gave Modi a free run on what could be described as the party presidents or L.K. Advanis territory.        
	Not that Modi spoiled anybodys party. He hailed Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, scotching rumours on the threat to the national leaders stemming from his fierce ambition.        
	The chief ministers comments suggested that he wanted to send a message that he was not an obstacle in Advanis pursuit but a soldier who could be relied upon.        
	He said the national political discourse should not revolve around who the tallest leader in the BJP was but should try to find out if any party had someone better to offer than Advani. He eulogised Advanis political skills and vision as he argued that he was the best candidate for Prime Minister.        
	In the process, Modi raised a larger political question about leadership by nomination. In an obvious reference to the Congress, he said the BJPs leader was not nominated because of dynasty but was a product of the democratic process.        
	He said Advani had struggled for decades and reached where he was because of perseverance and tapasya. Using the lotus metaphor, he said: Kamal ki pavitrata jag jahir hai. Utni hi pavitrata hai Advani ki. (Advani is as clean and pious as the lotus, the partys symbol).        
	Modi said the BJP was indebted to former Prime Minister Vajpayee for his enormous contribution and he could not be forgotten. But the biggest leaders were those who left behind able successors and Vajpayee had done that by anointing Advani as candidate for Prime Minister, he added.         
	He also seemed to have read the current mood in the BJP and appeared to be biding time before making a foray into Delhi.        
	On the other hand, Modi launched an attack on the Congress-led government on issues ranging from terrorism to development. He asked the Prime Minister what he had done to curb terrorism and challenged the finance minister to tell the real story behind the 9 per cent growth rate.         
	He said the exclusion of the NDA-ruled states would demolish the growth story as the performance of the UPA-ruled states was pathetic. He has often claimed that Gujarats phenomenal success was a significant contributory factor in Indias economic strides.         
	Modis charge of discrimination by the Centre was echoed by other chief ministers like Vasundhara Raje of Rajasthan, Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh and Shivraj Singh Chauhan of Madhya Pradesh.        
	But Modi had the remedy for this. He thundered: They harassed me. But the Congress got the answer in Gujarat. It will get the same answer elsewhere, too.

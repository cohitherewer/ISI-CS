	 Calcutta, June 27: The unrest in the Darjeeling hills has hit the aviation industry hard. Low passenger load on its flights between Calcutta and Bagdogra has forced Air India to withdraw the services from July 1 to September 30.          
	The airline operates flights between the two destinations thrice a week  on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.          
	Currently, there are hardly any passengers on either way and so the flights are being withdrawn temporarily, an Air India spokesperson said in Calcutta today. The 145-seat aircraft is flying with hardly 25 per cent passenger load for the past few weeks.           
	Aviation industry sources say Jet Airways and Deccan, the two other airlines operating in the sector, are also having the same problem.                  
	New Delhi: The CBI has made its third arrest in the Aarushi Talwar murder case. The agency arrested Rajkumar, the domestic help of the Durranis  family friends of the Talwars, following the recovery of a bloodstained T-shirt from his room on June 13. The Durranis have declined to comment. Krishna, another accused, has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days.

	 Mumbai (PTI): The city police have launched a special project to curb drug addiction among slum dwellers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll boycott, without force
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Poll boycott, without force
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, July 10: Militant outfits calling for a poll boycott have opposed the use of force to attain their objective, a first in Jammu and Kashmirs 20 years of insurgency.        
	Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Muhammad Sayeed today said it was wrong to stop voters at gunpoint, his declaration coming six months after the Hizbul chief gave the same call. Elections in the state are due this year.        
	It is wrong to stop someone at gunpoint from casting his vote, said Sayeed, who heads the Pakistan-based Jamat-ud Dawa but is considered the Lashkar founder despite the Dawas repeated disowning of the outfit.        
	In January, Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin had pledged not to use force for election boycott. If somebody comes to vote willingly, we wont stop him.        
	The calls come at a time when mainstream parties are avoiding rallies for fear of peoples backlash against the land allotment controversy over the Amarnath shrine board.        
	However, Sayeed, while opposing voter intimidation, urged people to ensure the boycott. Polls are no substitute for the right to self determination. I appeal to all parties in Kashmir to boycott elections completely, Sayeed was quoted as saying by a local news agency.        
	Sayeed said it was meaningless to hold elections in the presence of eight lakh troops. India is trying to fool the world community that Kashmiris are with India and Kashmir is not an issue, he was quoted as saying.        
	He also accused Pakistan of making a U-turn on Kashmir, suggesting the shift had harmed the movement for self-determination. Our cause received a major setback during the military regime in Pakistan. Pakistan should stick to its traditional stand on Kashmir.        
	In the past, militants have targeted pro-India politicians and threatened people to stay away from booths.

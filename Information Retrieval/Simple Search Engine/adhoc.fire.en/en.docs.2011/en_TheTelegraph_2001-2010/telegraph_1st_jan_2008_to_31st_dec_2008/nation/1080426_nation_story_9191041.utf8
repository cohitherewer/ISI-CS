          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 25: The Congress has embarked on an experiment to clip the wings of its general secretaries, deemed most powerful after Sonia Gandhi and her political secretary, Ahmed Patel.        
	For the first time, general secretaries looking after states will have minders, called coordinators, with whom they will have to work in tandem.         
	There is no senior-junior business or who will report to who. They will work together and report to the Congress president, a source said. So far, the general secretaries were assisted by secretaries who took orders from them.        
	Sources said the parallel apparatus was meant to rev up the party before the elections, help inexperienced members (Ajay Maken and Arun Kumar) and take the load off those who were over-burdened (Prithviraj Chavan) or relatively immobile (Mohsina Kidwai).        
	Observers said the general secretary-coordinator arrangement could be a recipe for chaos, given the Congresss crab-like propensity to make and break power centres.        
	The idea was conceived by Janardhan Dwivedi, himself a general secretary. But Dwivedi, considered close to the high command, will function solo as he is in charge of the organisation and organisational elections and training, and not a state.        
	So will Rahul Gandhi, a general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India. Rahul will continue farming out responsibilities to secretaries Jitendra Singh and Meenakshi Natarajan.        
	The experiment is likely to be ad hoc as some general secretaries minding states  Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot, Margaret Alva, R.K. Dhawan and Kishore Chandra Deb  have not been saddled with coordinators.        
	Asked why, a source said: Lets take Digvijay. Hes in charge of Uttar Pradesh but for all intents and purposes, its Rahul. The arrangement is working smoothly and Digvijay and Rita Bahuguna Joshi (the state president) have good relations with Rahul. So that can continue.        
	Dhawan and Alva have been deemed too senior to have coordinators. Although Gehlot is in charge of Delhi, the state is run by Sheila Dikshit and party chief J.P. Aggarwal.        
	In the cases of M. Veerappa Moily and Mohsina Kidwai, seniority was not factored in. Moily has been coupled with Kerala veteran P.J. Kurien to oversee Andhra and Assam.        
	Mohsina  who oversees many states, including Bengal and Kerala  has been paired with Janardhana Poojary, the old warhorse from Karnataka.        
	B.K. Hari Prasad, a general secretary in the making, will have Rajiv Shukla for company in Gujarat and Goa.         
	First-timer Arun Kumar has Union minister Vayalar Ravi as his coordinator. Sources said Ravi would call the shots in Tamil Nadu. Arun Kumar is too junior to deal with M. Karunanidhi.

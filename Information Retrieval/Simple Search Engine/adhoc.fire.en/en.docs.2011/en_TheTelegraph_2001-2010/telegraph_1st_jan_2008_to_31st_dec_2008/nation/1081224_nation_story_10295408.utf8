  - Minister says Karkare issue settled         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Antulay outside Parliament. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The government today said the doubts the BJP and the Shiv Sena had expressed about the anti-terrorism squads Malegaon probe were as wrong and deeply regrettable as the questions A.R. Antulay had raised about ATS chief Hemant Karkares killing on November 26.        
	Having punctured the BJP-Senas campaign against Antulay, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi breathed easy only after the minority affairs minister declared there was no need for further probe into Karkares death, that the issue was settled and he would not resign.        
	It had taken a serious back-channel effort after the Prime Ministers dinner for UPA MPs to rein him in.        
	Antulay wanted to respond in Parliament. Afraid he might embarrass them again, some Congress leaders advised him to instead clarify his stand to the media after the government tabled its statement.        
	They feared if he spoke in the House, the BJP-Sena would stall proceedings.        
	The minister was also told by a few senior colleagues and a political aide of Sonia that he would have to stick to the letter and spirit of what the Prime Minister and the Congress wanted or give up his job.        
	He relented.        
	After Antulay spoke, the Prime Minister asked his officers to get a videotape from a news channel to personally verify what he had said, sources revealed. Relieved that he had stuck to the party line, Singh said of his colleague: To err is human.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said in Parliament: The investigators have reached the conclusion that there is no truth whatsoever in the suspicion that there was a conspiracy to eliminate Shri Karkare or others.         
	There is also no truth in the different versions that have been circulated about the movement of Shri Karkare on that fateful day. Shri Karkare appears to have acted, after conferring with his colleagues, with speed and purpose in response to a crisis.... While it is indeed unfortunate that three brave officers and their men boarded one Qualis vehicle, the circumstances in which they came under fire and were killed were tragically fortuitous.        
	Antulay had hinted that there might be a conspiracy to kill Karkare, under whom the ATS had been probing the role of suspects with RSS links in the Malegaon blast.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: The ruling BJP today blamed the district administration for their inept handling of the Kandha-Dalit conflict, over a matter of job reservation, for the Khandhamal clashes. 
    
	The party blamed local minority leaders, both from the BJD and the Congress, for using misunderstandings to their advantage.
    
	Talking to reporters today, BJP vice-president and former Union tribal affairs minister Juel Oram, who led a team to Kandhamal, said the discontent among Kandha tribals had been simmering over a move to grant ST status to Dalit Christians. However, the administration had failed to assess the situation effectively, he alleged. 
    
	Oram, a tribal leader, admitted that through his party enjoys a strong base in the tribal belt, they had failed to sense trouble. He, however, parried questions on if his party had lost touch with its vote bank. Instead, he blamed Dalit-Christian politicians, missionaries and foreign-funded NGOs for diverting the issue.

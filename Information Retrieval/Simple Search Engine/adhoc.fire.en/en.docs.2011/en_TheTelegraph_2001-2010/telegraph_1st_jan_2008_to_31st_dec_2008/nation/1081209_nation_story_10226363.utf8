          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Supreme Court today said it wouldnt allow campuses to become political battlefields but hinted it might tone down its insistence that academic institutions follow the Lyngdoh committees norms.        
	Our purpose was to see that educational institutions do not become battlefields of politics and money power, a two-judge bench said while hearing an application on behalf of the Joint Struggle Committee of JNU. It might be the Lyngdoh way or any other way, the court added.        
	The court, which had earlier insisted it had to be the Lyngdoh way, frowned on the name of the JNU body. Now students just want to struggle but struggle against what? the bench wondered.

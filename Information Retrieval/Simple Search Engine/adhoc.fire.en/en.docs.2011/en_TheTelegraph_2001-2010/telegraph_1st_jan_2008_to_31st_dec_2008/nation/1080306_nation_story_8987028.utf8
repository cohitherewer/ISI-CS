The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Plan to stave off Baywatch capers    
	A safety net will soon be in place for those who take their Baywatch too seriously.    
	The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to post lifeguards at five of the citys most popular beaches.    
	Starting with Juhu, the guards will be at hand in Aksa, Madh, Gorai and Marve round the clock.     
	We will come out with a tender to appoint lifeguards on the five beaches. Candidates who meet the qualifications will be appointed irrespective of gender, Jairaj Thanekar, the civic bodys health officer, said.     
	Orders to appoint such lifeguards have, apparently, come from the state government. Thanekar hinted they should be hired in three months.    
	Around Rs 5 crore will be spent on watchtowers, ski-boats, high-speed motorboats, ropes and telescopes for rapid rescue.    
	In Juhu, where the plan will be launched first, 16 lifeguards and four watchtowers, each at a distance of 1km, will keep an eye on revellers splashing around.     
	The plan could spur those with a fear of seas to head to the beaches.        
	Empty House for budget     
	Meditation camps and weddings  everything was important in Hyderabad on February 16 but the state budget.    
	Finance minister K. Rosaiah couldnt have had a longer list of distractions as he presented his tax-free budget before a House that seemed least interested in the ritual.    
	In a near-empty house  169 of the 295 MLAs didnt turn up  37 Telugu Desam and nine CPM members staged a walkout. Eleven TRS members had been suspended a day before.    
	Among the few that put in an appearance, 100 Congress MLAs trooped out soon after Rosaiahs speech to attend a wedding. Even chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy left the House.    
	Rosaiah, presenting his 13th budget, had to be content with the huge media contingent and employees of the legislature as his august audience.    
	Metro on Gita track    
	The Delhi Metro is seeking divine intervention  to ensure its officers stay honest and hardworking.     
	It has ordered copies of Swami Vidyaprakashanandas Gita Makaranda, a book which has all the shlokas of the Bhagvad Gita. These will be distributed among employees.     
	Copies have been ordered in advance from Andhra Pradesh so that all executives can have their own little book to keep by their bedside for inspiration.     
	The idea to use the message of Krishna was apparently that of Metro managing director E. Sreedharan, well-known for preaching detachment from the fruits of action  a central message of the Gita.    
	If the message of Krishna guides Metro employees to stick to the straight and narrow, it is the power of yoga that helps them stay away from the stress of everyday life. The corporation has organised several yoga sessions to keep employees mentally fit. Yoga  A Way of Life by Acharya Kaushal Kumar, has been handed out to them.         
	Cool-off time    
	Cooled-off exams are hot, from Bengal to Tamil Nadu.    
	A 10-minute cool-off time, to read questions, has been allowed in the Class X and Class XII board exams in Chennai and the rest of Tamil Nadu. Bengal did it early this month.    
	The extra time will help improve performance and the overall pass percentage, school education minister Thangam Tennarasu said.     
	The decision followed requests from students, parents and teachers. Class X exams are for two-and-a-half hours and Class XII for three hours.

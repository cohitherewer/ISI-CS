	Bhubaneswar, June 25: The Union minister of state for rural development, Chandra Sekhar Sahu, today addressed the inaugural function of a two-day seminar being held to celebrate the golden jubilee celebrations of the Central Board for Workers Education under the ministry of labour and employment.        
	In the talk, the minister emphasised on training in the wake of globalisation.         
	Indian industries are committed to quality improvement and customer satisfaction. Training workers on quality, cost control, waste reduction, safe work practices and environmental protection is important, he said.         
	The minister also inaugurated a two-day national seminar on Building organisational core competence through workers education for executives of public sector undertakings in India.         
	The workers board was established in 1958 as a tripartite organisation under the labour ministry as an agency to implement workers education in India.         
	The idea behind the agency was to capacitate the working population in industries for better relations, besides increasing productivity and economic development.

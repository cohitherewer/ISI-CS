          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 29: Jyoti Basu today waved away Sonia Gandhis potshots at Bengal as insignificant but Prakash Karat took care not to target her while training the price-rise gun on the Centre.        
	I saw in the newspapers that she came for the election (panchayat poll campaign). I dont attach importance to what Sonia said since she does not know about Bengal, the CPM veteran said, emerging from the politburo meeting held here so that he could attend.        
	Sonia had yesterday taken a crack at the governments handling of Nandigram and said the Congress was with the oppressed people of the area. She had also said the state would have to keep prices in check.        
	Price rise is not a state matter but a central subject. She didnt say anything much on price rise despite the increasing suffering of the common people, Basu said, lobbing the matter back into the Centres court.        
	Stepping up the Lefts price-rise campaign against the Centre, CPM general secretary Karat, however, drew a distinction between the government and Sonia.        
	Aiming his barbs at the Prime Minister, Karat said: We would like to tell the Congress leadership that if it allows the Manmohan Singh government to continue its callous attitude to price rise, the people will not tolerate it.        
	He announced that picketing would be held in front of central government offices on May 15 to protest against rising prices. Only Bengal and Karnataka would be spared as they would be in the middle of elections.        
	Karat said the Centres refusal to curb private companies, like food giant Cargill, from buying grain and its unwillingness to prohibit forward trading in agricultural commodities revealed its bias in favour of big business and trading companies.        
	The party would mobilise 10 lakh volunteers for the picketing, he said. We want the government to accept the five-point demand we made to the Prime Minister last week.        
	Among the demands are stringent action against hoarding, strengthening the public distribution system and restoration of foodgrain allocation to states.        
	Karat defended Bengal against the Centres charge that it had failed to procure foodgrain from farmers, saying procurement was the primary responsibility of the Food Corporation of India.        
	But he virtually admitted the procurement shortfall when he said the politburo had been informed the state had procured 6 lakh metric tonnes of rice out of the target of 17.5 lakh metric tonnes.        
	Sounding a warning note, he said: I dont think anybody can underestimate the problem of price rise. The government cant afford to be callous to the peoples sufferings.        
	We hope the government will take effective measures. We will force the government to yield. Otherwise, we will decide our course of action after consulting other parties.

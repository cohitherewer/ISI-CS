The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Teachers reject Stephens defence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Teachers reject Stephens defence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 17: St. Stephens College today defended its controversial decision to appoint Christian faculty members ahead of better qualified candidates from other communities, and promised that academic standards would not be compromised.         
	But senior teachers opposed to the selections refused to accept the administrations pledge and defence  that it was within its rights as a minority institution  and threatened to seek intervention from Delhi University, under which Stephens offers courses.         
	The administrations explanation is not satisfactory. The appointments violate DU norms, and we are contemplating taking the case before the university if the college does not reverse the appointments, a senior faculty member told The Telegraph.         
	The college, in June this year, had appointed two Christians to ad hoc posts in the history department, overlooking candidates with better academic qualifications who were also in the fray.        
	The move sparked strong opposition from the faculty, which united over the issue after fractious debates over a slew of previous controversies that have hit the college over the past year.         
	The supreme council  the highest decision-making body of the college  today said it was within its rights, as a minority education institution, to preferentially select Christian teachers. At a press briefing, the council also clarified that it would continue to preferentially choose Christians for faculty posts.         
	Exercising the constitutional rights vested with the college as a minority educational institution, preference shall be given to duly qualified Christian candidates applying for teaching positions, the council said in a statement issued after the briefing.        
	The council denied the charge that the college was implementing quotas in faculty selections and said efforts to maintain the Christian character of St. Stephens were not incompatible with its high academic standards.         
	But soon after the late-morning press briefing, faculty members began drafting a letter to the governing council  a rung below the supreme council  that liaises between the college and DU.        
	Faculty sources said by late evening, 20 senior teachers had already signed the letter, which is likely to be submitted to the governing council tomorrow.         
	The letter will advise the governing council to take action against the pro-tem administrator Dr M.S. Frank, who has made the controversial appointments in violation of DU norms. We will warn the council that if they do not take action, we may have to approach DU, a senior faculty member said.        
	Frank is the current administrative head at the college.         
	The DU administration and the college have locked horns over the years on several issues, with St. Stephens claiming freedom from university rules on the ground of autonomy. The latest face-off occurred over the appointment of the principal.         
	DU had ordered St. Stephens to follow guidelines set by the University Grants Commission in selecting its principal, after former administrative head Valson Thampu resigned earlier this year.        
	The college, in its reply, accused the university of interference.

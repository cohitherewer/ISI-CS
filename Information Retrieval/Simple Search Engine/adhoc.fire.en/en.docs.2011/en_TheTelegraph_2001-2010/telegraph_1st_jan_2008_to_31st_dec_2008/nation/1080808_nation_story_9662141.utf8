          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 7: Amid the tussle for power in the state, JMM chief Shibu Soren will share dais with chief minister Madhu Koda tomorrow in Jamshedpur at a function organised to observe the martyrdom of Nirmal Mahto, the brother of deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto.        
	The JMM will use the occasion to show its strength and demand that Soren gets the chief ministers chair.         
	Revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan said, Kodas presence will not make any difference for us while demanding respect that is due to Guruji. The function would decide the future of Jharkhand politics, he added. The organiser of the programme, Sudhir Mahto, incidentally, was said to be not keen on Soren getting the Jharkhand crown and would like him to remain at the Centre.         
	Nirmal Mahtos martyr day is observed every year by the party. Nirmal, then senior party leader, was killed in Jamshedpur on August 8, 1987.        
	JMM MP Hemlal Murmu today said that efforts to install Soren as chief minister were on the right track. Murmu, supposed to be the force behind Sorens demand for the Jharkhand crown, said that Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Sonia Gandhi, was trusted to bring about a consensus among UPA partners.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 1: The government today streamlined the civil and police administration in communal strife-torn Khandhamal district, a day ahead the visit of Union home minister Shivraj Patil. 
    
	Church leaders earlier had met Prime Minister and the home minister at New Delhi, to complaint about the governments failure in curbing the violence. They had also sought the Centres intervention. They had requested the Prime Minister to depute a senior minister to make an on-the-spot review of the situation. On Sunday, the Prime Minister reportedly spoke with chief minister and inquired about the situation at the site. 
    
	Meanwhile, a delegation of Opposition parties have met the Governor and demanded that the army be deployed in the troubled areas of Kandhamal to tackle the situation.
    
	Yesterday, the chief minister took stock of the situation in Kandhamal and issued certain instructions and announced some relief and rehabilitation package for the victims.

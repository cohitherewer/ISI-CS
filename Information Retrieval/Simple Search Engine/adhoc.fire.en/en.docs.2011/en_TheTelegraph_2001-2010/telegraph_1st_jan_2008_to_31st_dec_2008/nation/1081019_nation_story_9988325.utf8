The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students take on meltdown at mock UN
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Students take on meltdown at mock UN
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Students at the mock UN conference in Delhi. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: As 16-year-old Shruti Basavraj stood up to speak on the global financial crisis, dozens of other teenagers in the room gripped their pens and notepads, ready to scribble questions they would grill her with.         
	Representing the US, Basavraj had the uncomfortable task of defending the countrys economic policies at a time when the slowdown in America is hurting economies across the world, including India.        
	I request all delegates to consider that the United States alone cannot be held responsible for the current economic crisis. It is a global phenomenon, said the Class XI student of Delhi Public School, RK Puram.         
	Unconvinced, Abhinav Vats, a year younger than Basavraj and representing Guinea Bissau, raised his arm to ask a question. Can the US assure developing countries that migrant labourers in that country will not face discrimination because of job losses? he asked. His tone was irreverent and his eyes were fixed on Basavraj  Guinea Bissau, one of Africas smallest countries, eyeballing the most powerful nation in the world.         
	From corporate boardrooms and the corridors of power in India and abroad, the economic crisis has leapt into forums for school debate, like the Indian Model United Nations. The mock UN, an initiative to encourage school students from India and other Asian countries to involve themselves in international affairs, is in its eighth year. It is supported by the UN and Indias human resource development ministry.         
	Nearly 600 students  from Sri Lanka, Nepal, Indonesia and India, but each pretending to represent a different country  debated, argued, questioned each other and agreed to resolutions over the past three days. The suggestions of the delegates  aged between 13 and 18  for dealing with the economic crisis ranged from lowering trade barriers, promoting investments to greater nationalisation of key resources.         
	I dont read newspapers much, but I do watch television. However, most of the information I have on the economic crisis is courtesy dinner table conversations with my parents and my elder sister, said Sargam Sardana, 17, playing vice-president of the UNs Economic and Social Council.         
	But the economic crisis wasnt the only agenda on the mock UN table. Subsidies and grants to African countries and the impact of a Barack Obama-led government on outsourcing also saw intense debates. The Democratic presidential hopeful, though, was a clear favourite with the delegates. In a poll, 85 per cent of them voted for Obama.         
	Other polls also threw up interesting results. BSP chief Mayavati won hands down in a poll on whether she was Prime Minister material. Over 95 per cent of the largely urban student delegates gave her the thumbs up.        
	Kashmir should be given independence, over 90 per cent of the students said, while nearly 80 per cent said they continued to feel safe despite the recent spate of bomb blasts.         
	And yes, India does love George W. Bush, as the Prime Minister had recently claimed, 90 per cent of the voters said.

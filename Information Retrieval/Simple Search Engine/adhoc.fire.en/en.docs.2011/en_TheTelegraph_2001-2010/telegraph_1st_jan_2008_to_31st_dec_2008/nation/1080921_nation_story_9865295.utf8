          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Delhi lieutenant governor Tejendra Khanna has written to 22 churches in the capital to keep vigil during religious ceremonies, especially Sunday mass, in the backdrop of the recent bomb blasts.         
	In the letter written last week, Khanna has asked priests to urge worshippers to be alert about anti-national elements.         
	The priests have been asked to depute trained volunteers to keep watch. The recent bomb blasts expose the evil design of ant-national elements who are out to destroy the communal harmony of the country, Khanna wrote.         
	The letter, which is to be read out during Sunday mass, asks volunteers to be in touch with the local police and inform authorities if they come across any suspicious activity.         
	We have been reminded by the lieutenant governor to keep vigil and we have deputed volunteers to keep an eye on the church surroundings, especially during mass, Father Jas Elanjikkal of the Defence Colony Cathedral said.

  - Who am I, cries 36-year-old after all efforts to find father fail and rights panel closes door        GAJINDER SINGH                          Sant Ram outside the Punjab human rights commission. Telegraph picture                                        
	Chandigarh, Aug. 10: The young man has two names but he doesnt know who he is.        
	All that Sant Ram knows  that, too, he has been told  is the name of his mother, who apparently lost her mental balance, was put in a home from where she ran away and now cant be traced.        
	Police have come across 25 men who could be of his fathers age but thats about it, nothing more.        
	For almost six years now, the 36-year-old, who grew up in an orphanage, has been searching for an identity, but no ones telling him the answer to the only question he has: who is his father?        
	In 2006, he had knocked on the doors of the Punjab human rights commission. But his search hit a wall there, too.        
	Last December, the commission closed his file after recommending further action.        
	I am simply seeking an identity for myself. I want to know who I am. I know who my mother was. I want to know who my father is, Sant Ram, who has another name also, Harjinder Singh, seethed as he walked down the stairs of the commission last month, angry and frustrated. Who do I approach now?        
	Sant Rams search began in 2002 after Gurdaspur district authorities repeatedly turned down his request for a voter card for lack of information about his father.        
	The rights panel had ordered a probe, which was carried out by Jalandhar police.        
	The search spanned Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur and Sangrur and the police claimed they had traced his mother, a woman they identified as Sahi Shanti. But they couldnt find out who his father was.        
	Jalandhar DSP Dharam Singh Uppal, who traced the name of Sant Rams mother, said he had come across nearly 25 people who could be of Sant Rams fathers age. But we couldnt proceed further. I have asked for further investigations, he added.        
	When Sant Ram approached the rights panel again, he was told to contact additional director-general (internal vigilance-cum-human rights) J.P. Virdi, to whom the police probe report had been forwarded.         
	Go to the police. Your file here has been closed, he was told by commission officials.        
	Brought up in a Hoshiarpur orphanage, Sant Ram says he was kidnapped in 1988 by a policeman, Gurwinder Singh, and his brother, Nirmal, and taken to Adi Nangal village in Gurdaspur where he was made to work as a slave for nine years.         
	He claims the home authorities helped in the kidnap.        
	It was during his years of slavery, Sant Ram says, that he was baptised into Sikhism and his name changed to Harjinder.         
	He tried to commit suicide but was saved by a priest of a gurdwara.        
	Enquiries about his mother revealed that she was sold by a person called Teja Singh to one Pritam Singh of Sangrur in the seventies.        
	Teja later took her back, which led to a dispute with Pritam. When the village panchayat failed to resolve the matter, the dispute reached courts and Shanti was sent to a centre for women in Gurdaspur with Sant Ram, then two years old.        
	But Shanti, the police report says, lost her mental balance and had to be separated from her son and sent to Amritsar and then to Jalandhar. But she ran away and no one knows where she is now.        
	Both Pritam and Teja are now dead and Nirmal, one of his alleged kidnappers, Sant Ram says, is pressuring him to withdraw the case.        
	But Sant Ram is not giving up. He has requested ADGP Virdi to probe further.        
	Like Bourne Identitys Jason Bourne, who, salvaged from the sea without memory, races to elude assassins and finally retrieves his lost identity, Sant Ram is determined to find out who he is.        
	I will approach the rights panel for DNA tests on the men the police have named in their report, he said, as he walked out of the rights panels office, a cloth bag in his hand.

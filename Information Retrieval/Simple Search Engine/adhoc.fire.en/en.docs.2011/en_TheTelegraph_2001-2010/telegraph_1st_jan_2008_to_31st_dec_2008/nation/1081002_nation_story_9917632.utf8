          INDRANIL GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The fate of the Nano project in Singur is expected to be decided at a meeting between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharje and Ratan Tata on Friday.        
	We in the government will try our best to convince Ratan Tata that he can, if he wishes to, order resumption of work at the Nano plant in Singur, a senior CPM minister said tonight. Although the Tatas have ruled out such an option, we will reaffirm our position that adequate security will be available for engineers and workers to enable them to restart work, he added.        
	Tata is expected to provide answers to two questions. Will the Tatas, fed up with Mamata Banerjees agitation, quit Singur and have the project relocated? Or will Tata, after taking stock of the farm-versus-factory debate across the country and turning a receptive ear to an expression of hope by the Prime Minister, agree to accommodate Mamata a little and stay put in Singur?         
	Mediators representing the Trinamul leader and the state government said tonight that they would be surprised if Tata gave a straight yes to the first question. The mediators are hoping that Tata would agree to allow the state government some more time.        
	They are also trying to impress upon the Tatas the political problems associated with the alternative sites in the states that have been trying to get the Nano project.         
	Some sources claimed that Mamata was no longer averse to gradually whittling down the demand for 300 acres inside the project area to a figure the government or the Tatas might not find too difficult to consider.        
	Her mediators have been reporting to her that the demand for 300 acres was impractical and she should concentrate on milking the general outcome -- such as the compensation package announced by the government -- as her personal triumph.        
	It will be unwise to assume that we are upon a solution, no we are not. But what is heartening is that over the past two weeks, she has been discussing ways to solve the Singur muddle, a mediator said. She has started looking at the package from her point of view, trying to figure out how she can turn it around to her advantage.         
	Today, speculation was rife about a central role following Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs comments on Singur on his way back home from France.        
	Singh said it was in the interest of Bengal and India that the issue is resolved satisfactorily. The Prime Minister said he sincerely believed that even now it was not too late to find a negotiated settlement meeting the concerns of the farmers and the investors.        
	Government sources pointed out that Singh could not have said anything else on the matter but refused to entertain questions on his likely response if he is requested to step in.        
	The comments did not prevent some of those involved with the back-channel negotiations from nursing hopes that the Centre might assume the responsibility of advising Tata to keep the project rooted in Singur and accommodate Mamatas demand a little.        
	What the Prime Minister or the Centre will do is a matter of conjecture at this point. But if the Centre succeeds in letting Mamata have a face-saver, it can help improve relations between Trinamul and the Congress in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.

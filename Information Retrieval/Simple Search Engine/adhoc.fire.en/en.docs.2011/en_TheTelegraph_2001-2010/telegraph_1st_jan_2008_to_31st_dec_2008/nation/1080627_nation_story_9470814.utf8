	New Delhi, June 26: The Congress appears mentally prepared for elections by the end of this year or early 2009.        
	According to an aide of the Prime Minister, the change of mind follows Manmohan Singhs rock firm determination to push the Indo-US nuclear deal with the complete backing of the Congress and Sonia Gandhi.        
	At a meeting of the Union cabinet this morning, a senior minister and a member of the Congresss core committee is said to have hinted to his colleagues that the monsoon session of Parliament might be the governments last.        
	Simultaneously, the governments floor managers are working on a bailout plan after the Left officially withdraws support and a vote of confidence is sought. Their calculation is that Samajwadi Partys 39 MPs, along with members of smaller parties like the Rashtriya Lok Dal and some committed Independents, should be enough to squeak past the 272-mark.         
	However, the managers said the arrangement would be a short-term one, meant to buy the Centre time to complete the processes before the 123 Agreement was put to vote in US Congress to operationalise the nuclear deal.         
	At this stage, nobody is looking at long-term alliances for elections, although we believe the Samajwadi Party will be a useful ally in a pre-poll or post-poll scenario, a Congress leader said.         
	Nobody treats the plan as a guarantee against a full tenure because it contains the seeds of instability and chaos. Sources admitted the government and the Congress were aware that it involved a quid pro quo and the Samajwadi leaders were known to be tough bargainers.        
	If the government survives the floor test with the help of its new friends, the Prime Minister is expected to tap his international friends to fast-track the processes in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). This is because he has a small window for Congress to pass the 123 Agreement.        
	The next scheduled meeting of the IAEAs board of governors, which needs to approve the India-specific safeguard agreement, is September 22. If India was to stick to this timetable, it might miss its date with Congress because after the IAEAs approval, the NSG countries have to be persuaded. This requires at least a month.         
	India can request the IAEA through the US and Russia  which have a substantial stake in seeing the deal through  to call a special session earliest by mid-July.        
	Before initiating these exercises, the government hopes to get its numbers together on the assumption that a parting of ways with the Left is inevitable. The ground for an understanding with the Samajwadis was laid by Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.

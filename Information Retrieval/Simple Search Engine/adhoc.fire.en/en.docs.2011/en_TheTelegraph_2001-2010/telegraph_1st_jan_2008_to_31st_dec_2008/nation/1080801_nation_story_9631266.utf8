	Bhopal, July 31: Two children have died in three days in a school at Asaram Bapus ashram in Chhindwara, a Madhya Pradesh district 130km from Nagpur, less than a month after similar deaths in Ahmedabad.        
	Ram Krishna Yadav, 4, was found unconscious in a school bathroom on Tuesday and died on the way to hospital.        
	Chhindwara superintendent of police Rajendra Shivhare had ruled out foul play.        
	Today, five-year-old Vedant was found dead, again in the bathroom.         
	It is not an accident or a coincidence. I am not in a position to say anything as investigation is on. The post-mortem report of the earlier incident has not come, Shivhare said.         
	The police are suspecting Vedants death to be murder because the bathroom door was bolted from outside. It was not closed from inside, an officer involved with the probe said. A large crowd of angry residents gathered at the ashram late tonight, and police had to use batons and tear gas to disperse the protesters.         
	On July 6, two students of a gurukul in Asarams ashram in Ahmedabad were found dead in mysterious circumstances. The boys family  the two were cousins  blamed Asaram, a former cycle shop mechanic who is now the spiritual guru of Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 29: Five years after detecting 141 bogus employees of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) drawing salaries for years, the civic body is embroiled in another fake staff scandal.        
	An investigation by the state CID, crime branch, has revealed that one Prasanta Kumar Samal of Baripada gram panchayat in Balasore district has been drawing salary from the CMC as a drain gang staff for the past 10 years.        
	The enquiry has also revealed that it is not Prasant Kumar Samal alone. There are a few others who have taken advantage of an organised racket of bogus employment in connivance with CMC authorities and managed to draw salaries for years together, observes a CID report.         
	The state crime branch had taken up the investigation in pursuance of a high court order following media reports on bogus employment in Cuttack Municipal Corporation. The report was submitted in court.         
	Acting on it, the high court recently directed the inspector-general of police (CID, crime branch) to make further investigation. The inquiry pointed towards the possibility of several others taking advantage of an organised racket, causing financial loss to the CMC.         
	Meanwhile, CID officers said, a criminal case has been registered and an in-depth probe into the criminal conspiracy for committing forgery of documents and fraudulent withdrawal of salary has been initiated.        
	Ironically, at least 141 fake workers who had been drawing salaries since 1998 were detected in 2003. Though the required documents connected with their appointments were not available, their names had managed to find place in the salary issue register with the help of forged documents prepared by the employees at a clerical level.         
	The story goes that fake employees were initially lured into the racket with the prospect of being paid a month salary for turning up only on pay days. In return, employees would have to pay 50 per cent of their salaries to the racketeers.        
	The fake staff, all belonging to different categories in the Grade-IV staff, had reportedly shelled out between Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 to the racketeers.         
	According to conservative estimates, more than Rs 5 crore had allegedly changed hands during the intervening time. In real terms, it had cost more than Rs 2.5 crore to the CMC.        
	The former chief executive officer of CMC had framed charges against some officers for alleged involvement in the racket by facilitating illegal process for a share in the booty.

          OUR BUREAU                                        Antulay    
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Centre has promised the Opposition a statement by either Pranab Mukherjee or Manmohan Singh on the controversy surrounding A.R. Antulay over his remarks on the death of anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karakare.        
	 Please have patience. The government will make a statement either tomorrow or before the House adjourns on December 23, Mukherjee said. Antulay was present in the House amid cries of shame, shame by Opposition members and demands for his dismissal.        
	Antulay had said yesterday that he was unsure whether Karkare was a victim of terrorism or terrorism and something.         
	In a reference to the Malegaon blasts probe, Antulay had added: Karkare found that there are non-Muslims involved in acts of terrorism during his investigations in some cases. Any person going to the roots of terror has always been the target.         
	Today, he said: I owe explanation to none. I have not said anything which has embarrassed the government and the Congress party. In fact, I have helped the government.        
	Sources said the Congress had asked Antulay to publicly clarify his statement.

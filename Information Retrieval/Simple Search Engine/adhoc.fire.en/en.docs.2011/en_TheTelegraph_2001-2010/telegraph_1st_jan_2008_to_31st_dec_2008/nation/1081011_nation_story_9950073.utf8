	Cuttack, Oct. 10: Ortel Communications Ltd is soon likely to lose its monopoly over distributing cable network using electric poles with the Supreme Court upholding the Orissa High Court verdict against the state governments one pole one cable policy.        
	Ortel Communications Ltd is the only private player in Orissa which extends cable TV, broadband internet and telephony services.        
	The state energy department had issued notifications in October 2001 and January 2002 putting into force a one pole one cable policy after Ortel Communications struck a deal with the Central Electricity Supply Utility (Cesu) in 2001 to use electric poles for its cable distribution network.        
	Ortel has since enjoyed virtual monopoly in cable operations in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Paradip, Rourkela, Puri, Khurda, Sambalpur, Balasore and Angul with a reported subscriber base of 1.55 lakh. Its broadband customer base is over 15,000.        
	The one pole one cable policy was challenged in the high court by other private parties last year. Acting on it, the high court disallowed such monopoly in May this year and directed the state government to formulate a proper policy that ensures equal opportunity for others to avail the electric pole facility.        
	Subsequently, Ortel challenged the high court ruling in the Supreme Court through a special leave petition. The Supreme Court, however, refused to admit Ortels petition last week. The division bench of Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice Mukundakam Sharma refused to interfere with the high court order. There is no merit in the petition, the bench observed.        
	Sources said the state government had constituted a committee to formulate a policy related to use of electric poles for cable TV network. The panel has the chief electricity inspector as the head and representatives from the Cesu and Grid Corporation of Orissa.

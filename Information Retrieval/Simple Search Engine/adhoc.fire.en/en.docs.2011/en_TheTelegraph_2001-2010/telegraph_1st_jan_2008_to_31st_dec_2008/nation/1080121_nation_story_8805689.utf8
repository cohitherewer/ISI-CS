     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Gaya, Jan. 20: Anomalies in execution of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has been unearthed in Fatehpur district of Bihar.
    
	The anomalies came to light following complaints of fraud and corruption in the execution of the scheme. The complaint was made before Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah at a janata durbar that he holds. If preliminary reports are to be believed, an estimated Rs 1.8 crore has been embezzled in a single block. 
    
	Flouting all norms, Fatehpur BDO Salim Akhtar Ansari is alleged to have transferred money under the scheme to the personal accounts of 10 panchayat sevaks working under him. 
    
	The panchayat sevaks simultaneously withdrew the money on December 24, 2007. 
    
	The basic thrust of the scheme is to generate employment and create infrastructure at village-level. According to guidelines under the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, 60 per cent of the money is kept aside to be spent on labour charges wherein material cost constitutes 40 per cent of the fund. 
    
	Officials conducting an inquiry into the scandal were shocked to find that neither the measurement book nor the muster roll were maintained while other requirements, like entry into the job cards, were also not noted. 
    
	According to sources, the Fatehpur scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, as the district enjoys an allocation of Rs 100 crore. More than Rs 76 crore were made available in the first six months of the current fiscal. 
    
	When contacted, the Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah confirmed prima facie evidence pointing to corruption. But he refused to divulge further, but stated that further inquiry was being made. Rammaiah did not rule out the possibility of similar inquiries in other blocks. Our priority is to get to the bottom of the matter in Fatehpur, he said.
    
	The Fatehpur scandal follows the statement made by Congress general-secretary Rahul Gandhi of how only five per cent of development money percolates down to targeted beneficiaries.

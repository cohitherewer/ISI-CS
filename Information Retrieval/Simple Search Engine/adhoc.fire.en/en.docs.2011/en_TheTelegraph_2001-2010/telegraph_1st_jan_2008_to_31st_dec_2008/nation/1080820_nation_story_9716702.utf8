                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Airport user fee set to take off in Hyderabad
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport                                  
	Hyderabad, Aug. 19: A flight out of Indias showpiece airport just got costlier.        
	In a first for domestic air travel in India, passengers leaving the five-month-old Rajiv Gandhi International Airport will have to pay a user development fee of Rs 375 from the midnight of Friday, August 22.        
	The decision comes a day after the Centre issued draft guidelines on the fee, which private airport developers want to levy as a means to recoup costs.        
	The swanky, new-age Rajiv Gandhi airport at Shamshabad, which started operations on March 23, had levied a user development fee of Rs 1,000 ($25) for overseas travel in June. It is Indias first private greenfield airport and is designed to accommodate the worlds largest planes.        
	The new Bengaluru (Bangalore) International Airport charges Rs 1,070 as user fee from international passengers, but is yet to levy any charge for domestic travel.        
	Earlier this month, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited, which owns and operates the Shamshabad facility, had announced it had submitted five fee models to the civil aviation ministry. Sources in Delhi said the ministry had given its nod to GMR to levy the fee of Rs 375 as an interim arrangement.        
	Airlines, hit by increasing aviation fuel prices and a drop in passengers because of rising fares, are opposed to the fee. Flight operators feel the additional cost, a common levy in airports abroad but something which Indian domestic fliers are not used to, could further affect the numbers.        
	Sridhar Kumar K, manager (corporate communications), GMR HIAL, said arrangements would be made to ensure that passengers were not inconvenienced while paying the sum. Special counters will be opened at the airport to facilitate all passengers to pay the user development fee without any hassles even if they have bought the ticket in advance, he said.        
	The fee will be collected at the airport before the boarding pass is issued. The passengers can pay either in cash or through credit/debit card.        
	Kumar said the civil aviation ministry had allowed GMR to charge only Rs 375 as fee from a domestic passenger. We had proposed a fee ranging from Rs 400 to Rs 600, but they (the ministry) approved only Rs 375, he said.        
	The official clarified that the amount could be reviewed if the need arose.        
	Viswanath Attaluri, the airports chief commercial officer, said the levy had become necessary because of the Rs 2,478 crore worth of investments made by the GMR-led consortium in the first phase to create world-class facilities for passengers.        
	The Hyderabad airport is a private-public joint venture between the GMR Group, Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad, Andhra Pradesh government and the Airports Authority of India.

	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The University of Oxford plans to establish a centre to study the success of Indian business, vice-chancellor John Hood announced today. 
    
	Hood, here as a member of the delegation with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said the Oxford University India Business Centre would come up by late 2008. 
    
	The primary objective of this research centre is to learn from Indias business success. A clear understanding of the issues faced by India and their innovative solutions, as India transitions from poverty to prosperity, will form a guide to future generations of countries attempting similar changes, Hood said.

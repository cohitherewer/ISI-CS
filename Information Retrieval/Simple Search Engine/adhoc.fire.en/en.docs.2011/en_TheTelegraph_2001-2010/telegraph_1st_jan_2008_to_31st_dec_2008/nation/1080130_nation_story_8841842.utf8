	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Margaret Alva thinks she can prove a point or two in her election-bound home state Karnataka.
    
	Ashok Gehlot has virtually grounded himself in Rajasthan in the run-up to the state polls.
    
	Prithviraj Chavan has finally managed to take time off his duties as a junior minister in the Prime Ministers Office to visit Tripura, a month before the elections.
    
	As sections of the Congress plan to urge Sonia Gandhi to declare 2008 the year of the party, leaders have begun assessing the state of the organisation, its election preparedness and the prospects of the party and its allies in various states.
    
	The comprehensive report, sources said, could be a vital input while deciding when to call the general elections  in late 2008 or as scheduled, in 2009. Two months ago, I would confidently say that with a little effort, we would retain power. Today, I must admit that even if we put in twice that effort, we may not return, a cabinet minister said.
    
	While the Congress considers Uttar Pradesh a nether zone, the ministers description of some of the other states summed up the partys outlook.
    
	While Bihar, the minister said, was a dark zone, Tamil Nadu was disturbed and Maharashtra unstable.
    
	Bihar is dark because the social coalition of upper castes, backward castes and a section of Muslims forged by the Janata Dal (United)-BJP alliance has held, and anti-incumbency has yet to catch up with the Nitish Kumar government. 
    
	In Tamil Nadu, the DMK is caught in its internecine battles. 
    
	In Maharashtra, too many things are going against the Vilasrao Deshmukh government: it is perceived as anti-poor and anti-Muslim, and the NCP, the sources said, had gained the upper hand.
    
	The partys best bet, they said, was to regroup in states where it was on its own: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.
    
	While Madhya Pradesh awaits a new state unit chief, the incumbent in Chhattisgarh, Charan Das Mahant, has not been able to form an executive committee because of the pulls and pressures of the factions led by Ajit Jogi and Motilal Vora.

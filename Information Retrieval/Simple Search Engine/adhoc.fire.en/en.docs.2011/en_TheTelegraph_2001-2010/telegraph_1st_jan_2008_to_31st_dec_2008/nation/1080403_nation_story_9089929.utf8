The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha elbow-room for retail players 
                                                                                                               Buddha elbow-room for retail players 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Coimbatore, April 2: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said his government would like to have four to five more small special economic zones and suggested that his approach to retail could be more flexible than his partys.        
	We dont want foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. If FDI comes in collaboration with Indian companies, we have to give a serious thought, he said. Officially, the CPM is opposed to the entry of FDI in any manner in retail. On domestic players, the chief minister said: We want regulations, a list of dos and donts for big retail companies to protect the interest of the small traders and shop-owners. But we will need companies for developing modern marketing infrastructure and cold chain for perishable goods, he said.        
	The statement is being seen as a sign of the governments resolve to make room for Reliance and other private investors despite resistance from a section of the CPM and allies such as the Forward Bloc.        
	Without mentioning Nandigram, Bhattacharjee to tried strike a balance between industrialisation and land acquisition.        
	The political organisation report has approved our industrial policy but it also asked us to be careful about land acquisition. We have to come out with a clear compensation and rehabilitation policy so that evicted families do not suffer when we take over land. The government has been asked to take care of them and ensure their alternative livelihood. The quality of life for them is also important, he said.        
	At the same time, he added that the acquisition of some farmland would continue. The present ratio of 63 per cent farmland and 23 per cent industrial and urban areas could not be maintained. Should the percentage of farmland remain unchanged? No, we cant stop there. We have to move ahead, he said.        
	Without spelling it out, he indicated that land acquisition by the government would be preferred over direct purchase by private investors. Echoing general secretary Prakash Karats self-criticism yesterday, Bhattacharjee admitted that the Left did not realise the full impact of the Centres SEZ bill while supporting its passage in 2005. Now we are facing the music. We will now seek amendments, he said. We want the Centre to stop the madness of approving SEZs indiscriminately, identify industries which are export-oriented or need foreign technology and capital and approve SEZs accordingly. Also, we want industry-specific land ceiling on SEZs and a land-use policy to ensure that SEZs do not become a real estate business, he said.         
	However, in line with the congresss rejection of a total ban, Bhattacharjee said: We will go for another four to five small SEZs in Bengal as we are planning to develop industrial parks for automobiles, rubber and apparel.        
	Indicating that he would prefer to move on the chemical hub with caution as the party had sought a review of the projects of the Salim group, he said: We are developing a petroleum and petrochemical region. If we think FDI and foreign technology are needed, we will ask for SEZ status. But we have not decided as yet.         
	Explaining the differences in approach in Kerala and Bengal, Bhattacharjee stressed on the historical differences. We focus on industrialisation since traditionally Bengal has been an industrial state since the Raj. But in Kerala, the situation is different historically. Thats why Kerala has been asked to develop agriculture as well as the social sectors.

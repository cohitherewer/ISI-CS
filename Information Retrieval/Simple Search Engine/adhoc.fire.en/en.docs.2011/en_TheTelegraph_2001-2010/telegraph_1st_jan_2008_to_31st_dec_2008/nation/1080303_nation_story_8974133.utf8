The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Girls in school are safer, govt tells parents
                                                                                                               Girls in school are safer, govt tells parents
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 2: Educate the girl child to ensure her safety, the government will tell millions of parents in a new campaign to end sex-based discrimination.         
	Convinced that fear of the law alone will not check crimes against women and girls, the government is launching an advertisement blitzkrieg that will mock offenders in some cases and cajole them in others.         
	The women and child development ministrys campaign is set to hit the streets in the run-up to International Womens Day  March 8  senior officials said.         
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury might announce the initiative tomorrow, they said, adding that the campaign was likely to continue through the entire month.         
	Instead of asking parents to educate girls as a matter of duty, the government will tap their concern over their daughters security to try and increase female literacy.        
	Shikshit ladki, surakshit ladki (an educated girl is a secure girl), says one advertisement, the caption placed above a picture of smiling young girls walking proudly through a street full of men.        
	Many parents do not send their daughters to school  often several kilometres away from their village  out of fear for their safety, government and private research in India has repeatedly shown.         
	The ministry of human resource development has a special scheme to build girls hostels to allay parents fears about sending their daughters to schools far away from home.        
	In addition, the government is countering parents security worries about co-education schools by building girls schools under the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Mahavidyalaya scheme.        
	But several parents still do not send their daughters to school. Our advertisement is aimed at helping them weigh the pros and cons of education, purely based on their concern for the girls security, an official associated with the advertisements said.        
	An educated girl is aware of her rights and is in a better position to demand them. We have carefully chosen the phrase, which can also imply a secure future for an educated girl, he said.        
	The pattern is the same in the advertisement against female foeticide. It warns of punishment under the Pre-Natal Diagnostics Techniques Act, but also offers other arguments to cajole parents into giving birth to a girl and taking care of her.        
	The daughter, the advertisement argues, is better equipped to continue the vansh (bloodline) than a boy. Besides, a girl generally takes better care of her parents in old age than a boy does, the advertisement says.        
	Eve-teasers are treated with contempt and ridicule in an advertisement against sexual harassment, which carries the tag Seeti bajaoge to jail jaoge (if you whistle, youll end up in jail).

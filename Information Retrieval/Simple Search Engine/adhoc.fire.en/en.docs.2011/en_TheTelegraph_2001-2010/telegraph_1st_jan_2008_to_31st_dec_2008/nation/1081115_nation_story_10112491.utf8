The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Returns relief for parties
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Returns relief for parties
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Supreme Court today refused to take action against political parties that fail to file income-tax returns as mandated by law to claim exemptions on the contributions they receive.         
	We dont think it is our duty, the court said.        
	The court was ruling on a petition filed by the NGO, Association of Democratic Reforms, which said it was mandatory for all parties to have their accounts audited and file their tax returns.         
	Under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, parties that do not file returns and disclose contributions in excess of Rs 20,000 would not be entitled to tax relief.         
	Made up of professors and alumni from IIM Ahmedabad and the National Institute of Design, the NGO alleged parties claimed tax exemptions without filing returns.         
	If parties maintain records of contributions, audit their accounts and file their returns, then income from house property, income from other sources and income by way of voluntary contributions received from any person are not included in the total taxable income for the previous year.        
	The NGO cited a Right to Information application to claim that not a single major party had filed its returns for 2006-07. Of the 21 most important parties, only the Congress, BJP, CPM, CPI, Samajwadi Party, ADMK, Telugu Desam and the Janata Dal (United) had filed returns for the three preceding years.         
	The petition alleged the Centre and the income tax department had failed in their duty as failure to furnish returns was a criminal offence.        
	These provisions have to be enforced to prevent ostentatious display of money in elections, it added.         
	But the court asked why the petition had been filed just before polls and threw it out.

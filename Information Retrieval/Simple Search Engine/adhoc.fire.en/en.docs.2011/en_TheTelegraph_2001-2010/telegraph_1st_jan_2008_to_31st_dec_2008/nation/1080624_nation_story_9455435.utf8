          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 23: The Nepal Maoists believe the Gorkhaland movement is none of their business but caution that statehood itself is not a solution.        
	Lakshman Panth, a middle-level leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), today said the statehood demand by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha was an internal affair of India.        
	Panth, who attended a meeting organised in Calcutta by a forum of 14 Naxalite organisations, however, added that the creation of Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh had hardly solved the problems of the poor people.        
	Thats why we dont think a Gorkhaland will automatically solve the problems of backwardness among Indian Nepalese or Gorkhas. A lot depends on the character of the leadership.

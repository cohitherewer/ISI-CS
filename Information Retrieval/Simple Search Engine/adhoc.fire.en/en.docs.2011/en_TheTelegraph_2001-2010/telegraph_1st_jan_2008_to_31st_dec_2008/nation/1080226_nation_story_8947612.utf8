          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Eleven Bangladesh fishermen detained in Balasore jail for the past five months were released today.         
	They had drifted into Indias boundary in Bay of Bengal after a storm. They were rescued by a group of Orissa fishermen on September 22, 2007.         
	The Bangladesh nationals were found drifting in the sea near Balaramgadi fishing base close to Balasore.         
	After rescued, the fishermen conceded that they had diverted 80 nautical miles from their base in Bangladesh due to the severe storm.         
	Then, police had put them behind bars for transgressing Indias territorial waters. Since then the foreigners were lodged in the Balasore jail until Saturday, when the judicial magistrate (first-class) P.K. Dash, acquitted them.         
	Meanwhile, the Balasore district administration has informed the state government and Bangladesh High Commission to help in the deportation of the fishermen.         
	The fishermen were arrested for violating Indias immigration law, said collector Alekh Chandra Padhiary.         
	We have informed the home department about their release and the officials on their part have informed the federal government and the Bangladesh High Commission, he added.         
	We understand that they are the sole bread-earners of their respective families and their absence means loss of livelihood for the entire family. Efforts are on to deport them as soon as possible, he added.         
	Currently the men are staying in a private lodge in Balasore.        
	On February 6, Gopalpur police rescued three fishermen from Myanmar. They also lost their way in the deep sea. They, too, have been jailed for having violated the Foreign Act 2 rules.         
	The collector has spoken to the Myanmar Embassy regarding their immediate deportation.

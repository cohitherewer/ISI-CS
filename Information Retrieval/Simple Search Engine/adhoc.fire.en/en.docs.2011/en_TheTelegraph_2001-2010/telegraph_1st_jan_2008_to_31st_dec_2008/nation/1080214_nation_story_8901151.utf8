          BASANT RAWAT                              (Top)The Gulbarg Society building and Jafris widow.				                                 
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 13: Out of the charred remains of Gulbarg Societys riot-wracked homes will rise a museum of resistance, if Teesta Setalvad has her way.        
	The Mumbai-based rights activist is planning to turn the Ahmedabad housing society where Congress MP Ehsaan Jafri was burnt alive and 67 killed by Godhra rioters in 2002 into a world-class museum.        
	The idea is to build a memorial to the innocent people who lost their lives during the mindless carnage and make it a rallying point for the movement against communal violence.        
	For those of us at Citizens for Justice and Peace who have devoted the better part of two-and-a-half decades battling the forces of communalism, hatred and division, this will be an effort to institutionalise resistance and energise survivors and human rights defenders, Teesta said.        
	Since the carnage six years ago, Gulbarg Society in the heart of the city has been like a mini ghost town. None of the residents of the once-prestigious minority complex - it has 19 bungalows and eight flats - has dared to return, opting for safety rather than their former homes.        
	Most of the violence-scarred residents are willing to give up their homes and make way for the museum, provided they get the market price for their property, Ehsaan Jafris son Tanvir said.        
	A museum will be a genuine tribute to those innocent people who were killed not just in Gulbarg but elsewhere in Gujarat, Tanvir said.        
	He said he had once wanted to turn his house into a museum and install his fathers statue in it. But he junked the idea because friends told him the idea was un-Islamic.        
	Teesta said she anticipated the Narendra Modi regime to block the proposal as the BJP and the Sangh would naturally prefer to bury the ghastly memories of the riots that bled Gujarat, which was under BJP rule then, too.        
	Even if I have to approach the Supreme Court, I will not give up the idea. The movement for the museum is part of our battle against the vindictive state, she said.        
	Teesta plans to go to the public to raise money to pay off the residents willing to give up their abandoned homes.        
	A former resident, Sharif Sheikh, said he was a little sceptical because a museum would enshrine memories of the massacre and force him to relive the trauma of losing his loved ones.        
	Besides, visitors to the memorial would try to seek out survivors for a first-hand account of what happened. We cannot go on narrating the same old story again and again, he said.        
	But of late, he and most other survivors who stay in Juhapura, a minority ghetto of sorts, and do odd jobs for a living had come round to the idea, he said.        
	I am least bothered about anything. Im only interested in selling my house where I cannot go back to live. If I get the market price for my house, I will be happy, he said.        
	The museum will be put in place with help from architects, historians, artists and writers. Every year on February 28, the day of the carnage, a programme will be held to commemorate the horrors of communal violence and stress the need to eradicate it.        
	All related literature, documents, art, posters and film graphics will be on display, Teesta said.        
	From the ashes of these memories will emerge the understanding that will give shape to the resistance we are trying to build, she said.

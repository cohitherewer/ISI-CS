	Patna, April 9: Some 80,000 Bihar lawyers will join work from tomorrow after Patna High Court today ordered a four-week stay on hiked court fee directing lawyers to resume work and asking petitioners to pay the previous court fee for four weeks from today.         
	Lawyers associated with 122 Bar associations had gone on a three-day strike from March 31 and later extended the strike as an indefinite one after the government did not announce any rollback within the first three days.         
	A bench of acting Chief Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad and Justices B. Ghosh and S.N. Singh today heard a PIL filed by groups on the hiked fee and put an interim stay on the raised fee.         
	A senior lawyer and member of the Bihar Bar Association, Mahendra Prasad Gupta, told The Telegraph: The high court asked a 15-member lawyers committee to discuss the matter with a government ministerial committee and respond within four weeks from today. Gupta added that as the court order came around 1pm today, all lawyers associations would be informed to resume duties from tomorrow.        
	Meanwhile, the government has also hinted at a fee rollback. Road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav, a member of the government committee, said the administration would like to resolve the matter amicably.         
	The government had constituted a six-member committee, under deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi.        
	The Bihar government had raised the fee for filing a common petition from Rs 250 to Rs 500 and hiked PIL fee from Rs 250 to Rs 1,000. Lawyers protested the hike stating that the majority of litigants and petitioners, coming from weaker economic backgrounds, would not be able to pay the hiked fee.

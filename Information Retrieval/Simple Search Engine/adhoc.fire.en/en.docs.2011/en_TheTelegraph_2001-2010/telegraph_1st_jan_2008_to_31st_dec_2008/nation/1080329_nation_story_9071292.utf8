          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: Healthcare system across the state went haywire today after members of Orissa Nursing Employees Association went on a cease work from this morning.         
	The association had earlier threatened to go on strike from March 27 if the government did not fulfil their demands.         
	Health minister Sanatan Bisi, who rushed to the Capital Hospital to pacify the agitating nurses, faced their ire. He and his security men were locked up inside a room for more than an hour.         
	The agitating nurses also closed the main gate, making it difficult for patients to enter or leave the hospital. Work remained affected throughout the day as the nurses refused to join work while patients stood mute.         
	There is no one to even change the drips. If this situation continues, I might have to take my wife to some private clinic. But that would mean spending a huge sum, said Benudhar Hota.         
	Bisis assurance to fulfil all demands of nurses after the Laxmipur Assembly seat by-election (scheduled on April 12) fell in deaf ear. The noisy scene continued till a platoon of police intervened and rescued the minister. The minister has requested the nurses to resume their duty.         
	The association has been voicing its grievances for a decade now. We only receive assurances. We want things to happen on the pen and paper, said Pravati Mohanty, the associations general secretary.         
	If the government fails to fulfil our demands within a week we will be compelled to forward our resignations. Some 3,800 nurses would resign and the government would be responsible for that, she said.        
	The nurses have decided to continue protesting in front of hospitals for another week.         
	At present, there are 2,144 regular and 1,633 contractual nurses engaged in government hospitals. The association is demanding a basic pay package of Rs 6,500, a government quarter, prohibition of contractual appointments and regularisation of appointments, among others.

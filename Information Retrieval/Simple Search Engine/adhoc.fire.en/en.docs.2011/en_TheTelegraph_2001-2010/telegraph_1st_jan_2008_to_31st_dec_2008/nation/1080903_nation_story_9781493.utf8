	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The head of the Catholic Church in Orissa today moved the Supreme Court for immediate deployment of central paramilitary forces in Kandhamal to prevent more attacks on Christians in the riot-racked district.        
	Raphael Cheenath, archbishop of the Cuttack diocese, accused the states ruling BJD-BJP alliance of malafidely not deploying central forces in areas where attacks were imminent on Christians.        
	His petition said the Centre had sent Rapid Action Force and CRPF contingents to the state, but they had been deployed only in towns, not in villages. Officials of the state of Orissa and the police are permitting the brutal assaults and are taking no action to prevent the massacres and intimidation, he said.        
	 More than a dozen persons have died in clashes that followed the murder of a VHP leader last month, though a rights body has claimed that 50 people have died.        
	Cheenaths counsel Colin Gonsalves said the archbishop was getting death threats.        
	The apex court initially asked Gonsalves to move the high court. But when he said the death threats had made it almost impossible for the community to approach the high court, the bench agreed to hear him out tomorrow.        
	The Centre, represented by additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, assured the court that it would take all necessary steps to deal with the situation.

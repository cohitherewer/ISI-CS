          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 28: The Orissa government is considering the introduction of a land-audit system for industrial projects  much on the lines of Karnataka.        
	We are studying systems used in Karnataka and in other states, conceded revenue minister Manmohan Samal while addressing an UNDP-sponsored media workshop.        
	Samal added that the move was considered after it was found that several industrial units wasted stretches of land allotted to projects.        
	The minister said his department, which is responsible for the acquisition for the projects, would seek status details from industries regarding the utilisation of land allocated to them. We will not allow wastage, he stressed.        
	Experts have suggested that there should be an independent mechanism to assess the land requirement of projects. In Karnataka, as its revenue secretary and UNDP national consultant S.M. Jaamdar mentioned, there is an 11-member land audit committee.        
	In Orissa, respective revenue divisional commissioners have been entrusted with the process of assessment, said UNDP team leader P.K. Jena.        
	Listing out the measures adopted by his government for Orissas R amp;R policy 2006, Samal said implementation statuses of seven industries were currently being studied.         
	A specialised R amp;R directorate has been constituted, while a comprehensive implementation manual had been drafted and circulated for views and comments. A state-level council on R amp;R has been set up while project advisory and project execution groups have been formed. The government has decided to implement the policy in a phase-wise manner. For the first phase, six industries in the private sector and three major irrigation projects in the government sector have been finalised, Samal added.

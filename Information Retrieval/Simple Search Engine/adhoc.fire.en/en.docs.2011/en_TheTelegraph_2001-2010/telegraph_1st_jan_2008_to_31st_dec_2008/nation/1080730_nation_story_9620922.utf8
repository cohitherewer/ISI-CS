          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Railway minister Lalu Prasad at the inauguration of a railway wheel factory at Chapra on Tuesday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, July 29: Lalu Prasad may have emerged as the hero in the UPA-sponsored trust vote, thanks to his uncanny knack of persuading Opposition MPs in favour of the Indo-US nuclear deal, but, the politicians family is less lucky.         
	Kunti Devi, Lalus sister-in-law and wife of elder brother Gulab Yadav, was forced to quit as up-pramukh (deputy chief) of the Phulwaria development committee after losing out in a trust vote today.         
	North Bihars Phulwaria village in Gopalganj was accorded the status of a block during the Lalu-Rabri regime and is home of Lalu Prasad.        
	Recently, block members of the area revolted against Kunti Devi for her failure in ensuring development. They asked her to conduct a trust motion on the plea that she had lost the confidence of the majority.         
	Today Kunti Devi and Gulab Yadav gave examples of the new railway station that Lalu inaugurated recently in Phulwaria, the Phulwaria-Hajipur passenger train, besides the availability of bank and hospital in the village as development. But, members were reportedly not impressed by progress pushed by lalu Prasad and asked her to show her individual contributions as the deputy block chief.        
	The motion that was taken up today secured six votes in its favour and eleven against it. She quit her post immediately, said a Gopalganj district board official.        
	A committee member belonging to Phulwaria village was peeved at Kunti Devi. Unlike Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, Kunti Devi was never seen among the people. She never went to the block office to take up any cause related to the villagers, the member said.         
	He, however, was all praises for Lalu Prasad. Our vote against Kunti Devi should not be seen as opposition to the railway minister. His family is trying to make a success out of Lalu Prasads hard work.         
	Most of Lalu Prasads family is into politics. Gulab Yadav was an elected pramukh of Phuwaria in the nineties and is still in active politics. His two brothers-in-law, Sadhu Yadav and Subhas Yadavs, are MPs.        
	Inaugurated        
	Lalu Prasad today strengthened clout in his Lok Sabha constituency after playing a saviour to Manmohan Singh government during the trial of strength.        
	The railway minister inaugurated a wheel factory on 200 acres at Bela in Chapra constituency that he represents in the Lok Sabha. Bihars NDA leaders had laughed when I had laid the foundation stone of this factory two years ago. They claimed that the wheel factory can not come up for its venue is waterlogged, Lalu said, inviting his opponents to: Come and see. The factory is going to start soon.        
	Lalu Prasad announced that he was going to inaugurate two more railway-related factories at Garkha and Marhaura. Incidentally, both the places fall in the Chapra constituency. Lalu Prasad also announced that he would ensure a profit of Rs 1,00,000 crore for the Indian Railways by the next fiscal.        
	The railways are in the process of acquiring 125 acres more at Bela to build a railway colony. The minister claimed that the factory would lead to a rise in prices of land in adjoining areas and would ensure employment for local people.

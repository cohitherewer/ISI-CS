	Starry nights end in lockup squalor    
	In a business suite tonight, in jail the next morning.    
	A 30-year-old jobless man came down to earth from a star-studded life after his luck, and his grannys patience, ran out.    
	Aniruddh Iyer had made it a habit to lie his way to top city hotels and run up huge bills by posing as a smooth-talking baron feigning temporary credit card problems.    
	But recently, his deception game ended at Le Meridian Hotel. The hotel staff, taken in by his pleasant looks, allowed him in without any advance. Aniruddh then made use of all amenities, ordered expensive drinks and food and even hired a luxury sedan for a long night out.     
	When he insisted that his card problem hadnt been sorted out yet, he was asked to make alternative arrangements to pick up the tab of Rs 22,500. Security guards caught him when he was trying to slip out of the hotel.     
	Even his doting grandma, who had paid and rescued him during previous escapades, refused and told police to deal with her grandson as the law would have it.        
	Protest wave to save lakes    
	Plans to privatise Bangalores lakes are causing more than a ripple.    
	Over 300 people formed a human chain at Agarala Lake in Kormangala, an upscale neighbourhood teeming with high-street malls and cafes, last week against the plan to privatise the water bodies. The protesters signed an appeal and sent it to chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, urging the government to reconsider the move.     
	It is critical you take the initiative of abandoning this disastrous scheme of privatising our lakes, the appeal said.    
	The protesters argued against proposals under which the obligatory function of the state (to protect the environment) was outsourced to private profit-making builders and hoteliers for their commercial interests.    
	Kannada actor L.V. Sharada and former high court judge A.V. Sadashiva were among the celebrities who took part in the protest. (PTI)    
	Lifeline skips the disabled    
	Mumbais lifeline doesnt have a heart for the disabled.    
	Thats the message that went out recently when Bombay High Court asked the railways to ensure that at least one city station has the facilities for the physically challenged. The task is to bring one platform up to the mark.    
	The division bench of Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice V.M. Kanade was hearing an NGOs petition saying stations and platforms do not meet international norms on disabled-friendly amenities.     
	The railways made a feeble attempt to cite Mumbai Central as an example but were stumped when the judges asked whether the handicapped could use wheelchairs to get to the platforms from the parking lot. The railways also accepted that no station had lifts.     
	Chief Justice Kumar asked lawyer Mallika Iyer, who represented NGO Indian Centre for Human Rights and Law, to visit any one platform along with the railways lawyer and draw up a checklist of the missing facilities. (PTI)        
	Wet amp; sick    
	Monsoon mayhem is back in Mumbai, as are rain-related afflictions.     
	The recorded death toll from such diseases this season is 20, with two of those casualties reported last Friday.    
	One patient admitted to B.Y. Nair Hospital in central Mumbai died of gastroenteritis. Another succumbed, at the same hospital, to fever from water-borne infection, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai said.    
	Since the monsoon arrived, the civic body has been advising people to boil water before drinking to prevent illnesses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kerala casts tourism net for Chinese
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kerala casts tourism net for Chinese
          MANDIRA NAYAR                           A dancer in Kerala                                  
	New Delhi, June 7: Kerala is not content just catching fish with Chinese nets. It also wants to catch the Chinese  in its tourism net.        
	With this in mind, Keralas minister for tourism, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, met Union tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni last month.        
	Kerala  which is Gods Own Country to tourists  knows the advantages it would get if it scales the Great Wall first among Indian states.         
	We want to go to China on an exploratory trip to find out how we can position ourselves, said state tourism secretary Venu.         
	We dont expect to get large numbers (initially), but we are in for the long haul in this market.         
	Kerala shares a history of trade with China that goes back several centuries. It also shares a political ideology with the Asian giant  communism.        
	The southern state is already a known wellness destination for Europeans. But it wants to check out the vast untested territory closer to home.        
	The idea is to meet tour operators in China so that we can get them interested in developing packages for us, said Venu.         
	It is still too early to chalk out a definite strategy for China as India itself is new for the Chinese tourism market. But we want to at least start by lighting small fires.         
	We have turned our attention to emerging markets, said Venu.         
	The idea is also to become a short-haul destination for countries like Malaysia and Singapore. Our advantage is that we are (geographically) close and so it is possible for people from these countries to come for a brief holiday.         
	Kerala has made ayurvedic massages synonymous with the Indian experience. Even hotels in Rajasthan have spa massages laid out, Kerala style.         
	But the government wants to give the states image a makeover. We want to market Kerala as a soft adventure tourism destination, Venu said.         
	The state has 15 wildlife sanctuaries, most of them unexplored. Tourism officials have now started working out trails for travellers, so that Kerala becomes more than a place to just soak up the sun at Kovalam.         
	In 2006, the state got 42, 8534 foreign tourists.

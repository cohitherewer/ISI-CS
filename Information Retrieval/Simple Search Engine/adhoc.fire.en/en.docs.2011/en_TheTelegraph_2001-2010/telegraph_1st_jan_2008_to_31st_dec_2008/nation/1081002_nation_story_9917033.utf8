          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Malegaon, Oct. 1: Malegaons blast-scarred Muslims are set to observe their first Black Id tomorrow, with black armbands and bottled-up anger against police and the government.        
	Community leaders have appealed to the people not to wear new clothes for the morning Id prayers to protest the death of five persons in Monday nights explosion.        
	A large number of security personnel  from the State Reserve Police Force, Rapid Action Force and the paramilitary  were brought in today to keep tight vigil over the five prayer sites.        
	The prayers will be held at Idgah Maidan opposite the Circuit House, Central Chowk and Millat Madarsa in Golden Nagar, Kolikuti and Ashrafiya Idgah. The police are on their toes to ensure there is no breakdown of law and order.        
	Investigations are on but our main focus at the moment is to ensure that Id is celebrated peacefully, Nashik police superintendent Nikhil Gupta said.        
	About 1.15 to 1.30 lakh people are expected to gather at Idgah Maidan alone, officials said. Nashik district collector S. Chokalingam is camping at the Circuit House.        
	Gupta and Chokalingam spent over two hours with leaders of the Kul Jamait-i-Tanzeem, an umbrella body of Muslims, discussing measures to ensure no trouble erupts tomorrow.        
	The leaders angrily shouted at food and civil supplies minister Baba Siddique when he walked in for the meeting, demanding why he had begun to speak from the police perspective.        
	The people are angry with the police for first claiming the deaths were caused by a gas cylinder explosion and then settling for a crude bomb dropped from a motorbike.        
	There were reports that three suspects, including two former Simi activists, were picked up from a Malegaon lodge and detained for questioning. But the police refused to confirm anything.        
	Nashik range IG S.P. Gupta would not comment about whispers that Mondays blast could be the handiwork of a fundamentalist Hindu organisation but confirmed that a man had phoned a local resident to warn of more explosions.        
	We are not looking at any specific group of community. We will investigate with an open mind. For operational reasons, we cant reveal any details of the investigations, he said.        
	The blast toll has gone up to five after a resident, Irfan Khan Zia Ustad, died of injuries in Mumbais KEM Hospital. About 138 people have been injured, the police said.

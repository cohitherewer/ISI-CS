          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 7: The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Church to help out Christians affected by rioting and arson in Orissas Kandhamal district in December last year.        
	The court today stayed the district collectors order barring any charitable or religious organisation from providing relief to victims.        
	The district collectors order is stayed. The high court order upholding it is stayed, a two-judge bench of Justices H.K. Sema and Markandey Katju said.        
	On January 11 the district collector had directed that no charitable or religious organisation would be allowed to carry out relief work in the affected areas. He had warned of action under the Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Penal Code against those violating the directive.        
	The archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar, Raphael Cheenath, challenged the order in Orissa High Court, which refused to intervene.         
	The collector defended his order before the high court saying religious institutions and NGOs would only focus on a particular community and that might create ill feeling among people from other communities and disrupt peace.         
	The situation is already very delicate and any such instance may further lead to a flare-up, the high court had said, refusing to exercise its power of judicial review.         
	The archbishop then moved the apex court.         
	He pointed out that the Orissa government had not announced any proper relief or rehabilitation package although three months had passed since the communal clashes. Cheenath said the very few people to whom compensation was paid received a measly Rs 10,000, which did not cover even a fraction of the losses they had suffered.         
	Only three relief camps had been set up, the archbishop said. Out of them, two were closed. The condition in the remaining one is awful without proper food, drinking water or medicines. Two persons had died in the relief camp on January 15 because of lack of medical attention.         
	He alleged that he had been prevented from distributing relief materials and reconstructing churches and houses that were destroyed.         
	The attitude of the state government is the most unreasonable. (It) has not constructed a single house and has given compensation and a few blankets to a handful of victims only to make a pretence that some relief is being provided, he said.         
	Cheenath described the high court ruling as unfortunate.         
	The high court has unfortunately accepted the plea of the state government uncritically and failed to understand that it was of paramount urgency that relief reaches the victims, the petition said.         
	The archbishop sought a directive to the Orissa government to provide compensation to all victims and reconstruct all buildings and churches damaged across the state.         
	The apex court has issued notices to the state government, through the state chief secretary and home secretary, the Union home secretary and the district collector.

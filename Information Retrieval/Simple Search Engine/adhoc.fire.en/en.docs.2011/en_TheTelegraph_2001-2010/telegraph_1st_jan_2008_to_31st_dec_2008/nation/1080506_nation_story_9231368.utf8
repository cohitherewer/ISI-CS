          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 5: The Lok Sabha was today abruptly adjourned sine die, four days before the scheduled completion of the budget session.         
	Most political parties expressed shock at what they said was a secret understanding between the Congress and the BJP. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee did not give any reason while announcing the decision to suddenly adjourn the House sine die, but many MPs saw the political interests of the two principal parties behind the move.         
	While RJD leader in the Lok Sabha Devendra Prasad Yadav said the BJP proposed adjournment because it desperately wanted to avoid the creamy layer debate, the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta said the government was running away from the womens reservation bill and the unorganised sector bill. Devendra argued that the creamy layer debate listed for this afternoon had left both the Congress and the BJP jittery.         
	Both the Congress and the BJP have, so far, avoided taking any position publicly. That undoubtedly created a meeting ground for the Congress and the BJP and they took the unprecedented step of ending the session without consulting other parties, Devendra said.         
	Left members expressed their opposition in the House itself. While Dasgupta lodged a strong protest over the unilateral decision as soon as the Speaker made the announcement, CPMs Varkala Radharishnan started shouting as the customary end-of-the-session Vande Mataram began.         
	Outside the House, Dasgupta said: This was a disgraceful combination of forces  the Congress and the BJP  to downgrade Parliament for vested interests. Dasgupta did not spare even the Prime Minister for the abrupt adjournment.         
	Manmohan Singh had promised to bring the womens reservation bill only yesterday. Even the Prime Ministers assurance is a hoax, he said, accusing the principal political parties of disrespecting Parliament. Within a few years, it will be difficult to get even 50 working days in Parliament, he said. The first part of the budget session commenced on February 25 and the House was adjourned on March 19.         
	The second part began on April 15 after the recess.

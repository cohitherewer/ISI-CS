	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 31: Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik blamed an incompetent chief minister and administration for the communal strife in Kandhamal, while political parties and organisations held four separate rallies in Bhubaneswar demanding immediate restoration of peace. 
    
	Hundreds of Youth Congress activists, who organised a rally, burnt the effigy of chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, and BJP leader L.K. Advani blaming them for the strife in Khandhamal. 
    
	On the other hand, activists of Kalinga Sena, a local outfit, were dressed as saints of various sects and carried holy books of all religions, highlighting on communal harmony. We want peace and communal harmony, they shouted, while marching through the streets. 
    
	CPM activists staged a dharna near the Assembly and took out a rally demanding immediate restoration of peace and harmony in the region along with stringent action against culprits involved in the violence. Members of ST and SC Suraksha Parishad also took to the streets demanding protection of life and property of innocent tribals and Dalits. 
    
	A fact-finding team, headed by former vice-chancellor of Ranchi University professor Ram Dayal Munda, which visited the troubled district yesterday, met Governor M.C. Bhandare today and demanded a CBI probe into the riots. 
    
	Earlier, addressing a news conference, the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik described the communal flare-up in Khandhamal as the example of incompetence of the chief minister and the callousness of the administration. Its not the question that which side was responsible for the communal situation. Its the government which is solely responsible for such avoidable situations, said the Congress leader. 
    
	Why did not the administration take precautionary measures in the communally-sensitive Kandhmal district, which had earlier witnessed a communal strife in 1994, asked the former chief minister.

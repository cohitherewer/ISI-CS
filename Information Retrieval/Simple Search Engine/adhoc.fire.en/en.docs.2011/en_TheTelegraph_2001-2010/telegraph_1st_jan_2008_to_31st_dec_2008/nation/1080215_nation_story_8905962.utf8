	Dumaria, Feb. 14: At least seven Maoists, including a self-styled sub-zonal commander wanted for the murder of MP Sunil Mahto, were killed in an encounter with police at a rebel-infested village in Jharkhands Ghatshila last night.        
	SP Naveen Kumar Singh said the police have found an Insas rifle which Vikas Mahto, alias Vikasji, of the Maoists may have snatched form the MPs guards during the March 2007 killing. Other weapons and ammunition have also been seized.        
	According to residents of Bhitar Amda village, around 11pm, two extremists, Vikasji and Bodo Melgandi, came to Khelaram Mardis house at Dungri Tola at the foothills of Rajnijharna and asked for food.         
	Upset with this regular invasion of privacy, Mardi refused. This led to an altercation and the villagers beat up the two unarmed Maoists.         
	Battered and bruised, Vikasji and Melgandi fled, following which the villagers sought help from the police. The encounter occurred during combing operations by the police.

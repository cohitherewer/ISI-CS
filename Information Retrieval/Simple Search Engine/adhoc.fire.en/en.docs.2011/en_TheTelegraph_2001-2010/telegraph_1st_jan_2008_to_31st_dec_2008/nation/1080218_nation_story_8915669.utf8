          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 17: Twelve youths were taken into custody soon after they got off a train from Gorakhpur this evening on the suspicion that they were jihadis.        
	Most of the youths were from Bihar and Bangladesh, but one was from Nepal, police said after rounding them at Secunderabad station.        
	The detention of the youths, whisked away to an undisclosed location for interrogation, follows inputs from central intelligence agencies that ISI-trained agents could arrive in Hyderabad on trains from the east.        
	We had received an input about five ISI-trained agents coming to the south, two bound for Hyderabad and the other three headed to Bangalore, said a senior police officer.        
	The information was about ISI agents taking trains from the east but, as todays swoop showed, other trains were also under the scanner.         
	Our information was that highly trained explosives experts were targeting the Kaiga nuclear plant in Karnataka, said the official. Kaiga is about 800km from Hyderabad.        
	Karnataka came into focus after reports of militant training camps in jungles close to Hubli and plans to use it as a base to launch attacks in the south.         
	Recently, Raziuddin Nasser was arrested in Hubli for running one such camp. He is the son of Maulana Naseeruddin, who is in jail in the Haren Pandya murder case.         
	Officers believe Raziuddin was Lashkar-e-Toibas chief in south India.        
	The narco test on a suspect arrested in Hubli, Imran Khan, had revealed plots to carry out strikes in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal tops in animal cruelty
                                                                                                               Bengal tops in animal cruelty
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 27: Bengal has reported the highest number of cases of cruelty to animals for the past three years, according to figures from the ministry of environment and forests.         
	The state reported more than 17,000 cases of cruelty to animals during 2006-07, and the cumulative number over the past three years is about 40,000, the ministry said today.        
	The figures shouldnt come as a surprise, with the plight of a pregnant Sunderbans tigress, who was beaten with sticks and stones, fresh on peoples minds. The scared tigress climbed trees and hid behind bushes before being tranquillised on February 18.        
	The same day, a rickshaw-puller in Alipurduar rescued a macaque from the hands of armed villagers.        
	Delhi and Uttar Pradesh follow Bengal on the list, but with much smaller figures  1,826 and 1,127, respectively.         
	But a Calcutta-based animal welfare activist said Bengals high figures reflect a superior network of alert volunteers spread across the state. Cruelty is probably widespread in other states also, but most of it probably never gets reported, said Debasis Chakrabarti, founder of the Compassionate Crusaders Trust, a Calcutta-based agency that helps animals in distress.        
	Whenever our volunteers report something, we follow it up with prompt action, seeking police or administrative help, Chakrabarti said.         
	The 2006-07 cruelty to animals figures from other states are a fraction of Bengals  255 in Haryana, 79 in Kerala and 71 in Andhra Pradesh.         
	The number of people convicted for the offence is the highest in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Delhi and Bengal.

	Chandigarh, Nov. 17: A Gurgaon beverage dealer, apparently staggering under the weight of stock losses, committed suicide after leaving behind a note donating his eyes.        
	Rajendra Gupta, in his late 30s, hanged himself from the ceiling with his wifes sari on Saturday night at his home in the Helimandi police station area of Gurgaon, near Delhi.        
	It isnt clear how much money Gupta lost in the market crash but police said he had started investing in shares a few months ago, hoping to boost his earnings.        
	In his suicide note, Gupta, father of two kids, said he was unable to bear the huge losses following the crash.        
	My last request to my family is to donate my eyes, he wrote.         
	A police officer said it was possible Gupta had taken loans to invest and was finding it difficult to repay them.        
	Since the family accepted his request to donate his eyes, a civil hospital doctor removed them and conducted the post-mortem, sub-inspector Hawa Singh of Helimandi police station said over the phone from Gurgaon.        
	Guptas soft drinks agency on Gurgaons Pataudi Road was said to be doing well, which has left his family struggling to understand what drove him to risk investing in stocks.

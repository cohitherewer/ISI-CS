	Power debate on price of sealing    
	Sheila Dikshit and her Congress government have turned into fodder for the capitals most explosive debates.    
	he question on top of peoples minds is this: has the partys fate been sealed ahead of the Assembly elections because of its inability to stop the sealing from 2005 to 2007? Others are wondering if the success in stalling the process will now win it back some of its lost votes.

	Another scare for the Congress is Mayavati, whose BSP won 5 per cent of the votes in the civic polls.

	But this year, Ramjas and Kirori Mal beat all odds to reach the finals. And eventually, Kirori Mal, Amitabh Bachchans alma mater, emerged the victor.

Much of the renovation will focus on the four Gopurams and other similar structures in the 16th century architectural marvel. Money has been raised through donations from devotees and companies.    
	Temple officials say the cost of reinforcing each of the four towers will be up to Rs 30 lakh. Shaky wooden beams in the towers, standing tall for over 400 years now, will also be replaced.

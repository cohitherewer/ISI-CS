	Patna, March 5: An article in Saamna  Shiv Senas mouthpiece  mocking people of Bihar origin today evoked a strong reaction in the state with the ruling JD(U) demanding party chief Bal Thackerays arrest.        
	A day after writing a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the issue, chief minister Nitish Kumar asked Singh to convene an all-party meeting to determine the way the peoples representatives should speak.         
	Quoting the Saamnas article, Ek Bihar, sau Bimar (One Bihar and hundreds ailing), Nitish Kumar said: The Prime Minister must intervene quickly and call an emergency all-party meeting, including leaders from Maharashtra and Bihar. Some leaders are shooting arrows from their mouth and vitiating the atmosphere in the country. There must be a Laxman rekha on what and how we speak. Enough is enough.        
	The politics and democracy stand threatened, said Nitish, due to the irresponsible comments from certain elements in Maharashtra. Nitish added: If the Prime Minister and the Centre do not intervene in the matter, it will be understood that the Congress is in favour of what is happening in Maharashtra.        
	The Centre is bound to issue strong directive to the Maharashtra government to rein in the irresponsible elements shouting provocative slogans and perpetrating violence on the Hindi-speaking people. We all Indians are one. The Centre must guard this principle, he said.        
	JD(U) parliamentary party leader Prabhunath Singh demanded immediate arrest of Bal Thackeray. His (Thackerays) place is in the jail after writing such an anti-national article in his mouthpiece, he said.        
	While railway minister Lalu Prasad expressed his anger on Thackeray in Delhi, hundreds of RJD workers burnt Thackerays effigy here today.        
	The RJD leaders said that the people from Bihar would celebrate Chhath on a bigger scale in Mumbai this year to prove that Mumbai and Maharashtra are not a fiefdom of Thackerays.        
	Nitish said: India already has its share of enemies outside. The country will be weakened if the people of one state turns inimical to other.

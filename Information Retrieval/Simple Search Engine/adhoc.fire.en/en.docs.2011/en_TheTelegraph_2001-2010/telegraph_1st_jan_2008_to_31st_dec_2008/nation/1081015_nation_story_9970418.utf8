          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that worship of whatever remains of the Ram setu was not an essential or integral part of the Hindu religion.        
	The written submission with potential to re-ignite a furore was made on a day Assembly elections were announced in several states where the BJP is either in power or a strong contender.        
	The Union government also insisted that the setu  also called Adams Bridge  was built and broken by Ram as described in the Padma Purana. It had earlier quoted excerpts from the Kamba Ramayana to back the claim.         
	The submissions defended construction of the controversial Sethu Samudram ship canal that proposes to cut across the Ram setu to reduce travel time from the west to the east coast.         
	Several environmental activists and right-wing groups had challenged the government decision to cut through the setu  the former citing ecological reasons and the latter on grounds of faith.         
	The Centre rejected the arguments by religious groups that worship of the Ram setu was a fundamental part of Hinduism and needed to be protected under the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution.         
	the petitioners have not alleged, much less proved, that the Ram setu forms an integral or essential part of the Hindu religion; this is necessary because the protection of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution is (offered) to religious belief or practice which forms an essential and integral part of the religion, the government said.         
	The petitions also did not claim that the setu as a place of worship forms an integral or essential part of the religion. As such, it is not even alleged that it is the belief of the Hindu community, the Centre added.         
	The government said the religious texts referred to by the petitioners themselves showed that the bridge was built and broken by Ram himself. it has not been proved undoubtedly to be the belief of the Hindu community that Lord Ram did not himself break the bridge.         
	This is not the first time the government is making what could be termed controversial submissions on the setu.         
	The BJP had kicked up a storm over the governments first affidavit that denied Ram ever existed and, by natural corollary, could not have built the bridge. The Centre later withdrew the affidavit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Budhia pace worries ex-coach
                                                                                                            Budhia pace worries ex-coach
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Two years ago all spotlights were on Budhia Singh when he entered Limca Book of Records after running 65km non-stop from Puri to Bhubaneswar.        
	But the states Olympic dreams surrounding Budhia were shaken recently at an annual sports event of the DAV School, where Budhia, a UKG student, could not even make it to the final of two events.         
	His name managed to pull a huge crowd to the Chandrasekharpur premises, where the boy won the first prize in the eating race. But he failed to make it to the final of the short race and the one-leg-hopping race even as he was competing with students two years junior to him.        
	Generally considered an athletics genius, Budhias performance came as a surprise. His performance was disappointing, said Naba Kishor Mohapatra, the school PET teacher.         
	Soon, questions were being raised about the nature of training being imparted to him.         
	The government never consulted any expert before training him. His training is whimsical and late. In China they start training kids from the tender age of seven, said Biranchi Das, Budhiyas former coach.        
	But the boys present coach is unperturbed by the performance. Ninety per cent of students of his age will be better than him in short races. They had killed his speed even before he reached the sports hostel, said Das.        
	Speed is a gift of god that can only improve with practice. Sprint queen P.T. Usha had suggested that the boy practise regularly. Isnt she an expert? Das retorted.

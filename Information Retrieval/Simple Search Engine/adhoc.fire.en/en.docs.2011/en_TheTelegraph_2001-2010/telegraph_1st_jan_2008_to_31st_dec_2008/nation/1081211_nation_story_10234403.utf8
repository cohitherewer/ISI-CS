	Patna, Dec. 10: Patna High Court today commuted the death sentence awarded to don and former JD-U MP Anand Mohan Singh to life imprisonment. It also acquitted six others convicted in connection with the murder of a Bihar district magistrate 14 years ago.        
	The Patna district and sessions court had awarded the capital punishment to Anand Mohan, former JD-U leaders Akhlaq Ahmad and Arun Kumar, and life imprisonment to party MLA Munna Shukla, Anand Mohans wife Lovely, former parliamentarian S.S. Thakur and Harendra Kumar for the murder G. Krishnaiyah.        
	A mob carrying the body of then dreaded gangster Chhotan Shukla had lynched Krisnaiyah, then Gopalganj district magistrate, to death on December 5, 1994, at Khabra near Muzaffarpur on the NH-28. The incident had rocked the state sending shock wave in the entire IAS circles.        
	Krishnaiyah, a native of Andhra Pradesh, had been murdered while he was returning to Gopalganj after attending a meeting convened by the Tirhut commissioner at Muzaffarpur in connection with the Sonepur cattle fair. Munna Shukla, the JD-U MLA from Lalganj, is the brother of Chhotan and was the part of the mob carrying the body of his elder brother who had been killed in a police encounter.        
	The division bench of Shivkirti Singh and S.M. Alam ruled life imprisonment for Anand Mohan Singh for provoking the mob to pounce on Krishnaiyah while acquitted six others citing lack of evidence as the reason.        
	Earlier, additional district and sessions judge Ramsreshtha Rai had ruled the accused persons guilty under Sections 302, 307, 147 and 427.

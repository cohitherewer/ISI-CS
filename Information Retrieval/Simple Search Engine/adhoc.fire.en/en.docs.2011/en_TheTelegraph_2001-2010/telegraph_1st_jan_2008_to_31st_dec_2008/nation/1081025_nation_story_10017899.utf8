          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chatterjee: Left torture                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The torture and insults from his former comrades today got too much for Somnath Chatterjee.        
	Deputy Speaker, come and run the House, the Speaker announced and dramatically strode out of the Lok Sabha on the last day of this session, seething at Left MPs.        
	The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta had asked if Chatterjee was using his authority to ensure the attack on Christians is not debated under an adjournment motion.        
	I have tolerated this for five days, Chatterjee bristled. Dont insult the Chair. You are deliberately doing it.        
	A moment later, he threatened to step down. Anything can be said in this House. It is becoming a torture. I dont want to sit here. You have put me here and if you want, I can leave the Chair right now, he said.        
	Seeing him about to walk off, UPA members burst into a chorus of no, no. Lalu Prasad got up and asked Chatterjee to ignore the Left. We are with you, he said.        
	The Speaker thanked him but said the Left MPs could not be ignored since they were part of the House. Chatterjee had walked out earlier too, disgusted with unruly MPs.        
	Chatterjee had rejected an adjournment motion moved by CPM member Basudev Acharia on the anti-Christian violence but allowed a debate under Rule 193. An adjournment motion bestows gravity on a subject since all House work is suspended to discuss it. Besides, it can lead to a vote.        
	When Acharia demanded an explanation, Chatterjee regretted that a fashion of querying the Speakers decisions had emerged and said he wasnt obliged to explain himself.        
	The Supreme Court today dismissed a PIL by a lawyer seeking to defend Chatterjee against attacks from the CPM. We cant codify parliamentary conventions, it said.        
	Veto on PM notices        
	The Speaker earlier rejected Left notices for a breach of privilege against the Prime Minister. The notices accused Manmohan Singh of failing to keep his promise about taking the deal to the House before it was operationalised.        
	Chatterjee said Singh was a member of the other House, and also rejected the notices on merit. According to Kaul amp; Shakdher (the rulebook) non-implementation of an assurance given by a minister on the floor of the House is neither a breach of privilege nor a contempt of the House.        
	The Left has now lost the last parliamentary device it could use to nail Singh on the nuclear deal, after its failed bid to oust the government in the July trust vote.        
	The notices had been submitted by Acharia and other CPM members. Chatterjee said he had heard Acharia and gone through extracts of Singhs speech, and decided no breach of privilege had been committed.

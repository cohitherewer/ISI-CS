                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Eye on polls, bid to speed up study bill
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Arjun: In a hurry                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Centre is contemplating writing to Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari to try and get the House to clear the right to education bill in this session, bypassing the customary scrutiny of a parliamentary panel.         
	The right to education bill was today tabled in the Rajya Sabha by junior education minister M.A.A. Fatmi, ending months of tension over the fulfilment of a promise made by the UPA in 2004.        
	Once tabled, a bill is generally referred to a parliamentary standing committee for its comments, but it is not mandatory. The panel usually takes a few months to conclude its findings, after which the recommendations are forwarded to the ministry concerned. Once the panels suggestions are addressed, the House debates the bill after which it is voted on.         
	But sources close to education minister Arjun Singh have said that the government was considering pushing the bill through the Rajya Sabha without referring it to the standing committee.         
	Arjun himself is learnt to be uncertain about the controversial move, fearing it may backfire.         
	The UPA had promised, in its common minimum programme, to legislate on the right to education. The government can claim it has fulfilled its promise of introducing the bill in Parliament, as once tabled in the Rajya Sabha, it cannot lapse even if the tenure of the Lok Sabha ends.         
	But sections in the government are keen to try and get the bill cleared in the Rajya Sabha, as it would add to the UPAs political gains for the 2009 elections, sources said.         
	A letter to Vice-President Ansari has been drafted and is currently with Arjun, the sources said.         
	Arjun and some others in the HRD ministry are, however, concerned that an attempt to rush through the bill might be seen as a blatant political stunt, an official said.         
	It may also convey to the House... that we have something in the bill that we wish to hide. Since we have nothing to hide, there is no sense in pushing for bypassing the standing committee, a source close to the HRD minister said.         
	The bill aims to enforce a 2002 constitutional amendment that made education a fundamental right.         
	Under the bill, the central and state governments are together legally responsible for providing schooling to all children between the ages of six and 14.         
	The bill seeks to put in place a neighbourhood schooling system in three years, ban all entrance tests and punish schools that take donations from parents.         
	It will also prohibit schools and governments from hiring para-teachers and denying admission to a child without a transfer certificate or a birth certificate.

	Cuttack, July 20: The Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Birthplace Museum will start a sound and light show with a little push from Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP).         
	While there would be an open-air gallery to accommodate 100-odd viewers, installation of light and sound system is expected to be ready in six months time, said museum director Chandrabhanu Patel, while talking to The Telegraph. Patel said a three-member technical team representing RSP visited the museum on Sunday to take stock of the work. Bids for the project is underway.         
	We have submitted a Rs 30lakh project-estimate and RSP has assured us that they would fund the entire cost, Patel said.         
	The proposed project involves a 20-minute show on Netajis life based on a script penned by Bijay Mishra, with sets designed by Asim Basu.         
	Meanwhile, the museum has also begun work on a garden within the premises that would double up as an childrens park. Work is on to etch out a relief that would depict the life of Netaji  from his early life to the freedom struggle. The relief would be on the insides of the boundary walls.         
	The relief would be an attractive summation of a great mans life that we hope would attract the children and make them curious to know more, an official explained.         
	Work on a new gallery, showcasing household articles of Netaji and his family, is also on. Articles collected from people who knew the family and those found in the mansion would go on display in the gallery.         
	The museum already has eight galleries depicting different phases in Netajis life. Sections include his early life, student and political life, his time in the INA. There is also a special room where Netaji was born where the original furniture and article have been kept intact.         
	A state-of-the-art media room with hi-tech sound-system and screens screening films on Netajis life and a library and letters section was also added recently.

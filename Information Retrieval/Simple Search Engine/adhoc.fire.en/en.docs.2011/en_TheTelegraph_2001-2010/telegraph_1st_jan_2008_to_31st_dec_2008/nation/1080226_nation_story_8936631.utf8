  - Environmentalist wants mortality check          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar Feb. 25: Greenpeace India, an environment activists group, has blamed the Orissa government for its failure to check deaths of the Olive Ridley Turtles along its coast despite requisite resources.        
	Accusing the government of failing to check turtle mortality, the agency, in a media statement, has claimed that from November 2007 to January 2008, 2,970 carcasses have been counted along the coastal stretch in Orissa.         
	Greenpeace also asked the state government to reduce the rate of turtle mortality by 20 per cent, at the least, by the end of April 2008.        
	Its ironic that the turtle toll till January 31 was 3,000 in the Paradip-Chilika stretch, a dramatic 76 per cent increase from the average mortality of the previous four seasons, said Sanjiv Gopal, a campaigner for the Greenpeace India.         
	In 2007, the government received a Central assistance of Rs 2 crore for turtles protection, the organisation said.        
	The funds were disbursed in November 2007. The fisheries department also acquired two patrol vessels to enforce the no-trawling rule and protect both turtles and traditional fishermen, he added.        
	Greenpeace claimed that it had been monitoring the scene in the current season (2007-2008) from November 2007 to ensure that the resources were being utilised.         
	From the evidence gathered till January 2008, its clear that despite required resources, the government has failed to protect turtles that throng Orissas coastal waters, the environmental pressure group claimed.         
	It also stressed that illegal fishing, especially trawling, continued unabated in Devi river.         
	The situation in the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary is unclear, as no sources of independent verification is possible. Ironically, after the resources for patrolling was provided, the situation went from bad to worse, the agency report stated.        
	Further, the state does not seem open to the idea of collaborating with conservation groups and NGOs, to check the infant mortality, the organisation claimed.        
	At least, as a first step, the government should commit itself to bring down the total casualties this year. The state then needs to set progressively depreciating mortality reduction targets for the coming seasons, Gopal added.

          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, April 25: A meeting between Pranab Mukherjee and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has fuelled speculation that the Centre has resumed the bid for a broader consensus on the nuclear deal.        
	The foreign minister had dropped by at Amars home last evening hours after saying the government would take the sense of the House on the deal.         
	Sources said the meeting, coming amid talk of a Congress-Samajwadi patch-up, lasted 30-35 minutes.        
	Although the odds are against the Centre launching an all-out push for the deal at a time it is on the back foot over inflation, Congress sources stressed that the government had never said it had abandoned the deal.        
	They said the Centre was continuing with the political process to bring the Left on board while seeking a broader political consensus, as spelt out by the Prime Minister in Parliament.        
	Government sources, too, said they were still working on the nuclear deal and there was nothing to suggest that it was a closed chapter.        
	The UPA-Left committee on the deal is to meet on May 6, when the Left leaders are likely to ask to see the text of the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.         
	The Centre is expected to reject the demand on the technical ground that the text is yet to be initialled.        
	The Left parties are looking to drag the discussion on till July, hoping to upset the governments deadlines and stall any possibility of the deal being operationalised.        
	The Left does not attach any importance to US assistant secretary of state Richard Bouchers statement that the US domestic law, the Hyde Act, is not binding on the 123 Agreement (the nuclear deal).        
	We have made our position on the nuclear deal very clear many a time. The 123 Agreement is anchored in the Hyde Act, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Patients find it hard to meet doctors
                                                                                                               Patients find it hard to meet doctors
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 22: Healthcare services in the three government medical college hospitals in Orissa continued to remain affected today with the indefinite strike of junior doctors entering the fourth day.        
	A senior doctor at Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital in Cuttack said several patients were forced to leave the hospital without getting an examination due to the staff shortage.        
	The impact of the strike had heightened after the striking junior medicos restrained postgraduate students from performing their duties at the three hospitals on Thursday.        
	The Junior Doctors Associations (JDA) at the medical college hospitals in Cuttack, Berhampur and Burla have been on strike since Wednesday. They are demanding that their monthly stipend be made Rs 13,000 in their first year, which is equivalent to the basic salary of assistant surgeons appointed by the state government.        
	At the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College Hospital, the unavailability of junior medicos tied the hands of the seniors. Doctors are attending only serious cases. Surgeries have been postponed.        
	A patient said: After the senior doctor came on a round in the morning we did not see any doctor till the evening.         
	Junior doctors continue to be the lifeline of the healthcare services in the hospital because several posts are unmanned.        
	Hospital superintendent Trilochan Sahu claimed the situation was under control. However, he said, a crisis is imminent if the strike continues for some more days.         
	We have already initiated steps to requisition services of at least 50 doctors posted in rural areas, the superintendent said.        
	Efforts by the state government to get the junior doctors working have failed.         
	Director of Medical Education and Training Nayan Mohanty visited Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College on Friday and held discussions with the striking doctors. But the talks reportedly failed.        
	The strike will continue till we get a definite response from the government, said Paresh Behera, the President of Junior Doctors Association at SCB Medical College in Cuttack.

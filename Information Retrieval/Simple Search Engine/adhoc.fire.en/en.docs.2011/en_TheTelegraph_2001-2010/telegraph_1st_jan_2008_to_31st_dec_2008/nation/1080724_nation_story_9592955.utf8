  - Ram built and demolished bridge, Centre tells SC          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, July 23: The Centre told the Supreme Court today that Ram Setu may have been built by a God-like man but since it was destroyed by the same God-like man, it couldnt be treated as a place of worship.        
	The governments counsel, Fali S. Nariman, countering arguments that the Sethusamudram project would harm the setu, quoted from the Kamba Ramayan, widely revered in the south, to reinforce the position.         
	This is the first time since the row over the project erupted that the Centre has resorted to a religion-based argument in court to counter its critics and take it forward.        
	The government had triggered protests when it filed an affidavit last year, later withdrawn under pressure, saying there was no proof of Rams existence and, hence, he couldnt have built the setu.        
	The same scripture which says Lord Ram built the bridge also says he destroyed the bridge into pieces with his arrows and anything that has been destroyed cannot be worshipped in Hinduism, Nariman told the court, seeking lifting of the August 31, 2007, stay on the project.        
	He cited several studies to argue that the canal, which will reduce the sailing time between the countrys west and east coasts, had been conceived over 150 years ago. Work started two years ago and an enormous amount of money had been spent since, he said.         
	No one said anything about religion then, Nariman said, implying it was too late to scrap the project or change its alignment which, saffron groups claim, will harm the setu.        
	Nariman pointed out that a lot of care was being taken to ensure that the construction didnt hurt anyones faith.         
	Dredging work was being done with great circumspection. No explosives were being usedthe government was not flagrantly violating any law and it was being done without destroying anyones faith.        
	The hearing began yesterday but the Centre didnt spell out its stand fearing it would cast a shadow on the trust vote.         
	Having reaffirmed its majority, the government pushed ahead with vigour today, ruling out alignment changes, as sought by many opponents of the project.        
	K. Parasaran, counsel for Hindu Munnani leader Rama Gopalan, also quoted from the Kamba Ramayan to claim the setu was built by Ram and was a place of worship.         
	Nariman opposed the contention, saying Ram had himself destroyed the setu after his victory over Ravan. Ram destroyed the bridge. So where is the question of the integrity of the bridge being destroyed?         
	Nariman also shot down the demand for an Archaeological Survey of India study to establish if the setu was man-made or natural, saying the projects critics could reject the findings on the ground of faith.         
	The arguments will continue on Thursday.

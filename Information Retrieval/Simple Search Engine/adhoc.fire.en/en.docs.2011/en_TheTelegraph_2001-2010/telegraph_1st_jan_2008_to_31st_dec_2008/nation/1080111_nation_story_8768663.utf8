	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The peoples car may not have scared fellow four-wheelers on the road but one segment doesnt like it at all  the zip, zap, zoom brigade.
    
	Two-wheeler makers are clearly nervous, though they are not yet scrambling to jazz up their old horses.
    
	Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj said two-wheelers had their own market and do not compete with cars. In fact, we are launching motorcycles priced higher than the Rs 1-lakh car launched today.
    
	But he was worried. We have to see how the Tata Nano performs, he added.
    
	In a more combative tone, Bajaj said being the first in the small car segment didnt mean there was no space for others. We will come out with our own version of a small car by 2011. We are developing technology, which will dramatically change the fuel efficiency concept. We are talking in terms of giving 30 to 40km per litre, not 20km a litre.
    
	Auto experts say the Nano could trigger a 10 per cent shift from the two-wheeler market towards the small car, but added that a clearer picture would emerge only six months down the road.
    
	We dont think the two-wheeler market would be affected, said Takashi Kajikawa, president and CEO, Yamaha. We feel it will grow in the coming years.
    
	Hero Honda MD Pawan Munjal, however, wasnt so confident. 
    
	We have to wait and watch to see how the Nano picks up, he said. Then we will decide (on future strategies), he said.

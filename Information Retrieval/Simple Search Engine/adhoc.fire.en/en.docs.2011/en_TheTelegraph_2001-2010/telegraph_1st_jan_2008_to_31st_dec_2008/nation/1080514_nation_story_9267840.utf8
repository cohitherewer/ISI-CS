	New Delhi, May 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will be the first foreign leader to address the first parliament of Bhutan during his two-day visit from May 16 that would see the commissioning of the biggest project between the neighbours so far.         
	Singh, visiting Bhutan after recent elections to the 47-member parliament, will address a joint session of the House, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said here today.         
	The Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party, which was backed by the monarch himself, won 45 seats in the elections held on March 24.         
	Singh will commission the 1,020MW Tala hydroelectric power project, which has been built with Indian help.         
	Tala is located in Chukha Dzongkhag in western Bhutan. The project is being managed by the Tala Hydroelectric Project Authority and is located on the Wangchu river. Situated at a height of 860m, it is the regions largest project.         
	Singh will also meet King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and his father Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the monarch who paved the way for the democratic transition.         
	Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who started out as the youngest monarch in the world, is credited with gradually abdicating the role of the monarchy in favour of peoples rule and leading the country to modernity.         
	Singh would also meet Bhutanese Prime Minister Lyonchen Jigme Y. Thinley. He would also inaugurate the 1,095MW Punatsangchhu hydroelectric project, which, too, is a joint venture scheme.

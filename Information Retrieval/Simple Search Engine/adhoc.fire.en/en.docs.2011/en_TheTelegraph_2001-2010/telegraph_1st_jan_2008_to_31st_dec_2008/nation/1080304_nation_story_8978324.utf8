 Buzz in Big Cities 

       
	Small-town chant in metro gallery
  
	Kapil Dev has pitched in where Mahendra Singh Dhoni did after last years T20 triumph  on small-town virtues. Both had made their points before a metro audience.
  
	The 1983 World Cup icon believes his success was possible because he lived in Chandigarh, where he had more time to hone his skills than many big-city lads who often have to spend hours commuting to the ground and back.
  
	If I had not come from Chandigarh, I wouldnt have played for India, the former skipper told a seminar recently on the future of Indian cities. In Chandigarh, it took him only 10 minutes to reach school and the ground. 
  
	It was pathetic to see children in Delhi lose time travelling, he said. In Chennai, a budding cricketer might have to travel as much as 40km to Chepauk each day for practice. The point was to have all facilities in your backyard, Kapil said.
  
	Dhoni, who led his young warriors to the T20 pinnacle, had told a Mumbai reception crowd last September that small-town boys were physically and mentally tougher.
    
	Lap it up at Olympic auction 
  
	Limited-edition laptops inspired by this years Beijing Olympics are up for grabs in India, Lenovo, one of the organisers of the games, recently announced in the capital.
  
	The laptops are being offered on www.lenovohopeauctions.com. Bidding closes on Thursday midnight.
  
	The laptops will share the theme of the Olympic torch relay, Cloud of Promise, officials said. The torch is travelling across the globe in the days leading up to the games. 
  
	The money collected from the auction will be distributed through the Lenovo Hope project to a variety of social causes, mostly to encourage disadvantaged children to take up sports as a hobby, if not as a career. 
  
	When we say disadvantaged, we mean those with physical or economic disabilities, an official said.
  
	Hoax call to get on train
  
	Ayantibhai Prajapati missed his train but such was his desperation not to miss his wifes treatment, he made a hoax call to ensure the express was delayed long enough for him to board.
  
	The 51-year-old businessman, arrested after his call was traced, was heading to Surat last week with his wife to see doctors. An important session was lined up, one that offered the promise of a breakthrough in her cancer treatment.
  
	When the couple didnt get the train from Bandra, the originating station, Prajapati thought he could delay it at Borivli, the next stop in Mumbai, by making a hoax call. 
  
	He dialled the police control room, which stopped and searched the Lokshakti Express. But having found nothing, the officers decided to trace the call and caught Prajapati as he tried to board it.
  
	The police are probing all angles but dont think he has terror links. They were desperate to get to Surat. They say their taxi driver also took a longer route, an official said.
    
	Rickshaw plea
  
	The Delhi government is being urged to hand out more cycle-rickshaw permits, a request that would go against previous plans to free key arteries of slow movers.
  
	Delhi High Court recently issued notices to the civic bodies, asking them if they would issue more rickshaw permits. They have time till April 8 to submit their replies.
  
	An NGO, Manushi Sangathan, filed a plea saying the citys six lakh rickshaw-pullers were at the mercy of corrupt policemen as the number of licences hadnt been raised.

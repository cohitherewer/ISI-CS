          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: The government has launched an effort to look for adverse effects of herbal and traditional medicines  the first formal pharmacovigilance programme in ayurvedas 3,000-year history.         
	The health ministry today announced that doctors and patients would be urged to report possible adverse effects of ayurveda, Unani and Siddha drugs, which will be investigated by a network of institutions of traditional medicine across the country.         
	Indias drug laws exempt traditional medicines from being subjected to rigorous safety and toxicology tests as long as each of their ingredients is among substances mentioned in ancient texts of traditional medicine.         
	The move comes at a time when studies in the US have detected potentially toxic levels of metals such as lead or mercury in ayurvedic drugs from India and raised questions about the quality of herbal products.         
	We have to come clean for the world, said Madhav Singh Baghel, director of the Post Graduate Institute of Ayurveda at the Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, designated as the national research centre for the programme.         
	Theres a growing demand for traditional products, but the world also wants formal safety data, Baghel said.         
	The Jamnagar institute will train physicians from eight regional centres for traditional medicine, including two for Unani and Siddha, to seek out adverse reactions patients consuming traditional products may report.         
	Any health professional or even patients could report suspected adverse events, Baghel said. The eight regional centres will analyse data and submit reports to the Gujarat institute, where an apex technical expert committee will again investigate each event to determine whether it had any link to the herbal product being consumed.         
	Any adverse events confirmed through such investigations would be reported to drug regulators and to the World Health Organisation, officials with the health ministrys department of ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha said.         
	Pharmacological experts have pointed out that a pharmacovigilance programme established in India a few years ago for modern allopathic medicines has virtually collapsed because of poor reporting by doctors, patients and the drug industry.         
	Were trying to learn lessons from that failure, Baghel said. It is important to sensitise both practitioners and patients to stay alert and report suspected adverse events.        
	Experts estimate the annual market size for traditional and herbal products in India to be about $300 million. More than 6,000 companies, including 300 large ones, are manufacturing or selling herbal remedies.         
	Last month, a study released by researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine had detected metals in 19 per cent of Indian-made products and 21 per cent of US-manufactured herbal products laced with traditional ash, or bhasmas.

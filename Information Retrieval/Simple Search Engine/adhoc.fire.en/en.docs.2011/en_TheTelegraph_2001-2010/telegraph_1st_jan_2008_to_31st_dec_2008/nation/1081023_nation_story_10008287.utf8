	Sriharikota, Oct. 22: The successful launch of Chandrayaan-1 may stimulate a spurt in export orders for Indias space services and products or inspire more young people to take up space science as a career, space scientists said.         
	The flow of science data from the moon if the spacecraft is successfully put into its intended 100km lunar orbit is likely to add fresh enthusiasm and momentum to Indias fledgling programme for planetary exploration, they said.         
	The first direct impact of the launch, they said, will be more confidence in the PSLV that has repeatedly proved its reliability by launching 30 spacecraft so far.         
	The PSLV launched today was upgraded by adding three tonnes of propellants into each of its strap-on motors to achieve a higher payload capability, establishing its potential role to carry heavier satellites into space than it has until now.         
	Isros commercial arm, Antrix Corporation, involved in selling services and products had orders worth about Rs 900 crore last year. Were looking to expand business by about 25 per cent per year, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said after the launch.         
	Scientists are hoping the orbiter mission would fuel enthusiasm for future pure science missions, and even manned space missions from India. The government has already approved a second lunar mission. Mars will be the next natural destination for Isro, Nair said.         
	Some Isro engineers are hoping a fresh thrust on science missions would increase the number of young people joining the space programme.         
	We may not be able to compete with IT companies (on salaries), but well give our scientists respectable living conditions, Nair said.

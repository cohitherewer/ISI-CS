          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: The multi-crore industrial land scam rocked the Assembly today with the Opposition demanding a high-level probe.        
	The Naveen Patnaik government claims to have provided a clean administration. Perhaps this land scam is the brightest example of the clean administration, said firebrand Congress member Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra while moving an adjournment motion on the matter.        
	Mohapatra said the state-owned Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation was entrusted with allotment of land to the industrial units in Bhubaneswar.         
	However, the corporation had not adopted any transparent policy and allotted land to industries arbitrarily, he alleged.        
	Citing a few instances, the Congress legislator said while Delhi-based Unitech Private Limited had been allotted 10 acres at a rate of Rs 21.1 crore per acre, a few other companies like Silicon, Centurion Institute of Technology and Prem Pratisthan had been provided land with a premium of Rs 6 lakh per acre. Two acres have been allotted to Team India Private Limited at a price of Rs 37.29 lakh, he said.        
	Several technical education institutions have been allotted industrial land, alleged Mohapatra. One private firm has constructed residential house and swimming pool on the land allotted for industrial purpose, he added.        
	Opposition whip Satya Bhusan Sahu said a House Committee had been constituted two years ago to probe into alleged irregularities in the allotment of industrial land. However, the committee had met only twice, he rued.        
	Sahu said Konark Cement and Asbestos Limited had been allotted 17 acres for only Rs 10.71 lakh for setting up an industrial unit. However, it was later allowed to run an engineering college on the land. Besides, 710 acres were allotted in favour of the company regularising encroachment, he alleged.        
	Industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan assured the members that a probe would be undertaken if they came up with specific allegations on irregularities in land allotment.         
	He also promised to provide the details within a month relating to land allotment with the name of allottees and the land price and whether the land has been utilised properly.

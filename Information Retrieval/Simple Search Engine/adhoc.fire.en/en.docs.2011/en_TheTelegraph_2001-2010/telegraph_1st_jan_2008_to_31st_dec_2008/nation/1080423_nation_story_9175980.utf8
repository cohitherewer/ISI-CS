The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pratibha toes Sonias line, silent on PMs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pratibha toes Sonias line, silent on PMs
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Santiago, April 22: As a President who owes her position solely to Sonia Gandhis nod for her choice last year, Pratibha Patils conflict of loyalties to the Congress president on the one hand and declared government policies on the other was bound to emerge at some point.        
	It repeatedly showed up in Chile yesterday on the final leg of her maiden trip abroad.         
	Chile rolled out the red carpet for Patil and took a number of decisions in the run-up to her visit to make it special. These included liberalisation of the visa regime exclusively for Indian businessmen, an unequivocal reiteration of Chiles support for Indias permanent membership of the UN Security Council and a string of agreements between the two countries in the presence of Patil and Latin Americas first elected female President.        
	Bachelet, who was beaming throughout yesterday in the presence of another female President who is old enough to be her mother, also offered India a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), an upgradation of the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) that New Delhi and Santiago signed in 2006.        
	Patils response to the offer was silence.        
	In her response to the Chilean Presidents remarks after the two countries signed four agreements at the La Moneda presidential palace here, Patil touched upon every point made by Bachelet except the offer of an FTA.        
	The reason for her silence is not far too seek. Sonia has opposed FTAs and at least in one instance wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressing her opposition to such agreements.        
	But it is the UPA governments declared policy to promote an FTA with Chile and the Prime Minister, as a free trader, has repeatedly supported FTAs with countries, sometimes using the euphemism of comprehensive economic cooperation agreement that includes an FTA.        
	Like a good diplomat, taking the cue from the President, Nalin Surie, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, was circumspect yesterday in his comments about an FTA with Chile.        
	Briefing reporters after the bilateral summit here, Surie was non-committal about pursuing the idea.        
	Free Trade Agreement is one of the several options we have. We already have the PTA working wonderfully with them. We will have to take it forward... it could be an extension of the existing PTA.         
	Despite Patils clear lack of enthusiasm for an FTA with Chile, Bachelet, whose life story epitomises her determination to fight for what she believes in, did not give up.        
	In a speech at a banquet last night in honour of Patil, Bachelet reminded the Indian President that the process of considering an FTA between Chile and India was already a commitment by New Delhi, implying that there should be no backsliding on this.        
	Allow me to mention the feasibility studies for a Free Trade Agreement with India that are underway... Bachelet said.        
	However, between her first remarks about an FTA in the morning and the banquet speech, Bachelet probably got the message behind Patils deafening silence on the FTA proposal.        
	Smartly, Chiles President quoted Sonia in her banquet speech, albeit on another issue.        
	Foreign leaders often quote Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and other celebrated Indians in such speeches, but it is rare for a foreign head of state to quote the Congress president.        
	But even then, Patil did not flinch in her loyalty to the Congress presidents line as opposed to her own governments declared policy. She remained silent on the FTA issue.        
	Patil also spoke yesterday at a joint meeting between a delegation from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Chile-India Chamber of Commerce.        
	There, too, she touched upon every aspect of economicties between India and Chile  except, of course, the FTA.        
	The Presidents silence on the FTA curiously puts her at odds with her own government, a dilemma that the Prime Minister will have to resolve before Bachelet visits India, possibly next year to take stock of relations between the two sides.        
	In contrast to the political expediency shown by Patil, a statement issued on March 28, 2006, after ministerial talks between Anand Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs and his Chilean counterpart, Carlos Portales, said: India and Chile had agreed to... negotiate the FTA in an early and time-bound manner. The Manmohan Singh government also committed in a joint statement with Chile on January 21, 2005, after a visit by Bachelets predecessor to New Delhi that the PTA that was signed as a sequel to that visit will lead to a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement eventually.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 25: Judicial officers of the state were sensitised on the nuances of cyber crimes at a workshop organised by the Orissa Judicial Academy.         
	Nearly 300 judicial officers of the state participated in the workshop organised yesterday with the focus on the computer as target and tool. The participants included district judges, chief judicial magistrates and sub-divisional judicial magistrates.         
	Justice Arijit Pasayat said at the workshop: Cyber crimes pose a threat to national security. Changes in the existing laws is the need of the hour.         
	The daylong workshop stressed that the threat was not an outcome of the intelligence of a criminal, but stemmed from ignorance of judicial officers.        
	The challenge in cyber crime cases includes getting evidence that is not physical but digital, speakers explained.

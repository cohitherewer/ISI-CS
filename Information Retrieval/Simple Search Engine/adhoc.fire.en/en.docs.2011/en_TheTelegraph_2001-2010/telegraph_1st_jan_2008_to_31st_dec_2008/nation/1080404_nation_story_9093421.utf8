	Srinagar, April 3: Police have arrested the Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief spokesperson, Abdul Khaliq Dar, an ideologue who lure Kashmiri youths to militancy.

	His arrest came after a series of round-ups, beginning with the Hizbs operational chief commander Gazi Misbahuddin four months back. Since then, the group has suffered casualties or arrests almost every day.         
	On December 5, Gazi was arrested in Srinagar. The same day, Hizbs central Kashmir commander Tajamul Islam was also caught.         
	Dar, who had crossed the border to Pakistan in the early 1990s, returned to the Valley in 2003.        
	Security forces have killed or arrested a few dozen of the outfits top commanders in the past four months.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raj Kumar, Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Aarushi Talwar murder suspects Krishna and Raj Kumar were granted bail today after the CBI failed to chargesheet them within 90 days of their arrest.        
	Krishna, the compounder of 15-year-old Aarushis dentist father Rajesh, and Raj Kumar, a domestic help of the Talwars friends Anita and Praful Durrani, had been arrested by the CBI on June 13.        
	A special court in Ghaziabad today rejected the CBIs arguments against bail. The agency told the court it had phone records suggesting the accused were constantly in touch with Hemraj, the Talwars domestic help who was murdered with Aarushi on May 15 night.        
	The court dismissed this as well as the claim that Krishna and Raj Kumar, both Nepal citizens, could flee India. Nor did it agree with the CBIs point that the duo might try to destroy evidence if released.        
	Krishna and Raj Kumar had to furnish sureties of Rs 25,000 each.         
	All those arrested in the Noida double murder have now been freed on bail. Vijay Mandal, domestic help of the Talwars neighbours, received bail last week after the CBI failed to chargesheet him within the stipulated 90 days.        
	Rajesh, arrested by Noida police, had got bail after the CBI, which took up the case on May 31, said it had no evidence against him.        
	If Raj Kumar were involved in the incident in any way, why didnt he flee at the time of the murder, being a Nepal citizen? defence lawyer Narendra Yadav asked after todays ruling. That my client had stayed on in Noida even a month after Aarushis murder proves he was not involved.        
	The CBI has done more than six narco-analysis tests in the case  including two on Raj Kumar  and is sitting pretty with phone records and a blood-stained T-shirt. But it has not yet found the murder weapon with which the victims throats were slit, nor their missing cellphones.        
	CBI director Ashwini Kumar merely said: Whatever the court has declared, well abide by it.

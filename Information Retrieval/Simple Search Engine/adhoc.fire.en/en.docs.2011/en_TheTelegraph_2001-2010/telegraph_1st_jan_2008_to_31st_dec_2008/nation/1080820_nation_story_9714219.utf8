	Cuttack, Aug. 19: Justice Basudev Panigrahi Commission, probing into the ethnic violence in Orissas Kandhmal district, began its second round of hearings on Monday in Cuttack, with an extended term.         
	The government extended the Commissions term that lapsed on August 8 by six months. The one-man commission was constituted by the government to inquire into facts and circumstances leading to the violence that had hit the tribal-dominated district during Christmas in December 2007.         
	Justice Panigrahi would conduct the hearings at the Circuit House in Cuttack till August 22.

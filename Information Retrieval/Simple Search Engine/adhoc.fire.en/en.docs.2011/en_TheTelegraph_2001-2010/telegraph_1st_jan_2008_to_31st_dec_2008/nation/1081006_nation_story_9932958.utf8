          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Rashtriya Janata Dal has shrugged off Amar Singhs attacks on the Congresss Shivraj Patil as the UPA ally tries to seal a deal with the Samajwadi Party.        
	Samajwadi boss Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD chief Lalu Prasad are said to have agreed not to field Lok Sabha candidates against each other in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in an understanding last month, sources said.        
	The deal, in the works since Mulayam rescued the UPA in the July 22 trust vote but not officially announced so far, is likely to benefit Lalu Prasad more than Mulayam, who can split the Yadav votes in Bihar and harm the RJD.        
	The understanding between the two Yadavs, once daggers drawn, probably explained why the RJD didnt appear worried that Amar was targeting the Union home minister often. The Samajwadis naraazgi (displeasure) will be resolved, an RJD leader said.         
	Amar had said yesterday Patil should resign until the Jamia Nagar encounter probe was over, less than two weeks after he attacked Patil over the Delhi serial blasts.        
	RJD leaders believe the attacks on Patil are a result of the deadlock in seat-sharing talks between the Samajwadi and the Congress, not a matter of policy.         
	We dont think the opposition is at a policy level because the two parties (Congress and Samajwadi) have some differences on seat-sharing, said an RJD leader. Many in Lalu Prasads party view the tirade against Patil as a reflection of the Samajwadis anger at defectors Beni Prasad Verma and Raj Babbar as well as Amar Singhs personal differences with the home minister.         
	Mulayam is fighting to retain his turf against Mayavati while Lalu Prasad faces a challenge from Nitish Kumar.        
	In 2005, Nitish rode not only the anger at the lack of development during the RJDs reign but also because of splits in Lalu Prasads minority and Yadav votes, sources said.        
	Mulayams effect on Bihars Yadavs had been felt in around 42 Assembly seats where RJD candidates lost by a slender margin. The Samajwadis have four MLAs in Bihar, two of whom have spoken against the truck with the RJD.

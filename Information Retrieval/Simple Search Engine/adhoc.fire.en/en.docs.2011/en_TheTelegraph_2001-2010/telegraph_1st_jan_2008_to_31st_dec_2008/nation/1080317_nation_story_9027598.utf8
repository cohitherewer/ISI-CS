  - Japanese citizens harassed in Konark, Orissa govt orders probe          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Konark Sun Temple                                        
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: Following uproar in the Assembly yesterday, an embarrassed Orissa government has invited a group of Japanese tourists, who were allegedly harassed and prevented by a guide from visiting Konark Sun Temple, back to the state.        
	Tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra said that he had spoken to the tourists who are in Gaya at present and requested them to revisit the temple, a Unesco World Heritage site.        
	He also said that stern action would be taken against the erring guide, Madhusudan Patra. The tourists had lodged an FIR against the particular guide.        
	Following media reports, the matter was taken up in the Assembly, which prompted the government action. Patra allegedly harassed a group of six Japanese women when they went to visit Konark on March 11. He also forced the group to hire him as the guide and demanded excess money, though they had purchased entry tickets.         
	As they refused to oblige him, the guide, along with fellow guides, allegedly threatened to bar them from visiting the temple. The tourists then left the place without visiting the heritage site, the media reports stated.         
	When they demanded refund, the official at the counter denied that too.        
	The tourists were a part of a group of 40 Japanese citizens visiting India under a programme organised by India-Japan Friendship Club.        
	In a related incident at Bhubaneswar, police allegedly refused to co-operate with two Swiss tourists who met with an accident on March 7. Monika Kessler and her brother Nikalus had lodged a complaint with the local police against a truck driver, who had hit their vehicle and later assaulted them.        
	The police allegedly did not receive their complaint and refused to take action against the culprit. The brother-sister duo then intimated the Swiss embassy, Orissa governor, chief minister and police commissioner about the incident.         
	The city police, in the meanwhile, arrested the accused truck driver for harassing the tourists.        
	Raising the issue in the Assembly yesterday, ruling BJD member Ananta Das demanded an inquiry into the twin incidents by a senior officer and urged the state government to act in order to restore visitors confidence.

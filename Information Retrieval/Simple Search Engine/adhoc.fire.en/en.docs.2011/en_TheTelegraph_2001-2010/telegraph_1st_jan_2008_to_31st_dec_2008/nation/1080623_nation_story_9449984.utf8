          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A tiger beetle                                        
	Darjeeling, June 22: Two men from Czech Republic were arrested today with hundreds of live beetles, butterflies and larvae in Darjeeling district.        
	The two have identified themselves as Petro Sevacha (51) and Emil Kusera (52).         
	Forest officials picked up the duo after keeping track of them for the past few days when they toured Srikhola and Rimbick, about 70km from Darjeeling. The foreigners have been handed over to police.        
	They had been in the area for the past three-four days and we were finding their movement very suspicious. We arrested them from the Srikhola-Rimbick area this afternoon, said A. Lepcha, the range officer (north) of Singalila National Park.         
	More than 200 live beetles and an equal number of butterflies and larvae were found in their possession, along with tools used for trapping the insects, said Lepcha.         
	Beetles are not on the list of endangered species, but collecting a large number invites action.        
	According to forest officers, each tiger beetle, in demand for traditional medicines in China, Japan and in Latin American countries, fetches between Rs 6,000 and Rs 7,000 abroad.        
	The foreigners will face charges under the Wildlife Protection Act and will be produced in court tomorrow.         
	Two years ago, some residents were arrested with beetles and they were apparently being paid between Rs 150 and Rs 200 for each insect.

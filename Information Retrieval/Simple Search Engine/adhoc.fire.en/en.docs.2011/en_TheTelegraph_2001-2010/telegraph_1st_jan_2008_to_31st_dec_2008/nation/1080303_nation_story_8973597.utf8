The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Budget fever grips US
                                                                                                               Budget fever grips US
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, March 2: George W. Bush won the US presidency campaigning as a compassionate conservative.        
	On Indias budget day, the primary India-specific business organisation in America that represents those who benefited most from Bushs tax cuts described P. Chidambarams proposals as compassionate.        
	The UPA coalition delivered a compassionate, pro-people budget that will bring smiles to the young and old and farmers alike  while not disturbing the boom under way in the corporate sector, the US-India Business Council (USIBC) said in a statement.        
	India budget fever is rising in the US almost in proportion to a decline in frenzy in New Delhi and Mumbai compared with what it was 15 or 20 years ago, especially the time when jurist Nani Palkhivala used to deliver his much-awaited annual budget speech in Mumbais Brabourne Stadium.        
	From Monday, until March 13, there will be a string of budget briefings in cities that are the centres of US business, an unmistakable signal that what happens in Indias domestic political economy now matters in America.        
	These briefings began even as Chidambaram was delivering his budget speech.         
	Hours after presenting the budget, Chidambaram appeared via video link before an American audience assembled at the Indian consulate in New York and answered questions from a diverse crowd of economists, bankers, strategic thinkers and businessmen.        
	Indias consul general in New York, Neelam Deo, hosted the interaction and moderated the discussion.        
	Although India-specific institutions and organisations are helping with budget-related events, what is significant is the involvement of entities that are US or global.        
	On Tuesday in Menlo Park, California, for instance, KPMG  the US affiliate of the Swiss cooperative, KPMG International  will be the lead body with the USIBC organising a budget briefing. Indias consul-general in San Francisco, B.S. Prakash, will speak at the briefing.        
	Arun Kumar, lead partner of KPMGs India practice and a member of the USIBCs board of directors, intends to explain at the briefing how Chidambaram has signalled in the budget that the welcome mat is very much in place for foreign investments in India.        
	Kumar said: This signal came from much of what he did not do, such as not tinkering with the tax advantages for foreign institutional investors from favourable tax treaties like the one with Mauritius.        
	What is expected to be of primary interest to Americans is the UPAs steps to shelter the Indian economy and ensure its growth in the face of a slowdown or possible recession in the US.        
	Ron Somers, the USIBC president who was in Delhi when the budget was presented, said: The finance ministers emphasis on education, public health and agriculture makes this a compassionate budget  one that will sustain growth while demonstrating the governments commitment to ensuring that all segments of society benefit from the vitality under way in the present economy.        
	On Monday, Ernst and Young will do an impact assessment of the budget in association with the USIBC in Los Angeles.

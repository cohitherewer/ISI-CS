          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 16: Renaming the famous Digha variety of mango as Lalu Mango, wholesale traders have put them up for sale with a sticker of Lalu Prasad pasted on each juicy fruit.         
	Perhaps it was the runaway success of Lalu pitchkari, gulal and patakha among other items in the last Holi that prompted traders to name a variety of mango after the railway minister.        
	Other products that were branded in Lalus name include chocolates, cola and sattu.         
	Lalu Mango is doing brisk business with customers preferring it over other varieties, said a mango-seller gleefully at the Income-Tax roundabout, a favourite destination for mango buyers in Bihars capital.         
	The Maldah variety of Lalu Mango is selling at Rs 35 per kg. Other varieties of Maldah mangoes are being sold for Rs 30 a kg, though.         
	RJD spokesperson Shyam Razak gifted the Lalu Mango to the railway minister on the occasion of the latters birthday on July 11, prompting the party chief to break into guffaws.         
	Despite the Lalu brand doing a brisk business in his home turf, the RJD chief is hardly assured party success in the coming Lok Sabha polls, due within a year.         
	His partys position became evident when Lalu Prasad, admittedly a champion of backward classes and a Mandal messiah, went all out to woo the upper castes at a three-day party camp at Ramgarh that concluded yesterday.         
	I never spoke against the upper castes. I never asked any government officer to prepare khaini (tobacco) for me. I never said that I will make Bihars roads like Hema Malinis cheeks, Lalu Prasad said, clarifying: My political enemies went on a smearing campaign among the upper castes by putting offensive words in my mouth. I will expose them by writing a book.        
	After launching his blog, the minister now plans to write a book to debunk myths about his anti-upper caste image and expose those responsible for defaming him.        
	He said the RJD would work to get the upper castes in its fold and asked party cadre to equally respect all sections of the society.         
	Nitish Kumar, however, ridiculed the railway ministers speech at the RJD camp, which was probably his last before the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The camp manifested Lalu Prasads growing anxiety in the run-up to the polls. Lalu brand for consumer items and his efforts to woo all sections he has humiliated before will not fetch him votes, Nitish said.        
	Let the Lok Sabha polls get over. He (Lalu Prasad) will draw a big zero, were Nitish Kumars parting words.

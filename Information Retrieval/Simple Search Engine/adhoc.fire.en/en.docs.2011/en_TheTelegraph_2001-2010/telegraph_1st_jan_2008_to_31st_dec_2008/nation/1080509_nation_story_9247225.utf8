	New Delhi, May 8: Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan plans to take Dalit issues to a New York forum at a time when Mayavati, another champion of the communitys cause, is trying to reach out to voters down south.        
	Paswan, the Lok Janshakti Party chief and the UPAs most visible Dalit face, will lead a large delegation of Scheduled Caste and minority community MPs of all parties to the Dalit and Minorities International Conference at the Big Apple from July 4 to 6.        
	The debate over the womens reservation bill, in which some parties want sub-quotas for Other Backward Classes and minorities, would be taken up at the meet. It is being hosted by the American Federation of Muslims from India.        
	The demand for reservations in the private sector is another issue that will be discussed. A demand for quota for Dalit Christians and Muslims as well as reservations in the higher judiciary for Dalits, OBCs and minorities would also be taken up. According to Paswan, who is the Union steel minister, delegates from 20 countries will attend the conference. India will send about 200 participants. The rest of the delegates will come from the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Singapore, Japan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal and Vietnam. The minister has been networking with Dalit MPs at a parliamentary forum that meets regularly to discuss issues of common concern. While members from all other parties attend, those from Mayavatis BSP have been keeping away, sources said.

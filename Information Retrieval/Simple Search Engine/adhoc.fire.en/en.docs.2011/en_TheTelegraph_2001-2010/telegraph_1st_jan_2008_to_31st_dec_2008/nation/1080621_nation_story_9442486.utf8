          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Congress chief Sonia Gandhi with Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia at a rally in Ujjain on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Chennai, June 20: The PMK today rejected an attempt to help it make peace with the DMK, which expelled it from the ruling coalition in Tamil Nadu this week, but tried to warm up to the Congress by coming out strongly in support of the nuclear deal.        
	An emergency meeting of the PMKs general council, presided over by founder-leader S. Ramadoss, said in a resolution today it fully stood by the UPA governments efforts to complete the nuclear deal as it would help fulfil rising energy demands.         
	The resolution suggests that the PMK does not intend to quit the government at the Centre, where Ramadosss son Anbumani is health minister. Anbumani did say he would quit if his father asked him to.         
	It is obviously an attempt by the PMK to please Sonia Gandhi, said a DMK source.         
	The PMKs resolution also authorised Ramadoss to talk to the Left parties in Delhi to help avert a UPA-Left showdown on the nuclear deal.         
	While the PMK appeared eager to please the Congress, it took a tough line on the DMK.        
	The meeting, also attended by Anbumani and party president G.K. Mani, totally rejected as unfounded the DMKs allegations justifying its expulsion from the state tie-up.         
	If we are to take action against maverick utterances of platform speakers, then no political party will have members left except their respective leaders, the PMK said.        
	Karunanidhi had accused Ramadoss of failing to rein in party colleague Kaduvetti Guru, who had threatened to behead senior DMK leaders. This issue was settled last March, the PMK said.         
	Earlier today, Dalit Panthers of India leader Thol Thirumavalavan had met Karunanidhi and then approached Ramadoss with the offer that the DMK could reconsider its decision if the PMK took action against Guru.

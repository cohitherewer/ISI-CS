	New Delhi, April 22: Mayavati is playing dicey, so its time to make up with the other M.        
	Her arch enemy Mulayam Singh Yadav, if you havent caught on.        
	The Congress believes Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party is preparing the ground to withdraw the outside support it offers to the central coalition after it forced adjournments in both Houses of Parliament over the politicisation of Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal, or eastern Uttar Pradesh.        
	Rahul Gandhi had visited these regions several times and criticised the Mayavati government for not doing enough for Dalits, tribals and the poor.        
	Although the Congress-led UPA has the numbers to survive a no-confidence vote in the Lok Sabha if the 15-strong BSP were to pull out, Congress sources said before that happened, it would be wise to make up with Mulayams Samajwadi Party.        
	Like the BSP, Mulayams party, too, is tentative about supporting the UPA government, given its fluctuating relations with the Congress and a degree of personal animosity between Samajwadi leader Amar Singh, Mulayams right-hand man, and central coalition chief Sonia Gandhi.        
	The sources said the Congress had hoped to break the ice with the Samajwadi Party in Karnataka and take the process northwards to Uttar Pradesh but conceded their efforts were still not progressing.        
	The Congress, insiders added, wanted an alliance or at least some kind of an understanding with S. Bangarappa, Samajwadi MP from Karnataka and a former Congressman and chief minister who has a base in at least seven districts, including home turf Shimoga.        
	The sources said Bangarappas departure, first to the BJP and then Mulayams party, was largely responsible for the Congresss poor showing in these parts in the last Assembly elections.        
	But Bangarappas son Kumara, a Congress MLA, opposed any truck with his father. Kumara, who had apparently gathered that one of his fathers conditions was he should not be given a ticket, rushed to Delhi to pre-empt talks.        
	Fathers position is not that great. Because of the speculation that he might go with this or that party, his workers have returned to the Congress, Kumara said.        
	While Bangarappa raised the bar by asking for 40 seats, the Congress struck back, insisting that he either join the party or fight on his own.        
	Samajwadi leaders, too, were keen to mend fences with the Congress through Karnataka. But if Bangarappa has a problem, we cant arm-twist him, said a Samajwadi source.

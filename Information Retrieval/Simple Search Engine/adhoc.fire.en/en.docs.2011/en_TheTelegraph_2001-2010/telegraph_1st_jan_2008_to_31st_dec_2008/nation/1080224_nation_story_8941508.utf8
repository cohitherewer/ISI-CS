	New Delhi, Feb 23: Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss has asked the information and broadcasting ministry to take action against tobacco and liquor companies indulging in surrogate advertising in the electronic, print and outdoor media.         
	In a letter to Union I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Ramadoss has said companies such as Bagpiper soda, McDowells, Johnny Walker soda and Kingfisher mineral water are using surrogate methods of advertising, which need to be stopped, health ministry sources told PTI.         
	These products have exactly the same brand name and logo, which had earlier been there in the liquor ads, it said. The companies are trying to bypass the advertisement ban on liquor products already in place, the sources said.         
	A similar trend is being followed by companies making cigarettes, paan masala and gutka, the letter added.         
	This is a step in the right direction, but it also shows that one arm of the government hasnt really bothered about the law, said Prakash Gupta, a cancer epidemiologist formerly with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.         
	Weve been urging the government to take action for a long time, Gupta said.

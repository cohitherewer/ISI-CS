          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mohan: Wedding woes                                  
	Chandigarh, Dec. 7: Edward VIII gave up an empire to marry his love; now Haryanas missing deputy chief minister has followed in his footsteps.        
	Chander Mohan, 43, son of former chief minister Bhajan Lal, was sacked by the states Congress government today after confessing  over television from hiding  that he had taken a second wife, for which he had to change his religion.        
	By the politicians side at the TV interview was Anuradha Bali, the 35-year-old divorcee he had married secretly, who too has been fired as the states assistant advocate-general.        
	The official reason for Chander Mohans dismissal is his prolonged absence from work  soon after Diwali he had gone missing from office and home, where he has a wife and two children.        
	The sack announcement, however, came immediately after the couple surfaced on TV screens today to acknowledge their marriage, before disappearing again.        
	In the interview, shot inside a moving car, Chander Mohan admitted he had converted to Islam and married Bali. My new name is Chand Mohammad and my wifes name is Fiza, he said.        
	Asked if he was not putting his job at risk, the four-time Kalka MLA answered: Posts keep coming and going. If the post is in my luck, it will come back.        
	This is one advantage of democracy that a hereditary ruler like Edward VIII lacked: when the bachelor king chose to marry the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson in 1936, he knew he was bidding farewell to the British throne for good.        
	Anuradha described her new husband as a real hero and said it required boldness for a politician to take such a step. I respect his family. I love him, she said.        
	Asked about his familys possible reaction, Chander Mohan replied: I have lived with her (his first wife) for 18 years and would not like to make any comment.        
	He said he had been impressed by the teachings of Islam and had been thinking of converting since he was young. I have taken the decision to marry again after a lot of pondering. As a Congress legislator from Kalka, I have always worked for the people and have remained committed to them. It was my commitment to her.        
	The deputy chief minister had remained loyal to the Congress even after father Bhajan Lal and brother Kuldeep Bishnoi, Bhiwani MP, left the party to form the Haryana Janhit Congress a year ago. He held the portfolios of food and supplies, science and technology, renewable energy, and printing and stationery.

	New Delhi, Feb. 15 (PTI): A couple have accused an AIIMS staffer of baby swapping.         
	Ayush Gupta has lodged a complaint stating that a doctor had first informed his family that his wife Premalata had given birth to a boy, but later the staffer handed them a girl.         
	AIIMS spokesperson Y.K. Gupta has denied the allegation. The hospital has sent DNA samples for tests, he said.

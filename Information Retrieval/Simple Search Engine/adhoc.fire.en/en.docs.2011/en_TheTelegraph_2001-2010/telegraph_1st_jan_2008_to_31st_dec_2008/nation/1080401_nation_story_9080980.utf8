The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Principal row dogs Stephens again
                                                                                                               Principal row dogs Stephens again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 31: Delhi University has raised fresh questions about the selection of a new principal at St. Stephens College, demanding that it be made party to the process of deciding who gets the post.         
	DU has asked the college to withdraw its latest advertisement for the post of principal as it violates the universitys norms. The post fell vacant after Reverend Valson Thampu resigned earlier this month following a 10-month tenure frequently blotted by controversy.         
	The university had raised objections over criteria for selection of principal laid down in an earlier advertisement as well, following which the college withdrew it. But its latest advertisement virtually repeats many of the same criteria.         
	In a letter to the supreme council of St. Stephens, the university has asked the highest decision-making body of the college to remove any condition related to the age of candidates for the post of principal.         
	The latest advertisement says that those between 50 and 60 years will be preferred. The university has also objected to the absence of any mention in the advertisement that St. Stephens is a part of DU.         
	We may be forced to consider legal options against St. Stephens if they continue to object to the norms that we apply to all colleges, a senior DU official said.         
	The college has not yet replied to the university letter, and St. Stephens officials said they were not going to be pushed into hurrying.         
	We are a minority institution and have specific rights under the Indian Constitution because of that. We will try and reopen channels of communication with DU. But our position will not change, a college representative said.

          OUR BUREAU                          IAF jawans drop food packets at Banki in Cuttack on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: The flood situation in Orissa continued to be grim today with more than 37 lakh people in 18 districts being hit prompting the state government to alert the navy for relief and rescue operations.        
	State disaster management minister Manmohan Samal said the navy had been altered as the flood situation was expected to worsen in view of formation of another depression over the Bay of Bengal.        
	Central paramilitary forces were pressed into service in the worst-hit Kendrapada and Cuttack districts, while three IAF helicopters were engaged in airdropping of food packets in marooned areas.        
	In case of necessity, naval boats and rescue teams would be airlifted from Visakhapatnam, he said. Naval teams from the INS Chilka were also expected to come in case of need, he added. Samal admitted that more than a dozen places had remained still inaccessible because of adverse situation.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who took stock of the flood situation at a high-level review meeting today, said more than 37 lakh people had been affected by the unprecedented flood.        
	According to the reports reaching the state government, more than 650 villages remained marooned. Describing the situation still a matter of concern, chief secretary Ajit Tripathy said the flood had affected 5,514 villages across 18 districts.        
	The official toll has gone up to 29, while preliminary reports suggested that more than 51,417 houses were damaged, Tripathy said, adding that the flood had caused 73 breaches on major river embankments and cut off roads at 939 places.        
	Though water level receded upstream, low-lying areas in Cuttack, Kendrapada and Jagatsinghpur districts had little respite.         
	Intermittent rains in some of these areas made the situation worse for millions of villagers.

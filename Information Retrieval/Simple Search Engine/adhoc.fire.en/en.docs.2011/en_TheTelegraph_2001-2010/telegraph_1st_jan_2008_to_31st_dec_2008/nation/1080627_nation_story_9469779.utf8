          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 26: Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has blamed the controversial forest land transfer to the Amarnath shrine board almost entirely on ally Peoples Democratic Party, which has now threatened to pull out of the government if the allotment is not revoked.        
	Azad has released documents that suggest that PDP ministers played a pro-active role in allotting the land to the board, letting it build prefab structures for pilgrims to camp but disallowing any permanent structure.        
	The papers reveal that deputy chief minister and law minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig, who is from the PDP, had turned down his own departments order to get the allotment vetted by the Supreme Court.        
	Baig is now spearheading the PDPs campaign to rescind the land transfer, against which the separatists have launched a street agit- ation.        
	Later, forest minister Qazi Muhammad Afzal, who too is from the PDP, cleared the proposal and approved its placement before the cabinet, the documents show.        
	Afzal today insisted that the government had to rescind the transfer order. I am not ready to talk about this issue, he told The Telegraph, when asked to comment about Azads revelations.

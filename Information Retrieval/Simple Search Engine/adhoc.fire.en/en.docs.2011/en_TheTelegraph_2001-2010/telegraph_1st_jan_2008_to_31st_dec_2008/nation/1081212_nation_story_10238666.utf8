          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 11: Coastal police station projects under the Orissa national security plan have received a fresh impetus after the Mumbai attacks.        
	The ministry of home affairs, in 2006, had accorded clearance to five coastal police stations along the 480km Orissa coastline to check the influx of Bangladesh nationals, curb illegal fishing and protect endangered species.        
	In 2007, the Union home ministry had also sanctioned Rs 66 lakh for the stations.        
	The five proposed stations were supposed to be set up at Jamboo in Kendrapara, Paradip in Jagatsinghpur, Dhamra in Bhadrak, Chandipur in Balasore and Gopalpur in Ganjam.         
	The projects, however, made little headway, as many among them failed to receive the nod from the forest and environmental departments.        
	However, post-Mumbai attacks the respective district administrations have been stirred into action  especially after receiving a note from the state home department. As a result, on December 2, the Kendrapada collector S.K. Panda visited Jamboo for site selection. Land was identified at Uttarpada near Jamboo and was recommended to the home department for approval, said U.R. Acharya, the tehsildar.        
	Earlier, a site was selected by the district administration at Petcheela near Jamboo.        
	But, it failed to receive clearance from the forest department on the ground that the site fell under Bhitarkanika National Park area.        
	At Paradip, however, some progress has been made.         
	On December 2, the chairman of the Paradip Port Trust offered a temporary building for the police station.        
	Sanctioned staff for the coastal stations are already undergoing training. The police stations that have the space ready will start operating as soon as the training is over, said R.K. Sharma, the Jagatsinghpur SP.        
	Official sources said Ganjam administration has already allotted 15 acres at Gopalpur seafront for the proposed coastal police station.        
	The land for the police station at Dhamra has been identified, but it needs to be developed after sand filling. Work on the Chandipur station (Balasore) is underway.

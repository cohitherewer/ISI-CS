          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Bangalore, May 25: In the morning, H.D. Deve Gowda was unfazed. As the hours passed, he locked himself in.        
	The game is not over yet, the former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) chief had said as the first signs of a rout started coming.        
	By evening, with just 28 seats in his kitty  less than half the 2004 figure  the man who hoped to be kingmaker refused to speak to journalists waiting outside his mansion in Bangalore.        
	Sahebru (boss) is resting, dont make noise, an aide whispered.        
	The JD (S) was a partner in the previous two coalition governments  spending 20 months each with the Congress and BJP  and is seen as the party that thrust an early election on Karnataka.        
	The only reaction from the Gowda camp came from his son and former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who alleged that BJP president Rajnath Singh had tried to tap his new MLAs within the first hour of victory.        
	I respect the peoples verdict. I take full responsibility for my partys showing, he said.        
	It was Kumaraswamys decision not to hand over power to the BJP last October that had forced the mid-term poll after a seven-month spell of Presidents rule.        
	Seven months after the great betrayal scripted by Gowda Senior, the people have shown them their right place, BJP spokesperson Suresh Kumar said.         
	Kumaraswamy said the JD(S) had done well despite several senior leaders moving over to the Congress. However, except for former deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah, all these defectors lost.        
	The drubbing has left the JD (S) weaker and shunned. We are not even in a position to stitch an alliance with the Congress. No party wants to touch us after the rejection by the people, a long-time aide of Gowda admitted in private.        
	The JD (S) was born of a split in the Janata Dal in 1999. In 2004, it tied up with the Congresss Dharam Singh, but 43 MLAs led by Kumaraswamy later appeared to rebel against Gowda and walked out to form an alliance with the BJP.        
	The BJP and the JD(S) agreed that Kumaraswamy would be chief minister for the first 20 months and B.S. Yeddyurappa for the following 20 till elections.        
	But when it came to handing over power to the partner, Gowda stepped in and decided not to.         
	The JD(S) later relented but a week on, when the time came for Yeddyurappa to prove his majority in the House, the party issued a whip to its members not to vote for the government. That led to Presidents rule.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: Mumbaikars who have never worn woollens in their life were out shopping for sweaters and jackets today as the temperature fell to 9.4C, the lowest this winter.        
	This is unusual for February  at least three degrees below normal. The cold conditions prevailing over north India... have increased the northern wind pattern frequency, said C.W. Bhadram, the deputy director-general of the Met department.        
	Wednesday was the coldest February day ever. The lowest temperature recorded in February so far was 10.2C in 1981. Mumbais coldest day ever was January 27, 1962, when the temperature dipped to 7.4C.        
	Ajinkya Apte, 37, a bank employee, bought his first woollen this year. I did not know they sell sweaters around alleys near Victoria Terminus in January despite living in Mumbai all my life.

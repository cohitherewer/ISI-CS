	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Jamia Millia Islamia has denied police claims that the two alleged terrorists killed today were students of the university.        
	I categorically deny that either of the two men killed had any connection with Jamia. They are not our students, vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan said today.        
	The shootout took place barely a kilometre from Jamia. The police claimed the slain men  Mohammed Atif Amin and Mohammed Sajid  were activists of the Indian Mujahideen that has claimed responsibility for the blasts in Ahmedabad and Delhi. They said Atif was doing a postgraduate diploma in human rights and Sajid was studying spoken English. But senior faculty members in both departments said they did not know of any student named Atif or Sajid.        
	The family of Mohammed Saif, the arrested terror suspect, claimed at their home in Sarai Mir, Uttar Pradesh, that he was doing a course in computers at Jamia.

	Srinagar, Nov. 18: Yesterdays high poll turnout has forced Kashmirs separatists on the backfoot for the first time in the five months since the Amarnath row.        
	Mainstream parties are now planning big rallies for the rest of the seven-phase elections, hoping to bounce back from a low-key Valley campaign dogged by fears of attacks.        
	The results have shocked us. We never expected such a high turnout. We dont have a strategy to persuade people to boycott the polls. Let us hope good sense will prevail on people, a Hurriyat leader said.        
	His remarks came hours after election officials reported 64 per cent polling in the 10 constituencies that voted yesterday, revising the figure from last evenings 55 per cent.        
	The Hurriyat, which claimed yesterday that the figures were manipulated, ran into a grim reality check today.         
	The turnout is certainly on the higher side but it is still the first phase, Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq told The Telegraph.         
	He was quick to send a warning, though. Delhi shouldnt misconstrue it as a vote for India. We werent given any space to propagate our views as all of us have either been arrested or put under house arrest.         
	But the Mirwaiz conceded that people have local problems like inadequate roads and they want redress, an unexpected acceptance from a separatist leader that polls could offer solutions after all.        
	For leaders of mainstream parties, the high percentage of voting has come as a boost. It is an eye-opener and proves that while the people want the Kashmir issue to be resolved, they also want to... elect representatives who can work for the welfare of the people, National Conference chief Omar Abdullah said.         
	The PDP went a step further. The trends emerging from the first phase have set the momentum for the revival of a historic and momentous era, senior leader Tariq Hameed Karra said.         
	More parties now appear to be winning listeners by arguing that a good government that can build roads and improve civic amenities would not necessarily undermine the independence movement.        
	Noor Ahmad Baba, dean of social sciences at Kashmir University, said the people had come to realise that independence was a higher, time-consuming goal.         
	It (the high turnout) means the Hurriyat leadership doesnt have a finger on the pulse of the people. Yet, the high voting will not undermine the separatist movement because political parties had clearly delineated the freedom struggle from these elections.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     4500 sick after school food
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Over 4,500 children across the country have fallen ill over the past five years after having free mid-day meals, the government told Parliament, casting a shadow over a scheme central to the UPAs election strategy.         
	The disclosure by minister of state for human resource development M.A.A. Fatmi came on a day the government put out large advertisements in major newspapers patting its back over the mid-day meal scheme.         
	The advertisements, carrying photographs of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, cite gains made through the scheme which the government last year extended from primary classes till standard VIII.         
	Nutrition in schools... promise fulfilled... mid-day meal to 15 crore school children, says the advertisement, carrying a picture of children eating seated in a neat row.         
	But Fatmis disclosure to Parliament suggests that the food provided to children under the scheme may not always be nutritious and may even be a health hazard in some cases.         
	In all, 4,620 children have fallen ill since 2003 after having the meal, universalised following a landmark Supreme Court judgment in 2001.         
	Topping the list of states with the maximum number of such children is Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress that heads the UPA has ruled for much of the past five years (see chart).         
	Karnataka comes next, with Bengal sixth in the pecking order of states that have seen the most children fall sick after having the mid-day meal.         
	Tamil Nadu, where the concept of using a meal to lure students to school originated, has reported 77 cases of children falling sick.         
	The scheme is aimed at giving poor families an incentive to send children to school.         
	Veteran officials involved with the plan often recount tales of the drive under former Tamil Nadu chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, who in 1982 made the scheme compulsory in all government schools.         
	MGR once famously asked all those who accused him of populism: If the stomach is empty, how do you expect a child to study. That statement still motivates us, a senior official, who has worked in various capacities with the scheme, said recently.         
	The Comptroller and Auditor General recently pulled up the HRD ministry for not carrying out any baseline study to help evaluate in statistical terms the direct impact of the scheme.         
	Enrolment in schools has seen a significant rise since 2001, the period over which the scheme has been implemented across the country.         
	Today, India enjoys over 95 per cent gross enrolment in primary school.         
	But the absence of any baseline study before the scheme was launched makes it impossible to assess the contribution of any scheme to the improved enrolment figures.        
	The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, aimed at universalising primary education, and a host of other schemes have also been implemented over the same period.

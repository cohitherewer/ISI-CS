          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Sept. 10: Amarinder Singh today became possibly the first former chief minister to be expelled from the Assembly for corruption.        
	Punjab Speaker Nirmaljit Singh Kahlon declared his seat vacant on the basis of a House committee report that found Amarinder guilty of exempting 32.1 acres of prime land from acquisition by the Amritsar Improvement Trust to help a private builder.        
	The House endorses the resolution for Amarinders expulsion for the remaining three-and-a-half years of its term and directs the state vigilance to file an FIR against him, Kahlon ruled.        
	The resolution was passed by voice vote by ruling Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP members amid protests by Congress legislators.         
	As chief minister between 2002 and 2007, Amarinder, the House report said, had broken rules and shown haste and interest in granting the exemption that helped Veerpal Colonisers and Builders Pvt Ltd.        
	The 32.1 acres on the Amritsar-Jalandhar bypass were part of a 188-acre development scheme notified by the Amritsar Improvement Trust. A low-cost housing scheme for backward sections was among the projects the trust was planning on it.         
	The committee that went into the allegations against Amarinder included five Akali legislators, four BJP MLAs and three from his own party, the Congress.         
	The report said Amarinder disregarded the advice of senior officers to go ahead with the Rs 360-crore exemption and cited official files, documents and statements of witnesses.        
	What is embarrassing for the former chief minister is that all the major witnesses against him belong either to the Congress or to the government he headed.        
	The then chairperson of the trust, Ratna, a Congress appointee, told the committee she was removed because she had opposed the exemption.        
	Then chief secretary Jai Singh Gill and other senior officials had also voiced their dissent. But the files travelled fast, sometimes three to four times a day, to proceed with the exemption, the report said.         
	Amarinder was present in the Assembly and his wife and Lok Sabha MP Preneet Kaur was in the visitors gallery.        
	It is a clear case of vendetta. The House cannot go into the business of the preceding House, he said.        
	Then local bodies minister Jagjit Singh, the late housing minister Raghunath Sahai and former trust chairman Jugal Kishore Sharma have also been indicted.

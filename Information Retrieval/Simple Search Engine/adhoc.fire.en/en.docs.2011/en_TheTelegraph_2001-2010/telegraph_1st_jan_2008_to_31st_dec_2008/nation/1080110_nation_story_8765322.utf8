	Hailakandi, Jan. 9: Poll officials lit a bonfire of ballot boxes in Assam after pleas for protection from goons fell on deaf ears  possibly the first time in the country the custodians themselves are destroying election material.
    
	Official sources said nearly 100 poll personnel were injured in the attacks in south Assams Hailakandi since last night by the thugs, allegedly hired by political parties to rig the panchayat polls.
    
	The sources said the violence was expected, given the rough run-up to the third and final phase of the panchayat elections, but what nobody had bargained for was the way the poll personnel retaliated.
    
	By evening, the army was out in the district to prevent a possible backlash.
    
	Hailakandi deputy commissioner S.P. Kakati Bora said the rowdiness of the polling staff was unprecedented. No arrests had been made till late in the evening.
    
	The 2,500-odd schoolteachers and 800 others engaged for poll duty at 621 booths today had an inkling of what lay in store and had demanded better security. Some of them refused to go to their assigned booths.
    
	On Monday evening, inspector-general of police Ramesh Chandra Jain met the officials and persuaded them to leave for the stations.
    
	This morning, the goons descended on the booths minutes after they opened, assaulted the polling staff and snatched ballot boxes and cellphones.
    
	Bruised and battered, the polling personnel later gathered at a college and made a bonfire of whatever polling material they had managed to save from the thugs. The few policemen present looked on helplessly.
    
	By the time police and paramilitary personnel had chased away the angry polling staff from the college campus, two hours had passed.
    
	The election office said about 80 per cent voted today amid allegations of rigging. Repoll is likely in more than 100 booths following charges of foul play.

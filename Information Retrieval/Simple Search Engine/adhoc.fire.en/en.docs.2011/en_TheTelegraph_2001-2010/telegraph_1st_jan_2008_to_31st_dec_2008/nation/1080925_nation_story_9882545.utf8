The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students skip class to boost relief
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Students skip class to boost relief
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Flood victims have their meal at a relief camp on the Puri-Bhubaneswar NH-203 on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 24: Skipping classes to lend a helping hand for flood victims is something that Deepika would never forget.        
	For hundreds of students like Deepika, the day begins at 10am at Kalinga Stadium here and by the time they head for home at 3pm, 15,000-odd food packets are ready to be air-dropped. The packets, we are told, should not exceed the weight of 4kg so that it wont injure anyone while air-dropped, Deepika said.        
	Prahlad Das (60), the proprietor of Kalinga Catering and in charge of relief material supply, said he received scores of calls from different schools everyday so that students could be accommodated to help package food, which includes biscuits, jaggery, chuda and salt. Earlier, NCC cadets, Scouts and Guides would come with help offer, but this year the students are active and eager to participate in the work, said Das, who has been a regular supplier of relief material during natural calamities since the 1999 super cyclone.        
	While girl students do the packaging part, their male counterparts take care of loading and unloading of the relief material  that also includes candles and matchsticks  on trucks. We have about 40 students from Class VIII and IX. All of them are pretty excited to come and offer help. In fact, the parents of the children are also encouraging. We have not forced anyone, said Dilip Satpathy, a teacher from DAV Public School, Khandagiri.        
	One advantage in seeking help of the students is that they are quite active and do the work faster than regular labourers, said Das.        
	Kids still trapped        
	In Kendrapada district, hundreds of students are still trapped in several schools for the past few days.        
	Food materials available with us were exhausted three days ago. The children virtually went without food and drinking water the next two days, said Sarbeswara Mohapatra, the secretary of two-storeyed Sri Aurobindo Integral Education Centre at Khurusia village, 10km from Mahakalpada block headquarters in the district.        
	The 60 students  aged between five and 12  and 10 teachers along with 50 villagers are trapped for the sixth day today in the first floor of the residential school.        
	To arrange relief for the children, Mohapatra had managed to make his way through the floodwaters to a highway, 4km from the school. Food and water may reach them now. But the children need to be immediately rescued from the building as the toilets are still under water, he said.        
	So has been the plight of 80 orphans  33 of them being infants below one year in age  who remained trapped at Patelipanka in the same block.         
	The children, both at the school and the orphanage, are still surrounded by 8ft high water, but they are at the safest possible place around. Arrangements have been made for the functioning of a relief centre there, officer on special duty Hemant Sharma said.

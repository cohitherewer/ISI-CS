          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The apex child rights forum has proposed that all out-of-school children till age 18 be declared victims of child labour under proposed amendments to the relevant Indian law.        
	The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has suggested raising the age bar on child workers from 14 to 18, commission sources said. But these children can be allowed to work during scheduled school vacations under monitoring, it has said.         
	The recommendations, to be submitted to the women and child development ministry tomorrow, are likely to be accepted as minister Renuka Chowdhury is learnt to be keen on implementing the proposed amendments before the general elections.        
	Some opposition is, however, possible from the commerce and labour ministries, which are concerned about the implications on the labour market, the sources said.        
	At present, employing children under 14 is illegal only in a few occupations, described as hazardous, like zari work. The list was expanded in 2006 to include household labour. But the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, does not bar these occupations if the work is being performed in the childs home.         
	The child is often employed by parents in a family shop or industry, where he or she is not even paid. This, too, is child labour, a commission source said.         
	The recommendations are aimed at bringing the child labour law in consonance with the proposed right to education law, which makes it the states legal responsibility to ensure school education for all. The idea behind raising the age bar from 14 to 18 is to try and ensure that all students get education at least till standard X, the source said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: When push comes to shove, the government can depend on Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The foreign minister proved that today with a powerful shove to CPM member T.K. Rangarajan, a man much bigger than himself, in the Rajya Sabha.        
	The act may have been uncharacteristic for a veteran politician known for his cool head, but Mukherjee was merely trying to shield party colleague and junior finance minister Pawan Bansal.        
	Bansal, who sits on the row behind Mukherjee, had stood up to read from the insurance amendment bill when CPM members ran into the well, shouting slogans against the legislation. A few, Tamil Nadu MP Rangarajan prominent among them, then rushed towards Bansal, possibly to snatch the papers from him.        
	Mukherjees reaction was spontaneous. He stood up and pushed the CPM leader away. A stunned Rangarajan stopped in his tracks and slowly walked away. Surprised by Mukherjees aggression, the other Left MPs too backed off.        
	Those watching from the galleries probably had one of their most unforgettable moments in the House.         
	Bansal introduced the legislation amid protests, with an MP tearing a copy of the bill. Mukherjee later tabled the South Asian university bill, under which a university will be established with its main centre in India and other campuses in the Saarc countries.

	Cuttack, Feb. 17: It was a close shave for Orissa reserve police constable Pratima Rout (23). With Sukanti Dei (27), Rout was a part of a night patrol at Nayagarh reserve magazine last Friday.         
	We were resting in the guardroom, when at 10.30pm a petrol bomb and grenade were hurled. Before we could take position with our rifles, we were held at gunpoint. The rebels told us to lie face down on the floor near the wall. Later, they fired from an SLR, said Rout.         
	She is now left nursing bullet injuries in her left shin, right thigh and stomach.        
	Rout is one among the seven personnel who survived the series of attacks on Friday night by militants in Nayagarh. She is undergoing treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital here.        
	But Padmacharan Jani (38), a constable at Mahipur outpost under Daspalla police station, was less lucky. Rebels dragged him along and left him to die in the jungle. Next morning, his colleagues discovered the personnel lying under a tree. I gave in when I saw their numbers. But they fired nonetheless, said Jani writhing in pain in the hospital.         
	Jani witnessed the murder of APR Prafulla Pradhan.         
	According to him, the rebels shot Pradhan dead after asking him to take off his clothes when he surrendered. Pradhan was on duty in the front post of the reserve magazine. APR Sajid Ali Khan, too, was shot dead under similar circumstances.        
	APR B.B. Basantia positioned himself on the roof of the reserve magazine, right at the back. But he was surrounded and shot in the back. Then his head was shoved in the tank and his trousers were taken off.         
	The wounds of Friday nights horrors, it seems, would take time to heal. Constable Kantheswar Pradhan (37) is battling for his life at the surgical ward in the SCB Medical College. Post-operation, he is nursing wounds in his chest.         
	He was on duty at the police training school with constables K. Rama Rao (41), Dipti Ranjan Puanh (32) and Udhab Kumar Jena (38)  all left severely injured.         
	Luckily, of the 364 trainees, 330 were away in Bhubaneswar attending a law and order duty in the Assembly. Or else, the number of casualty would have been higher.        
	Constable Jugal Chandra Swain, who was on duty at the time of the attack, recalls seeing two Eicher minibuses, sporting white banners on front with police written on them hit the drop gate around 10.25pm on Friday.         
	Within seconds a group of 200 armed people, including 70 to 80 women, got down from the buses, and opened fire. Around 20 personnel retaliated. The rebels proceeded towards the duty post, where the training arms and ammunition were kept. The men in khaki tried to resist. The exchange of fire continued for more than 30 minutes. The battle ended after the police exhausted all the arms and ammunition they had.        
	The rebels looted AK-47 and Insas rifles, light-machine guns, carbine, SLRs and grenades. They also ransacked the school, its office and staff colony. Arms and ammunition worth Rs 1-crore were looted.        
	Before leaving the place, the rebels shouted slogans Maovadi zindabad, lal salaam, said eyewitnesses. The last Friday nights attack was the worst-ever by the rebels in Orissa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP hawks in Malegaon bind
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP hawks in Malegaon bind
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: The BJP has dropped its plans to make the Jamianagar encounter an election issue because it fears accusations of double standards over its support to Malegaon blast suspect Pragya Singh Thakur.        
	The hasty, but quiet, retreat follows mounting pressure from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the party to back the sadhvi.        
	The BJP is worried that any evidence against Pragya could be embarrassing since it had questioned the patriotism of those who criticised the Jamianagar shootout in which two alleged militants were shot dead.        
	The party is also struggling to hide the apparent contradiction between its public stand that linking terror to religion is wrong and the Sangh view that the Malegaon blast accused should be defended since they are Hindus.        
	Last week, Sangh general secretary Mohan Bhagwat said: Hindus and terrorism are contrary to each other. No person associated with the culture of this country can be a terrorist.        
	BJP chief Rajnath Singh has echoed him, saying people associated with Hindutva cannot become terrorists. Bhagwat was, however, critical of those who have questioned the Jamianagar encounter, saying: Such things (questions) weaken the national resolve to fight terror.        
	In contrast with the BJPs cautious defence of the sadhvi, the Shiv Sena has warned that Hindus will retaliate if the government fails to control terror.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: A BJP MLA from the capital who was to contest the Delhi Assembly elections in a fortnight was found dead at his residence early this morning. Initial investigations suggest he killed himself, police said.         
	Puran Chand Yogi, 73, was a three-time legislator from central Delhis Rajinder Nagar. He had won his partys ticket for the November 29 state elections, the police said.         
	Initial investigations suggest he has committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope, Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said.         
	No suicide note has been found, he added. Family sources had initially said he died of a heart attack.         
	It is too early to say what may have motivated him to take his life. We have sent his body for a post-mortem and should receive the report in a day or two.         
	Only after we have officially confirmed suicide as the mode of death will we proceed to investigate possible reasons, Bhagat said in response to a question on the possible reasons for Yogis suicide.         
	Initial investigations have revealed, other police sources said, that Yogi was not confident for some time whether he would receive the BJPs ticket for the polls.         
	His family has told us he was tense about getting the ticket. Eventually, he did get the BJP ticket, said an official at Inderpuri police station.         
	An official with the Delhi chief electoral officer said the CEO had decided to postpone elections to the Rajinder Nagar seat.         
	The rules clearly state that if a candidate from a national party dies after nomination to the polls, elections can be put off, the official said on condition of anonymity.         
	The Election Commission of India would decide when to hold the polls to the seat, he said. An RSS activist for over four decades, Yogi joined the Delhi legislature in 1993, and won again in 1998 and 2003.

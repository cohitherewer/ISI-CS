Bullies just love it
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A poster of Big Bully, a 1996 comedy starring Rick Moranis and Tom Arnold.   Young David Leary (Moranis) is constantly bullied by Roscoe Fang Bigger (Arnold) in Hastings, Minnesota. Before moving to Oakland, David squeals on Fang and gets him arrested. Years later, Davids son Ben picks on a little kid named Kirby. David meets the boys father, who turns out to be his childhood nemesis. When Fang learns who David is, he re-embarks on his old routine                                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The first-ever brain scans of young bullies suggest they enjoy watching others feel pain and have disruptions in their brain mechanisms that allow people to understand the emotional states of others.        
	Researchers led by neuroscientist Jean Decety at the University of Chicago have found that youths with aggressive conduct disorder displayed unusual patterns of brain responses when watching images of others in pain.         
	Their findings, published today in the journal, Biological Psychology, indicate that the natural empathy response  the capacity to appreciate the emotional states of others  may be disrupted in ways that increase aggression.        
	The researchers compared magnetic resonance imaging brains scans of boys aged between 16 and 18, divided into two groups. All members of one group had a history of starting fights, showing cruelty to animals or people, or stealing after confronting others, while members of the other group had no such conduct problems.        
	The boys had their brains scanned while they watched video clips in which people experienced pain caused accidentally by a heavy bowl falling on the hands, or caused intentionally by someone deliberately stepping on a persons toe.         
	The adolescents with conduct disorders showed strong activity in regions of the brain called the amygdala and ventral striatum, an area that responds to feeling of being rewarded, when watching pain inflicted on others, Decety said. This suggests they enjoy watching pain.        
	When observing pain intentionally caused by others, the adolescents with conduct disorders did not show activity in the brain regions that contribute to self-control and moral reasoning, the researchers said in their report.        
	This finding contrasts significantly with an earlier study by Decety that had found children in the age group of 7 and 12 naturally empathetic to people in pain.         
	The scientists said unravelling biological mechanisms of conduct disorders could lead to new strategies to treat such problems of adolescence that are known to give rise to anti-social behaviour during adulthood.

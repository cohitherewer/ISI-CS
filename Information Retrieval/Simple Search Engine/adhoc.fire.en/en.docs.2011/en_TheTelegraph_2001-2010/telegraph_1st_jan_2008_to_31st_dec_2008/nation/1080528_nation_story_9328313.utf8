          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, May 27: Sambalpur MP Prasanna Acharya and collector Pradipta Patnaik expressed dissatisfaction over utilisation of Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds in the district in a review meeting held recently.         
	During the meeting, sources said, reviewers found several loopholes, including instances of some department officers drawing funds in advance and taking years to complete or even begin work. Acharya and Patnaik quizzed members regarding the irregularities during the meeting.         
	It was observed that Acharya sanctioned Rs 75,000 from his fund to start construction work of a community centre in Marawaripara. Though a junior engineer took Rs 35,000 as advance a year ago, work was yet to begin.        
	The MP and collector not only expressed dissatisfaction over the matter, but wished to know why the engineer was granted the funds in the first place.         
	After the meeting the collector directed the municipal engineer to look into the matter and submit a report within a week.

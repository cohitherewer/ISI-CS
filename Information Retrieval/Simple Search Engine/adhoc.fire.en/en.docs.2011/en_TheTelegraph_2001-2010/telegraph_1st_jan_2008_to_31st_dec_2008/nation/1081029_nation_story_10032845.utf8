	Aamir Khan at a promotional for his film Ghajini in Mumbai on Tuesday. After Fanaa, Ghajini will be my first commercial entertainer in a long time. It will also be my first out-and-out action film, the actor said at the trailer release.         
	Aamir, who sports a muscular look in the film, said he had to work out for almost a year. I exercised at least 3-4 hours every day. It was only after 2-3 weeks of training that I realised what I had got into, he said.        
	We wanted to release the film during Diwali but it got delayed because of the muscle-tear injury I suffered during the shooting, Aamir said. The film is scheduled to hit theatres on December 25.        
	Ghajini is a remake of a Tamil film by the same name, which was inspired by psychological thriller Memento directed by Christopher Nolan.        
	Directed by A.R. Murugadoss, Ghajini also stars actresses Jiah Khan and Asin Thottumkal. (Fotocorp picture, PTI text)

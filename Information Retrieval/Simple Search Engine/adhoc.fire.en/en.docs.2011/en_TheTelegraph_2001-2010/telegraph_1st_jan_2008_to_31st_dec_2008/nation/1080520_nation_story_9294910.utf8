          BASANT RAWAT                           The pearl discovered by Desai                                  
	Ahmedabad, May 19: A farmer has put up for sale a rare, 48-carat natural pearl, said to be among the largest discovered in the country in recent years.         
	Sanjay Desai, 49, who owns an aqua farm which develops cultured pearls in Chikhli, 350km from Ahmedabad, chanced upon the natural gemstone in 2006, but has been holding on to it as he wants a reasonable price of Rs 18 crore.         
	Initially, Desai wanted to sell off the gemstone for Rs 3 lakh as he did not realise its true value. After being advised by a scientist in Bhubaneswar, he got the pearl  which currently resides in a bank vault  valued and certified by the Gem and Pearl Testing Laboratory in Bahrain.         
	Although there are gem testing facilities in India, Desai opted for the one in Bahrain as it is considered world class and meets stiff conditions set by global buyers.         
	But Desai would prefer that the pearl remains in India. A relative of a Hyderabad businessman approached me yesterday requesting me to wait for five days. The businessman is interested. I have got several offers from across the country. If I get a reasonable price, I will sell it to an Indian buyer which is my first preference, he said.         
	If he doesnt get a reasonable price, Desai said he would have to put up the pearl for auction at Sothebys in London to get global buyers.         
	In its report of April 29, the Bahrain lab stated that the pearl weighed 47.92 carat (9.58 grams) and had an uneven colour combination of white and light pink. The natural blister pearl of freshwater origin is of baroque shape with dimensions of 25.92x19.57x17.58mm.         
	Pearls are hard, round objects produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusk like the pearl oyster or freshwater mussel.         
	A natural pearl, like the one Desai has, is rarely found in a pearl farm as it is formed without any human intervention.         
	A cultured pearl, on the other hand, is one that has been formed in a farm. The majority of the pearls on the market are cultured and valued much less.         
	The largest pearl on record is the Pearl of Allah, found in 1934 off the Philippines coast. The 31,893.5-carat gem weighs around 6.4kg and is valued at $60 million.         
	The largest pearl found in India is said to be the Pearl of Asia (600 carats). It was taken away by Persian invader Nadir Shah during the invasion of Delhi in 1739. The Shah of Iran later gifted it to the Chinese.         
	Desai began his pearl farm in 2003 after seeing a TV documentary on the potential of aquaculture in India. With an initial investment of Rs 25 lakh, Desai and his son Bhargav, now an MBA graduate from Pune, started a farm spread over an hectare in Chikhli, one of its kind in the entire western region.        
	Desai has been culturing pearls of all shapes and sizes. He has started producing customised pearls in various forms and symbols like Om, Sai Baba and Ganesha.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Congress will write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take appropriate steps to protect small investors from dramatic fluctuations in the stock market.
    
	Sources said Sonia Gandhi was extremely concerned about the fate of small investors and felt that her party should take up their cause rather than just react to the sensex swings in a general way.
    
	Following the signal from 10 Janpath, spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said the party would call on the government to take appropriate steps. Over the last two days, there has been tremendous activity in the stock market. We have no doubt there will be a full recovery as we all are aware our economy is very strong and robust. But even in the medium term, to maintain and encourage proper financial growth in the stock markets, we will call on the government to take appropriate steps.
    
	Asked if an inquiry should be held as the BJP had proposed, she said the Congress was confident the government would take the necessary steps.
    
	Natrajan defended finance minister P. Chidambaram, who has faced flak from the CPM. There might have been various factors (responsible for the market mayhem), including external ones, she said.

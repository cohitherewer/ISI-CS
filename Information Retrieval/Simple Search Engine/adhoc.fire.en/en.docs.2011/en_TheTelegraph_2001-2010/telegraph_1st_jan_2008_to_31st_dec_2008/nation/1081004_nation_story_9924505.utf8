	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 3: The city will soon get to see an auxiliary force designated as special police officers (SPOs) under the commissionerate of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.        
	Sporting badges and laminated identity cards, the SPOs would be empowered to act during emergency. They would also be trained to conduct patrolling and maintaining traffic. Taking the concept of community policing a step ahead, the commissionerate appointed 13 SPOs recently.        
	We have been encouraged by good response from several groups of people. Many of them were willing to lend a hand to assist the police during a police-public partnership meeting, said police commissioner B.K. Sharma, in charge of both Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.        
	The new officers would assist in maintaining law and order, patrolling and preventing crimes. Bapuji Nagar, the oldest residential colony in Bhubaneswar, would become the first locality to have these special officers. The officers will take charge on October 5.

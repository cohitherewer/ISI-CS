     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Bangalore, March 3: Pro-Kannada activists today ransacked the office of Sasken Technologies after a local television channel played a mobile phone footage of a song sung by some employees of the company.
    
	Police said around 30 Kannada Rakshna Vedike members barged into the software companys office and damaged furniture and equipment before being chased out by the cops.
    
	The song, penned in English by an employee, was aimed at a woman colleague. Though she didnt seem to mind the joke, a tech worker who captured the alleged insult on his mobile phone camera sent the footage to a local channel. 
    
	The footage shows some employees singing the song Nazi-style, an arm placed on their chest.
    
	The Kannada activists alleged that some outsiders had penned the verse to insult Kannadigas and that it contained words against the red-and-yellow Karnataka flag. They said the song also painted the woman employee as a soldier of Karnataka.

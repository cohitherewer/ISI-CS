	Mumbai, June 9 (PTI): Two municipal hospitals refused to admit an eight-month pregnant woman in a critical condition yesterday.        
	Sheetal Vanve, bleeding profusely after the foetus died in the womb, had to run from one hospital to the other for almost six hours.        
	The KEM Hospital operation theatre was reportedly under repair and Naigaun Maternity Hospital did not have the facilities to handle such critical patients.        
	Finally, Sheetal was admitted in the state-owned JJ Hospital where she was given blood. The death of the foetus was confirmed through sonography and a stillborn weighing 2kg taken out through induced labour.        
	The 19-year-old is recovering, Rekha Daver, the head of the gynaecology department, said.         
	Sheetal first went to Naigaun Maternity Hospital. A nurse on duty said the hospital could not take care of serious cases, the family members claimed, adding she referred them to KEM hospital.        
	However, a doctor in the casualty department of the KEM Hospital refused to admit Sheetal saying the operation theatre was undergoing repairs and she should be taken back to Naigaun hospital.        
	The additional municipal commissioner, Kishore Gajbhiye, said an inquiry would be held.

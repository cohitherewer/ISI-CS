	Srinagar, Feb. 6: More than 1.5 lakh goats and yaks are facing death in freezing Ladakh, threatening to dry up the supply of Pashmina shawls.        
	The wool for the intricately embroidered shawls, mainly exported to West Asia and Europe, comes from goats in the region bordering China.        
	Tsering Dorjey, the autonomous Hill Development Council chairman in Leh, said several animals had perished and many more were facing death since the Valley had been buried in a heavy blanket of snow.        
	These goats are raised in the Nyoma region of Leh, which has been cut off by snow. We have run out of fodder. We are looking to transport 3,000 quintals of fodder and have requested the army to airdrop it because many roads are blocked, Dorjey said.        
	Sonam Dawa, who heads the Ladakh Buddhist Association, said the snowfall this year had been unprecedented. We receive less snow normally. The Nyoma area has recorded more than a feet of snow, he said.        
	Bordering China, Nyoma is more than 250km from Leh. The authorities learnt about the threat to the animals from nomads who had travelled to the Leh district office by foot.        
	The goats and yaks in the region have grown weak. Young ones are dying because of the cold and snow, Dorjey said.        
	Humans have been affected, too, with scores of villagers being vacated from the avalanche-prone south Kashmir after the authorities sounded an alert.         
	Gulmarg received six to seven feet of snow and several villages remained cut off.        
	Yesterday, snow claimed the life of an official at the Sadhna Pass in Kupwara.         
	A police spokesperson said a 26-year-old woman gave birth to a child in a police van, which was ferrying her to a hospital in Anantnag district.        
	Jameela, a resident of Grend village, was in severe labour pain and stranded, with around five feet of snow blocking the Grend-Pahalgam road.        
	The authorities have announced a cash reward for the policemen who took Jameela to hospital for saving two lives.        
	Aamir Ali, a coordinator in the Disaster Management Committee, said the government had set up two camps at Kulgam in south Kashmir for evacuated families.         
	The Srinagar-Jammu National Highway remained closed for the second day today and flights could not take off or land in Srinagar, he said.         
	Around 150 passengers are stranded on the highway and some houses have also been damaged. We have cleared the inter-district roads to ease traffic.

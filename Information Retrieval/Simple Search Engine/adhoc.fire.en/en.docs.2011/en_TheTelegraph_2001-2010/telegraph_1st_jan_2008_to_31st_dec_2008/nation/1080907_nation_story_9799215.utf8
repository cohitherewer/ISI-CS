          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Centre is studying whether it can legally claim control of Panjab University, the Prime Ministers alma mater, without the approval of the Punjab government that provides 40 per cent of the universitys funds.         
	The HRD ministry has asked the law ministry to examine whether Panjab University can be forced to follow laws applicable to central universities, government officials have said.         
	The decision to seek the law ministrys opinion was taken after the Punjab government withdrew its assent for central status to the Chandigarh-based varsity this week.         
	The law ministrys opinion will be crucial. At the HRD ministry, we believe Panjab University can essentially be considered a central university, a ministry official said.         
	The row erupted when the HRD ministry asked the university to follow OBC quotas implemented in central higher education institutions from this year, sources said. The Centre provides 60 per cent of the funds for the university, under the budget for Chandigarh, a Union territory.        
	The Punjab government, though willing to allow OBC quotas, said it was not ready to fund their implementation  building additional hostels, classes, and hiring teachers  the sources said.         
	In August, the state government agreed to hand over control of the 126-year university to the Centre.         
	New Delhi has already promised to ensure a central university in each state, and HRD officials had suggested that Panjab University be handed over to them.         
	But earlier this week, the Punjab government withdrew its assent for central status after several academics from the state opposed the transfer claiming it would hurt the varsitys unique character.         
	The university, which operated from Lahore since its inception in 1882 till Partition in 1947, is the only one in India that is neither under the control of the Centre nor any state government.         
	The HRD ministry, however, is keen to ensure the university enforces 27 per cent OBC quotas, sources said.         
	If we have to pay completely for the OBC expansion plans, we believe we should be allowed complete administrative control of the university, an HRD ministry official said.         
	The state government has traditionally claimed the university as theirs, as the 1947 law that brought it to India was created by the Assembly.         
	But the current character of the university  where the Centre and the state share the finances for the university  is a result of the Punjab Reorganisation Act of 1966, a central law.         
	Since the current character of the university is a consequence of a central law, we believe we can technically claim control over Panjab University, the ministry official said.

          MANDIRA NAYAR                           Amer Fort, one of the major tourist attractions in Jaipur                                  
	New Delhi, May 14: As it picks up the pieces and tries to return to normality after the serial blasts, Jaipur has another battle to fight  to shake off the terrorism tag.         
	A favourite with tourists, Pink City now faces the prospect of fleeing visitors and empty hotel rooms.         
	Hotel Classic Holiday, a towering white building just 4km from a blast site, has already started feeling the pinch.         
	We have had two no-shows from the morning, owner Bhavuk Agarwal said. Our visitors were coming into town for a couple of meetings, but were planning to stay on for a holiday.         
	While summer is an off-season for foreign tourists, Jaipur had become a great weekend getaway for families from Delhi. More so, as schools are closed now.         
	The last few weeks had been good for business, said the owner of Hotel Shikha, Deepak Sharma. Usually we have very few bookings during this time, but weve had 80 to 85 per cent occupancy the last few days.         
	But the summer boom fuelled by tourists from Delhi has been short-lived. Till yesterday, 15 of the hotels 25 rooms were occupied. Today, there are guests in only three rooms, Sharma said.         
	An atmosphere of fear and uncertainty is hardly conducive for a holiday. Jamming of phone lines  especially right after the blasts  has added to the feeling of insecurity.         
	Our clients had plans to go to Ajmer or Jodhpur, but they have all cancelled and headed to Delhi, Sharma said.         
	Rajasthan is one of the strongest tourism brands in the country. The state received 23,48,3287 domestic visitors in 2006, according to the tourism ministry, making it the fifth most popular destination in India.         
	But after the blasts more than 60 people last evening, even the imposing impregnable forts  the image that the state advertises  seem a little vulnerable.         
	Some foreign tourists who have booked holidays in India in December have sent in queries asking about the situation, an internet-based travel company said.        
	The upscale hotels  isolated islands in endless acres  however claim not to be affected.         
	At Raj Palace, a heritage hotel where a room can cost between $375 to $500 a night, the staff claim everything is normal. Our guests are enjoying themselves, deputy manager Narapath Singh Shekhawat said.

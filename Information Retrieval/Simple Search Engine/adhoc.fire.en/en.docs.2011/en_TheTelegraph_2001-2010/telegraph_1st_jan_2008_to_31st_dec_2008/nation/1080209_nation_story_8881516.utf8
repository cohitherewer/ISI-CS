	Mumbai, Feb. 8: A sessions court today framed charges of rape and criminal intimidation against Abhishek Kasliwal, the 30-year-old son of Shriram Textile Mill owner Ambuj Kasliwal, in a March 2006 case.         
	Abhishek had allegedly raped a 52-year-old woman in his car inside the Shriram mill compound in Worli after offering her a lift.        
	Abhishek, who was present in court this afternoon, pleaded not guilty to all the charges and will now stand trial. The court fixed the hearing for February 28.

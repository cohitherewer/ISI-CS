										      LARGE HOUSE IN PAK CITY FOR LASHKAR CHIEF                        A school building in the Jamaat-ud-Dawa headquarters in Muridke. (Reuters)				                           
	Lahore, Dec. 4: Mohammad Hafeez Saeed, the 63-year-old leader of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, lives in a large compound that includes a cream-coloured mosque that faces on to a bustling commercial street. A sign outside says Centre of Qadsisiyah, a triumphant reference to the place where the Arabs defeated the Persians in the seventh century.        
	A spokesperson for Saeed, Muhammad Yahya Mujahid, denied in an interview on Wednesday that Saeed was involved in the Mumbai attacks and described the Indian demand that he be turned over along with 19 others as propaganda.        
	India wants him because he exposes India on Kashmir and on water closure, Mujahid said, referring to Pakistani complaints about India cutting off water sources to Pakistan.         
	The groups public face, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, runs Islamic schools and charity works and maintains a 75-acre campus about 15 miles north of Lahore, at Muridke, he said. Since 9/11, he added, the scene has changed and the relationship is not so good with the establishment.        
	According to Western intelligence officials, the Lashkar was formed in 1989 with the assistance of Pakistans powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency, with Saeed as its head collaborator.         
	Though established as a proxy force to fight India in Kashmir, the Lashkar has since turned itself into a transnational group, officials say. Today it has cells in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistans tribal areas, and a few of its fighters have even turned up in Iraq, officials said.        
	Whether the group has come under the influence of al Qaida is uncertain.         
	Were not saying theres a direct hand in it but you have to think theres some learning going on, emulation going on, there are influences or contacts of some kind, a senior American official said.         
	Accounts from the captured gunman in Mumbai as well as those from a former Lashkar fighter who spoke to The New York Times provided glimpses of its recruitment methods and how the Mumbai attacks were planned.         
	One of the camps the surviving terrorist attended was in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-occupied Kashmir, where Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the Lashkar affiliate, did relief work after the 2005 earthquake.         
	There were roughly 25 people, sometimes more, in each camp, said Deven Bharti, a police officer in Mumbai. Whether some of them were being prepared for other attacks on other targets is not known. We cant rule it out, he said.        
	Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, 21, had only limited information about his conspirators, Bharti said. He did not know if there were plans to attack other targets. He was only a foot soldier, Bharti said.         
	A strict practice among the trainers of the Lashkar, the former fighter told New York Times, was a system of changing the names of the members every few months, so that everyone had layers of names that were discarded over time.        
	That system was intended to make it very difficult to identify members of the Lashkar, and is a likely explanation why Pakistani investigators have had little luck in finding Kasabs family in Faridkot.        
	The former fighter, who comes from the tribal areas of Pakistan, said he joined the Lashkar in 2000, stayed for eight months, then switched to the Jaish-e-Mohammad for ideological reasons.         
	He said retired Pakistani army officers impressed with the Lashkars ideology joined its ranks as volunteers. He spoke on condition of anonymity.        
	According to the former fighter, some members of the Lashkar moved to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, particularly the Mohmand region, close to Peshawar.         
	At its start in 1989, Osama bin Laden was widely reported to have been a financial supporter of the group. Since 2002, Lashkar trainers have worked closely with al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Seth Jones, an expert on militant groups at the RAND Corporation.        
	The Lashkar was banned under strong American pressure in 2002. Since then, Saeed disassociated himself from the Lashkar, said his spokesman. The Lashkar was now an operational wing to fight in Kashmir.        
	Asked if he knew the operational commander of the Lashkar, Mujahid waved his hand dismissively, and said he was in Kashmir. He denied even knowing the name of Yusuf Muzammil, the man identified by the Indian authorities as the person in charge of the Mumbai operation. Everyone who was interested in Kashmir, went to Kashmir, he said. They are doing there what they have to do.

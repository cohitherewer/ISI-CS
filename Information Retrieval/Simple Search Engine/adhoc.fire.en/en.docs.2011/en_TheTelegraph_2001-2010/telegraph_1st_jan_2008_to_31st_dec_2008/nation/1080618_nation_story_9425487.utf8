          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 17: Heavy rain has triggered flood fear in north Orissa even as several villages were marooned by swelling rivers.         
	Low-lying areas were heavily affected with rivers flowing near the danger-mark. Water-level of Jalaka has been rising in Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Bhadrak and Jajpur, said reports.         
	While Jaleshwar and Rajghat recorded the highest rainfall of 25cm, Balasore received 14cm rainfall.         
	The government has already sounded an alert and collectors of all coastal districts have been asked to be alert.         
	As many as 40 panchayats in three blocks of Balasore have been marooned by Jalaka, Budhabalanga and Subernarekha.         
	Similarly, 30 panchayats under eight blocks of Mayurbhanj have been inundated by Subernarekha and Budhabalang.         
	Disaster management minister Manmohan Samal said 13 coastal districts had been alerted regarding the possible floods and Rs 12.25 crore has been released from the calamity relief fund.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who returned from New Delhi this afternoon, said the situation was being closely monitored.         
	Heavy rains in Bengal and northern Orissa, resulted in disruption in train services in the South Eastern Railway jurisdiction. Several trains were short-terminated and cancelled, while many were delayed due to flooding of railway tracks in Balasore and Bhadrak.         
	Movement of vehicles was affected in some places in north Orissa as rainwater inundated roads in low-lying areas, reports stated.        
	Yesterdays depression over coastal Bangladesh moved in a north-westerly direction today and lay centred over Gangetic Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh, 80km north-east of Calcutta. The system is likely to move in a north-westerly direction, said Met officials.

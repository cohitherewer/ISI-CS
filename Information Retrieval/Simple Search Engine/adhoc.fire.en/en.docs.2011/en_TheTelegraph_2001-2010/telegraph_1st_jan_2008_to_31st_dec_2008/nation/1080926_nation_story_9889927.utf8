	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Amar Singh today accused Shivraj Patil of having refused to send police to arrest a BSP worker who allegedly tried to blackmail the Samajwadi leader over the cash-for-votes scandal.        
	The allegations against the Union home minister come in the middle of a deadlock over sharing of Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha seats between the Congress and the Samajwadis.        
	Amar said the BSP man, Hashmat Ali, came to his Delhi home this morning and allegedly offered to make a statement in his favour before the House panel probing the scandal in exchange for Rs 5 crore. Ali had deposed once but claimed he would change his testimony.         
	Amar then called Patil but, on being told he couldnt send the police, contacted the nearby Tughlaq Road police station, from where officers came and arrested Ali.        
	Amar lashed out at Patil, saying if the minister couldnt respond to his call for help, he could hardly be expected to protect the terror-stalked common man. The minister has been under fire over the recent serial blasts.        
	The Samajwadi leader didnt stop at Patil, accusing Congress MP Rizwan Alvi and another Congress leader linked to cricket of working to malign his image. The latter was seen as an allusion to Rajiv Shukla.         
	Last week, Amar had slammed Digvijay Singh over seat sharing. Congress has been asking for over two dozen seats but the Samajwadis arent ready to give more than half that number. Uttar Pradesh has 80 Lok Sabha seats.        
	The BJP likened Amars charges to a pot calling the kettle black, saying it was a stage-managed show. A witness who was to depose is found in his house on the same day is a matter for inquiry, a party release said.

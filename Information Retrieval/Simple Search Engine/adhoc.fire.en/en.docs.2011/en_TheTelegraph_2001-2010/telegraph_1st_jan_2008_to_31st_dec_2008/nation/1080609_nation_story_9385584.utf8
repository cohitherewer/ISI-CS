	On train to Delhi: Sanjay case files     
	Mumbais movers and packers just missed the business of a lifetime  13 trunks of papers in which Sanjay Dutts fate remains locked.    
	A mountain of Tada court documents travelled last week from Mumbai to Delhi, where the Supreme Court will hear the appeals of Dutt and other accused in the 1993 serial blasts case from next month.    
	The apex court may not have seen such a large body of evidence, packed painstakingly by court officials over weeks.    
	The trunks, each weighing 40kg, were taken to the capital by train. Evidence in the 15-year-old case runs into more than a lakh pages, which include 10,000 pages of the original chargesheet and over 14,000 pages of evidence recorded before the special court.    
	The trunks, sealed and secured with foolproof locks, were sent with the kind of security rarely seen.    
	The blast trial stretched for 14 years, resulting in the conviction of over 123 accused. The final verdicts were staggered over eight months, ending with Sanjay being found guilty for possessing an AK-56.        
	Power for plastic squad    
	The capitals green watchdog will get more teeth in its fight against plastic.    
	A government panel, apparently unhappy with the way civic bodies are dealing with units making plastic and polythene bags, has suggested more legal powers for the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to deal with the problem.    
	The pollution committee is empowered to check violations but it is the civic bodies that slap fines on violators under a garbage-control act passed in 2003. Now, though, the government panel, comprising pollution-control officials and a retired high court judge, has suggested powers to search and confiscate machines and material found in such units in violation of rules or if they recycle plastic waste to unlicensed ventures.    
	The government body was set up in response to a petition filed by NGO Tapas seeking a blanket ban on plastic bags. (PTI)    
	Flight rush at new hub    
	The skies over Bangalores new airport could soon swarm with new flights with several carriers firming up touchdown plans.    
	Among those waiting in the wings are Oman Air and Dragon Air (China). Tiger Air, the low-cost option to Singapore, has already begun services.    
	The airport witnessed 400 traffic movements daily within a week of its opening on May 24. In the last week of May, 45 freight flights arrived and 2,800 tonnes of cargo was cleared and moved.    
	Some of the teething troubles, like delays in baggage handling and connecting aero-bridges, have persisted but authorities insist it is because of the shortage of equipment and staff.    
	The problems have been caused by the uncertainty in fixing the opening date, they said, but promised quick changes.    
	Security will be reinforced, too, with an increase in the strength of the Central Industrial Security Force personnel manning the airport. The number has already gone up from 770 on the first day to 990 within a week.        
	Ribbon chugs in    
	Chennai had a glimpse of the AIDS campaign train this week after it arrived in the city on its cross-country odyssey.    
	The Red Ribbon Express, a joint initiative of the National Aids Control Society and the railways, drew hordes of visitors during its two-day halt from June 1 to 3.    
	The first three coaches of the AC train have an exhibition on AIDS prevention. The fourth has a special auditorium meant for NGO programmes. It will stop at 19 stations, including Namakkal and Salem, in its 40-day sojourn. (PTI)    
	MUMBAI: This Monday (June 9), watch the colours of life come alive in an array of paintings showcased by Devajyoti Ray. The exhibition is on at Jehangir Art Gallery from 11am to 7pm. The venue, a well-known Mumbai landmark, is located at Kala Ghoda, opposite Elphinstone College. Call 22048212.

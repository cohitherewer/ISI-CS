	Govt schools set to walk the talk    
	The Oxbridge accent might not be a preserve of the capitals schools for the rich and famous if a state plan pays off.    
	The Delhi governments department of education has launched a programme with the British Council to equip students of government schools with English skills.    
	The aim is to ensure they can compete with their peers in private schools that stress a lot on language skills.

	The government realised our students were lagging behind those from private schools in terms of communication, education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said.    
	Christened Yuva, the new programme will employ innovative ways to enhance communication skills among children in joyful, interesting and meaningful ways, he said. (PTI)        
	Eye on the sightless    
	Some politicians in Karnataka appear not to have lost sight of the causes that make a difference to the less fortunate.    
	Their entire BJP state cabinet, headed by chief minister B.S. Yedyurappa, recently pledged to donate their eyes after death.    
	The gesture is being seen as a shot in the arm for the campaign to persuade common people to pledge their eyes.     
	Yedyurappa signed on the dotted line, followed by his 33 ministers.     
	The chief minister described the donation as a noble cause, saying it would gift sight to at least two people. He hoped more people, even youngsters, would come forward to make donations, a feeling echoed by the eye hospital that organised the campaign.     
	Case at hand, against judge    
	A petitioner recently had the high court list a case questioning a judges integrity instead of an appeal, the usual practice.    
	Khanapuram Gandaiah accused a former district judge of Ranga Reddy of having deliberately ignored papers and memos filed by him before passing his order years ago.    
	One of the first such cases in the history of Andhra Pradesh High Court, Gandaiahs plea became a talking point among lawyers and legal eagles in Hyderabad and beyond. Orders have normally been contested through appeals.    
	A division bench headed by Chief Justice Anil R. Dave and Justice R. Subhash Reddy urged Gandaiah to think again before pressing for listing since the case involved the judiciarys prestige. They suggested an appeal instead.     
	The embarrassment was greater since the judge facing the allegations is now a high court registrar.    
	But Gandaiah persisted, saying his objective was to know why the judge had committed grave errors by overlooking fabricated documents furnished by the other side in the dispute. The bench relented and took in his case.        
	Tax fears out    
	House-owners spooked by the prospect of having to fork out more to the civic exchequer can breathe easy.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi recently ruled out a hike in property tax rates, capping speculation that the levy would be raised to pay for better amenities.    
	Vijender Gupta, the chairman of the civic bodys standing committee, said the money to improve facilities would come from rationalising existing financial resources.

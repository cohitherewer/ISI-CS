  - Easy rules amp; different mindset bring about change          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          No longer left out                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 17: Hassle-free rules and changed mindsets have resulted in a healthy rise in adopting a child in the state.        
	Till 1997, the state witnessed only four adoption cases, including three boys. But the scenario changed dramatically in the past decade.        
	A report prepared by the state council for child welfare says that Orissa has witnessed a spurt in facilitating more adoption cases in recent years and the number is growing. With adoption procedures getting less troublesome, more couples are showing interest in adopting children from Orissa, says Sanjukta Mohanty, the council secretary.        
	You have a room in your heart and at home you can have them. Unlike yesteryears, now the infertility certificate is not mandatory, she said. Recently, the Central Adoption Resource Agency issued a circular to all agencies stating that the applicants need not produce fertility certificate anymore.        
	Earlier, it were only childless couple who came for adoption. However, many working couples have been showing a lot of interest at present.         
	Affluent couples already having children are keen to adopt orphans too and couples with single child are also going for adoption. Earlier, obstacles like time, money, paperwork stalled the process and many interested couples had to return empty handed. But this isnt the case now. Not just less cumbersome process, people these days are more educated, serious and come prepared, she said.        
	Earlier, people would miss out on documents like arranging an income certificate and criminal record among others. The initial enthusiasm died down after learning the lengthy procedure. But now we take extra care to counsel them and lead them a helping hand, she added.        
	The council has scrutinised more than 100 adoptions this year. The adoption figures were 96, 182, 126, and 119 in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Besides domestic adoptions, the number of international adoption cases is also rising.        
	There have been adoptions from the US, Sweden, Germany, Australia, Spain, and France. This year only witnessed 36 international adoptions.

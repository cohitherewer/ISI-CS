	Jaipur, Dec. 22: Fifty-one Pakistanis who had overstayed in India with tampered visas have been set free from a Jodhpur jail following a government directive at a time relations have turned sour between the neighbours.         
	The Pakistani citizens  22 men, 25 women and four children  had come to India by the Thar Express. They were caught in April-May while returning home.        
	The detainees pleaded innocence saying the forged seal of the Indian embassy on their visas was the handiwork of their agents in Pakistan. Police investigations also seem to have reached this conclusion but it is not clear how all the Pakistanis could have been ignorant of the regulations when they had wanted to stay for a long time in India.         
	Deputy superintendent of police (CID) Hem Singh Charan said: These people who wanted a prolonged stay in India gave Rs 20,000-30,000 to their agents who forged the seals of the Indian embassy on their visas.

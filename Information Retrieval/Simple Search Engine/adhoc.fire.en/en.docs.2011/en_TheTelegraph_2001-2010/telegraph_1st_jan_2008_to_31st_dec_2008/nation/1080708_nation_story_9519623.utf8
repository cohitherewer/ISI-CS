	Srinagar, July 7: Jammu and Kashmir today headed for yet another spell of governors rule as the raging controversy over the Amarnath land transfer resulted in the resignation of chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and his council of ministers.         
	Governor N.N. Vohra, who took over barely a week ago, has accepted Azads resignation but asked him to continue in office till alternative arrangements are made.         
	The government was reduced to a minority 10 days ago after ally Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) jettisoned it over the land transfer to the Amarnath shrine board.        
	The PDP had initially supported the allotment but made a U-turn following a public uproar. The order has since been revoked.        
	Azads exit has paved the way for the likely imposition of governors rule, which will make its way back to the state after 12 years.         
	The main Opposition party, the National Conference, which has 24 MLAs, declined to take a shot at government-formation. We are the single-largest party and the governor was constitutionally bound to ask us whether we could form the government. But we have said no to him, NC president Omar Abdullah said.         
	Azad announced his resignation after concluding an emotional 130-minute speech in the Assembly ahead of the crucial floor test.        
	But the chief minister did not give in without taking a potshot at separatists who had fuelled the land transfer agitation in Kashmir.        
	There are some political merchants who don a crisp sherwani when people die in Kashmir. They care two hoots for the sentiments of people and just do politicking. They are the leaders who send their wards to Pakistan to pursue MBBS courses. They want others to wield guns but send their sons to achieve bigger dreams abroad, he said.        
	For several days, Kashmir was brought to a grinding halt by some people who misled the people and exploited their sentiments. They have no problem because they get hawala money from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries. What will happen to an ordinary labourer who earns during the day and feeds his family in the evening?        
	In the face of opposition from the National Conference, PDP and the Panthers Party, which together have 47 seats in the House of 87 and had issued whips to members to vote against him, Azad was unlikely to reach the halfway mark of 44.         
	Realising he lacked the numbers, the chief minister straightaway went to Raj Bhavan, where he handed over letters conveying his and his councils resignation.         
	Azad, a former Union parliamentary affairs minister, had taken over as chief minister in November 2005 under a 2002 power-sharing agreement with the PDP, according to which both parties were to head the government for three years each.        
	After the PDPs withdrawal, Azad had repeatedly exuded confidence that he would win the trust vote, apparently with the support of rebels from his ally and some absentees.

	Singur, July 29 (PTI): A bomb-like object found near the Tata Motors small car project site yesterday may have created panic among residents, but police today said it was a firecracker.        
	Police seized the firecracker and started a probe in the incident that happened close to the factory wall, in Hooghly district of Bengal. Labourers at the site vacated rented accommodation in the wake of a call by the anti-land acquisition forum Krishi Jami Raksha Committee asking outsiders to leave the area. However, work was not affected, company sources said.        
	Security at the site was beefed up recently following Naxalite threats. A meeting was held on the factory premises to review security, said additional director-general, of CID, Bhupinder Singh.         
	Hooghly district magistrate Irabati Meena and SP Rajiv Mishra today held a meeting with state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakraborty and briefed him about the security arrangements in the Singur factory.

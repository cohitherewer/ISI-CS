	Cuttack, June 24: People for Animals (PFA) first drew the media and administrations attention towards Ram Singh Munda for keeping a sloth bear in captivity. The animal rescued and Munda out on bail after arrest, it wants to help the animals former master lead a decent life.        
	In a bid to make the best use of his skills, its office-bearers want engage Munda at their animal shelter.         
	We will engage Munda at our animal shelter. He will be perfect for the animals, said PFA Orissa secretary J.B. Das.         
	Kalinga Institute of Social Science has consented to provide free education to Gulki, Mundas daughter at a tribal school under it, Das said.         
	Before the PFA came forth with help, Orissa State Legal Aid Service Authority decided to assist Munda, who was jailed for violating a wildlife law and raising a sloth bear in captivity. It helped the tribal man get bail on Monday.         
	Munda is a resident of Rutisila in Ghatagaon of Keonjhar. Rani, the bear with a shaggy black coat, was rescued on June 19 and her guardian was arrested on charges of violating Wildlife Animal Protection Act, 1972.        
	As we said, we wanted the bear to be rehabilitated, but did not wish the man to be arrested, as he was not aware of the wildlife laws when he took Rani in, Das added.

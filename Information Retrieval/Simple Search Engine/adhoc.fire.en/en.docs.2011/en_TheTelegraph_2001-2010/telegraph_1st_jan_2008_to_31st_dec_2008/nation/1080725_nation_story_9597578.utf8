                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Feather in Somnath   cap: Lok Sabha TV
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Somnath Chatterjee                                        
	New Delhi, July 24: Somnath Chatterjee has another reason to be happy apart from the praise and support from the Prime Minister and the UPA. His pet project, Lok Sabha TV, completed two years today with high ratings and viewership, a day before the Speaker himself turns 79.        
	The unglamorous channel, launched amid much resistance and prophecies of imminent failure, marked a quiet second anniversary with only sporadic images of bursting crackers on a corner of the screen indicating the event.        
	According to Map, an organisation that tracks TV ratings, the channels viewership soared by 50 per cent on July 21, the day the debate on the trust motion started. On July 22, when Cashgate was followed by the trust vote, the figure was close to 60 per cent. More than 10 lakh viewers tuned in.        
	Viewers obviously found the political drama more gripping than the saas-bahu soaps and even sports. It was better than a reality show. Besides, there were no ad breaks, an industry watcher explained.        
	Many others watched the proceedings on other news channels that aired Lok Sabha TV feed almost continuously.        
	CEO Sunit Tandon said the channel consistently had higher ratings than CNN and BBC and almost matched Discovery and Travel amp; Living.        
	Chatterjee believed telecasting Parliament proceedings would act as a sobering influence on MPs. Its difficult to say whether it did, but the benign-looking, white-haired Speakers headmaster-like admonitions, in English and Bengalised Hindi, would have endeared him to many homes.        
	Many see the channel as a breakthrough in the history of Indian democracy since it got the public involved in serious political issues being discussed and decided in Parliament. Chatterjee also wanted a Rajya Sabha TV but MPs such as Sitaram Yechury shot the proposal down.

          NALIN VERMA                           One of the elephants at the Sonepur fair. Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, Nov. 19: First it was the samosas, now its a kidnapping  everything about Sonepur is jumbo.        
	An elephant and its mahout were snatched from the Sonepur cattle fair last night by gun-toting henchmen of a local landlord, after word spread that the animal was to be sold for a huge sum.         
	Pachyderms are the biggest draw at the fair, but since trade in elephants is banned, any sale is passed off as a gift. The fair had set tongues wagging this week when a snack vendor almost wangled Rs 10,000 from a Dutch couple for four samosas, until some volunteers stepped in.        
	The animal was found today in nearby Baijalpur village, where it has now been chained outside the house of former headman Chandrika Singh while an ownership dispute between two friends-turned-foes is resolved.         
	Landlords Arbind Singh and Ramji Singh had bought the elephant in Assam in June. Like at the Sonepur fair, the deal was shown officially as a gift. However, the Assam seller gave only Arbind the power of attorney in the donation chit, giving him the right to donate or gift the animal away.        
	Arbind and Ramji had documents from Assams wildlife department to transport the jumbo to Bihar, said P.K. Das, the Sonepur deputy superintendent of police and the officer in charge of law and order at the fair.        
	Arbind was offered a high price for the elephant and planned to sell it without telling his friend but Ramji found out, the police said.         
	Last night, Ramjis gun-toting henchmen raided the fair tent where the elephant had been chained and abducted the animal along with mahout Kamaluddin while Arbind and his friends were asleep.        
	Arbind later lodged a police complaint saying Ramji had stolen the elephant. Ramji retaliated with the same charge.        
	When the police found the elephant in Baijalpur village, DSP Das and his colleagues decided to tie the animal to Chandrikas door while they sorted out the tangle. The police and fair officials are trying to decide which of the two friends should get the elephant.        
	Arbind denies plans to sell the elephant. I had no intention to sell the animal without Ramjis consent, though I had paid more than Ramji in Assam. Ramji countered the claim, saying he had more land and property and, therefore, had shelled out more.        
	Chandrika cant wait for the deadlock to end. I am not rich. I find it hard to feed the jumbo. Still I am feeding it as I dont want to earn the wrath of Lord Ganesh.        
	As the row rages, Baijalpur, used to watching gun-toting commandos escorting ministers and officials, has a new VIP in its midst: the elephant, ringed by policemen.

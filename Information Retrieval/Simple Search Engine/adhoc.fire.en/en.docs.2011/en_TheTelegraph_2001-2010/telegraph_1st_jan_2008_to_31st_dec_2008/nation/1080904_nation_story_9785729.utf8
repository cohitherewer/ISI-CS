	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 3: The violence-hit Khandhamal district was limping back to normalcy today. In Jeypore, too, the situation was near normal with people celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi at several parts of the town amid adequate deployment of police.        
	The curfew was lifted from 7am to 2pm and later extended till six in the evening. There was a good response today and a huge crowd gathered to participate in the festivities. There were no incidents of violence reported from the town till late this evening.        
	The district administration decided to allow the Ganesh puja celebrations after various puja committees there were keen to organise it. However, certain conditions were imposed for the celebrations. The immersion ceremony will be held tomorrow instead of the usual 10 days time, deputy inspector-general of police Sanjeev Panda said.        
	The situation is almost normal now but we cannot take any chance. This has been done to keep the situation under control, he said. The list of members to be present at the puja pandals would be sent to the district administration.         
	Similarly, no loud speakers would be used by the puja committees with elaborate security arrangements.        
	Meanwhile, a high-level official team, which visited Khandhamal yesterday worked out strategies for containing violence in the tribal-dominated district besides speeding up relief and rehabilitation for the affected.        
	A delegation of RSS today met chief minister Naveen Patnaik and urged him to provide full protection to Hindu tribals allegedly living under fear of minority attacks in several villages of Khandhamal and Gajapati districts.        
	RSS national executive committee member Ram Madhab told reporters that they had demanded immediate arrest of culprits behind the killing of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and stopping of harassment of innocent Hindu leaders and activists and withdrawal of all false cases instituted against them.

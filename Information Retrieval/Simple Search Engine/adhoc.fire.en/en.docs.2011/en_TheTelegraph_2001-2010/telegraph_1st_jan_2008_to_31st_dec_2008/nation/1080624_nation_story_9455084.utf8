  - Land sale has spawned new millionaires anxious about investments and spendthrift children         GAJINDER SINGH                          Vijay Sharma, who got Rs 9 crore for six acres of land, in front of his new Ford Fiesta. Picture by Gajinder Singh                                         
	Jhurjheri (Punjab), June 23: Turning a crorepati overnight has deepened the creases on Manu Singhs forehead.        
	A few months ago, the 60-year-old farmers sons tilled the soil. Now they swagger about in Scorpios and Pajeros and fly to foreign tourist hotspots to spend a slice of their new-found, perpetual holiday.        
	Earlier, they would drink just occasionally. Now they regularly carouse on expensive liquor like Chivas Regal, Manu (name changed) says.        
	He isnt the only worried patriarch in this village of new millionaires located metres from the runway of Chandigarh airport. The Punjab government has bought the farmland here at Rs 1.5 crore an acre for a new terminal.        
	The sudden riches have gone to the younger generations head. They dont seem to understand the value of money, rues sarpanch Prem Singh, a mechanical engineer who owned no land and missed the windfall.        
	If there are four brothers in a family, each wants a car for himself when only one SUV and a small car is more than enough. If someone flaunts a Tata Safari, his neighbour buys a Mitsubishi Pajero to get one up on him. Its all so vulgar.        
	Yet, when it comes to spending a little on social causes, no ones interested. The sarpanch says he had tried to raise donations for a water cooler at the local primary school, but nobody seems willing to either donate or collect the money.        
	No one cares about improving the narrow, pockmarked village road, either. The Hondas and Fords, Pajeros and Scorpios are parked next to cow-dung heaps on the fly-infested lanes lined by dirty drains.                  Chhota Singh, whose   half-acre plot brought   him Rs 75 lakh      
	Kaka Singh, who received Rs 20 crore for his 13-odd acres, defends the trend. He says most of the villagers had never ventured out of Punjab, so its natural that they should splurge on foreign trips now.        
	I had only seen aeroplanes landing and taking off from the nearby runway and had always dreamt of taking a ride on one of them. Now is my chance to take my family to another country for a holiday, he says.        
	The travel agents visiting the village say it will cost only a few lakhs, which I can afford easily now. Ill take along even my infant grandchildren.        
	Some of the older villagers have realised the need to invest their crores before its all blown on swank cars and expensive liquor, and are turning to financial firms to learn about mutual funds.        
	I must invest the money to secure my childrens future, says Chhota Singh, 50, whose half-acre plot brought him Rs 75 lakh  a pittance compared with what most others have got.        
	A Jat in Punjab has little knowledge of anything other than agriculture. But there are no options left, I must learn how best to save my money.        
	The one thing most of the families have invested in is land. The government offered them plots in places like Fatehgarh Sahib, Sirhind and Patiala, where the prices of farmland have shot up from Rs 12 lakh an acre to Rs 30 lakh after Jhurjheris farmers received their compensation. The government has offered to waive the registration fees and stamp duty.        
	But that has created another worry for the older generation. Vijay Sharma, richer by Rs 9 crore, is already sad over the break-up of families that he foresees within the next six months, with the young migrating to the places where they have bought land.        
	Stepping out of his new Ford Fiesta, Vijay says: The elderly dont want to migrate but the young want to live in cities.        
	His neighbour Dharam Singh explains: We can buy land elsewhere but we cannot build a village. We have many memories here, and have developed relations with residents of nearby villages.        
	He is afraid that the government may have plans to demolish the village, although the authorities havent said anything. We wont allow the village to be razed. They can erect a wall in front of the village and build an approach road to the new terminal from elsewhere.

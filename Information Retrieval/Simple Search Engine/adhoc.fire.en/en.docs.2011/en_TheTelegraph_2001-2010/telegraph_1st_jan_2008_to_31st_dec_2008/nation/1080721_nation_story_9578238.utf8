	New Delhi, July 20 (PTI): A landowner can approach a consumer forum to settle a dispute with a builder because the builder is deemed a service provider under the consumer protection act, the Supreme Court has said.        
	However, there is no such remedy for the builder under the act. The builder has to move a civil court for remedy, a bench of Justices R.V. Raveendra and L.S. Panta said.         
	The bench quashed the orders of the Delhi district forum, state consumer commission and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which had all held that a landowner was not a consumer under the act.        
	A landowner, Faqir Chand Gulati, had moved the apex court against builders Uppal Agencies Pvt Ltd.        
	Gulati had entered into an agreement with the firm for the construction of apartments on his land in -3 Kailash Colony. Under the agreement, after completion of work, Gulati would be entitled to the ground floor  comprising three bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a drawing-cum-dining hall, one storeroom, a kitchen, a rear terrace, parking space and servants quarters.         
	But Gulati said the builders deviated from the sanctioned plan and refused to rectify it, following which he complained to the district forum that dismissed his plea saying the landowner was not a consumer. The view was upheld by the state commission and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.        
	But the apex court said a landowner was a consumer.

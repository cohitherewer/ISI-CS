	Ajmer, May 20: Haji Syed Kalimuddin hopes that a day would soon come when he can again see every Bangladeshi in this town the way he saw Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.        
	That was a long time back and things have changed since. Last weeks Jaipur blasts have made matters worse.        
	After Tuesdays serial explosions killed over 60 people, the focus is on a large floating population of Bangladeshis in Jaipur and Ajmer, which, too, has bled from a deadly assault by terrorists.        
	A hidden bomb had killed at least two last October as thousands prayed outside the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, one of the countrys most secular shrines, in this town.        
	Now, after alleged involvement of Bangladesh-based outfits like the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami in terror attacks in India, chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia wants all Bangladeshis to be identified within 30 days and the process on deportation of illegal settlers started.        
	It wasnt like this before.        
	At least not when Kalimuddin first met Mujibur Rahman in 1974 on a visit to Dhaka.        
	Kalimuddins father, Haji Syed Waliuddin, was the Bangabandhus vakil as the khadims at the Ajmer dargah  who can be compared with pandas in temples  are called.         
	Kalimuddin was young then, but cherishes the relationship he has enjoyed with Mujibs pious daughter, Sheikh Hasina.        
	He is disappointed that Hasina, who used to visit the shrine every year, hasnt been able to make it for the last two years because of political developments in her country.        
	Another former Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, has also come here.        
	As Syed Mehmood ul-Hassan Chishti, the secretary of the dargah khadims committee, says, Ajmers relationship with Bangladesh, and even Pakistan  residents still remember President Pervez Musharrafs visit  binds the whole of South Asia.        
	But that relationship has now come under a strain.        
	India played a big part in Bangladeshs independence. Till Indira Gandhi was in power or even after that during Morarji Desais time, we were quite liberal towards Bangladesh. But ever since this terrorism has started, naturally as a neighbouring country, India is worried, and should be, Kalimuddin says.        
	Suddenly, the sight of Bangladeshis in the bylanes has become a matter of concern for him and others like Syed Sarwar Rais, who visited Dhaka only a week back. Many of these nikammas (useless people) are turning fundamentalists, Kalimuddin says.        
	Justifying the security measures against Bangladeshis, he says any illegal migrant should be removed in such times, and the khadims should co-operate.         
	Rais, who spends four months in a year in Calcutta, couldnt help taking a dig at the double standards of the state, which has issued ration cards to many Bangladeshis.        
	But he summed up the feeling of fear and suspicion. On Sunday, three men came to his house here, placed a bag and started to run. Rais said he got them arrested because police would suspect him, but found the bag only contained some factory die.        
	Kalimuddin wants this atmosphere of fear to end. He wants to see every Bangladeshi in this dargah town the way he saw Mujib years ago.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kotwals, tighter law on Centre table
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Guwahati/New Delhi, Sept. 14: Shivraj Patil today spoke of going back to kotwals or informers to tackle terrorism while the Centre mulled tightening an existing law to muffle the BJP clamour for an anti-terror law.        
	The Union home minister suggested reviving the traditional system of kotwals to lighten the load on an understrength police.        
	Patil said that since only 14,000 police stations served Indias 6.5 lakh villages, at a ratio of 1 to 46, he wanted a group of citizens to act as the eyes and ears of the government in every village.        
	It may not be exactly in the traditional form but we need to develop something like the village kotwals who used to provide information to the local police stations about the activities in their villages. We need to marry the western system of policing with the traditional system, Patil said in Guwahati during a trip to inspect the Assam floods.        
	In Delhi, government sources said the Centre had drafted amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 to buttress it with certain provisions of the now-repealed Prevention of Terrorism Act, introduced by the NDA.        
	They said the government had been sitting on the draft for fear of angering the minorities, but with the BJP turning up the heat after yesterdays Delhi blasts, the Centre might act soon.        
	The sources added that the amended law would give investigating agencies 180 days to file a chargesheet, instead of the current 90 days after which the accused become entitled to bail.        
	The draft, drawn up and cleared in principle by the home ministry, also seeks to increase police custody for a terror suspect to 35 days from the current 14 days in a single case.        
	Tightening the 1967 law will allow the Centre not only to reject calls for the return of the NDA law, but to also argue that the states dont need their own separate law.        
	Narendra Modi has been screaming at Delhi for sitting on the Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act for three years. Recently, Mayavati withdrew her proposed anti-mafia law, the UPCOCA, tired of waiting for clearance from the Centre.        
	The draft amendment also has a clause seeking to attach the property of anyone convicted of funding terror groups, but the finance ministry is hesitating to clear this, the sources said.         
	In Guwahati, Patil suggested the states set up more police stations. The state governments spend huge money on development. But unless they proportionately enhance the expenditure for providing security to the people, development activities will be retarded, he said.        
	The home minister, under fire for his failure to contain terrorist attacks, virtually passed the buck to the states.        
	He said over-dependence on the central intelligence agencies  the RAW and the IB  would not help. The states also need to co-operate better in security-related matters, Patil added.

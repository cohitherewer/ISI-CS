	Raipur, July 23: Two BJP MPs from Chhattisgarh had allegedly made up their mind to violate the party whip yesterday and vote in favour of the trust motion. But Chhattisgarhs BJP chief minister Raman Singhs timely intervention foiled the move.         
	The two MPs were identified a day before the vote. They were in contact with the Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders. The party high command swung into action before they could cross-vote in favour of the UPA government, a top BJP leader told The Telegraph today.         
	According to the leader, the BJP high command in New Delhi was aware of the movements and had identified most of the MPs. On Monday, the BJP high command asked Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and former Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to rush to New Delhi, the leader said.         
	The BJP revelation stands justified as three of the eight BJP MPs who cross-voted or remained absent were from Karnataka. Raman Singh was in Bangalore, for naturopathy treatment, when he received the message from the high command. He, along with Yeddyurappa, reached New Delhi and hosted a dinner for all the nine BJP MPs from Chhattisgarh and succeeded to keep the two MPs on party line.

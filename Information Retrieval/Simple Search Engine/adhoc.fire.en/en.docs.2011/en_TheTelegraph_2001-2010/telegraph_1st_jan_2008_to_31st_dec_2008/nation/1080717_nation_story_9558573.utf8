	Bhubaneswar, July 16: The state capital, an old-world temple town, is set to get a hi-tech railway station with help from China.         
	A Chinese railway delegation led by director of the Sino-India Railway Co-operation Working Group W.U. Wei met the general manager of East Coast Railway, A.K. Goyal, and his team of senior officers yesterday to discuss the proposed project.         
	The team of experts inspected and surveyed the proposed site and would be submitting a suggestion report on ways to go about the task. Based on their suggestions, The Indian Railways would decide on the future course of action, stated an East Coast Railway release. Twenty-five stations are being planned in India on public-private partnership mode. There will be commercial exploitations and generation of revenue in the stations.

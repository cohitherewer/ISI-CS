          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Rescue workers clear debris in Mumbai on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: At least 20 people, including five women and four children, were killed when a part of a 70-year-old building declared unsafe collapsed today.        
	Several residents were trapped under the debris of the Rangoli building, located in central Mumbais Bhendi Bazaar area, when it caved in around 5.15 this morning.        
	Fire brigade personnel carrying out the rescue pulled out 10 bodies and took some of the 21 injured to the nearby JJ Hospital. Some were said to be in serious condition. Authorities at the hospital said some were sent home after treatment while others had been admitted.         
	Late this evening, the rescuers were trying to locate five children and two women still feared trapped under the debris.        
	The building, constructed by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), had been in poor shape since 1985. Residents blamed the housing authority for not carrying out repairs despite requests.         
	Mhada officials, however, said the occupants had been reluctant to move to transit camps despite warnings.         
	Rangoli had been classified dangerous in a pre-monsoon Mhada survey of old buildings, the officials said.         
	The officials believe the weak structure could have caved in because of the rains over the past few days. Over 2,219 residents continue to live in 78 such buildings, most of them in central Mumbai.        
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh visited the collapse site and announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the families of those who died and Rs 25,000 for the injured.        
	There are 19,000 dilapidated buildings in the city and many are located in congested areas, making rescue work difficult. We tried to persuade the residents of many of these buildings to move to the transit camps at Colaba but they were reluctant. We will try to rehabilitate them in the best possible manner, he said.        
	In another incident, 24 children were injured when the railing of a staircase in St Antonio DSilva School in Byculla gave way during the tiffin break. All were treated and discharged soon, said an official of the school, not far from Rangoli building.        
	The railing of the staircase came unstuck during recess when children rush out of classes. They were coming down the stairs and fell on each other, a school official said.

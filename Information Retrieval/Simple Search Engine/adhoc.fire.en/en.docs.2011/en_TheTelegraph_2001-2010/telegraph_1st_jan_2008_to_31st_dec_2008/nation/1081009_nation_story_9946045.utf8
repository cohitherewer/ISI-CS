          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: The Maharashtra cabinet today accepted a Centre-appointed panels suggestion to broaden the definition of wife to include a woman who has lived together with a man for a reasonably long period.        
	The Justice Mallimath Committee said such a step would help women involved in live-in relationships to claim alimony in case of a break-up.        
	Under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the word wife now applies to a woman who has been divorced by or has got a divorce from her husband and has not remarried. But the committee said if a man and a woman were living together for a reasonable period, the woman should get the status of a wife.        
	The proposal was approved at a meeting of the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.        
	As CrPC is on the concurrent list, the cabinet proposal would be sent to the Centre for obtaining the Presidents assent, an official said.        
	The cabinet also cleared a proposal for tougher punishment to curb attacks on public property during riots or aggressive political campaigns.        
	Under Section 427 of the penal code, a person who damages property worth more than Rs 50 can be jailed for two years and fined Rs 500. The cabinet has proposed the inclusion of a sub-section  called 427A  that would make the offence punishable with five years in prison.        
	Under the sub-section, public property would include hospitals, medical clinics, studios, media offices, research institutes, sports complexes and any other public service institution.        
	The amendments are aimed at controlling damages to public services during communal riots and aggressive political campaigns. Sources said the amendments would also help control attacks on police personnel by mobs.        
	Seven policemen and nearly a dozen home guards were injured recently when a mob pelted them with stones after an explosion in Malegaon killed five people.        
	The cabinet decided on tougher punishment for offenders under sections of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, that deal with dangerous driving, speeding, driving illegally and accident-related offences.        
	Under these sections, offenders can now be jailed for three months to two years.        
	Officials said the proposed amendments were aimed at checking drunken driving among other offences.        
	Techie father        
	The father of the Pune techie and terror email suspect, Mansoor Peerbhoy, has said he was shocked by the polices claims but would co-operate with the investigations.        
	Asghar Ali Peerbhoy, the father, said in Pune: I am confident that my son will do no wrong. Even if he has, he could not have committed such serious offences. He is a very innocent person and he has never seen a police station in his life. I have never seen him misbehave or hit any, not even a child.

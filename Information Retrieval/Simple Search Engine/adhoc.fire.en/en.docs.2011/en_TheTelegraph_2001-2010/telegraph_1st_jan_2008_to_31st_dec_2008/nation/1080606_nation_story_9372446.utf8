          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 5: A day after declaring a bandh in Bengal, Left parties today called for a Bihar bandh on June 10 (Tuesday) to protest the oil price hike.        
	Representatives of the CPI, CPM, CPI(ML-Liberation), Forward Bloc and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Krantikari Vichar Manch unanimously decided in a meeting to call a dawn-to-dusk state bandh.        
	The Lefts joint co-ordination committee spokesman Mohammad Jabbar Alam said the cadre of all Left parties would begin organising street corner meets and demonstrations to garner support for the bandh from tomorrow itself.        
	Alam said the steep hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas would break the backbone of common people already struggling with inflation and price rise.

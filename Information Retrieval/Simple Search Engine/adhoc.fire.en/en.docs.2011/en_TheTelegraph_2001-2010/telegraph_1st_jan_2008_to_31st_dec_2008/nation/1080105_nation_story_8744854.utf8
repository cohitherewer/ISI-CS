The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fresh driving licence plan for Delhi visitors
                                                                                                            Fresh driving licence plan for Delhi visitors
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Delhi government is toying with a proposal to bar drivers with licences from other states from zipping down the capitals streets.        
	The transport department proposal, aimed at curbing traffic violations, says that those with licences from elsewhere but living or working in Delhi should take a fresh driving test.        
	If people with licences from outside Delhi clear the standards of driving in Delhi, they can drive here with their fresh licence, a senior transport department official said.        
	The proposal has yet to be cleared by the Delhi cabinet. Department sources they were expecting opposition from sections within the cabinet.        
	It is a huge proposal. Not everyone will accept it... at least, not at first, the official said. Other states could also object as licences now valid across India would no longer hold in Delhi.        
	The proposal suggests that drivers from nearby satellite townships, who travel to Delhi on work or to meet acquaintances, could be issued special permits.        
	The permits will, however, require address verification. The permits will be much easier to obtain than a new licence. The permits wont require a fresh driving licence, the official said.         
	According to statistics with traffic police, there have been nearly 6 million instances of traffic violations in the last three years. The new proposal was sure to bring down the number, transport officials said.        
	Quite simply, licences are obtained far more easily outside Delhi than within the capital, an official said.        
	But Gauri Sinha, a Delhi-based executive from Jamshedpur who retains her earlier licence, begged to differ. She said the government should first address corruption in the transport department before trying anything else.        
	They should first produce statistics to back their claim that there is no corruption in issuing driving licences, she said.        
	Others termed the proposal dumb and irrational.        
	Transport officials said traffic violations were not the only reason for the proposal. With dedicated bus corridors in the pipeline and the metro running successfully, the government was hoping the proposal would dissuade people living in Delhi temporarily from using private transport.        
	A number of people working in Delhi do not have plans to settle here. They are from other cities... and many are single. If the proposal comes through, such people may want to use public transport instead of cars, an official said.        
	Delhis lieutenant governor Tejinder Khanna said at a news conference that Delhi residents should always carry identity cards.        
	It is not mandatory. But it will help the person as police on the lookout for a criminal may otherwise harass him.

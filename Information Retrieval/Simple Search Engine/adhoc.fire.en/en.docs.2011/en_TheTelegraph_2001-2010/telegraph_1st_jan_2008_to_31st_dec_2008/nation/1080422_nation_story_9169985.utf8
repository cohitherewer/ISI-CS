          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, April 21: Pakistan today test-fired a nuclear-capable ballistic missile, the second launch since the weekend that marked the culmination of a field training exercise for the long-range Shaheen-II or Hatf-VI, the military said in a statement.        
	The missile, which has a range of 2,000km, the longest among Pakistans weapons systems, can also carry conventional warheads.        
	The first test was carried out on Saturday almost two months after Pakistani scientists conducted a series of tests involving the Ghauri, Abdali, Shaheen Raad and Babur (cruise) missiles.        
	The Army Strategic Force Command conducted the first training launch of the missile, which marked the culmination of a field training exercise, the military said in a statement.        
	The test, the statement added, validated the operational readiness of a strategic missile group equipped with the Shaheen-II.        
	Navy chief Admiral Muhammad Afzal Tahir, who witnessed the launch, said Pakistan could be justifiably proud of its defence capability and the reliability of its nuclear deterrence.        
	The capability, he added, formed the bedrock of Pakistans security policy and would continue to be enhanced.

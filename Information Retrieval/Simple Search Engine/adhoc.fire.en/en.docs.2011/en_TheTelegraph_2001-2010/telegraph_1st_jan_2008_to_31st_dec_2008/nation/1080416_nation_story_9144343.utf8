	Forecast changes with politics     
	Politics has muscled its way into Vedic predictions.     
	The ceremonial reciting of the almanac (punchagam) at Ravindra Bharati on the Telugu New Year Day, Ugadi, had forecast a bright future for Andhra Pradesh.     
	Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and his cabinet colleagues, present at the event, were pleased a punch. So thrilled were the leaders that they chose to honour the pundits who had predicted abundant rain, a flurry of investments, and a peaceful, prosperous and healthy year ahead.     
	While the Congress camp whooped in joy, Telugu Desam Party leaders were tickled for a different reason.     
	At the NTR Trust Bhavan, the Desam had organised a parallel reading of the almanac, which predicted disaster for the state. Astrologer Srinivasa Gargeya said unseasonal rains would play havoc, crops would face a pest attack, and the clincher  mid-term polls to both Parliament and the Assembly.     
	Gargeya also predicted the victory of the UNPA at the Centre and the elevation of CPM general secretary Prakash Karat to the Prime Ministers post.        
	No more Hyderabad trips    
	Hyderabad has got a new airport only to lose weekend techie tourists because of it.    
	Bangalores IT professionals dont want to come to the city of the Charminar on weekends. Reason  the 90-minute drive from the new Shamshabad airport to the city.    
	All four routes from the airport are generally clogged, stretching to 10 hours what was earlier a six-hour journey from one tech city to another.    
	We dont see any point spending such a long time in traffic and connectivity hassles every weekend, said Sandeep Bandaru, a software professional from Hyderabad who works in Bangalore.     
	Taxi operators on the routes charge Rs 750 on an average, when the standardised official charge is Rs 350.     
	Some executives predicted matters would worsen when the new airport opens at Devanahalli in Bangalore, where, too, connectivity would be a hassle.    
	Click amp; pick a dream varsity    
	A US-based education information provider has launched an Indian portal that plans to hand-hold students through the search for their dream course and assist them in applying for it. All for free.     
	The website  www.studyplaces.com  offers a bouquet of servi- ces ranging from counselling, online or on the telephone, to collec- ting applications forms, assisting students fill them and then despat-ching them to the universities.     
	It is the first of its kind website in India. Our revenues will come solely from advertisements, Amitabh Nagpal, the CEO of studyplaces.com, said.     
	The website offers practice tests in competitive exams popular in India  from entrance tests for IITs and IIMs to the GRE and GMAT.     
	The practice tests, prepared by faculty from central universities across India, will be changed every 15 days, Nagpal said.         
	RBI helping hand    
	Puzzled about personal finance? The Reserve Bank of India could be of some help.    
	The RBI has recently come out with a concept paper on financial literacy and free counselling centres to educate customers about products and services, its deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath has said.    
	The free counselling centres set up by the bank would impart training to investors about responsible borrowing, debt counselling and debt restructuring for borrowers under stress, she said.     
	Mumbai: Satyam National Academy of Photography is conducting a workshop on digital photography. Professor Shreekant Malushte will address participants from 10am to 4pm. The workshop is on till April 28. The academy is on Senapati Bapat Marg in Dadar (West).

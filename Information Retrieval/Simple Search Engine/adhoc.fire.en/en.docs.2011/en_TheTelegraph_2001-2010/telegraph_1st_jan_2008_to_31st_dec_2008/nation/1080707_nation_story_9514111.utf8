  - Kashmiri Pandits ransack Sozs Delhi residence over Amarnath somersault        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A protester at Saifuddin Sozs house in New Delhi on Sunday. (AFP)                                        
	New Delhi, July 6: A mob of about 100 Kashmiri Pandits vandalised the residence of Union minister Saifuddin Soz today, exposing the vulnerability of the high-security Lutyens Zone where most ministers and MPs live.        
	The Akbar Road bungalow, attacked in protest against the withdrawal of land to the Amarnath shrine board in Kashmir, is less than a kilometre from the Prime Ministers residence, 7 Race Course Road.        
	Water resources minister Soz, who is from Kashmir, and his wife are on a visit to their home state, sources said. No family member was in the house, and no one was injured.        
	The protesters, who had gathered under the banner of the Amarnath action group at Jantar Mantar in the afternoon, arrived at the bungalow in 20-odd vehicles, shouting slogans and flashing placards.        
	The four armed guards at the gate were caught by surprise as the mob forced the iron gates open, shattered the windows of Sozs office with stones, broke potted plants in the garden and threatened the servants.        
	Such was the force that the stopper on the grille gate broke while the lock remained intact. We were helpless, said one of the guards, C.B. Rajput.        
	The presence of women among the demonstrators also deterred the armed personnel from using force. The protest raged on till the police were called in and led the demonstrators away to detention.        
	An assistant in the ministers office, John Kutty, said he had told the guards not to use force. He admitted the situation would have been different had the minister been here and the mob tried to force its way into the house.        
	Sources said Delhi police had no inkling of the attack till they were informed by Sozs office. Senior police officers declined comment, saying an investigation was on.        
	Heads are expected to roll in the police for the security lapse.         
	Senior officers visited the spot within an hour of the incident and spoke to office and household staff and driver Manzoor.        
	The BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal have held violent protests in Jammu and elsewhere in India on the Amarnath controversy.        
	Jammu and Kashmirs Congress government recently revoked a controversial order allotting land for makeshift camps to be built for Amarnath pilgrims. Soz isnt known to have been involved in the decision, and was probably targeted because he is a Muslim Congress leader from Kashmir.        
	The protesters dubbed Soz, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and the Peoples Democratic Party  which quit the state government to protest the delay in revocation of the allotment  the new Taliban.

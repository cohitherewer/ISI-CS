	Patna, Oct. 20: While demanding tough action against what he described as Raj Thackeray-led gang rebel raisers, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said he would talk to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh soon on the repeated assault on people from Hindi heartland in Maharashtra.        
	It is not necessary now to talk to Raj Thackeray and his unlawful outfit. It is the time for tough action against the elements who have been taking the Constitution to ransom, Nitish said on the sidelines of his janata durbar.        
	Nitish, who spoke to his Maharashtra counterpart Vilasrao Deshmukh yesterday, said: The Centre cannot stay mute spectator to the people being robbed of their constitutional rights in one of the states. The Centre will have to speak and act fast.        
	Nitish reiterated that the people of one state could go, settle and work in any other state. Empowered by the Constitution to land and work in any part of the country, the citizens do not need anyones permission to move out and work anywhere they wish, he said.        
	What was the fault of the candidates who had gone to Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra to appear in the Railway Recruitment Board examinations? Nitish asked, while himself furnishing the reply: Their only fault was they were born in the state other than Maharashtra.        
	CPI-ML (Liberation) today burnt the effigy of the Prime Minister for tolerating the outfits like Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. The party leaders demanded immediate ban on these outfits and arrest their leaders. The MNS activists yesterday invaded the candidates from the Hindi heartland who had been appearing in Railway Recruitment Board exams in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra.        
	The MNS launched assault on the candidates yesterday in a series of continuous attacks that the outfit has been carrying out against the people of Bihar and other parts of Hindi-speaking areas in Maharashtra for the past year.

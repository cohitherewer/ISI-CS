  - Management students shun plum job offers, choose to launch portal to guide retail investors        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           (From left) Satvik Upadhyaya, Neha Juneja and Ankit Mathur                                        
	New Delhi, March 11: Satvik Upadhyaya is no veteran market analyst, but the 23-year-old final-year student at IIM Ahmedabad is confident he can help investors wade carefully through the perilous waters of futures trading.         
	The next time the stock market crashes, Upadhyaya and three other young management and engineering students will sit down to prepare  within minutes  a strategy to help distraught investors get back on their feet. Free of cost.         
	Spurning attractive job offers from investment banks and consultancy firms, four students from top education institutes are starting their own website, where they will assist investors share experiences with each other.         
	Weve all been interested in trading for some time. But each time we wanted information online on futures trading, we struggled to find what we wanted. Thats when we decided to take the plunge, says Upadhyaya, now eagerly awaiting the April 1 launch of the website, aisapaisa.com.        
	The portal, the team claims, will be the first in India to offer free, up-to-date information on retail investment.         
	Neha Juneja, just completing her MBA from Delhis top B-school, the Faculty of Management Studies (FMS), rubbishes talk of experience  or the lack of it  working against the team.         
	I started trading while I was doing my undergraduate studies from the Delhi College of Engineering. Sure, we may not have the experience of the big names who speak on television, but we will also bring in a fresh perspective, she says.         
	The team, she says, has already consulted experts from market watchdog Sebi.         
	By October, we plan to offer our services in Hindi, and then in Gujarati as well, says Juneja, who turned down a Rs 17-lakh-a-year job offer from Tata Administrative Services.         
	The other members of the team are Ankit Mathur, who is also completing his course at IIM Ahmedabad, and Himanshu, from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.        
	Himanshu has, however, started working and is yet to inform his employers that he is quitting.         
	The major thrust of our website will be to encourage investors to share their experiences. That will be our USP. Existing market portals do not encourage such sharing enough, Juneja says.         
	Each of the members, Upadhyaya says, will put in a few lakhs of their own money as initial investment to start and maintain the portal.         
	The team has decided not to invite any advertisements on the portal.         
	Our visitors will be people struggling through market uncertainties. It will be a turn-off for them if they also have to wade through advertisements. Also, taking advertisements from listed companies would mean compromising on the objectivity of our information, Upadhyaya says.         
	Uncertainties in the market, however, do not appear to be affecting pay packets of young MBAs. The average salary offer for MBA students at the FMS went up from Rs 12.04 lakh to Rs 15.31 lakh a year, the institute has declared.         
	At IIM Kozhikode, which has also revealed placement details, final-year students were offered Rs 14.83 lakh a year on an average, a hike of 15 per cent over last year.

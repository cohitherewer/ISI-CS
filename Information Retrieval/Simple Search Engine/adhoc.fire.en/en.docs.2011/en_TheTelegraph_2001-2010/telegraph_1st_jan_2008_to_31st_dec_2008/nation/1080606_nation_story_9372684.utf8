          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 5: Two governors whose terms have ended are still in office as the Centre, stuck in the fuel price backlash, is yet to finalise new names.        
	Jammu and Kashmir governor Lt Gen S.K. Sinhas tenure ended on Wednesday. His Assam counterpart, Lt. Gen Ajai Singh, was to be in his post only till June 5-6 midnight.        
	Constitutionally, the President can allow them to continue even after their five-year tenure but such discretionary moves reflect poorly on those who finalise gubernatorial appointments.         
	Rashtrapati Bhavan sources said there was no word from the home ministry yet but there was a possibility that the entire list may come together.         
	The list could include new appointments in Maharashtra, where Goa governor S.C. Jamir is in charge.        
	Speculation about the new governors has grown with some names making the rounds. Former Rajasthan chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur and former CBI director P.C. Sharma are being mentioned as contenders for Assam.         
	In Jammu and Kashmir, the buzz is that N.N. Vohra, the Centres special envoy to the state, or former Union home secretary V.K. Duggal, could replace Sinha.         
	The appointment has assumed significance as polls in Jammu and Kashmir are due later this year. Rashtrapati Bhavan sources confirmed it wasnt the first time a governor was continuing beyond the mandated term.

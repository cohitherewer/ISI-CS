          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 8: Industrial development and ecology are at a stand off over the commercial use of water from the Brahmani river for a proposed steel hub at Duburi.         
	While the government has already assured the supply from Brahmani for the proposed plants, a catastrophe awaits Bhitarkanika Sanctuary  Asias second-largest concentration of mangrove forests  experts believe.         
	Proposed steel plants with a combined capacity of over 40MT have been reportedly assured water from the river. The plants would require all most all the water available.         
	According to the irrigation department sources, the total live storage capacity (LSC) of the Rengali Dam reservoir is 4400million-cubic-metre. The Rengali irrigation canals have a requirement of 3,450million-cubic-metre, while large PSU industrial users like SAIL, NTPC, Nalco and Mahanadi Coalfields have an estimated requirement of over 450million-cubic-metre.         
	The department officials admit there would be an additional pressure of over 400million-cubic-metre from Brahmani at Jokadia barrage, if the proposed plants go on stream in Duburi.         
	For every tonne of finished steel, an estimated 1-lakh-cubic-metre would be required.         
	Diversion of such huge volume of water, experts fear, would push Bhitarkanika mangroves on Orissas coast towards the same fate as the Sunderbans, after the Farakka Barrage. The Sunderbans were affected after the barrage was commissioned and the Sundari trees (a variety the mangrove was named after) started to disappear soon after.         
	A fall in water flow and the consequent shortage of fresh water downstream of Jokodia barrage (where drastic reduction in water availability has already been marked) will lead to changes in the water regime of Bhitarkanika mangroves, said B. Mohanty, secretary of Wildlife Society of Orissa.        
	The situation could be calamitous for the mangroves as fresh water brought from the Brahmani to Bhittarkanika mixes with sea water to produce brackish water ideal for the mangroves, he added.         
	Mangroves, growing in brackish water, are sensitive to changes in salinity  any change in freshwater flow increases saline ingression.        
	The rich mangroves in Bhittarkanika spread over 195sqkm have a high level of bio-diversity with 62 of the worlds 73 mangrove species.

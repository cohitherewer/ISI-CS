          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          John Kerry in Delhi. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: US Senator John Kerry today echoed Indias concern that Pakistans ISI and other elements might have had a hand in the Mumbai attacks and advocated tight control on the spy agency.         
	President-elect Barack Obamas personal emissary, however, sounded a note of caution over using the military option, saying it could have unintended consequences for Pakistans civilian government and the fight against terror.         
	At a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Kerry agreed with Delhis position that Pakistan must crack down on terrorists targeting India, sources said.         
	In the United States, our intelligence agency is obviously accountable, not just to the administration that runs it but also to the United States Congress and, through the Congress, to the people, Kerry told reporters after the meeting.         
	It is imperative that the intelligence service of Pakistan not be able to make its own choices or operate outside of the standards that we have a right to expect, he added.

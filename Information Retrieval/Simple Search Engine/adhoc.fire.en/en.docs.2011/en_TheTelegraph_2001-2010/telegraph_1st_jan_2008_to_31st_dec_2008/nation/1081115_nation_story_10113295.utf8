  - Day-long special session to ensure the right people are voted in         CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: When votes alone cannot ensure the right leaders, turn to God.         
	Thats what the Delhi Catholic archdiocese is doing with the Assembly elections off to a start today. It will hold a day-long prayer session tomorrow for what is being called the well-being of the polls.         
	The Prayer for Election will be led by Paul Dinakaran, the founder of the Jesus Call Group of Believers, with the patronage of heads of churches under the Delhi archdiocese.        
	We decided to facilitate a special day of prayer in view of the elections in six states in north India, said Father Dominic Emmanuel of the Delhi archdiocese.        
	The prayer session will be in four phases. In the first, people will pray for the right persons to be elected and a righteous leadership to be put in place by God in each state.        
	The second prayer would be for peaceful elections and unanimous results as per Gods choice.         
	The third will be for the prosperity of each state, that is going for elections, after the government is formed.         
	The last segment would be for peace to prevail among all people in each state and for the government and the political leaders to rule all people equally with love and concern.         
	The session will be held at the Delhi United Christian Senior Secondary School grounds. As many as 10,000 people are expected to participate.        
	We are inviting people belonging to all walks of life to attend the function. It is not just a Christian function. We will be praying for the well being of the entire country, Fr Dominic said.        
	He stressed that the programme had no political connection. We have not invited any political party particularly though politicians of all hues may participate in the function. We are open to all.         
	Fr Dominic said the Delhi archdiocese had conducted a similar prayer session for the 2004 general elections. Asked if the verdict then had turned out to be as expected, he said prayers are always answered.         
	We hope that the elections will turn out to be good this time as well, he added.

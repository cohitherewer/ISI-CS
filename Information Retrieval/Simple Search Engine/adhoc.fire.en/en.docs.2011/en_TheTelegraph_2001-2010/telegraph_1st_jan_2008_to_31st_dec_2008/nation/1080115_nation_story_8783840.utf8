     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Beijing, Jan. 14: The Indian foreign office is elated it has two major takeaways to show for the Prime Ministers visit here so far: a pledge to promote cooperation in civil nuclear energy and an understanding from China of Indias ambition to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
    
	A Shared Vision for the 21st Century  the joint statement from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Premier Wen Jiabao  shows there is now a maturity in our relationship, said foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon. 
    
	For a large part, the tone for the document was set by the happy experience of the first joint India-China army exercise in Kunming last month. As expected, the formal announcement that this year it will be the turn of China to send troops for a drill to be hosted by the Indian Army has been made in the document. 
    
	The India-China defence dialogue which also registered a first in November last year will be held in India this year. The statement said the confidence-building measures through steadily enhanced contacts in the field of defence will be implemented. 
    
	On both cooperation in civilian nuclear energy and the UNSC, Indian officials say there have been incremental changes. China has not committed to supporting Indias membership of the UNSC. But it recognised the Indian aspiration. Menon said this has been put down in writing for the first time. 
    
	The two sides support comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including giving priority to increasing the representation of developing countries in the Security Council, the document noted. The Indian side reiterates its aspirations for permanent membership of the UNSC. The Chinese side attaches great importance to Indias position as a major developing country in international affairs. The Chinese side understands and supports Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the UN, including in the Security Council, it read. 
    
	Menon said Chinas positive nod to civilian nuclear cooperation was not taken as an indication of its support in the Nuclear Suppliers Group to the India-US 123 Agreement. But India has not yet asked for support. Today I am satisfied. We are not asking the question (of support for the 123 Agreement) yet, said Menon. 
    
	That would be done when the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency is concluded. Talks are due in Vienna on Wednesday. Asked whether the question of going to the NSG should be qualified with an if or a when  because the safeguards agreement has to be vetted by the Left  Menon replied that depends on your attitude. 
    
	On civilian nuclear cooperation, the document notes: As two countries with advanced scientific capabilities, the two sides pledge to promote bilateral cooperation in civil nuclear energy, consistent with their respective international commitments, which will contribute to energy security and to dealing with risks associated with climate change.

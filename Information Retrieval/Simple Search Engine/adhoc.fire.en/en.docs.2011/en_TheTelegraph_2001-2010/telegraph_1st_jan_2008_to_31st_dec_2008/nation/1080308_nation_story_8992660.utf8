          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 7: It is 27 years since Roshan Jahan (60) has been fighting for her rights. But her battle is far from over.        
	The widow of headmaster Roshan Mohammad, who taught in a government-aided English-medium middle school, is fighting legal battle since he died 27 years ago. Mohammad was the headmaster of Mahasinghpur School near Salipur in Cuttack when he died in 1981.        
	After his death, his widow and minor son were told that the family was being refused their rightful pension by the then district inspector of schools. Virtually reduced to starvation, Rosan Jahan knocked at the high courts door. In 1998, a two-judge bench of Justice S.N. Phukan and Justice C.R. Pal issued direction to the government to take immediate steps and pay the widow her due within three months time. However, even after submitting necessary papers and duplicate service book, Rosan Jahan was not paid a single penny.         
	She was forced to move the high court again in 2004 and the high court came down heavily on the administration for their delay.         
	In May 2004, a single-bench of Justice A.S. Naidu issued fresh orders asking the state to act within three months time.        
	But four years on, the plight of the widow is far from over.         
	My department has not received any order for the implementation of the high court directive from higher-ups, district inspector of schools Surendranath Barik told The Telegraph today.        
	I am aware of the case. But I can do little apart from seeking fresh clarification from the administration and act accordingly. As it seems from the previous files, her application was rejected by the then DI on grounds that the government had withdrawn the pension scheme in 1981, Barik said.         
	But Roshan Jahan has not given up yet.         
	I will move the court again. Lawyers have advised me to file a contempt petition this time, she said.        
	When my son became a major in 1988 I asked the authorities to at least grant him a job on compassionate grounds. Even that relief was not granted despite the collector referring his name, she rued.         
	In 2000, the mother adds, the district education officer had referred her son Mohammad Asif Rabanis name for a job. The collector had agreed as well.

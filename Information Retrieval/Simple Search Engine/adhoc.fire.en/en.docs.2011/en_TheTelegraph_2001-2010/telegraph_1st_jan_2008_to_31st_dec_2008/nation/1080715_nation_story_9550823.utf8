          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti and BJP activists protest against the revocation of the land transfer order outside Raj Bhavan in Jammu on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, July 14: The Amarnath pilgrim rush has hit a record high despite the trouble over the temple land transfer.        
	The number of pilgrims this year has hit an all-time high and we still have a month to go, said Madan Mantoo, public relations director on the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board.         
	Around 4.7 lakh pilgrims have visited the cave since the two-month yatra began on June 17, with temple officials saying the figure is set to cross the five-lakh mark.        
	Only 3.11 lakh had a darshan of the Shiv lingam last year while 3.02 lakh visited it in 2006. In 2004 and 2005, the number was around four lakh each, a record, Mantoo said.        
	Officials said the rush was unprecedented in the first week and though the numbers thinned after the agitation over the land transfer began in the Valley on June 22, tens of thousands visited the cave during and after the agitation, another officer overseeing the yatra said.        
	The row began after the government allotted 40 hectares to the shrine at Bal tal, sparking protests that continued for 10 days and left seven dead and hundreds injured.         
	Under pressure, the allotment was cancelled, which quelled the trouble in the Valley but triggered clashes in Jammu, where one person lost his life in a militant attack and hundreds were injured in clashes. The Peoples Democratic Party withdrew support to the Congress-led regime, forcing central rule to be clamped eventually.        
	Despite these protests, there were only a couple of attacks on pilgrims, none of them serious, the officer said.        
	The Action Committee Against Land Transfer, which comprises separatists, traders, lawyers and other civil society groups spearheading the agitation, made repeated requests not to target pilgrims. This offered the visitors reassurance that the Valley was safe for them.        
	Our agitation never targeted the pilgrimage. In fact, local Muslims were organising the Yatra until a few years back and, during a snowstorm in 2000, the pilgrims were rescued by residents, said Nazir Ahmad Dar, vice-president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, which has been at the forefront of the land protests.

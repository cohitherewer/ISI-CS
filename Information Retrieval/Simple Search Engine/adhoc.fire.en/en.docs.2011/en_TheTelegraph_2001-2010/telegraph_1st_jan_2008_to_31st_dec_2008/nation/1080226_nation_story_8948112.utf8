	New Delhi, Feb. 25: A woman who told the Supreme Court she had brought false rape charges against her father 20 years ago, when she was 14, will be prosecuted for perjury.        
	But her father Asha Ram, 77, will not be freed from life imprisonment with the court rejecting the womans latest affidavit as a violent afterthought to bail him out.        
	A bench today dismissed Rams review petition, which contained the daughters affidavit, and asked a Shimla court to start perjury proceedings against the now-married woman. Conviction can bring her up to seven years in jail.        
	One of the statements (the rape charge or the retraction) is wrong. This is serious. She will have to face perjury charges, the court said.        
	The womans affidavit said her mother and the local police had forced her with threats to frame Ram. Her parents, who lived in Himachal Pradesh, were estranged.        
	The case was falsely lodged against him and I also deposed against my father in the court of the additional sessions judge, Shimla, at the instance of my mother and police, the affidavit said. If I did not depose so then my mother would have harmed me along with the police.        
	Ram was convicted of the alleged rape  said to have taken place on the night of August 23-24, 1988  and sentenced to a five-year term with a fine of Rs 1,000.        
	But on appeal, the high court acquitted him, prompting the state to challenge the judgment in the apex court. On November 17, 2005, a two-judge apex court bench upheld the trial courts verdict, relying entirely on the daughters statement.        
	It increased the punishment to life imprisonment and fined Ram Rs 25,000.        
	Five days later, Ram filed his review petition together with the affidavit by his daughter, who said she was not at her fathers home on the night of the alleged rape.        
	Japanese tourist        
	A Japanese tourist today accused a hotel employee in Jaipur of rape but her refusal to get a medical test done has tied polices hands.         
	The woman, around 35 years old, lodged an FIR at a police station. When she was taken to a magistrate, she told him the employee had stolen her mobile phone but kept quiet about the rape charge, the police said.

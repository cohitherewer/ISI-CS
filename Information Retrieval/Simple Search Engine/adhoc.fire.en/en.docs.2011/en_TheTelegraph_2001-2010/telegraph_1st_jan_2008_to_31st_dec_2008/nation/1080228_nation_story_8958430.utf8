The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Misa dole, but not for Lalu
                                                                                                               Misa dole, but not for Lalu
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Misa: Name not enough for dad                                  
	Bhopal, Feb. 27: Lalu Prasad has missed a monthly pension of Rs 6,000 because he belongs to the wrong state.        
	BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh today decided to grant the pension to 4,000-odd people arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (Misa) during the Emergency.         
	The railway minister, too, was detained under the law  and even named his eldest daughter Misa after it.         
	But he is from Bihar and therefore not eligible for either the dole or the free health check-ups  finance minister Raghavji said the detainees would also be entitled to medical facilities on a par with freedom fighters.         
	Even if he were eligible, Lalu Prasad might have found it awkward to claim the pension now that he is on the same side as the Congress.        
	Most of the beneficiaries here belong to the BJP. Raghavji, who presented the election-year budget in which the pension was announced, was himself a detainee. Yes, me and more than half of my cabinet colleagues will receive this honorarium, he said.        
	The BJPs Misa bonus will also benefit some leaders of the radical Jamaat-e-Islami and the CPM.        
	Yes, why not? Jamaat leaders, too, had fought for freedom of expression and democracy. I remember 45 such colleagues, said commercial tax minister Babulal Gaur.        
	Raghavji, who described the detainees as freedom fighters, said the Loknayak Jai Prakash Samman Nidhi would cost over Rs 2 crore.         
	While those who had spent over six months in jail would get Rs 6,000, detainees held for three to six months would get Rs 3,000 a month, he said.        
	Congress general secretary and MLA Digvijay Singh objected to the measure. Many Misa detainees were criminals, pickpockets, hoarders and those who had compromised with the Defence of India Rules (DIR), he said. How will the MP government distinguish between genuine political activists and criminals?         
	Local BJP leader Raj Kishore replied that Misa was used exclusively against the political class and demanded free train and bus travel, too.        
	The Shivraj Singh Chauhan regimes step should win the approval of L.K. Advani, who was among the hundreds of Opposition leaders imprisoned after the Emergency was declared in June 1975.         
	Perks for Misa detainees have been on the agenda of other parties, too, but no one has been as generous. In 2006, then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had announced a monthly dole of Rs 500 and free bus and train travel. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has promised pension but not acted yet.        
	Digvijay said the move might be short-lived. Elections are due in November, he said, hinting the scheme would be scrapped if the Congress won.        
	The budget has also reduced taxes on products used in daily puja, such as offerings, religious photos, frames, camphor and anything that uses cow urine. Religious wristbands and kirpans have also been exempted from VAT. Raghavji said all this would cost the exchequer Rs 1.82 crore.

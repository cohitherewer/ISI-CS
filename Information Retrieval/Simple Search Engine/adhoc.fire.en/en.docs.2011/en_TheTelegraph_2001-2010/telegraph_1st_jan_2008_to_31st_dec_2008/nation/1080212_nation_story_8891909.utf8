The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	MCD plans record increase in kitty    
	The MCD wants to give councillors more cash for development but the planned hike could leave MPs green with envy.    
	The proposal is to almost double the kitty to Rs 1 crore. The MCD had contemplated the hike earlier but an increase in the number of wards, from 134 to 272, nixed the idea.    
	In the last budget, we had allocated Rs 134 crore for the hike. But with the increase in the number of wards, the money had to be shared by more councillors, Vijender Gupta, chairman of the civic bodys standing committee, said.     
	The MCD is flush with funds from a string of successful public-private partnerships. We earned more from advertisements and hoardings in parking lots, an official said.     
	But the plan is unlikely to be accepted easily. MPs receive Rs 2 crore under the local area development scheme - twice the amount proposed for the councillors. There is a difference, though in the constituency sizes. Delhi, for instance, has only seven MPs compared with 272 councillors.        
	Cash props for Metro plan    
	Chennais planned Metro, modelled on the one in Delhi, has hit the fast track with a key Japanese lender committing funds for the elevated and underground rail system.    
	The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will not only provide loans but will back the money with technical knowhow on the best way to set up the transport project.    
	Tetsuo Shioguchi, the banks senior executive director, told local administration minister M.K. Stalin during a recent meeting about Tokyos version of the Metro.    
	The discussions were followed by a visit to Japan by Stalin, Chennai Metro Rail chairman Syed Munir Hoda and MD T. V. Somanathan. The aim was to study the functioning of the Tokyo rail system and draw lessons about building the Rs 9,700-crore project back home.    
	Big Mac at Delhi station    
	Fancy a burger and French fries while waiting for a train, Big Mac will be right there.    
	McDonalds will open an outlet at the old Delhi station, one of the countrys busiest, after a successful bidding race that raised its hopes of setting up shop at other rail hubs.    
	We are talking to the railways but we are aware that these things (approvals) take time, said managing director of McDonalds India franchisee (north and east) Vikram Bakshi.    
	The US fast food chain that runs over 32,000 outlets worldwide is also looking at catering in trains but for the plan to roll, it would need to set up base kitchens at stations first.     
	We require a fairly large kitchen with lots of facilities, Bakshi said. The focus now will be on establishing outlets at stations which, the company reckons, can also serve as base kitchen for the service in trains. Railway authorities say having chains like Big Mac will ensure quality food for passengers. It will also bring the railways extra revenues from letting out space.         
	Pep-up pill    
	An energiser is in store for hospitals run by Mumbais civic body.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai plans to upgrade facilities at its hospitals, with commissioner Jairaj Phatak saying the civic bodys 2008-09 budget had set aside more funds for the spruce-up.    
	he King Edward Memorial Hospital, in central Mumbai, and Andheris Cooper Hospital are among those on the list. Edward alone will be given Rs 33 crore to improve facilities. A 215-bed hospital is planned in Jogeshwari.

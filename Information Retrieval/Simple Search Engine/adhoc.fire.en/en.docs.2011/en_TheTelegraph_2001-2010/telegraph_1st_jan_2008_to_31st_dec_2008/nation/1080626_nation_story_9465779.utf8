          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, June 25: An aspiring chartered accountant was knocked off a motorcycle and run over by a speeding minibus near Victoria Memorial this evening.        
	Ivy Roy, who was wearing a helmet, was on her way home to Lake View Park in Bon Hooghly from work in Taratala when the bus hit the bike she was pillion-riding on.        
	Police said the buss rear wheel went over the 24-year-olds abdomen. Strangely, the police said there were no eyewitnesses to the 7pm accident on Hospital Road who could jot down the number of the bus as it sped away.        
	Colleague Tarun Kumar Das, 40, who was driving the bike and escaped with minor bruises, raised the alarm, drawing the policemen nearby. The girl was rushed to SSKM Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries, an officer said.         
	The police blamed possible overtaking for the accident. It seems the minibus driver tried to overtake the motorcycle and knocked down Roy. We are trying to locate the bus, said an official of Hastings police station.         
	Ivy worked for chartered accountancy firm Roy and Chaudhury Associates and was due to appear for her CA final in May next year. She was part of the team overseeing the financial operations of an electronics firm in Taratala. Das worked as a senior accountant there.        
	Ivys family declined to speak when contacted tonight but colleagues described her as a bright professional.         
	She was a very promising hand of the CA firm and, though she was not our employee, she was more than that. For the past year and a half, she led the efforts to install and operate the SAP (business applications) software, said S.B. Chandra, owner of the Taratala-based company.

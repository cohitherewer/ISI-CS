                                                                                                               Rahul in forest fight
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Ijurpa (Kalahandi), March 7: The sleepy village of Ijurpa, in the foothills of Niyamgiri, was bustling today as hundreds of Dangaria Kandha tribals came out to greet the mahapuru (demi-god) who would save their forests.        
	The mahapuru  Congress MP Rahul Gandhi  came to Ijurpa, 600km from Bhubaneswar, after starting his Orissa tour from Sinapali, which his father Rajiv Gandhi had visited in 1985.        
	Jitu Jakasika, a college student who interacted with Rahul, said: We explained how Vedanta Alumina would affect the bio-diversity of Niyamgiri. The survival of 25,000 primitive Dangaria Kandhas would be at stake. Rahulji said he was with us.         
	Later, at a rally, Rahul called himself a soldier in the struggle to save forests.

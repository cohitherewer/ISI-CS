                                                                                                               Drop in rebel count: Cops
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           On guard                                  
	Srinagar, March 17: Police claim the militant strength in Kashmir is at an all-time low, with the numbers falling below 500 for the first time in 18 years since the violence broke out.        
	Around 350 militants, including 120 foreigners, are present in the Valley, according to police intelligence reports.        
	The number was around 600 at this time last year, said Ashkoor Wani, senior superintendent of police, counter-insurgency.         
	As of now, we have around 500 listed militants in the Valley. But our investigations show that 70 of them have been counted twice and another 80 are not present here at all.         
	These militants belong to six outfits, including the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Al Badr, Harkat-ul-Jehad Islami and the Kashmir Revolutionary Front. The revolutionary front includes small groups like the Save Kashmir Movement and Al Nasireen.         
	The Hizb continues to be the strongest group with 170 militants, followed by the Lashkar with 120.         
	Wani said the number in Jammu could be roughly the same as in Kashmir.         
	Although the army agrees that militant numbers have fallen significantly, its figures are different. Defence spokesman Colonel Goswami said the militant number in Jammu was around 800, with most of them concentrated in the south of the Pir Panchal mountains. They include 150 foreigners, he said.         
	Last week, the armys new corps commander, Lt General Mukesh Sabarwal, said 500 to 600 militants were active in Kashmir. It is too early to say that militancy has ended here. The militant infrastructure on the other side of the LoC is intact, he said.         
	The year 2007 saw a considerable drop in violence, with the number of deaths declining to a three-digit figure for the first time since insurgency began, the police said.         
	From 1,181 in 2006, violence-related deaths came down to 770 last year, the police added. The victims included 166 civilians, 122 security force personnel and over 460 militants.         
	A police official claimed that 33 militants, mostly from the Hizb, had been killed in the first two months of this year.         
	Last November, Nissar Ahmad Bhat alias Gazi Misbah-ud-din, who was heading the Hizb for around three years, was arrested from Srinagar. This was followed by the death of the groups financial head and several divisional and district commanders.         
	The police credit this to effective counter-insurgency operations and intelligence inputs. Of course, the situation in Pakistan has come in handy as it brought down the morale of the militants, a senior officer said.         
	Security forces are keeping their fingers crossed, fearing that infiltration might again rise in the coming months.

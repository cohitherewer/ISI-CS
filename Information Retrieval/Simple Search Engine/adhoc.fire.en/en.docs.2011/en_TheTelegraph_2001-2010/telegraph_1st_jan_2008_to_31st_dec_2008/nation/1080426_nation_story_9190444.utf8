	New Delhi, April 25 (PTI): A Delhi traffic police constable was today sacked for raping an 11-year-old in a moving car.        
	Sanjeev Kumar was arrested along with property dealer Naresh Kumar yesterday. The constable had dragged the child into the car, where both the men had raped her.        
	Police said Sanjeev had confessed to the crime. Charges of kidnapping and rape have been pressed against him.         
	Residents of the Outer Delhi neighbourhood, from where the girl was abducted, set fire to the car.        
	This was the second instance of a minor being raped in a moving car in Delhi this month.        
	The parliamentary committee on womens empowerment today summoned Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal and sought a detailed report within a week on recent cases of crime against women.        
	Congress MP Krishna Tirath, who heads the committee, said it has asked Delhi police to take several steps, including giving clear instructions to station house officers on how to handle such cases and setting up womens police posts.        
	Sanjeev and Naresh were produced before metropolitan magistrate D.K. Jangala who sent them to judicial custody till May 9.

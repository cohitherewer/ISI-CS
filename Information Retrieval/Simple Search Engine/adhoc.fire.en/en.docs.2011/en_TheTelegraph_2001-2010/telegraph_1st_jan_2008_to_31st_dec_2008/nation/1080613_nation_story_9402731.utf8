          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, June 12: The Union cabinet today decided to grant Rs 3.5 lakh as compensation to kin of 844 persons killed in the 1989 Bhagalpur (Bihar) riot.        
	Todays cabinet decision brought a parity in the relief and rehabilitation package adopted by the country for the victims of the 1984 anti- Sikh riot and those of the Bhagalpur riot, which Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had demanded two-and-a-half years ago.        
	Nitish Kumar welcomed the cabinet move, but described it as a belated one. I welcome the decision even if it is a belated one. Delayed justice is better than no justice, he told The Telegraph.        
	Nitish recalled that Justice N.N. Singh Commission had recommended life-long pension to the dependents of the victims of the Bhagalpur riot. Abiding by the commissions recommendation, the Bihar government had been paying Rs 2,000 per month since September, 2007 as pension to the kin of those who lost their lives in the worst-ever riot in the state ever.         
	In February, 2006 I wrote to the Centre asking it to provide a R amp;R package similar to those being granted to victims and kin of the 1984 riot. I persistently kept following my request for some two-and-a-half years, he added.        
	The Union cabinet has also decided to pay compensation (of Rs 2.25 lakh) to 22 persons injured in the 1989 riot that had erupted between two religious communities in course of a religious celebration. The Union cabinet clarified that the relief in case of the deceased would be in addition to the amount that has been already paid by the Bihar government, while for those injured, it would be inclusive of the relief already received.         
	The riot had changed the course of Indias political history by alienating the minority community from the Congress at the Centre, Bihar and most of Indian states.         
	In the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls that followed in 1989 and 1990, the Congress was routed from the Centre as well as from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and some other states in the Hindi heartland.         
	Lalu Prasad and regional parties became favourite of the minority community.        
	The resurgent BJP then virtually helped the regional parties strengthen their clout among the minority community at a time when the Congress was on a wane in the Hindi heartland by taking out a yatra (rally) and Ram Mandir movement.

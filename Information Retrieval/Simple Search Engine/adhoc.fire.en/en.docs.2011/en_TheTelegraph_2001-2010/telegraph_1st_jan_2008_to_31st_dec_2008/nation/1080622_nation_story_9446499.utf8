	Hyderabad gets closer to Metro    
	Hyderabad has moved a step closer to its Metro dream.    
	The state cabinet recently cleared a bill to implement the Rs 9,696-crore project expected to be completed by 2011.    
	If the bill sails through the Assembly, the state will take up the plan in municipal areas as government projects or public-private partnerships. Until the legislation is passed in the next House session, an ordinance will be promulgated to give its provisions legal teeth for now.    
	Financial bids for the 71km project, spread across three routes, will open on July 4. Of the total cost, the Centre and the state will pay 40 per cent as grants. The rest will come from the developer on a build-operate-transfer basis. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 1,939 crore, about 20 per cent of the project cost, to meet possible cash shortfalls.     
	Modelled on the trains in Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, the project will have 66 stations spread across the three high-density corridors in the city. All coaches will be air-conditioned. The elevated stations will have escalators.        
	Warm-up for youth games    
	Bangalore is warming up for a new sports spectacle next month.    
	The city will host the first-ever National Youth Games from July 22 to 29, an event meant only for those under 18. Around 6,000 athletes from across the country will take part.     
	The BJP government in Karnataka, which came to power last month, is doing all it can to ensure the event gains popularity. Minister for sports and youth services, Gulihatti Shekar, said contests would be held in 24 disciplines.    
	The winners would have a chance of participating in the Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in Pune in September and the Youth Olympics in Singapore in 2010, officials said.     
	Amar Kumar Panday, secretary of the government organising committee, said there would be synthetic tracks for field events.    
	Intruder alarm    
	The Congresss local boss might be too famous for his own safety.    
	Two men were arrested recently for sneaking into the residence of M. Krishnaswamy in a break-in that left several police officers and political leaders baffled.    
	Radhakrishnan, 43, and Balakrishnan 45 had made their way in posing as police officers and relatives of Krishnaswamy.    
	Once they had entered the place, the duo approached Krishnaswamys wife and requested her to give them some money, saying they were suffering from health problems.    
	As the two tried wheedling the cash out of the lady, Krishnaswamys son Vishnuprasad happened to return home. Having heard their sob story, he immediately realised they were trying to pull a fast one on the family. The duo were kept in the house and handed over to the police.    
	The incident has set off alarm bells for the family of the leader, coming as it did after an attack on him and his supporters by an unidentified gang a couple of months back. (PTI)        
	Outbreak shield    
	Mumbai is being promised a disease-free monsoon this time.    
	The Maharashtra health directorate said recently the city and the rest of the state were ready to combat rain-related outbreaks. Control rooms have been set up in the city and the districts.     
	We have identified 21 medicines and ensured they reach all centres, said Dr Suhas Ranade of the health directorate. The control rooms will report monsoon-related health problems, from minor ailments like fever to larger threats like epidemics, to the headquarters daily.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, May 16: The BSF will move an additional 1,000 troops to the international border in Jammu and Kashmir to foil infiltration attempts by militants such as that in the Samba sector of Jammu last week.        
	A dozen-odd militants are believed to have crossed the border into India in Samba on May 9, while Pakistani Rangers allegedly offered covering fire.         
	The BSF had earlier claimed that they had foiled the infiltration bid, but two encounters in Samba days later left nine persons, including three militants, dead and virtually invalidated the BSFs success story.         
	BSF director-general A.K. Mitra, on his first visit to Jammu after the encounters, today said 1,000 men were being rushed to the border in the Samba sector to strengthen security there.

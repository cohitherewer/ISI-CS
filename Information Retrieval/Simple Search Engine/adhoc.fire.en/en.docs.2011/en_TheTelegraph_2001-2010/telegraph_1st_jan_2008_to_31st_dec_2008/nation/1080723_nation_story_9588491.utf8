          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Shibu Soren in Parliament. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: Todays scenes of MPs waving wads of cash in Parliament were a first, but this is not the first time that a government has been accused of bribery to win a trust vote.        
	In 1993, however, the allegedly bribed members were charged with having actually voted for the P.V. Narasimha Rao ministry, so they would have had no incentive for theatrics in any case. Nor were Lok Sabha proceedings beamed live to every home.        
	That year, too, it was a septuagenarian Congress Prime Minister whose fate was on balance. Rao, who then had Manmohan Singh as finance minister, won by 14 votes.        
	The charge of handing a Rs 50-lakh bribe each to 10 MPs  four from Shibu Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and six from the breakaway Lok Dal  came much later and never stuck.        
	Rao and senior cabinet colleague Buta Singh were convicted by a trial court in September 2000 and handed three-year terms, but the high court acquitted them in March 2002 for lack of evidence.                
	Some of the tainted MPs were said to have deposited the alleged bribes in a nationalised bank and thus left a paper trail, but no links could be proved between the money and the voting.        
	Although Rao and Buta, the alleged bribe givers, faced trial, the supposed bribe takers did not  with one exception. A Supreme Court judgment of April 1998 explains why.        
	Moved for clarification about parliamentary immunity while the Rao-Buta trial was on, the apex court made two points.         
	One, the immunity applies to MPs actions (including speeches, comment and voting) in the House but does not extend to what they do outside.        
	Two, bribe-taking MPs, if any, enjoyed the immunity since their purported action of accepting the money was linked to the way they voted in the House.        
	Of those accused as bribe takers, only Ajit Singh faced trial, ironically because he did not vote despite allegedly taking the money. He, too, was acquitted for lack of evidence.        
	The CBI never appealed against any of the acquittals.        
	Former law minister Shanti Bhushan today said it was time the apex court re-assessed its verdict on the immunity enjoyed by alleged bribe takers. That judgment was absolutely absurd.         
	He dismissed todays drama as a political stunt, saying: It is well known that in politics, various inducements are made. But no one gets or takes money so openly.         
	Bhushan added: Waving of notes (inside Parliament) is highly improper, but it is not an offence. The members could claim they brought it to the House as evidence.        
	The former law minister said the BJP should have complained in writing to the Speaker, giving the names of the alleged bribe givers, and then furnished the money as evidence. But he agreed that the matter called for an inquiry.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Pranabs wife Anupama. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Nov. 18: A senior manager of a Bata factory was gunned down in his car, apparently because of a rivalry among colleagues over a canteen contract.         
	The wife of the manager has filed an FIR against the general manager.        
	Pranav Kumar Singh, 45, was driving a Maruti car home when four persons on two motorbikes pulled up near the car and pumped bullets into his chest, senior SP, Patna, Amit Kumar said.         
	Another manager, Anil Kumar, who was in the passenger seat, was unhurt.        
	It appears to be a planned murder executed by contract killers, Amit said.        
	Contractors perceived to be close to some colleagues had been vying for a factory canteen project, police sources said. Pranav may not have been in favour of the contractors who were hand in glove with other officials, they said.         
	We suspect that the murder was linked to the dispute among the officials and contractors in the factory. We are investigating it, the SP said.         
	Pranavs wife Anupama today lodged an FIR naming Jai Prakash, the Patna general manager of Bata India Limited, in connection with the murder. She also named some Bata employee union leaders in the FIR.        
	Anupama, 40, told The Telegraph: Jai Prakash was responsible for the murder of my husband.        
	Jai Prakash could not be contacted. Bata officials refused to comment.         
	The police said Pranavs Maruti was following another car carrying some Bata officials. He reportedly overtook that car and then stopped near a Sai Baba temple around 8pm to wait for it to catch up. At this point, the assailants pulled up, shot Pranav and fled. Pranav died on the spot.        
	Anil said: The killers shot Pranav from close range before my eyes. My mind became blank and I was terrified by the suddenness of the event.         
	The police took the victim to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.         
	Additional forces have been deployed around the Bata factory and Pranavs house.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    (From top) McConnell, Kerry and Negroponte: Security visit				                                 
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Three high-profile American visitors, including Barack Obamas personal emissary John Kerry, are set to fly to India as Delhi weighs on Condoleezza Rices advice to improve internal security.        
	While India is pulling out all stops to exert international pressure on Pakistan for meaningful and concrete action in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks, sources said Rice held substantial discussions on improving security within the country to avert a repeat.         
	The US secretary of state spoke at length about improving homeland security, intelligence gathering and tracing the sources of terrorist funding in her official-level meetings. She talked about preventing such attacks in the future, how the US had not had a terror strike since 9/11, and how they hunt down the men, plots and funding for such strikes, a source said.         
	Since then, the UPA has drawn up plans to equip coast guards, commandos and police forces better and improve intelligence gathering, the sources said. The Centre also proposes to set up a federal investigative agency.         
	Senator Kerry is expected to arrive in Delhi on Sunday to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Kerry is set to take over as chairman of the US senate foreign relations committee. His visit signals the importance President-elect Obama gives to Indias concerns on terrorism from across the border, the sources said.         
	US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte, who is flying to Islamabad this Friday, is slated to visit India too, as the Bush administration piles pressure on Pakistan to act on non-state actors using its territory to perpetrate terror.         
	The head of the US directorate of national intelligence, Mike McConnell, is also expected here next week. He will discuss ways to strengthen intelligence systems in India.

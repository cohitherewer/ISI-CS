          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The BJP today said a wrong Nehruvian vision had prevented Kashmirs complete integration into India and asked the country to be prepared for cruel decisions to find a permanent solution.        
	Senior leader Arun Jaitley claimed Jammu and Kashmirs special status was being exploited to take the state towards separation and that the Centres ability to keep the nation together had become suspect.        
	He, however, added that the global mood had changed after the 9/11 terror attacks on America and that separatists and militants would find it impossible now to get anything through violence. The age of redrawing political boundaries is over, he said.        
	Jaitley criticised Kashmirs mainstream parties for backing the separatist protests and claimed that a theocratic environment now prevailed in the Valley.        
	The BJP leader alleged Jammu had been neglected for years while Kashmir was mollycoddled. He advocated tough measures against the Valley protesters this time, mentioning that they had been raising Pakistani flags, but backed the armys soft approach towards the nationalist Amarnath agitators.        
	He asked the government to go by a 2005 high court order upholding the now-revoked land allotment to the Amarnath shrine board. The government should abide by the high court order, transfer the land allotted to the Amarnath shrine board and then deal with the separatists. The whole country will speak in one voice against the separatists, Jaitley said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More buses on rebel routes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     More buses on rebel routes

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 11: Orissa and Andhra Pradesh today entered into an agreement formalising running of inter-state buses on 72 routes with most of them touching rebel-hit areas in the twin states.        
	According to the agreement inked by Orissa transport minister Jayanarayan Mishra and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart K. Laxminarayan, the government-run buses from either state would cover 10,400km. The long-standing process since 1981 is historic and will benefit people of both the states, said Mishra.        
	From now onwards, 38 long-distance buses from Orissa would operate on nine routes between the states, while 72 short-distance buses from Andhra Pradesh would run on 17 routes.        
	The officials have also mutually agreed upon the non-restriction of goods carriage, educational carriage, health carriage and facility carriages while allowing them a free permit. Besides, a parking space for the buses would be allowed in Koraput for the Andra Pradesh buses and similarly the Orissa buses can use space in Vizianagaram. Also the additional tax paid by Orissa in terms of non-approved route to Andhra Pradesh after 2007 would be refunded by the latter, the agreement stated.        
	The Orissa transport commissioner has proposed some more routes which will be discussed and operated later, said Laxminarayan.        
	This would also make accessible the southern Orissa with the north coastal and northwest of Andhra Pradesh serving some of the extremely backward routes of the state. Several sensitive and Naxalite-hit areas will be connected that have poor bus services from Orissa, said Suresh Mohapatra, the transport secretary. Earlier, with fewer buses plying on the road, government officials visits to Maoist areas were risky. With more number of vehicles plying through the area, the risk will be less, he added.

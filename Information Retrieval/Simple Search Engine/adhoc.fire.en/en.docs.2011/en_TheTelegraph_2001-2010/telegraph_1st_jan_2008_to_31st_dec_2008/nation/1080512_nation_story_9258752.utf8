	Ramdev does a Bush on food talk    
	US President George W. Bushs assertion that Indians are eating more than usual has found an unlikely supporter in Baba Ramdev.     
	The yoga guru, who is in Hyderabad for his annual yoga classes, said that an average Indian middle-class family consumed a minimum seven-course dinner or lunch, besides a breakfast and an evening snack.     
	Indian families overspend on food rather than on health needs, he said, while addressing a news conference.     
	He said Bush was right in his comments on the eating habits of Indians. My concern is not just the overeating but also over wastage of food, said Ramdev. Whatever George Bush said about Indias large middle class is true. The rising income levels of the Indian middle class is leading to more consumption of food. In fact, Indians are not just eating more, they are destroying their health.    
	Ramdev said the uproar created by political parties over the US Presidents remarks was just cheap politics.           
	Gawli gets a taste of fear  
	He once ran a reign of terror. But the tables have now been turned on Arun Gawli.    
	The gangster, lodged in the lockup of the Mumbai police headquarters at Crawford market, is so scared that he gets his food tested for poisoning.    
	This despite Gawli being sent all his meals by his family from his home in Dagdi Chawl.     
	Gawli has been in police custody since April 29 when he was booked in connection with an extortion case.     
	Mumbai joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria says the police have made a special provision for Gawli, who thinks the Dawood Ibrahim gang is out to get him.    
	The don-turned-politician is alleged to have ordered the murder of many a Dawood henchman, including his brother-in-law Ibrahim Parkar.    
	The food-taster is always the man who brings in the food  a servant of the Gawli family.    
	Two hours before 7.30pm  the designated dinner time  Gawlis errand boy brings the food in a carrier and tastes it before a policeman. He then waits at the police station for two hours, till the police and the gangster are convinced there are no signs of poisoning.       
	Street stuff, but healthy  
	Next year, you might be able to gorge on golgappas in peace, without bothering about hygiene.    
	A scheme to upgrade quality of street food across the country by 2008-09 is in the pipeline.    
	The government has planned to upgrade hygiene and quality of food in 10 streets, one each in cities of tourist importance, during the first two years of 11th five-year plan period, minister of state for food processing industries Subodh Kant Sahai said.    
	The minister said that the cities are to be selected in consultation with the ministry of tourism and state governments.     
	The scheme, which is awaiting final approval, is to be implemented through urban local bodies.

	Thieves at party  
	A gang of thieves recently sneaked into a wedding, dressed as guests, and stole Rs 3,465 of the moi panam (cash gift) from the drawer of a table.     
	All of them, including two women, were dressed in wedding finery. They also had dinner before going for the kill.    
	The gang went to the table where the grooms relatives had gathered. While one of them pretended to gift a Rs 500 note to the couple, the rest removed the cash from the drawer.     
	The person who was counting the money later realised it was Rs 3,465 short. But the gang had just left.     
	The man, however, managed to catch the number of the car in which they were fleeing. In no time, the party was over the wedding crashers. The car was intercepted and the five taken in custody. PTI

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Raja Acharya		    
	Bhubaneswar, May 14: Album starlet Bidusmita Mantri today filed an FIR against gangster Raja Acharya at the Mahila police station here.         
	The actress demanded an investigation into the nude MMS clipping Raja claimed to have in possession.         
	I want an inquiry into the MMS matter. The statement that Raja made to the media was false and if it has any truth, let the police investigate it, she said.         
	The actress reportedly received a threat call from an unknown number last night while she was at her Kendrapada residence.         
	The unidentified caller threatened her not to come to Bhubaneswar.         
	He threatened to wipe out my family if I reached Bhubaneswar. I am sure he must be an associate of Raja, said Bidusmita.        
	The call came around 9.30pm. The caller asked if I was Bidusmita and started threatening me, she said.         
	Bidhusmita has been staying in Kendrapada days after the murder of coach Biranchi Das.         
	After Bidusmita disconnected the phone, the person continued ringing her. I saw several missed calls later, she said.        
	She immediately got in touch with Kendrapada superintendent of police Diptesh Pattnaik and Bhubaneswar deputy commissioner of police Himanshu Lal.         
	I have been given sufficient police protection, said the actress.        
	Bidusmita reached the Mahila police station here in the evening and lodged her formal FIR.

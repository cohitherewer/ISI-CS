          AMIT ROY                                           Raj Persaud      
	London, June 21: Celebrity psychiatrist Raj Persaud, who was facing being struck off the medical register for plagiarism, has got off relatively lightly with only a three-month suspension.         
	At a five-day disciplinary meeting in Manchester of the General Medical Council, 45-year-old Persaud, born in Reading of Indian-origin parents from Trinidad and Guyana, admitted he had used the work of other scholars in his books and newspaper articles without proper attribution.         
	The GMC ruled that Persaud, who is well known in Britain for his frequent appearances on television and as presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme, All in the Mind, had brought his profession into disrepute.         
	Persaud is a visiting Gresham Professor for Public Understanding of Psychiatry and a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.         
	He has often argued that Indians who suffer mental health problems should seek medical treatment as soon as possible before a condition becomes chronic.         
	Newspapers predicted he would be struck off but friends of Persaud, including Lord (David) Owen, a former Labour Foreign Secretary, and the tv journalist, Martin Bashir, a celebrity himself for having secured the big confessional interview with Princess Diana, prevailed upon the GMC panel to be lenient with Persaud and let him off with a three-month suspension.         
	That is the equivalent of a cricketer, facing a life ban, being told he will have to miss a couple of one dayers.         
	The GMC perhaps appreciated that if Persaud was forbidden from practising, it would be his many vulnerable NHS patients, especially in the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, who would also be punished.         
	Owen, who is also a former health minister, praised Persauds rare skills and his bridging of the gap between academia and the publics understanding of mental health issues.         
	Bashir disclosed he had developed a personal relationship for which Im deeply grateful with the doctor.         
	There was also support from husband and wife Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, former presenters of a tv programme, This Morning, on which Persaud was a regular guest.         
	The couple said they wish it to be known Dr Persaud will remain a valued contributor to their programmes.         
	Impressed by their references and the English characteristic of sticking by friends who are in trouble for doing wrong, Dr Anthony Morgan, chairman of the GMCs Fitness to Practise Panel, said: The Panel has determined that a three-month period of suspension is sufficient to send out a signal to you, the profession and the public that plagiarism is unacceptable behaviour.         
	Sounding like a man who has just had the blindfold taken off on the gallows, a relieved and chastened Persaud said: I am saddened by the findings and decision of the GMC, which relates to material published in 2004 and 2005. As I said during the hearing, I accept that my use of the work of some authors lacked adequate acknowledgement.         
	He pointed out: I have apologised repeatedly for this during the hearing, and I apologise for this now. I am saddened that this occurred while I was seeking to promote the work of academics to the wider public. I am grateful for the support of so many colleagues, patients and members of the public who have contacted the GMC and myself to offer their support to me at this difficult time.         
	He added: Mental illness and psychological problems are much misunderstood, but extremely common predicaments which still require energetic efforts to de-stigmatise. I hope to be allowed to continue with this work in the future.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: When the Prime Minister meets Indian mission heads tomorrow to discuss diplomatic issues related to the Mumbai attack, he may also brief them on how to promote India as a safe destination for foreign travellers.        
	Sources said Manmohan Singh agreed to take the matter up with the ambassadors and high commissioners after the tourism ministry sent him an SOS about the sharp fall in tourist arrivals in the country.        
	Indian mission heads have been summoned to Delhi for a three-day briefing and had talks with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee on the first day today.         
	The ministry is desperate to save the Incredible India campaign, which is reeling under the double blow of the economic slowdown and the Mumbai carnage. A slump of 40 to 50 per cent in tourist inflow was reported in November, before the real impact of the terror attack would have been felt.         
	The slump is all the more ominous because November and December have traditionally been the peak season for foreign tourists.        
	We are concerned. Unless there is a concerted effort from all arms of the government, the Incredible India brand is doomed, a senior tourism ministry official said. He hoped tomorrows meeting would help convey the message that India was still safe to visit.        
	As many as 26 foreigners died during the Mumbai carnage and many others were injured. Several governments  including the US and the UK, which send the highest number of tourists to India  had issued advisories against travelling to India after the attack.        
	The Centre succeeded in persuading London and Washington to withdraw the advisories but the damage had already been done, the official said.

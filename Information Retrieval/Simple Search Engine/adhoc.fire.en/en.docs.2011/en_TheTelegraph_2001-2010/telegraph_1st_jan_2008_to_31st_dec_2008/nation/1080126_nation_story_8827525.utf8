     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: Sajjan Jindal today offered to build a deep-sea port in Bengal, a project that hasnt gone beyond the drawing board even after years of lobbying the Centre.
    
	The announcement, made after Jindals meeting with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings today, comes weeks before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh lays the foundation stone for the groups steel plant at East Midnapores Salboni. 
    
	The chief minister asked us to carry out the study for the port. We will start work from February itself, Jindal said after the talks that lasted an hour and 20 minutes.
    
	The port will be good enough for 20 million tonnes of cargo annually, Jindal said, adding that it will have a draft (depth) of 18 meters. A deep-sea port could boost the states industrialisation drive since the existing docks at Calcutta and Haldia, built along a river, are too shallow for large ships.
    
	But some believe the plan must go further than a mere declaration. We welcome Jindals suggestion. However, he has not come with any firm proposal yet, state industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.
    
	Jindal indicated that the investment in the port would be Rs 2,000 crore. 
    
	The states deep-sea port plan has hit a block as the Centre is yet to find a consultant for the feasibility study.
    
	Steel project
    
	The Jindals plan to train students of industrial training institutes for the 15,000 jobs required at the steel plant. A hospital and schools at Salboni are also planned. Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal, said a 3-million-tonne cement plant, using slag from the steel unit as input, will be set up, as will an integrated township for the employees.

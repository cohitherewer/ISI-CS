          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 20: The Assembly proceedings were stalled for the third day today in Orissa with the Opposition storming the well and shouting slogans demanding discussion on the red attacks in Nayagarh, forcing adjournments.         
	No business could be conducted except a statement made by Naveen Patnaik on the ongoing combing operation. Raising the issue at the outset of todays sitting, the Leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, wanted to know the fate of the Oppositions motion for a special discussion on the Nayagarh incident. Speaker Maheswar Mohanty said he would allow a motion tomorrow, but Patnaik insisted on taking it up today.

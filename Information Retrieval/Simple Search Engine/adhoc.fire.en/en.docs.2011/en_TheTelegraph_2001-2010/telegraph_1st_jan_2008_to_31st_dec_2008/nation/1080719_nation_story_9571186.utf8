	New Delhi, July 18: Managerial skills are all very well but learning to communicate them in a variety of languages may soon hold the key to success for students at the Indian Institutes of Management.        
	IIM Calcutta is introducing courses in communication skills and foreign languages within its flagship post-graduate management programme, restructured after nine years, institute officials have said.        
	The communication skills course will be mandatory for students to pass.        
	At present, no IIM specially teaches its students the art of writing and speaking. But IIM Calcutta officials said market feedback indicated that B-school presentations  students have to do several of these  may not be enough to fine-tune communication skills.         
	Starting this academic session, IIM Calcutta students will also be offered a choice between German, French and Mandarin languages to prepare them for corporate opportunities increasingly dominated by the non English-speaking world, sources said.        
	Our courses need to reflect the constantly evolving world of business and cannot be restricted to catering to only the English-speaking world. A foreign language, we believe, is essential for the managers of today, Ajit Balakrishnan, the IIM Calcutta chairman and rediff.com CEO, said.        
	IIM Ahmedabad officials said they were closely observing the new courses at IIM Calcutta and might include foreign languages in its management programme from next year.        
	Africa, Asia and Latin America are the new markets, where the big multinationals are setting up operations. Foreign languages are likely to become crucial to the management programme, an IIM Ahmedabad official said.        
	Prashant Mishra, the chairman of the IIM Calcutta management programme, said the course restructuring was based on the need to cater to an increasingly globalised environment.        
	The financial services market, for example, is expanding in countries like China, Singapore and Hong Kong, where language can be a barrier. Similarly, a student recruited by Mittal Steel, for example, may need to go to countries where people do not know English, he said.         
	Traditionally, the competitive IIM course structure  in which PowerPoint presentations and write-ups are almost a daily routine  has been considered adequate in sharpening the communication skills of budding managers, Mishra said.         
	But our market feedback suggests that belief may be flawed. We felt the need to focus on soft skills of our students, and the need to give the management programme a more global orientation.        
	In their second semester, IIM Calcutta students will have to take two courses in communication skills  writing and speaking  Mishra said.        
	Both the communication skills courses and the foreign languages are aimed at improving the cross-cultural sensitivities of our students.        
	Based on student demand, the number of foreign languages on offer may be increased, Mishra said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Varanasi jail inmates drag the plough                                   
	Lucknow, Nov. 3: The ox at Varanasi jail had taken ill, so the authorities got the prisoners to drag the plough.        
	For at least a week, the jailer allegedly forced some 10 inmates, mostly undertrials, to turn beasts of burden to level the jails five-acre paddy field. Then residents of the locality, 3km from Varanasi town, informed television channels.        
	After TV beamed the pictures and rights activists raised an outcry, Varanasi divisional commissioner Suresh Chandra carried out a preliminary probe. The jailer and two security guards were suspended today.        
	Convicts sentenced to rigorous imprisonment  and not undertrials  are often made to labour in jail for a small payment, cleaning rooms, cooking, crushing stones or taking up gardening. At Varanasi jail, some worked on the paddy field with the plough and the ox, till the animal took ill.        
	Its sub-human behaviour to ask jail inmates to do the work of animals, said Romesh Chaturvedi, an activist.        
	Yesterday, Chandra and four other officials visited the jail and asked questions. On the basis of the prima facie findings, three officials have been placed under suspension, district magistrate A.K. Upadhyay said.        
	He added that a detailed probe was under way to find out how long the practice had been going on.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 6: Orissa High Court has issued a notice to the government after a PIL on lax security in jails was submitted.         
	Inadequate security measures had apparently resulted in a spurt in jail escapes in recent years  a charge that was also levelled by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) recently.         
	Reportedly, as many as 77 prisoners had managed to escape jails in 43 incidents since 2002, either by digging an escape route or by scaling the perimeter wall at night, or better still, over powering jail staff during in jail hospitals.         
	Recurring escapes have been noticed in circle jails at Choudwar, Baripada and Sambalpur and district jails in Balasore and Sundergarh.Maitree Sansad, a social organisation in Cuttack, filed the PIL, while the issue was raised before the high court yesterday.         
	The two judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty has directed the government to submit a status report on jail security by June 19, conceded the counsel for Maitree Sansad, Ajay Mohanty, while talking to The Telegraph today.         
	Previously, the CAG team had tested 18 jails and had found that none were equipped with the basic modern security systems such as cellphone jammers, cellphone detectors, live-wire fencing or metal detector doors. Orissa has 70 jails with over 14,000 inmates at any given point of time against an accommodating capacity of 10,000.         
	But there are just 1,383 warders, 124 head warders and 300 officers with the Orissa Prison and Correctional Services.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Centre may extend the tenure of the IIM Lucknow director, Devi Singh, when his term ends on August 24, bucking a recent trend of asking such chiefs to quit after one innings.         
	Devi Singh may either be asked to continue for an interim period or receive a full extension as IIM Lucknow director because the Centre has been unable to home in on a better replacement, officials said. The final decision on the future of the IIM director is yet to be taken but he is frontrunner for a second term, sources said.         
	The appointments committee of the cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has in principle approved a recommendation by the human resource development ministry to extend Devi Singhs tenure.         
	The IIM Lucknow director was appointed in 2003 by the NDAs Murli Manohar Joshi. Current education minister Arjun Singh was initially suspicious of Devi Singh, ministry sources said.         
	Over the past five years though, Devi Singh successfully won the trust of the government, defying on more than one occasion informal whips by big brother IIMs in Ahmedabad and Bangalore to the remaining institutes challenging the government.         
	Last year, when all other IIMs, led by Ahmedabad and Bangalore, opposed OBC reservations, Devi Singh staunchly refused to join the pack, officials said.         
	Earlier this year, when the government objected to a fee hike at the IIMs, Lucknow went in for a moderate hike.

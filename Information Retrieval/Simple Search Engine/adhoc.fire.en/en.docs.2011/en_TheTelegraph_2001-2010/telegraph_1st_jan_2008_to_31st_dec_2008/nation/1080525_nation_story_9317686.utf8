          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 24: The BJP today shifted the venue of its national executive from Jaipur to Delhi as clashes between Gujjars and police continued in Rajasthan for the second day.         
	The conference, initially scheduled for three days, will now be for two days from June 1.         
	The decision to shift the venue was taken at an emergency meeting of BJP office-bearers this afternoon. Party chief Rajnath Singh and senior leaders L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley were present.         
	They reviewed the situation in the state after the Gujjars went on a rampage leading to police firing yesterday.         
	The violence that continued today has claimed at least 29 people.         
	The party felt it was not wise to go ahead with the conference in the state. The Gujjars have shown in the past that they can manage huge demonstrations and paralyse the state.        
	The BJP did not want this spectacle to get the focus of the media that would have been in Rajasthan to cover the executive.         
	This is the second time the party has had to shift the national executive from Jaipur. Last year, too, the party changed the venue from Jaipur to Delhi in the wake of the Gujjar agitation for ST status.

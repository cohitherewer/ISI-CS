The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Two hours to spell out a word: poll
                                                                                                               Two hours to spell out a word: poll
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          Womans day: Chidambarams daughter-in-law in Parliament on Friday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: It isnt often an election speech comes divided in 14 laborious volumes. It isnt often the elaborate budget-day minutiae of decimal points and sub-texts come so lucidly superscribed by the big message. What P. Chidambaram took two breezy hours spelling out to the Lok Sabha this morning, he could have said with a single word: elections.        
	Chidambaram wasnt being finance minister today, he was ministering the political fortunes of his party and alliance. His was less a budget speech, more a feisty action-taken report on the Congresss aam aadmi manifesto of 2004.        
	The employment guarantee lay extended countrywide, the miserable farmer was unburdened of a Rs 60,000-crore debt-yoke, women and minorities were lavished with largesse, the salaried were handed relief theyve often come not to expect. Measure after measure today, the finance minister motioned a cheered treasury to the hustings; measure after measure, he left the Opposition taxed.        
	There was joyous drum roll lifting off the UPA ranks, the BJP squirmed in indignant silence. It was all too apparent that the finance minister was gleefully undercutting them in the vote stakes, but they couldnt even cry foul.        
	There was a fleeting effort at protest from the saffron back benches  hapless cries of unfair, unfair  but they were put down with ease. Whats unfair? came the jeering counterblast from the UPA. Look at this party, they think giving relief to farmers is unfair! Kisan-virodhi hai-hai!         
	Mohammed Salim of the CPM had a sharper taunt. Bania party hai, bania party, he cackled. They are complaining about no benefits to banias.        
	What was the BJP to rail against, though? The extension of minimum employment guarantee? Concessions to farmers? The hike in tax slabs? Today was a day the Opposition knew better than to oppose; that would be the surest way to be damned by constituencies across the country.        
	Word quickly rippled back from the BJP front ranks  hold your anger, itll be counterproductive. How they wished they were the ones laying these proposals out, how riled they were at the sight of the smug Chidambaram preening ballerina-like at the lectern, daring them with a deeply affected float-like-a-butterfly-sting-like-a-bee smile.        
	For all the censure they would later heap on Chidambarams presentation, it was railway minister Lalu Prasad who probably caught the Oppositions post-budget temper most aptly today. As the House rose, the UPA barrel-chested, the BJP slouched, Lalu Prasad lingered in the first row, trying to locate adversaries to rib across the Lok Sabha well. He pulled a mock-glum face and ran his fingers slowly and elaborately down his eyes, as if to say, time for you to start weeping, mates. Kaaji, he dared no one in particular in the fast emptying BJP benches. Hawa nikal naa gaya, ab chalo (so, has the wind been knocked out of you now? Lets go).        
	The hubbub in the bursting galleries was not over the nitty-gritty of the finance proposals, it was all about their political import. All agricultural debt-waivers to be fulfilled by June 30 and fresh loans to be made available thereafter? Does that mean elections could be announced soon after, with the farmer still in grateful frame? Who cares about the monsoon now, remarked someone, the farmer will feel happy even on a drought this year.        
	Could that also mean the government will have bought enough time to slip through the nuclear deal? News has arrived from Vienna, after all, that considerable progress has been achieved in talks with the IAEA, and the government still has life and time to bargain for. The Americans are talking of a September deadline, not beyond reach. The bets were on, and they werent all against the UPA finally daring the Left on the deal and opting for elections if that is what it would mean.        
	UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, for one, was leaving no one in doubt she was all for another tryst with the aam aadmi. In what was probably both a signal and a command performance, she strode out of 10 Janpath this afternoon, beaming in a red sari, to accept accolades from a mass of farmers gathered to celebrate the tidings Chidambarams budget had sounded. Who knows, she may have already addressed the first rally of the next campaign. But surely there are many still to go on the tough road to polls and Chidambarams already exhausted his kitty.

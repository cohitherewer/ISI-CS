                                                                                                               Delhi seeks mercy for Sarabjit
          OUR BUREAU                          An old photograph of Sarabjit. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi/Islamabad, March 18: Two prisoners  one dead and the other facing death  have got India and Pakistan involved in an undeclared tug of war.         
	India today appealed for clemency for Sarabjit Singh, who is to be hanged on April 1. He is alleged to have played a role in blasts that killed 14 people in 1990 but his family in Punjab says Sarabjit is a victim of mistaken identity.         
	Pakistan is unhappy about the death of Khalid Mehmood in a Delhi hospital on February 12.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Parliament: We appeal to the government of Pakistan to treat Sarabjit Singhs case with clemency on humanitarian grounds.        
	In reply to a letter, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Punjab chief minister the Centre had taken up the matter with Islamabad at the highest levels.         
	Islamabad confirmed this. The Indian government has approached Pakistan seeking clemency for Sarabjit Singh, foreign ministry spokesman Muhammad Sadiq said.         
	Mukherjee told Parliament that India and Pakistan had put in place certain institutional arrangements, including a new agreement on consular access and a joint judicial panel to improve the lot of prisoners, and the appeal was being made in this context and in the same spirit.         
	Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur, who met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Mukherjee and railway minister Lalu Prasad, has sought the Pakistan high commissions help to send a clemency petition to President Pervez Musharraf.         
	Musharraf had rejected a mercy petition for Sarabjit, sent to him along with a plea for pardoning Kashmir Singh, recently freed after 35 years on death row. Sarabjits death warrant reached jail authorities in Lahore on March 15.        
	As Indian officials waited for consular access to Sarabjit, Pakistan asked about Mehmood. We first wrote to the ministry of external affairs on February 13 to provide us details about the circumstances under which he died. We sent a reminder last week, a Pakistani diplomat said.        
	Sources in the foreign ministry said Mehmood, who overstayed his visa and was arrested in May 2006, was being tried under the foreigners act, the passport act and the official secrets act. He was in judicial custody and died of illness in hospital.

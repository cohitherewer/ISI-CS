	In the report headlined CPM cries Ma-Mo plot in Mondays edition, the allegation that Mamata Banerjee had an understanding with Narendra Modi to drive the Tata project out of Bengal was erroneously attributed to CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.         
	The charge was levelled by CPM Gujarat secretary Arun Mehta, not Karat. We apologise for the mistake.

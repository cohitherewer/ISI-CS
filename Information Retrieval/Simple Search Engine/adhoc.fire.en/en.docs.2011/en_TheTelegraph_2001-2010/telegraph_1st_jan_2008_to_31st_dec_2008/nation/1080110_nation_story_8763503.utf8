     OUR CORRESPONDENT

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: The Global Council of Indian Christians today protested against the apathy of the National Commission for Minorities in addressing Christian problems in Khandhamal. 
    
	The commissions decision to cancel its visit to the clash-sites because of the hilly terrain speaks volumes of its disregard to the crying needs of the riot-hit Christians in Khandhamal, said council president Sajan K. George, who was on a visit to the troubled district today. 
    
	It may be recalled that the two-member fact-finding team, headed by Dilip Padgaonkar, was scheduled to visit the riot-affected areas on Monday. But the team cancelled the visit and returned to Bhubaneswar after meeting groups and individuals at the district headquarters. Padgaonkar had explained that it was not possible to visit the areas because of difficult terrain. Stating that more than 2,500 villagers were still lodged in three shelter camps in Khandhamal, he stressed that the atmosphere of fear was very much a part of their lives  so they has chosen not to return. 
    
	He alleged that the team had failed to take stock of the miserable condition of the victims. The NCM should have visited the camps and taken evidence from the victims about the partisan, even bigoted behaviour, he fumed. 
    
	The commission should have used this opportunity to persuade the Centre to release special assistance he added.
    
	It should have also persuaded the state government to request for a CBI inquiry to prevail truth and justice for every section of the society, added the Christian leader. 
    
	A factfinding team of the National Human Rights Commission, led by Mukesh Singh arrived in Khandhamal today and held discussions with the district collector and other senior officials. The team is scheduled to visit other riot-hit areas. 
    
	Meanwhile, the state government today deputed a team of three senior officers, headed by additional director-general police Prakash Mishra to Khandhamal today to study and monitor the law and order there. 
    
	The state-level communal harmony committee, headed by the chief secretary, was scheduled to meet tomorrow at Bhubaneswar to take stock of the situation and suggest measures to restore peace and communal harmony. 
    
	Talking to reporters here, Tripathy said the situation was expected to normalise completely within a week. 
    
	The deployment of central paramilitary forces would continue for at least another week. 
    
	Meanwhile, around 400 villagers of Katingia and Tiarisahi, close to the worst-hit Brahmanigaon, who had taken shelter at a relief camp in Sorada in neighbouring Ganjam, have been brought back to their homes by the district administration. 
    
	So far, 135 persons have been arrested in connection with the Khandhamal riots and 112 criminal cases have been filed, said the home secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aamir picks a safe cause
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aamir picks a safe cause
          MANDIRA NAYAR                          Aamir in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Aamir, the politically correct Khan, is ready to take up a safe social cause: the security of women tourists.        
	The tourism ministry has signed the actor up as brand ambassador for its Atithi Devo Bhava campaign in the country and abroad.        
	Aamir, known to be choosy about what he endorses, will now champion the ministrys pet causes, from keeping monuments graffiti-free to treating women tourists with respect.        
	This campaign will be more than just advertisement spots, said joint secretary, tourism, Leena Nandan. It will be a mass movement.        
	It was Aamirs sensitivity and passion that made him an automatic choice, ministry sources said. Aamir told reporters he was doing it for free.        
	The committed and perfectionist actor, often accused of peppering his film crew with suggestions, should love doing the ads. The sources said tourism minister Ambika Soni was keen to get Aamir involved in the campaign, and would be picking his brains.        
	Aamir is expected to get involved in the production too, with help from his crack Rang De Basanti team.        
	Under fire for Indias growing image as an unsafe destination for women tourists  fuelled by a spate of high-profile attacks on western women  the ministry had been toying with the idea of forming a tourism police. But for now, it has decided to recruit Bollywood power.        
	Aamir has always shown a great deal of interest in social causes and has spoken about national issues, Nandan said. He always believes in what he endorses.        
	Unlike some of the causes he has appeared to champion in the past, this one brings the actor no risk.        
	Aamir, who had generally been media-shy and would keep away from awards functions and celebrity causes, had gone into the activist mode after Rang De Basanti released. First, he spoke out on the Gujarat riots, four years after they had happened.        
	I was concerned about people being killed in Gujarat. Not because they were Muslims but because they were Indians, he said during a visit to the office of Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (Anhad).         
	I feel bad that people behind the carnage got re-elected.         
	But the actor then burnt his fingers by speaking up for the Narmada dam oustees after a visit to a Jantar Mantar sit-in on a hot afternoon. It led to his film Fanaa coming under an unofficial ban in Gujarat and himself being dragged into an old wildlife case by the Modi government.        
	Aamir has since then shown a politicians balancing skills, nimbly side-stepping a pesticide row while doing ads for Coca-Cola and then running with the Olympic Torch while saying a silent prayer for Tibet in my heart.        
	The actor was on another campaign-endorsing mood today as he sped across the capital  this time on a rather wet day  from Sonis office to Maneka Gandhis People For Animals fund-raiser.        
	I am an entertainer, he said at the event. I may not be present physically, but I can use my popularity so that people will listen to me.

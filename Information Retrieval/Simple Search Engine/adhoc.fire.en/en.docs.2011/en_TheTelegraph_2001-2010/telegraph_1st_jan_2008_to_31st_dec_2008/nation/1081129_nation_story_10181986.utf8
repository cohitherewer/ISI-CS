                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ship seized with Indian crew
                            
	Nairobi (Kenya), Nov. 28 (AP): Somali pirates hijacked a chemical tanker with dozens of Indian crew members today and a helicopter rescued three British security guards who had jumped into the sea, officials said.        
	A warship on patrol nearby sent helicopters to intervene in the attack, but they arrived after pirates had taken control of the Liberian-flagged ship, according to Noel Choong, the head of the International Maritime Bureaus piracy reporting centre in Malaysia.        
	The ship master had sent a distress call to the piracy reporting centre, which relayed the alert to international forces policing Somali waters, Choong said. No details about how the pirates attacked or the condition of the crew were immediately available.        
	Choong said the ship was being operated out of Singapore.        
	Still on board were 25 Indian and two Bangladeshi crew members, said diplomats who could not be named because of restrictions on speaking to the media.         
	The British security guards escaped by jumping into the water, said a news release issued by their company, Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions.        
	The company said it was aware of the incident on the chemical tanker it identified as M/V Biscaglia.

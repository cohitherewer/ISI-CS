	Marans win cable clash first round    
	The first family has returned home bruised in Tamil Nadus cable war.    
	An arbitration panel recently rejected a plea by Royal Cable Vision, floated by M. Karunanidhis elder son M.K. Azhagiri, for signals of the Marans-owned SUN channels.    
	Madurai strongman Azhagiri, who set up his company to rival the Marans Sumangali Cable Vision, had claimed that his firm was being denied access to the highly popular SUN TV channels for reasons beyond business.    
	Long before he went to the panel, Azhagiri had taken the family spat into the public domain, saying SUN Network was adopting discriminatory practices to protect Sumangali, which controls 80 per cent of the states cable business.    
	The TDAT, which hears telecom and broadcasting industry complaints, ruled that Azhagiris Royal Cable Vision must submit subscriber details and complete other formalities to receive the signals from SUN channels.    
	The SUN blackout had left households with Royal connections unhappy, with fears that many would opt out. Even the presence of Union communications minister A. Raja, from the DMK, didnt help Azhagiri win this round.        
	CM makes power pitch    
	If B.S. Yeddyurappa has his way, the lights will stay on longer in Bangalore and, indeed, in the rest of Karnataka.    
	The chief minister recently requested the Centre to raise the states share in the power generated by generators like the NTPC and National Hydroelectric Corp.    
	During talks with plan panel member Kirit Parikh, Yeddyurappa pointed out that the states share was 15 per cent against Tamil Nadus 37 per cent and Andhras 31 per cent.    
	Yeddyurappa also said the central companies should set up more generating stations in Karnataka. His party, the BJP, has promised free power to farmers for pumps.    
	The chief minister also made a pitch for Bangalore boosters, requesting Parikh to persuade the Centre to reimburse Rs 5,000 crore it was spending on projects in the city.

	Wrangle over CBSE switch    
	Tempers have frayed over a move to introduce the CBSE syllabus in Andhra Pradeshs govern-ment schools.    
	Opposition has come from the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, which warned that the course switch from Class VI was a precursor to privatisation.    
	The party activists staged protests in Telengana, blocking highways and chanting slogans. Party chief and former Union minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao alleged that the aim of pushing 6,500 government schools towards CBSE and merging upper primary sections in some schools with the nearest high school was to privatise primary education.    
	The moves will lead to higher dropouts and closure of over 2,000 schools in Telengana, Rao said, warning of continued agitation unless the order was rescinded.    
	Teachers unions and experts also dubbed the move unwarranted. But school education minister D.R. Narasimham justified the decision, saying CBSE was followed in all states.     
	We feel it will benefit our students, rural pupils, at a time when our state is a favoured destination for IT and knowledge-based industries.

	Stray cases    
	The capital appears to be losing its patience with stray visitors.    
	The civic body last week rounded up not criminals but stray cattle loitering around in the city.    
	In all, 150 such unwanted guests were caught over two days while they were having a leisurely stroll on some of the busiest thoroughfares. The MCDs cattle-catching teams, accompanied by police, picked up the strays from Shahdara, Najafgarh, Civil Lines and Karol Bagh.

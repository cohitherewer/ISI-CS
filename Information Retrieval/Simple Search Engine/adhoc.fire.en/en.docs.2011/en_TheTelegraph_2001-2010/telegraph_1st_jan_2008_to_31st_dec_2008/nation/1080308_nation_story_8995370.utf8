                                                                                                               Sabharwal trial shift 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 7: The Supreme Court today said it would transfer the Professor H.S. Sabharwal murder case to a non-BJP state for a fair trial.         
	A bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and P. Sathasivam was hearing a plea by the Ujjain professors son, Himanshu, claiming that the Madhya Pradesh investigation was not fair and that most of the witnesses had turned hostile.         
	The court had in July 2007 stayed the trial following Himanshus accusation that the public prosecutor was biased.         
	Sabharwal died of a heart attack on August 26, 2006, after he was manhandled by suspected activists of the ABVP, the BJPs students wing. The professor was attacked outside Ujjains Madhav College after he cancelled student elections over allegations of rigging.         
	All six accused  former ABVP state president Shashi Ranjan Akela, former secretary Vimal Tomar, Sudhir Yadav, Pankaj Mishra, Hemant Dubey and Vishal Rajoria  were subsequently jailed.         
	Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, of the BJP, had sparked a controversy after he visited one of the accused in hospital.        
	Today, Himanshus counsel said the case should be transferred to another state, preferably one not ruled by the BJP, for a fair trial and to prevent political interference. He argued that Nagpur would be most suitable in terms of distance from Madhya Pradesh.         
	The apex court agreed but said it would pass formal orders later. It also said the competent Nagpur court would complete the trial within eight months. The accused can move that court for bail.        
	It is a moral victory for me, my family and the entire civil society. Since the case needs retrial, I plead for a CBI investigation, Himanshu said.        
	Some 54 witnesses were examined, but most of them, including policemen, had turned hostile.         
	Home minister Himmat Kothari said: If the apex court feels the trial should be outside Madhya Pradesh, we will co-operate.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 20: The nun who was allegedly raped during communal violence three months ago has agreed to attend an identification parade anywhere in Orissa other than Kandhamal, state crime branch sources said.         
	A Kandhamal court yesterday rejected her plea for shifting the venue of the parade to Delhi.         
	The nun is, however, totally reluctant to come to Kandhamal, where she was allegedly raped, the sources said.         
	Inspector-general of police (crime) Arun Roy confirmed that the identification parade would be held in the state. But its place and date are yet to be decided.         
	We will be able to decide on that after the investigating team returns from Delhi, he said.         
	A CID team headed by Dilip Mohanty questioned the nun, who is undergoing trauma counselling, at an undisclosed location in Delhi on Tuesday.               
	The sources said she had requested the police to examine her at a place away from media glare.         
	Investigators are now trying to reconstruct the sequence of events on the basis of her latest statement, said a senior CID officer associated with the probe.         
	Tuesdays statement more or less corroborated with an earlier version given at a news conference in Delhi on October 24 and the written complaint lodged by the nun on August 26, a day after the alleged incident, said the official.         
	The investigating team also questioned Father Thomas Chellantharayil, the sole eyewitness to the incident.         
	The nun was later taken to AIIMS for collection of blood sample for DNA matching, which will be carried out in a forensic laboratory in Calcutta, added the sources.         
	Blood samples of the prime accused and five co-accused had been already sent to Calcutta.         
	Subdivisional judicial magistrate, Baliguda, Kandhamal, Dolagovind Barik yesterday asked the crime branch to apprise the court on the status of investigation on November 24.        
	The nun had initially refused to assist the CID, saying she had no faith in Orissa police. But she finally agreed to co-operate in the probe following the Supreme Courts advice.

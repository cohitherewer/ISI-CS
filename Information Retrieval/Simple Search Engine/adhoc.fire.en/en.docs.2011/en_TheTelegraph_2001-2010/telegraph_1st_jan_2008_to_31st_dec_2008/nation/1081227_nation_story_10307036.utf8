	Bhagalpur, Dec. 26: Union minister for irrigation and RJD MP Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav today toured rebel-hit areas in Munger and the Jamalpur railway workshop. Lalu Prasad is supposed to visit the workshop on December 29.         
	Though Yadav chose to stay mum regarding his visit a day after the Bhagalpur-Mujaffarpur Janseva Express murder and loot, he criticised Munger and Government Railway Police, blaming them for yesterdays incident where a GRP constable was killed and arms and ammunition were looted near Abhaypur station on the loop section of Lakhisarai.        
	The body of Ganesh Singh, the constable who was killed yesterday, was sent to his Gaya village today after the autopsy.         
	On his part, Vrigu Srinivasan, the deputy inspector-general of police (Munger), blamed the inaccessible topography of the district for making anti-Naxalite operation impossible. Talking to The Telegraph, Srinivasan denied any chance of lapse on their part in Jamui, Lakhisarai and Munger where rebels have infiltrated of late  especially in the rural areas.

	Srinagar, April 21: A CRPF jawan today shot his superior and another colleague dead before committing suicide near the Vaishno Devi shrine in Reasi district.         
	Dhirendra Kumar of the 140 Battalion killed inspector Snoop and constable Praveen Kumar at Katra less than a kilometre from the shrine. He later shot himself with his service rifle.         
	Katra police superintendent Ashok Sharma said the incident happened this morning while the CRPF men were patrolling the area.         
	The deputy commandant was briefing the men and immediately after he left, the soldier trained his gun on the inspector, Sharma said.         
	A probe has been ordered. The jawan was a fresher and there are reports that his leave was not granted.         
	An official said there was an argument between the jawan and his senior after which he opened fire. Another jawan who was standing nearby was also hit.         
	Several pilgrims were on their way to the shrine at the time and many were inside the complex, the official said.         
	The pilgrims initially mistook it for militant firing. The yatra was briefly suspended, the official said.         
	Sharma said the yatra resumed later.        
	The route is manned by hundreds of CRPF men. Over 60 lakh pilgrims visit the shrine every year.

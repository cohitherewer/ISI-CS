          SHEENA K.                              Raman Singh, Ajit Jogi				                                 
	Raipur, Oct. 23: A big respite has came for Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, as his predecessor Ajit Jogi will not contest against him from Rajnandgaon assembly seat in the ensuing state polls.         
	The Congress central election committee today cleared the names of 35 candidates to contest the Assembly elections, fielding Ajit Jogi from Marwahi  the constituency Jogi earlier represented.        
	Jogi had been asserting to contest the election against Singh and had urged the party high command to field him from Rajnandgaon from where the latter would try his luck to enter the Assembly. Following Jogis avow, all eyes were set on the Congresss move as it would have plunged Rajnandgaon to see one of the biggest electoral fights that would have also put the political fate of both the stalwarts at stake.        
	The move of Jogi was aimed to put himself as a strong candidate for the post of chief minister by defeating Singh as the Congress had failed to project any leader for the coveted post if it comes to power in the state that goes to the polls for a 90-member Assembly on November 14 and 20.         
	Senior Congress leaders said that the move not to field Jogi against Singh was strategic. If it was so, Jogi could have confined to Rajnandgaon as and the party could not use him in other constituencies, the leaders said.        
	Marwahi Assembly seat in Bilaspur district has been a traditional Congress stronghold and it will not be a tough task for Jogi to win over the voters. After becoming the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Jogi contested the by-election from Marwahi and won by record margin.

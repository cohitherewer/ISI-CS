     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 14: Bihar legislative council employee Akhilesh Singh (37), missing for the past 10 days, was found dead last night at Gardanibagh here. Police have arrested two colleagues of the victim from Kankerbagh for hatching a conspiracy to kill him.
    
	The arrested duo  Vinod Kumar Singh and Brajkishore Singh  confessed to have planned the murder after they fell out with Akhilesh over money matters. Gardanibagh police, who are dealing with the case, traced the body following directions from the arrested two. 
    
	Patna senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan told The Telegraph: Besides being a government official, Akhilesh had a flourishing money-lending business. 
    
	Akhilesh, a resident of Kankerbagh, had been missing since the evening of January 4 after he left for home on his motorbike. Though police recovered Singhs bike with its key intact from a deserted area on January 5, they could not trace Akhilesh. 
    
	Superintendent of police Anwar Hussain told reporters that the body was fished out last night from a well between Gumti No. 15 and 16 under Gardanibagh police station. The body was packed in a gunny bag and was disposed off in a deserted well, he added.
    
	Post-mortem report reveals that Singh was hit in the head with iron. The report has been corroborated with the confession. 
    
	The victim had an altercation with the accused at the council office on January 3, the day before he went missing. The accused had borrowed Rs 20,000 (approximately) from Singh. 
    
	The two refused to reveal the exact sum that they owed to the deceased. The interrogation is still on, said a police officer, adding that the accused had taken offence to the regular reminders. 
    
	Akhilesh stayed in Kankerbagh with his two brothers, both businessmen. He had two children  a six-year-old daughter and a four-year-old son.

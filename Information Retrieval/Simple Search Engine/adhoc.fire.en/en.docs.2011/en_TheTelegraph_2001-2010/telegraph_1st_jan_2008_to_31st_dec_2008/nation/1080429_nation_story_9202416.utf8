	Sriharikota, April 28: The Indian Space Research Organisation is firming up plans to put an Indian in space in the next seven years or so.        
	Buoyed by the perfect satellite launch, Isro chairman Madhavan Nair said the project had to be started as soon as possible as space has become the final frontier for man.        
	The Centre is expected to give the go-ahead for the first manned flight in six months, he said. The manned flight would be undertaken after three unmanned ones.        
	As the US, China and Russia had made giant strides, India had to keep pace, he said. India cannot afford to be left behind in this space race and, by 2015-2020, mans accessibility to space becomes very important.        
	Nair said the plan was to put a crew of two on board a geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle on a low earth orbit.        
	Several complex systems would have to be put in place, he said, including stay and safety of the crew, safe comeback, an escape system in case of an emergency and systems on ground to manage the mission.        
	He said even the most sophisticated instruments sent up on satellites had their limitations in planetary explorations or in lunar probes. After a certain level, mans presence becomes very essential, he added.

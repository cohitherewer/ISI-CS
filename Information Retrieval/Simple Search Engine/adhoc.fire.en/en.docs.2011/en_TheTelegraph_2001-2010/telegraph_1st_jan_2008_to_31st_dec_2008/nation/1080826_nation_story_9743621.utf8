          OUR BUREAU      
	Ranchi, Aug. 25: Shibu Soren was today invited to form the Jharkhand government after he staked claim by handing a list of 42 legislators to governor Syed Sibtey Razi.        
	Soren will take the oath of office on Wednesday at 1pm at the Morabadi grounds. A Raj Bhavan spokesperson said the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief had been asked to prove his majority by September 1.        
	We have enough heads to prove our majority in the Assembly, Soren said.        
	Apart from the 33 legislators belonging to the JMM, Congress and RJD combine, Soren has claimed the support of seven Independents, including outgoing chief minister Madhu Koda and Stephen Marandi. His list included the name of Forward Bloc legislator Aparna Sengupta.        
	But the names of suspended BJP members Vishnu Bhaiya and Manohar Tekriwal was not on the list, though they were present at Raj Bhavan.        
	When Soren called on the governor, he was accompanied by railway minister Lalu Prasad, junior food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahay and other legislators.        
	The swearing-in will be held on August 27. Gurujis supporters and well-wishers will be coming from all over Jharkhand and adjoining states. It will be very difficult for them to reach here by tomorrow, Sorens eldest son Durga said.        
	The Sudesh Mahto-led All Jharkhand Students Union has decided to stay out of the UPA apparently after Lalu Prasad brokered peace between Soren and Koda. Soren had yesterday sought Mahtos support.

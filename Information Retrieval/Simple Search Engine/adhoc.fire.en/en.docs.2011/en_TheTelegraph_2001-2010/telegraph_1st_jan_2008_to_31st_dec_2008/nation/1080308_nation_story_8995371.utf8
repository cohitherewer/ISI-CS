The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI fires pullout threat in writing
                                                                                                               CPI fires pullout threat in writing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Bardhan                                  
	New Delhi, March 7: The Left renewed its nuke threat today with CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan writing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that his party would withdraw support if the Centre went ahead with the deal.        
	The letter comes a day after CPM general secretary Prakash Karat virtually put the government on notice and demanded that the next meeting of the UPA-Left committee on the controversial deal be held before March 15.        
	Should the government decide to push ahead with the deal, we will not and cannot go along with it. We will then be left with no option other than withdrawing our support to the government, Bardhan said in the letter.        
	This is the first time a Left party has officially written to the Prime Minister threatening to withdraw support, though communist leaders have been talking tough since the 123 Agreement was finalised in September last year.         
	The CPI, which has 10 members in the Lok Sabha, is the largest Left constituent after the CPM.        
	Bardhan criticised Singhs statements in Parliament, including his appeal to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to rise above party interests. It is an open effort at canvassing BJPs support for the deal, Bardhan wrote.         
	Your (Singhs) talk of trying to build a consensus (with Left parties) sounds hollow when you are fully aware that no such consensus is possible, a fact revealed in the parliamentary debate itself.        
	The CPI general secretary iterated the Left parties stand that the deal would be against our national interests, our sovereignty and independent foreign policy.        
	The letter said: In the midst of the statements made by the US side and by our own high officials, the solemn decision taken at the last meeting of the UPA-Left committee that the government will come back to the committee after the IAEA negotiations and even before any text is initiated, is being totally sidetracked.         
	Public opinion is bewildered at all this. We have been waiting with patience for the government to clarify the situation.         
	Bardhan did not stop at the nuke deal and said there were several other violations of the common minimum programme that were causing a lot of disquiet.

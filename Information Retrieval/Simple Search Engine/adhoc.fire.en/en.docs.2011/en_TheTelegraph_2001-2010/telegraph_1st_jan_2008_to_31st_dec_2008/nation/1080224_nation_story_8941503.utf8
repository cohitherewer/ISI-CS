          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Private support                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The Supreme Court has backed private participation in higher secondary education so that more children can complete high school.        
	It is the duty of the state government to provide access to education. Unless new schools in the private sector are permitted, it will not be possible for the state to discharge its constitutional obligation, a three-judge bench has ruled.        
	The apex court set aside a Bombay High Court judgment that had quashed the Maharashtra governments sanction to 1,495 new higher secondary schools.        
	The high court order amounted to denying access to a large number of students aspiring for higher secondary education, the apex court said.        
	But the judges clarified that the government would be free to punish schools that fail to meet any condition set by it or flouts the state education code.        
	Maharashtra has a master plan that lays down several conditions for new Marathi-medium schools. But it does not cover English-medium schools or those set up by linguistic or religious minorities.        
	The Supreme Court ruled that the object of regulating permission for new private schools was to ensure they have adequate infrastructure and to prevent unhealthy competition among them.         
	The aim was to maintain standards of education, protect the interests of teachers and students, and avoid concentration of schools in particular pockets.        
	The state had included certain suggestions, made in an earlier high court judgment, in the master plan.        
	Since the master plan had not been finalised, the Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court had in the interim allowed the state to sanction all categories of schools, including Marathi-medium ones, for 2004-05 and 2005-06.        
	District-level education committees had scrutinised 3,000 applications and granted permission to 1,495 higher secondary schools through an order dated May 16, 2006.        
	These schools had begun functioning when the Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sansthan Mahamandal challenged the government clearance to them before the Nagpur bench and had the order quashed.

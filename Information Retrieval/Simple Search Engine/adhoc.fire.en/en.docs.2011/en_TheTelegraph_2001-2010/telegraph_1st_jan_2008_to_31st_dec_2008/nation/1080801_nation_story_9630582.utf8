	Ahmedabad, July 31 (PTI): A 12-year-old boy, who was seriously injured along with his father and younger brother in the serial bomb blasts here, died today, taking the death count to 54.        
	Rohan Vyas had been admitted with his father and brother to the Civil Hospital trauma centre, which was also targeted on July 26.         
	Rohans father Dushyant, who worked as a laboratory assistant in the hospital, died soon after he was admitted while his younger brother, Yash, 9, is still undergoing treatment at the special burns ward.        
	On the day of the blasts, Rohan, who suffered 80 per cent burns and Yash were riding their bicycles near the entrance to the trauma centre.         
	Their father watched them cycling when a car bomb exploded, seriously injuring the three.        
	After Dushyants death, his wife Geeta kept her hopes up by praying for her two sons. Now, she is numb with grief.        
	Yash, who suffered 50 per cent burns, does not know that his father and brother have died.

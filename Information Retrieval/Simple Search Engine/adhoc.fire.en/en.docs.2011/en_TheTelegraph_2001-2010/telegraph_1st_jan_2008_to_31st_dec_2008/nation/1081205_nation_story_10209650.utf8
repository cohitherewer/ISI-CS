          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Top officials of nine coastal states, including Bengal, and four Union territories will meet tomorrow to tighten vigil and avert Mumbai-like strikes.        
	But the meeting, called by the Union home ministry to step up sea surveillance, might not have representatives of the navy, coast guard and the BSF.        
	Their likely absence could raise questions on whether the measures decided at the meeting will be effective on the ground.        
	Tomorrows discussions will aim to create a coordinated coastal security force with speedboats and marine police stations.         
	The states will be told to pull up their socks and utilise the Rs 551 crore the Centre had sanctioned in 2005 under the Coastal Security Scheme.        
	Sources said the implementation of the scheme had been poor, with less than Rs 100 crore being utilised so far. Fresh resources will also be promised.        
	A home ministry official said Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu had worked on the 1995 scheme, but Bengal has done next to nothing.        
	Bengal home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti will be told about the steps that need to be taken to tighten sea vigil.        
	Federal agency nod        
	The BJP has given the go-ahead to a proposal to form a federal investigative agency after home minister P. Chidambaram met L.K. Advani, PTI reported.

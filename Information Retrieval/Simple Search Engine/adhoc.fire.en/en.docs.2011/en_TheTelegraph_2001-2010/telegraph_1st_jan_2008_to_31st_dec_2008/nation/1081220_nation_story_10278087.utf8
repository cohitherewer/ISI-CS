	Mumbai, Dec. 19 (PTI): Bombay High Court today ruled that municipal authorities could kill a stray dog if it was causing nuisance but mass killing was not allowed.        
	The court did not define what nuisance was, but said barking  even at night  could not be reason to kill a stray. The court said the municipal corporation could kill dogs only in the circumstances prescribed by animal birth control rules: if the dog was rabid, or mortally wounded or incurably ill. A perennially violent dog could be called incurably ill. Beyond this, the civic commissioner could order a dog killed if it was causing nuisance.

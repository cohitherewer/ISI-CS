	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Orissa government today announced a Rs 40-crore package for the handicraft sector and set a target to double the number of artisans in the state through skill training sessions.        
	Also on the anvil, were plans to construct an international sales promotion and a modern packaging centre at Bhubaneswar for export promotion. The package was approved at a meeting, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today. Earlier, the state had announced a similar package for handloom weavers.         
	The ministers also decided to issue photo identity cards to the artisans and set up a welfare fund for them. Laying stress on the skill development through training, the meeting decided to begin lessons with 2,000 artisans.        
	Orissa is known for its excellence in arts and crafts and earns a good amount of foreign exchange from export of handicraft goods. According to the package, soft loans with margin money will be provided to 3,000 artisans every year and 500 artisans would be sent on training tours on improved products and designs.

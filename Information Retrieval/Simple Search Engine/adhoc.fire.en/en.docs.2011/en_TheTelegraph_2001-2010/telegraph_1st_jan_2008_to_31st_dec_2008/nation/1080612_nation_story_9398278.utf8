	Bhubaneswar, June 11: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today ordered an inquiry into the death of an inmate at Choudwar central jail.         
	The convict died yesterday after another inmate stabbed him.         
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra has been asked to investigate into the matter and submit a report within 10 days.         
	Prisoner Krushna Chandra Behera succumbed to his injuries at SCB Medical College and Hospital yesterday.        
	Reports said Behera of Badamba, convicted for dowry killing, was serving a life-term. He was returning from the lavatory to his bunk in the evening when another convict  Pratap Khatei  confronted him. Without any warning, Khatei plunged a broken, but sharp, spatula handle into his stomach.         
	Though there were 19 others in the ward at that time, no one realised that Behera had been stabbed. Behera ran screaming, but Khatei followed him and stabbed him again on the back before being overpowered by others.

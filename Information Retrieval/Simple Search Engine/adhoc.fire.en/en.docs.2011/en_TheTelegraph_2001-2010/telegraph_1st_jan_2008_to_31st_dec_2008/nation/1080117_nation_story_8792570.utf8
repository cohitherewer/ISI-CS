	New Delhi, Jan. 16: The BCCI has a choice: drop the Australia tour or the I in its name.
    
	A public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court today said the Board of Control for Cricket in India should stop using the word India if it doesnt recall Anil Kumble and his boys and defend the countrys honour in the race row with Australia. 
    
	The lazy and ignorant board, Lucknow-based lawyer Prince Lenin said, should discontinue the tour because the Australian cricket board had humiliated the nation in front of the entire world. 
    
	The court has set January 28 for the hearing.
    
	If Lenin finally has his way, the irony wouldnt surely be lost on the BCCI czars.
    
	Sometime back, in the thick of a telecast rights battle with a channel, the board had claimed it was a private, autonomous body, with no links with the government, either administrative or financial.
    
	Lenins PIL also sought to prevent the board from organising or taking part in any tournament under the name India. 
    
	Those who were not concerned with the game or had not contributed to it, the petition added, should be barred from contesting as office-bearers of any sports body.
    
	The PIL said the board had become the richest sports body in the country because of the love and affection of the people.
    
	But on the current tour, the BCCI has been a mere spectator to the unsporting acts of the Australian players, the umpiring mistakes and the damage caused to the spirit of the game and has not withdrawn for fear of losing a few crores.
    
	No person, the petition argued, could be allowed to make money at the cost of the nations honour. 
    
	The BCCI, it said, had failed to protect and defend the respect, pride and dignity of the country, which rests with the players, and so no more deserves to represent the Tricolour at any level.

	Patna, Feb. 15: If friends in high places come in handy to impress folks back home, Lalu Prasad believes in flaunting connections in the highest place.        
	No less a person than the President of India, Pratibha Patil, dropped in for tea at the Patna house allotted to the railway ministers wife.        
	The commander-in-chief does not call on politicians every day  though it is not unprecedented  and the Bihar capital was agog with the significance of the visit.        
	The spin doctors of Lalu Prasad, who lost power in Bihar after a long run, were busy highlighting how the visit had given him an upper hand in the ego tussle with chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	President Patil, who arrived on a two-day visit to the state, rescheduled her programme to squeeze in a trip to the home officially allotted to former chief minister and Opposition leader Rabri Devi this evening.        
	Roses in hand, Lalu Prasad and his wife welcomed Patil at 10 Circular Road. The President was offered a gift  no surprises here, a replica of a train.        
	The President, too, had brought along a gift, an RJD legislator said but did not say what it was. Patil spent 35 minutes with the couple over tea and snacks.        
	As the President had come to Bihar for the first time, I invited her to tea as a gesture of welcoming the big guest, an elated Lalu Prasad said later.        
	A Patna Raj Bhavan official said that a visit to the Union ministers house was not part of the original programme. It was changed at a later stage.         
	A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had gone to Atal Bihari Vajpayees house to greet the then Prime Minister on his birthday. Years before that, Rajendra Prasad had met Jawaharlal Nehru at the Delhi airport when the countrys first Prime Minister returned from a successful foreign tour, an old-timer in Delhi recalled.

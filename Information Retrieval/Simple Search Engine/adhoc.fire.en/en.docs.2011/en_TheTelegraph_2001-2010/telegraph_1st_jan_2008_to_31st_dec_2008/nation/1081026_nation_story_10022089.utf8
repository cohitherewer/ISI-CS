          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Khan: Fan in fix                                  
	Chandigarh, Oct. 25: A teenage boy from Pakistans tribal militant hub sneaked into India alone soon after Independence Day, wearing a school uniform.        
	Fifteen-year-old Nasir Sultan, however, is no child militant. His head filled not with indoctrination but Bollywood dreams, the die-hard Shah Rukh Khan fan was headed for Mumbai hoping for a film industry career.        
	But his heros reel script  SRK played an Indian Air Force pilot captured and imprisoned in Pakistan in Veer-Zara  has visited Nasir in reverse in real life.        
	The schoolboy from the North West Frontier Province was arrested by the BSF in Ferozepur, Punjab, immediately after his August 18 sneak-in and has spent the past two months in Faridkot Central Jails juvenile cell.        
	Nasirs extradition process can begin, if at all, only after he appears for the next hearing at a Ferozepur magistrates court on November 11, Faridkot deputy commissioner V.K. Meena said.        
	He has been provided legal aid. He is well. We have no intimation from either the foreign ministry or the home ministry on his release as of now, Meena said.        
	On October 16, the police had taken Nasir to a PCO from where the boy  who had left home in his uniform and carrying his schoolbag  spoke to his father Sultan Zareen.        
	Sultan, a petrol pump employee in Chuktian, Upper Dir district, has approached the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad to seek his sons release.        
	Nasir wanted to become another Shah Rukh Khan and used to ape the actors mannerisms when he was first brought here, a jail official said.        
	The jail houses another Pakistani boy, 17-year-old Sunil, son of Ashraf, who had crossed over on May 18, also hoping to act in Bollywood. He has been provided legal aid too, Meena said.        
	Former Pakistan rights minister Ansar Burney, who today left Karachi on a Mumbai-Delhi trip, will press for the two boys release.

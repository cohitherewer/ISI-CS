          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi , May 27: Samajwadi leader Amar Singh today accused L.K. Advani and Mayavati of conspiring to keep the Congress-led coalition out of power after the next general elections, indicating a new phase in his partys relationship with the Congress.        
	They have a secret understanding to prevent Manmohan Singh or Sonia Gandhi from becoming the Prime Minister (of the next government), he said. Either Advani or Mayavati will become the next PM.        
	The Samajwadi general secretary said Mayavatis BSP was the BJPs B-team and accused it of eating into the vote share of the Congress and other secular outfits in the recent Karnataka elections, where Advanis party emerged victorious.        
	Amar said the BSP, Uttar Pradeshs ruling party, would try to do the same in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh and Delhi as well as in the Lok Sabha polls, due next year.        
	The Samajwadi leader dismissed speculation that his party might join the UPA government or arrive at a working arrangement with the central coalition. But his tone and tenor suggested that his party had reached an understanding with the Congress in view of their common interest in Uttar Pradesh and the coming parliamentary elections.        
	His recent bonhomie with the Prime Minister and participation at the dinner meeting held to mark the UPA governments fourth anniversary also point towards some behind-the-scenes developments.        
	Manmohan and his party, under tremendous pressure from the Left not to activate the US nuclear deal, seem to be eyeing the Samajwadi Party as a potential ally.        
	Amar, however, rubbished talk of his partys growing distance from the Left, saying their relations had always been strong and would continue to be so.

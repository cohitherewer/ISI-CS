	New Delhi, May 15: The humble bicycle, all but forgotten in these times of big fast cars, has grabbed national attention because of a tragedy.        
	After bombs planted on eight trendy new cycles killed more than 60 people in Jaipur, the security establishment is on its toes. So are the traders.        
	We are on high alert. If a customer wants to buy more than two cycles, we make it a point to write down his address and phone number. We try to involve him in conversation and enquire about his reasons for buying the bicycles, said Arun Bhandari, a trader in Jhandewala cycle market, Delhis biggest.        
	Writing down names and addresses of customers is standard practice at D. Das and Brothers on Bentinck Street, Calcuttas oldest cycle market. In case of Bangladeshi customers, we also keep their hotel address, said Debabrata Das.        
	Not everyone does this. A cycle doesnt require any licence, so its impossible for us to ask for details from each and every customer, said Sanjib Dey of Star Cycle Co., also on Bentinck Street.         
	Before Black Tuesday, few cared about who was buying cycles and how many.         
	Bicycles for kids and teens comprise the major chunk of our business. The standard bicycles also sell but the numbers are falling, said Mihir Mukherjee of Eastern Cycle Co. on Bentinck Street.         
	The cycles used in Jaipur cost upwards of Rs 5,500. A year and a half ago, cycles were used to plant bombs that killed 31 people in Maharashtras Malegaon. Those cost around Rs 2,010 each.        
	Experts say the price is a key reason why militants are turning to bicycles to trigger blasts  they have been used in explosions in Faizabad and Lucknow as well as in Assam.         
	One can pay cash, so there is no money trail. Traders who are selling bicycles do not ask for identity proof or residential proof from a customer who is buying a cycle for as low as Rs 2,300-5,000, a senior police officer, who was part of the Malegaon probe, said.         
	Another reason would be that in this age of opulence when everyone wants a car  whether its a Nano or a BMW  the lowly cycle wouldnt draw attention, not even if left behind in a no-parking zone.        
	The only time cycles invite attention is when they get in the way and slow down traffic  the reason they are not allowed in Calcuttas city centre.        
	Police officers say a bomb planted on a cycle promises maximum impact because the height ensures that splinters will hit the torso.         
	There are stark similarities between the Jaipur and the Malegaon blasts. There is a definite trend as far as the bicycles are concerned, said A.N. Roy, Maharashtra DGP.         
	Manish Agarwal, the Malegaon trader whose shop sold cycles used in the blasts there, sympathises with his counterparts in Jaipurs Kishan Pol market.        
	My son Piyush was at the counter when the bicycles were bought. Since then, Sohail and Mobin, our salesmen, have found jobs elsewhere and my son cringes every time he sees a customer, said Manish, who helped the police draw a sketch of the rebels.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 3: A suspected paedophile, who was absconding for two days, was arrested on Wednesday and refused bail by a Cuttack court.        
	The accused, Sanjay Jena (32) is accused of sexually abusing three girls aged between six and 11 years of age, is a 32-year-old factory worker hailing from Jagatsinghpur.         
	Jena was arrested on Wednesday after the public and parents of the victims, who had lodged a complaint at the Purighat police station on Monday, mounted pressure on the police.         
	He was made to appear before the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate facing charges under sections 354, 376 and 377 IPC. The court remanded him to jail after rejecting his bail.         
	Jena has denied abusing the three girls.         
	The charges are false and I hope there will be justice, he told reporters before being taken to the Cuttack Central Jail at Choudwar.

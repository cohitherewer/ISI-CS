          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Mukesh Tomar stood in a ring of youth Congress workers guarding the entrance to the Ram Manohar Lohia emergency ward.         
	No one enters other than doctors or patients, the young man, the image of a smiling Rahul Gandhi plastered on his T-shirt, yelled to his colleagues.        
	A photographer nudged close to snap a blast victim being wheeled in, but was pushed away. No one means no one at all, Tomar glared.        
	But those he let pass thanked him and his colleagues.        
	As bombs exploded across Delhi, youth wings of political parties descended on hospitals and the blast sites. But for once, politics at a time of tragedy was not drawing jeers. Instead, the youth workers, who tried to manage the chaos in their own brusque way, won goodwill, handy in an election year.        
	As Kuljit Kaur waited with her daughters at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital for news of her husband, Rajendra Singh walked up, patted the girls on their heads and handed a visiting card to the mother. I am from the youth BSP. Please do call us any time, if we can be of help. We will do all we can, he said.         
	Police officer Mohan Singh, sceptical at first, conceded the youths had been of great help. Law and order apart, manpower is required to organise the chaos and to help the families of victims identify their relatives, Singh said.

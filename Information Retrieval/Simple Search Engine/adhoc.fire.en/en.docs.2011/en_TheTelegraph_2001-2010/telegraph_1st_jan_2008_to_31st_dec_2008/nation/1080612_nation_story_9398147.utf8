                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Narco test on Talwar compounder
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, June 11: Arrested dentist Rajesh Talwars compounder Krishna was today whisked away to Bangalore for a narco-analysis test as the Nepalese national emerged as the key to the mystery behind the Noida twin murders.        
	Sources said the CBI was thinking of conducting a brain-mapping test on Krishna, who was put through a lie detector for the second time yesterday since the agency widened its probe into the murders of Talwars daughter Aarushi and servant Hemraj.        
	The sources said investigators had not only established that the compounder was present in the Talwar house on the night of the murders, he also appeared to know where the murder weapon  probably a khukri  was hidden.        
	The sleuths have also found Krishnas fingerprints in the Talwars bedroom, on one of the glasses in Hemrajs room and on the handle of the door leading to the terrace, where the body of the domestic help was found.        
	Also, Aarushis call records have shown that Krishna was in touch with her. Asked about it, he apparently told the CBI he used to call her to get fashion advice.        
	CBI officials said Krishna couldnt give a satisfactory explanation about the presence of his fingerprints and several discrepancies had emerged from his lie-detector tests.        
	That is why the narco-analysis  in which a truth serum is injected into a suspect  became crucial for further investigations, said joint director Arun Kumar, who is heading the probe.        
	His narco-analysis is being conducted to further rule out contradiction in his statements, Kumar added.        
	The CBI officer also clarified that all legal formalities needed to carry out the tests had been completed, including taking Krishnas consent.        
	Sources said the agency was now treating Krishna as a witness and had still not formally arrested him despite holding him in custody for over four days, but things could change after the results of the narco-analysis come in.        
	If the agency treats him like an accused, it will have to arrest him. Any investigating agency cannot hold an accused in custody for more than 24 hours without arresting him and producing him in court, an official explained.

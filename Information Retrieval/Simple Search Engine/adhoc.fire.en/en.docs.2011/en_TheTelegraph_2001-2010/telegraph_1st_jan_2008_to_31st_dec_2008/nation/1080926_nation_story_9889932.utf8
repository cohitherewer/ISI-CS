          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Sept. 25: Suspected militants today shot dead a Peoples Democratic Party leader in a north Kashmir village.         
	The incident comes days before the Election Commission meets to decide when to hold elections in the state.        
	Police said Ghulam Muhammad Mir, the PDPs zonal president and a resident of Bahrampora village, was killed at Dangiwachi in north Kashmirs Baramulla district.        
	The PDP has termed the murder suspicious and demanded a judicial probe.         
	No militant group has claimed responsibility. This is the first political murder in recent months and comes amid a ceasefire announced by the United Jehad Council, a body of top militant groups.         
	He was walking in Dangiwacha market when some militants shot him at point-blank range, Kashmir police chief B. Sriniwas said.         
	The area was immediately surrounded.         
	The state is currently under governors rule. It was imposed on July 11 which was imposed after the PDP withdrew support to the Congress-led government.         
	The Jammu and Kashmir chief electoral office has announced that election-related preparations have been completed.         
	Official sources said Mir, a contractor by profession, was shot around 2pm after offering mid-day prayers at a nearby mosque.         
	The PDP today held a condolence meeting, chaired by party patron Mufti Muhammad Sayeed.         
	The meeting expressed serious concern and grief over the killing but termed it suspicious because common people have raised doubts over it, PDP general secretary Nizam ud din Bhat said.         
	A PDP spokesperson said a deep-rooted conspiracy was behind Mirs killing.        
	The spokesperson called for a judicial investigation.         
	The spokesperson said thousands of people protested the killing of Mir, who was popular for his social work and honesty.

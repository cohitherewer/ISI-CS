	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 30: College students today clashed over obscene graffiti and police opened fire to control a rampaging mob as the Orissa communal violence that has already claimed over a dozen lives spread to another district.        
	A senior police officer said more than 60 people, including 17 policemen, were injured in the flare-up in Jeypore, Koraput.        
	Unconfirmed reports said a student, Lalit Rath, was injured in the firing and had to be rushed to Visakhapatnam in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for treatment.        
	Koraput police chief Dipak Kumar also suffered bullet wounds.        
	District collector B.K. Sahoo said the situation was grave. I am rushing to the spot with the DIG, he told reporters.        
	The violence broke out as the toll rose to 19 in the state since the murder of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader in Kandhamal district last Saturday night and a suspected retaliatory attack in Padampur on Sunday.         
	Witnesses said the students clashed this morning after some of them spotted objectionable graffiti on the walls of Vikramdev Autonomous College targeting members of a community.        
	They said local MLA Rabi Narayan Nanda was trying to cool tempers when a force led by the Koraput police chief reached the spot.        
	An eyewitness said the cops baton-charged the students, who then attacked a police station and damaged seven police vehicles, some 70 two-wheelers, a government bus and two fire-engines.        
	State police chief Gopal Chandra Nanda confirmed the attack on the police station but evaded questions on whether his men had opened fire. I have no definite information right now, he said.        
	But Jeypore sub-collector S.K. Nayak said the police were compelled to resort to blank firing after the mob stormed the police station.        
	The violence prompted authorities to clamp curfew on the town. Curfew was imposed in the town whose streets are still full of angry people throwing stones, SP Kumar said.        
	An official said one company of the Rapid Action Force and seven state armed police platoons had been deployed.        
	The violence in Jeypore led to a roadblock in nearby Koraput town, MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati said.

	The CPM today said Delhi should take strong action against the Bajrang Dal, a VHP affiliate, for its alleged involvement in violent and terroristic activities.         
	The Centre should collect all evidence... and take strong action, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said.         
	She also accused the UPA government of not doing enough for the victims of the ongoing violence and advised chief minister Naveen Patnaik to snap ties with the BJP.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Helium debut on nuke date
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Helium debut on nuke date
          M.R. VENKATESH                               
	Kuthalam (Tamil Nadu), May 11: The country today got its first pilot plant to extract helium from natural gas on the 10th anniversary of the Pokhran II nuclear tests.         
	The plant at an ONGC gas collection centre in Kuthalam village, over 300km from Chennai, was built with technical expertise from the Calcutta-based Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics.        
	The Rs 6-crore project is the first step to make India self-reliant in extracting the strategic gas.         
	The country requires about 180,000 cubic metres of helium each year, most of which is imported from the US at a cost of Rs 20 crore.        
	The rare gas is used in frontier technologies like space research, atomic energy, nuclear reactors, superconductivity, quantum mechanics and in cryogenic engines of satellite-launch vehicles. It is also used in medical diagnosis tests such as magnetic resonance imaging.         
	But there is a shortage of the gas globally, leaving India with no option but to become self-sufficient, ONGC chief R.S. Sharma said after cutting the ribbon in the presence of Saha Institute director Bikash Sinha.         
	Just as uranium was scare in the early 1960s and India was entirely dependent on imports, in another five to 10 years, helium, a strategic gas, would become equally scarce in the world market and any amount of money will not buy you helium, Sinha cautioned.         
	Helping build the extraction plant was a challenge and technologically, it was the most difficult plant to set up, Sinha said. But today, we have made a breakthrough.         
	The technology can be taken to any other ONGC site where there is a possibility of helium extraction from natural gas, he added.         
	The central point is to have such plants in large numbers across the country wherever helium extraction is possible. Otherwise we wont get anywhere, the Saha Institute director said, calling for more investment for the technology.        
	Natural gas fields with younger rock formations  less than 60 million years old  have little or no helium, Sinha said. Kuthalam, in the Cauvery delta basin in Nagapattinam district, is Indias first cretaceous-age  older rock formation  gas field in which helium is present in 500 parts per million (0.05 per cent) by volume in natural gas, he said.         
	The volume concentration is just about right for extraction for a pilot plant, the reason why the ONGC facility in Kuthalam was chosen for the project. For commercial extraction of the gas, the volume concentration of helium has to be more than 0.3 per cent.         
	The plant has been designed and made by a US company, Adsorption Research Incorporated.         
	We are thinking of patenting this technology in another three months, Sinha said.

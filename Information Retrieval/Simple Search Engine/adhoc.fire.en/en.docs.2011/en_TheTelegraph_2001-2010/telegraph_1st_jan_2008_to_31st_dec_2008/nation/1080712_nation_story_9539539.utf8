          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 11: Prakash Karat is in touch with all parties opposed to the nuclear deal but will not name them.        
	I am in touch with all parties which can take a stand against the nuclear deal, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat told reporters.         
	But he did not mention the names of the parties or whether they included the Lefts sworn enemy, the BJP.        
	Karat was responding to a question whether the Left was in touch with other parties in the wake of the government deciding to seek a trust vote in the Lok Sabha.        
	Some Left leaders had earlier dropped hints about voting against the confidence motion along with the BJP, however unpalatable it is to the secular forces.         
	The leaders feel that the vote is against the betrayal of the government and if the BJP also votes against the motion, it is not the Lefts fault. The Left parties have said that once they withdrew support, they are on the other side of the political divide.        
	Janata Dal (S) leader Danish Ali and party parliamentarian M.P. Veerendra Kumar met Karat separately today. The JD(S) has three MPs in Parliament, and Veerendra Kumar, who had dissociated himself from H.D. Deva Gowda, is in the CPM-led Left Front in Kerala.         
	Our stand, irrespective of what others do, is that the Left will vote against the government for its betrayal of national interests, Karat said in an interview to Peoples Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece.        
	In a reference to the Congresss efforts to rope in other parties to gain majority, he said: One must not forget that the Congress and the UPA are losing ground among the people. If anybody wants to hitch their fortunes to the Congress, that is their business.        
	Karat also charged the Congress with not fighting the BJP politically and ideologically as the Left does. Since the beginning of 2007, we have seen how the Congress is failing to check communal forces.        
	Karat, flanked by other Left leaders, today flayed the IAEA safeguards text, maintaining that the Left was not opposed to the safeguards agreement as such, but was objecting because it was a step to operationalise the Indo-US 123 Agreement.

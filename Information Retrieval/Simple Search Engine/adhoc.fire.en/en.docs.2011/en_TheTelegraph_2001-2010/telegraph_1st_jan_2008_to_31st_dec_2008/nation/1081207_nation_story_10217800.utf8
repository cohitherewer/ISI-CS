The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wanted: Hand of God in election
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wanted: Hand of God in election
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                    Chauhan (top), Pachauri: Poll pilgrims                                   
	Bhopal, Dec. 6: Diego is in Calcutta, but politicians in Madhya Pradesh are seeking the hand of God.        
	Maradona effect? Survival instinct, more likely, though the goal is the same  victory.         
	With the clock ticking towards the December 8 verdict, senior BJP and Congress leaders in the state are legging it to temples seeking divine intervention to see them through.        
	For the past three days, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has been touring pilgrim spots. He has already been to the Mahakal temple in Ujjain, the holy city of Omkareshwar and Pitambara Peeth in Datia.        
	His BJP colleagues Narrottam Mishra and Kailash Vijayvargiya are in Vaishnodevi and Sai Babas ashram in Shirdi, respectively.        
	The temple visits come at a time the football legend  whose hand of God goal set the stage for Argentinas victory in the 1986 World Cup  is in the country for a felicitation.        
	The Opposition Congress is also counting on divine power. State unit head Suresh Pachauri, the man tipped to be chief minister if the Congress wins, also paid a visit to Pitambara Peeth.        
	His camp, however, insists that his regular devotion will help him edge Chauhan out.        
	Chauhan, who was in Omkareshwar yesterday with his wife and children, also claimed that he has been visiting temples since childhood. I have been visiting various places of worship since childhood. It is part of my faith. My prayers seek peace and prosperity for the entire population of Madhya Pradesh, he said.        
	The chief minister appeared confident about another term in office. MP voters have voted for the BJP and I do not think we will be needing alliance partners, he said.        
	Omkareshwar, on the bank of the Narmada, is among 12 revered Jyotirlinga  or lingam of light  shrines to Shiva. The shape of the island resembles the Hindu symbol Om.        
	Vijayvargiya said he was a devout Hindu. Before going to Shirdi, he added, he had offered prayers at the Mahakal temple and a Ganesh temple in hometown Indore.        
	Sources said in Ujjain over a dozen BJP and Congress legislators organised yagnas in the hope of emerging victorious.        
	Not all politicians, though, have gone temple-hopping. Former chief minister Babulal Gaur said there was no point visiting shrines now. Now that votes have been cast, I do not think these visits would make any material difference, he said.         
	But if you are going for penance, I welcome it, he added.        
	In a dig at fellow politicians, Gaur, who has won eight consecutive Assembly elections from Bhopal, said he had faith in both God and voters. God is always with the good. If you have done good, then you will not have much problem in winning.         
	Gaur said since the November 27 vote, he has been getting up at six in the morning, doing yoga, reading the Bhagwad Gita, fulfilling ministerial responsibilities and attending marriages of relatives and party workers.        
	Anurag Modi of Shramik Adivasi Sangathan, an NGO working with tribals, described the temple visits by politicians as a gimmick.        
	As a rationalist, I feel the attempt is to fool both gods and people. Most of these ministers and Congress leaders have failed to win voters confidence. So now their sense of insecurity is driving them to temples, he said.        
	Anurag, whose wife contested as an Independent against revenue minister Kamal Patel, said politicians were becoming superstitious.        
	He didnt explain how the temple visits would fool the gods.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 17: The crime branch has filed a petition in a Baliguda court, seeking the         
	test identification parade in the nun rape case in Cuttack.        
	We filed the petition on Tuesday asking for the parade on the premises of the state CID bureau headquarters in Cuttack, a crime branch official said.        
	The move comes after the high court verdict on December 5 to conduct the parade in Cuttack on a petition by the 29-year-old victim who has been staying away from Orissa since the alleged incident on August 25, two days after Swami Laxmananda Saraswati was murdered.        
	The investigating team of crime branch wants to complete the probe soon as it has to file the chargesheet in the case by January 28, 2009 (within 120 days from the date of the arrest of the accused). The process had been delayed as the TI parade had not been conducted so far.

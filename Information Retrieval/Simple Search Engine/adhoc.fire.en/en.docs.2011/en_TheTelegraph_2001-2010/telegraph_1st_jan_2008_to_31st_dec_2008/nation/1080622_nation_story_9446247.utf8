          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 21: Villagers protesting against the proposed Posco steel plant in Orissa have taken 15 supporters of the project hostage after one group allegedly threw bombs at the other, leading to a death.        
	The president of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, Abhay Sahu, said last night, that some Posco supporters hurled bombs when they were returning after a protest meet. The members of the anti-Posco outfit then surrounded the school from where the bombs were being hurled.         
	When reports last came in, 15 people were hostage in the school in Govindpur, about 130km from Bhubaneswar.        
	District officials rushed to the village  one of the 15 taken by the steel plant  with forces. Over 50 protesters were arrested.        
	One protester injured in the attack died this morning. The anti-Posco outfit said the hostages would be freed only if the alleged attackers were arrested and the victims family adequately compensated.

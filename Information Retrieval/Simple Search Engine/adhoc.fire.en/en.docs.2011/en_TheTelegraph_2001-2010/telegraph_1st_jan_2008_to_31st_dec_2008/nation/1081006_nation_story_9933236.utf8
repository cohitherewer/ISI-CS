	Srinagar, Oct. 5: The government today clamped indefinite curfew across Kashmir and cracked down on separatist leaders and some local news channels ahead of a possible showdown with pro-azaadi protesters.        
	The authorities are trying to pre-empt a separatist march to Srinagars commercial hub Lal Chowk, eight weeks after a march to Muzaffarabad led to the death of a Hurriyat leader and several other protesters in police firing.        
	The Lal Chowk march, called tomorrow by the Hurriyat-led co-ordination committee, marks the resumption of the standoff between the government and separatists after a lull during Ramazan.        
	The authorities placed all the 10 Valley districts under curfew early this morning, and erected barricades and installed iron gates on all roads leading to Lal Chowk. Police vehicles fitted with speakers were on the streets before daybreak, asking people not to step out of their homes.        
	The police and the CRPF have been deployed in thousands to prevent any flare-up that could set the stage for a face-off at tomorrows rally. Clashes were reported from a couple of places but no major curfew violation was reported.        
	Several people were admitted to hospital after being beaten up by the security forces.        
	Srinagar district magistrate Mehraj Kakroo said Section 144 had been imposed for a month, banning assembly of five or more persons.        
	The authorities arrested JKLF chairman Yasin Malik, who heads the 15-member organising committee for the Lal Chowk march, last night. Moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and hawk Syed Ali Geelani were placed under house arrest.        
	Geelani was later admitted to hospital with chest pain. His condition is stable and he took a cup of tea in the morning, a Hurriyat spokesman said.        
	Local cable news channel SEN TV was taken off the air after the Srinagar administration stopped the transmission of local cable network News Channel. The local channel telecast objectionable material to incite people, an official said. The Hurriyat has vowed to go ahead with the rally.        
	People are ready to defy curfew and march towards Lal Chowk. We request people not to resort to violence or raise objectionable slogans, which could give the security forces an excuse to resort to force, said Saleem Geelani, a Hurriyat leader.        
	The separatist-led uprising was on in full swing before Ramazan but was toned down during the month of fasting. The government had prevented a Lal Chowk rally on August 25 by imposing a nine-day curfew that was lifted the day before Ramazan began.

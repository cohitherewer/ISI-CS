                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Ajit works on BJP, but keeps door ajar
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Ajit: Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Ajit Singh seems to have decided to tie up with the BJP, but the leader known for his shifting loyalties has left a small opening for a last-minute change of mind.        
	It is no secret that the septuagenarian Rashtriya Lok Dal chief wants to reserve a berth in Mathura for son and successor Jayant Choudhary.        
	With the Congress and the Samajwadi Party haggling over seat-sharing, an alliance with the BJP looks like the best bet for Ajit.         
	But he refused to give a final word on the alliance. Talks are on in the right direction, the Baghpat MP said.        
	Sources said the Jat leader had asked for at least 10 seats in his area of dominance. But the RLD might end up with a single-digit share  the party has three Lok Sabha seats.        
	The clincher in the deal, however, is said to be the BJPs readiness to accommodate Jayant.         
	Lambasting the UPA government for failing to control terrorism and Naxalites, Ajit almost echoed the BJP on Malegaon blast accused sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur.         
	There is politics being played by those in power, he said, questioning the release of tapes with the sadhvis statements.        
	Like the BJP, he also sought new laws to rein in terror.        
	The RLD leader accused the Centre of failing on all fronts, particularly in arresting inflation, implying the NDA was the only alternative.        
	Ajits categorical statements were a change from the ambivalence that generally mark his political statements.        
	He has courted all parties in power  from the Congress in the 1980s to the National Front, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party. These parties, too, obliged because they could not afford to ignore his importance in western Uttar Pradesh and his base among Jats and farmers.        
	Ajit might have lashed out at the UPA today but, given that he had waited till the last minute before voting against the Indo-US nuclear deal in Parliament, a change in tune cannot be ruled out till he makes a final announcement.

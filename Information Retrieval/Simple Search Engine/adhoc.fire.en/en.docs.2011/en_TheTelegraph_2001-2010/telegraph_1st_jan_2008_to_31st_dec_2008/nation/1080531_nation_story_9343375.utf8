	Raipur, May 30: Twelve women labourers were killed while 20 others sustained injuries this morning when the vehicle they were travelling in turned turtle near Berla in Durg.         
	According to police, around 40 labourers from Akoli and Berla boarded the ill-fated Tata delivery van (CG 04 J9750) this morning to go to Siltara industrial area in Raipur, where they worked in different units.         
	The police said the vehicle was overloaded and blamed the driver for the accident that occurred around 8am today.         
	A case against the driver has been registered and investigations are on.        
	The driver lost control over the van while negotiating a curve and the vehicle slipped off the road before turning turtle, police sources said, adding that 10 women died on the spot, while two died on way to Berla hospital.         
	The irked villagers did not allow rescue workers to remove the bodies from the accident spot for five hours demanding compensation.        
	Around 600 villagers gathered at the spot and staged vehement protests against the administration demanding adequate compensation to the kin of the victims.         
	The villagers did not allow the rescue workers to shift the bodies even as senior officials tried to negotiate with them. Only after repeated assurances the villagers lifted their demonstration.

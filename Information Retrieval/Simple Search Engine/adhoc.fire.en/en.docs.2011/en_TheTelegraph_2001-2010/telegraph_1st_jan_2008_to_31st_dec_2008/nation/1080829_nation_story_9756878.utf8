	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 28: The death of Rajani Manjhi would be investigated by the National Commission for Women.        
	The body of Manjhi, 22, was recovered from the completely gutted missionary school in Bargarh district during the Orissa bandh on Monday         
	An inquiry team will visit the spot soon, said state commission for women chairperson Namita Panda.        
	The deceased, who was burnt alive inside the school-cum-hostel, was initially mistaken as a Christian nun. However, she was later identified as a student and hostel caretaker hailing from Nuapada village in Jaharbandha. It was later seen that she was a Hindu and her body was cremated according to Hindu rites. Her parents were handed over an ex-gratia amount of Rs 10,000 by the district unit of Red Cross. Rajani, apparently, got trapped inside the building when it was set ablaze by an angry mob protesting against the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and his associates.         
	Police have identified those who had set fire to the hostel. Investigations are in progress and arrests will be made soon, said inspector-general of police (northern range) Y.B. Khurania.        
	The commission is shocked by the brutality of the death. A committee headed by our member Manju S. Hembram will meet police officers investigating the case, said Panda. The National Commission for Women probe team would also meet the victims family members and those involved in the incident. A report would be submitted to the Centre later, Panda said.

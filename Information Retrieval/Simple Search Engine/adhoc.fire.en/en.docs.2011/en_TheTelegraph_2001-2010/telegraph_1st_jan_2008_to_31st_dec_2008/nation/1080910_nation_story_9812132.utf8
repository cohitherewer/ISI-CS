The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul in relief camp, by boat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahul in relief camp, by boat

	Patna, Sept. 9: Rahul Gandhi may just have given a tip or two to the ever-swelling band of armchair flood samaritans.        
	The young Gandhi scion today hopped into an army boat outside a relief camp in Purnea district and sailed right up to another in Madhepura, still under the swirling waters of the Kosi, to lend a shoulder and offer solace to the marooned.        
	I am with you in your hour of grief and misery. I will do whatever I can to help you tide over this crisis, he told flood victims at the Murliganj relief camp again and again, hardly bothered if his spick-and-span clothes or even his feet got wet in the filthy waters.        
	In Purnea earlier, he did much the same thing. After landing at the airbase, he drove straight to the Jankinagar and Banmankhi relief camps and mingled with the inmates, assuring them he would be with them through the crisis.        
	The men, women and children at the relief camps were overwhelmed that Rahul actually came to visit them, Jeevan Gupta, a trader helping with relief work, said over phone.        
	Aap hamar paas aagayeel chhi, hamar dukh dard har lailchhi (You have come among us and taken away our grief), Gupta quoted some women as telling Rahul.        
	So far, the flood victims had never had any neta like Rahul actually visiting them. They had all heard that L.K. Advani and Mayavati would come calling, but neither had shown up at their relief camps.        
	Many other leaders had made aerial surveys of the submerged Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria and Katihar districts, addressed news conferences at airports and left.        
	Rahul, however, kept journalists at bay today. From Madhepura, he drove to Forbesganj on the India-Nepal border and met flood victims before calling it a day.        
	On August 28, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had declared the Bihar floods a national calamity and announced a Rs 1,010-crore relief package.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, July 5: The United National Progressive Alliance, a front of regional parties formed as an alternative to both the Congress and the BJP in 2006, broke away from the Samajwadi Party today.        
	Since morning, one ally after the other blamed Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party for taking a stand on the nuclear deal and supporting the Congress without taking them into confidence.        
	The day began with INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala declaring that the group was now without the Samajwadi Party. By afternoon the Asom Gana Parishad and the Telugu Desam Party had joined in the diatribe against the Samajwadis, brothers-in-arms till Thursday evening.         
	The Samajwadi Party went on its own to agree with the Congress while promising us that there would be a national debate on the nuclear deal, said AGP chief Brindaban Goswami. If the UNPA supports the Congress, we will not have an alliance with them.        
	Goswami said if the BJP brought a no-confidence motion against the government, the AGP would support the move. The party has two members in the lower House.         
	In Hyderabad, Desam leaders accused Mulayam of going back on his word.         
	The Desam has five Lok Sabha MPs, which means the third fronts strength in the House now  minus the Samajwadi Partys 39  is 10, including two members of the National Conference and Independent Babulal Marandi. The INLD does not have a Lok Sabha MP.         
	Samajwadi leader Amar Singh argued that support for the Congress was not on the nuclear deal but to keep communal forces out. He said US President George W. Bush was bad but L.K. Advani was worse and communalism was worse than US imperialism.         
	The AGP didnt agree. Goswami said the Congress was the most communal party in the country and asserted that an anti-Congress stand was the basic requirement for being part of the UNPA.        
	UNPA partners have been working on alliances on their own though they have kept doors open so that the front could have a role after the polls. The AGP has been negotiating with the BJP while the Desam has already held talks with Left parties.

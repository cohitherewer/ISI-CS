          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: More than 500 families residing along the seashores in Kendrapada district can now heave a sigh of relief, as the government has decided to shift them to safer homes.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik took the decision at a high-level meeting held today to discuss threats of sea erosion over villages located near the shore.        
	Apprehending danger to the lives of 4,000 people living along the coastal areas, the government decided to act promptly and has, for now, identified the Satbhaya gram panchayat as most vulnerable to sea erosion.        
	Unabated sea erosion over the years had led to the disappearance of half-a-dozen villages, including Kanhupur, Mohanpuri, Gobindpur, Khairikola, and Tentulikola, in the past few years.         
	For now, the government would rehabilitate residents of Satabhaya and Kanhupur villages, said Manmohan Samal, the revenue and disaster management minister.         
	According to todays decision, each displaced family would be given 10-decimal of homestead land, 2 acres of farmland, besides an Indira Awas Yojana house. The respective district administrations have reportedly been directed to take up the matter immediately with the villagers. District collectors have been asked to explain the procedure to the villagers and facilitate speedy rehabilitation, Samal explained.        
	The government has reportedly identified four alternative places for rehabilitation, located 6-10km from the sea.         
	District collectors have also been asked to identify suitable area for the re-location of the villages and submit a report after taking the opinion of the affected villagers about where they would like to be shifted.        
	After the receipt of the detailed reports from collectors we will work out the eventual modalities, Samal assured.

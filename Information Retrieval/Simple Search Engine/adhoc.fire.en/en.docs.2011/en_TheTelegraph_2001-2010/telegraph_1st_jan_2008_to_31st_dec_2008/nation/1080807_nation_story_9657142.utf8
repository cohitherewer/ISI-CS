          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Manmohan                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Prime Ministers Office has questioned admission criteria changes for the National Institutes of Technology, exposing differences with the HRD ministry on a policy opposed by several states and Union territories.        
	In a tersely worded letter, the PMO has asked the ministry to report the number of seats to be allocated to the Union territories, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in particular, officials have revealed.         
	The allotment of seats to students from all states was completed on August 4 but those from Union territories are yet to be considered under the new admission policy. NIT classes have been under way since mid-July.        
	Union territories come under the direct control of the Centre, and the letter reflects withering patience at the PMO to admit such students to the NITs, the countrys second-largest engineering brand, ministry officials said.         
	Each of the 20 NITs is allowed to reserve 50 per cent seats for students from the state in which they are based. Till 2007, the remaining 50 per cent formed part of a central pool, filled on the basis of proportional representation. That meant a state where an NIT offered more seats got greater representation in such institutes elsewhere.        
	Seats were reserved for each Union territory and state that didnt have an NIT proportionally, based on student population.         
	Selections were based on rank (in relation to other candidates from their own states) in the centrally conducted All India Engineering Entrance Examination.        
	However, on June 9, the ministry issued a notification to all NITs informing them it was ending the proportional system. Students are to be admitted now purely on the basis of their rank in the exam, the ministry said.         
	Eleven states wrote to the ministry alleging the new admission guidelines discriminated against students from educationally weaker regions who now had to compete purely on merit. Of the Union territories  none has an NIT  Pondicherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands complained to the ministry and the PMO.         
	The PMO wrote to the ministry on August 1 expressing concern over the Andaman case since the Union territory is separated from the mainland. The islands Congress MP, Manoranjan Bhakta, had earlier asked HRD minister Arjun Singh to ensure there was no reduction in the 47 seats it was entitled to till last year.        
	Ministry officials said they hadnt finalised the number of extra seats to be created for each Union territory and how these would be spread across the NITs. We expect to finalise the number of seats for each Union territory by the second week of August, an official said.

          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The BJP leadership is getting disenchanted with Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar because of his overbearing ways and conscious attempt to illustrate his partys ideological reservations on Sangh parivar politics.        
	An undercurrent of discontent had been there for some time but a section of the BJP now feels the need for drumming coalition dharma into the arrogant Janata Dal (United) leader.        
	Sources said many leaders gave vent to their feelings at the partys recent national executive though the matter wasnt discussed formally.        
	Nitish wants to hog the limelight all the time and tries to undermine the BJPs presence in the (Bihar) government. He is not sensitive towards the political requirements of a coalition arrangement. The central leadership is also not happy with the situation, a BJP office-bearer said.         
	Although the extremely peeved leaders are exercising restraint as shadow Prime Minister L.K. Advani doesnt want any strain in the relationship in an election season, the sources said the murmurs started when Narendra Modi expressed his disgust with Kumars obstinacy.        
	The Gujarat chief minister had apparently wanted to give some suggestions on disaster management in the wake of the floods in Bihar but Kumar didnt pay much heed.        
	BJP leaders said Kumar didnt even acknowledge the massive aid from party-ruled states. He, instead, chose to call on the Prime Minister alone to seek a special package for Bihar.        
	In fact, Kumar has never taken any BJP leader along with him for meetings with the Prime Minister.        
	The sources said senior BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu felt compelled to ring up Kumar to tell him to brief Advani on the flood situation. Advani later met the Prime Minister alone on the same issue.        
	A BJP leader said it was clear that Kumar wanted to take all the credit. But what is worrying us is that he is trying to curb our political initiatives. The BJP wants to project certain issues in a big way to suit its electoral strategy but Nitish undermines those efforts.        
	The allusion was to issues like terrorism, minority appeasement, the Amarnath land row and the Ram setu dispute. Kumar is not allowing the BJP to raise these issues in Bihar.        
	The BJPs state leadership had a few months ago revolted against deputy chief minister Sushil Modi for playing into the hands of Kumar. Advani and his aides defused the fire as their immediate concern was keeping the alliance.

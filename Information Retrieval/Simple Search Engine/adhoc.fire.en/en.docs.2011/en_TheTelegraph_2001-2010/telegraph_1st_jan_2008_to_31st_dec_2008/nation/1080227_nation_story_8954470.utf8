     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Centre is divided on the text of the Sethusamudram affidavit to be filed in the Supreme Court by March 5.
    
	The culture and shipping ministries, which are supposed to prepare the document, have not resolved their differences so far.
    
	A draft was presented during a meeting of the cabinet committee on political affairs soon after the railway budget today.
    
	Culture minister Ambika Soni, shipping minister T.R. Baalu and science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, whose ministries are linked to the project, were present at the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
    
	The draft sought to incorporate the apparently irreconcilable views of Ambika and Baalu but the differences were obvious.
    
	Ambika was of the view that the Archaeological Survey of India, asked to find out if the Ram setu was natural or man-made and if it had any cultural significance, wouldnt be able to establish anything through its survey.
    
	DMK leader Baalu took his partys line, saying the ship canal project should go ahead without changes. He felt the government should request the court to vacate the stay on the project and to dismiss a petition that claimed the project would harm the setu.
    
	Ambika also argued that surveys could not settle matters of belief and cultural history but this stand wasnt included in the draft, sources said.
    
	Pranab Mukherjee, Hans Raj Bharadwaj, P. Chidambaram, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Pawar were present at todays meeting. The cabinet committee will meet on Thursday to resolve the differences.

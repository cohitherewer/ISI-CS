The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Didnt the youngsters ever expect this?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Didnt the youngsters ever expect this?
          SHYAM G. MENON                          Jet employees meet Raj Thackeray on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	The Jet Airways drama will be remembered as a soap in which politicians took business decisions and businessmen played politics.        
	Economic slowdown with a resultant impact on air traffic was to be expected, though the crunch it brought alongside fuel cost and investments made anticipating business expansion proved hard for airlines to bear.         
	Against this backdrop, the announcement at the weeks start that Jet and Kingfisher would function as an alliance, short of merger, was logical. Such steps are routine in civil aviation. It is a high-risk industry, cyclical and capable of jettisoning jobs with the same ease as it creates them.        
	Airlines keep going bust and if you dig deep to places of aircraft manufacture, you will see cities like Seattle where the cyclicality of business in civil aviation and defence often throws up hundreds jobless.        
	If you do your homework or if any of the training institutes had bothered to teach history, these facts would have been with people before they joined aviation.        
	Indeed, nobody joins any profession without doing adequate homework. Looking at the youngsters protesting and the ease with which they washed up at politicians doorsteps, this was the first question that came to mind  didnt they ever expect this?        
	What worried more was the brand of opportunistic politics they sought refuge in. Society will continue to treat this generation as children even when they think they have grown up.        
	It is a further reflection of the times that these youngsters with life and chance to spare are worth saving, but not the middle-aged or the older in similar circumstance.         
	On the other hand, Jet committed the grave mistake of kicking out people without easing them to an exit. It was in your face and for all to see. This is the prime difference between the furore Jet faced and the leave-without-pay policy the government carriers have mooted.         
	Civil aviation is an industry with harsh economics. It should have been somebodys job at Jet to get that point across to its people and tailor the exit accordingly. To its credit, Jet does not appear to have done anything illegal yet. The labour secretary has been quoted as saying 700 of the 1,900 sacked people were probationers; the ministry was examining the balance.         
	The cost of reinstating the employees will not be borne by the politicians. It will be Jets onus, failing which it could become a tiny part of that burden on the exchequer being hinted at  the bailout package for Indias airlines.         
	Was forcing this the crux of the drama? If so, the essence of Indias economic philosophy would begin to match the American attitude to Wall Streets greed. There and here, the taxpayer pays.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deoras comments were amazing in this context. He disapproved Jets job cuts and highlighted its default on fuel bills at the same time. Wasnt Jet addressing internal costs to pay such pressing bills? Thats what it would seem to the lay observer.         
	Praful Patel, the civil aviation minister, kept distance from the drama initially, then reversed track.         
	Vijay Mallya played his cards safely. He may have aligned with Naresh Goyal, but he made announcements very unlike Jets and after Jet had drawn flak for its harder stance.         
	The outcomes for Jet and Kingfisher are contrasting. For an airline that was once the finest in the country, Jets fall from grace would be hard to repair.        
	Going by what has been reported in the media, the airline is now many things it wasnt  in financial difficulty and shadowed by politics. Not a good thing for any brand even if this overnight soap involving politicians, businessmen and a cast of hundreds was doubted for authenticity.

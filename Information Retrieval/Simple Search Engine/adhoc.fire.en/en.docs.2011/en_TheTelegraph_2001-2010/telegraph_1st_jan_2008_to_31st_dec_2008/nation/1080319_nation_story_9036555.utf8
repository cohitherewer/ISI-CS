	Raipur/Hyderabad, March 18: Seventeen Maoist guerrillas returning from a forest meeting near the Andhra-Chhattisgarh border were shot dead in an encounter early today.        
	Police said Andhras Greyhound commandos encircled the group of 40 on a tip-off from Chhattisgarh police and gunned down 14 Maoists, including seven women, in a two-hour encounter near Pamed, 500km south of Raipur.        
	Three others were killed while fleeing into the forests in Bijapur district. The commandos were alerted after Salwa Judum tribals tipped off the police that a massive Maoist congregation was under way in the area.        
	The operation was conducted by the Greyhounds while Chhattisgarh police provided strategic support and guided the personnel to the place where the rebels were camping, Bastar IG R.K. Vij said.        
	According to Bijapur police superintendent Ankit Garg, the commandos ringed the area where the Maoists had put up and plugged most of the escape routes. The rebels did not get much chance to retaliate, he said.        
	Some 10 guerrillas were seriously wounded, he said. All 17 bodies have been found and are being identified. There were no casualties among the Greyhounds.        
	A cache of weapons that included 17 rifles, three AK-47s and three SLRs was seized from the spot. Some cash was also found. The police said top commanders could be among the victims as they generally carried AK-47s.

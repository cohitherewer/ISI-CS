          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, May 26: Police today arrested seven persons in Etah district for allegedly running a fake arms licence racket that could have helped Naxalites procure guns from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Etah senior superintendent of police S.K. Singh said arms had been purchased using the fake licenses made by the arrested seven.         
	They had duplicate rubber stamps of the Etah district magistrate. The signature of the licensing officer had also been neatly forged, the officials said. They were being interrogated to establish links with Naxalite arms dealers.        
	The police have also sealed a gun dealers shop that allegedly sold firearms against fake licences.         
	We have sealed one arms shop, the Raj Gun House, from where at least 48 firearms were sold against fake licences in the last three years. When we got in touch with the CID of Bihar police, we learnt that some of the weapons seized from Naxalites there were bought from shops in Etah, S.K. Singh said.         
	We suspect some of these weapons, purchased using dubious gun licences, have gone to the Naxalites.         
	The Uttar Pradesh director-general of police, Vikram Singh, has ordered scrutiny of records of all the 155 licensed arms dealers shops in Etah district, which is close to Aligarh.         
	A spokesman of the DGPs office said the adjoining districts of Mainpuri and Etawah could also come under the scanner as arms dealers have shops there, too.         
	The tip-off on the arms licence racket came from Bihar last month when a police team from there landed in Etah.        
	Bihar police had seized some weapons from Naxalites in their state that they said were purchased from the western Uttar Pradesh district.         
	The police raided Jaishree Arms Store along with their Bihar counterparts. The owner of the shop was a resident of Nalanda district in Bihar and a raid was conducted by another Bihar police team at his house in Nalanda town.         
	There, the police seized five rifles, one single-barrel and three double-barrel guns that were to be sold to customers who had furnished fake licence. The owner of the store was arrested in Nalanda.         
	The police in Uttar Pradesh found out, in the meantime, that the weapons were not accounted for in the stocks register at the shop.         
	This month, the police found out that Raj Gun House had sold 48 firearms against fake licences.         
	The shop had allegedly bought five rifles from a bigger arms dealer, Shiv Traders, in Kanpur in June 2007. But the shop failed to account for these in its records, the police said. Similar irregularities were detected regarding 25 other guns, purchased from different dealers.         
	Raj Gun House had also purchased 18 single-barrel guns from Bajrang Traders, another big dealer in Kanpur.         
	Investigators also found that the purchase orders issued by the district magistrate to the bigger arms dealer had also been tampered with. The police are planning to prosecute the owner of Raj Gun House.         
	Although the Naxalites mostly snatch weapons from the police, they also buy from the market, for which they need arms licences. But a licence issued from a district magistrates office can be used only within that district.         
	Police officials on the case said the fake gun licence racket would have started at the district level.         
	These licences are converted into national permits by another group of operators in the state headquarter in Lucknow, officials said.         
	It is not proper to think that the entire lot of Naxalites shop for weapons in Etah. But they look for weapons in the licensed arms shops in the districts like Etah, Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and Bhind, Morena in Madhya Pradesh where a large number of arms shops are located, said one intelligence officer here.

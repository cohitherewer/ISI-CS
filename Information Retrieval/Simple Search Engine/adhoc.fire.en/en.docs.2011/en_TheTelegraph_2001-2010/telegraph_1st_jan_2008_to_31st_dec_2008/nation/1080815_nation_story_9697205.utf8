          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: The pay hike announced by the Centre today has gladdened the armed forces but the services headquarters are still working out if the new salary structure will stem the rash of resignations from middle-rank (colonel- and brigadier-equivalent) officers.         
	Senior armed forces officers had pointed to more than 100 offers to resign from middle-rung officers to illustrate that the recommendations of the sixth pay commission were disappointing and many were availing of the option of quitting after 20 years in service for more paying jobs in the corporate sector.         
	Even as more details are awaited, prima facie, all the concerns of the defence forces appear to have been suitably addressed, said the chief of naval staff and the chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Sureesh Mehta.         
	The defence ministry expects to assuage middle-rank officers by placing colonel- and brigadier-equivalent officers in a higher pay band (Pay Band 4) than that recommended by the pay commission. However, in the Union cabinet today, the structure of the pay band has been revised downwards from Rs 39,200-Rs 67,000 to Rs 37,400-Rs 67,000.         
	Officers and soldiers are still looking for a clearer analysis of the new pay structure from their headquarters.        
	Headquarters pay and accounts staff were deciphering the import of todays cabinet decision and it is only in the next week that a breakdown of the salaries of the troops will be circulated.         
	The navy chief did note, however, that the government had addressed the demand for an increase in military service pay (MSP). Increase in MSP of personnel below officer ranks and compensation for middle-rung officers are particularly heartening, he said.         
	Among the other proposals approved for the armed forces are:         
	 Grade pay of major general/joint secretary equivalent to be raised to Rs 11,000 and that of lieutenant general/joint secretary equivalent to be Rs 13,000 per month         
	 Increase in military service pay of personnel below officer rank from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 per month         
	 Three guaranteed promotions under an Assured Career Progression scheme for personnel below officer rank after eight, 16 and 24 years of service         
	 Enhanced grade pay of middle-level officers (from captain to brigadier)  lieutenants Rs 5,400; captains Rs 6,100; majors Rs 6,600; lieutenant colonels Rs 7,600; colonels Rs 8,700 and brigadiers Rs 8,900         
	 Lieutenant generals who have been overlooked for army commander-equivalent posts to be placed in the fixed Rs 80,000 per month grade         
	 Rates of special forces allowance for army and air force to be equated with the navys marine commando (Marcos) allowance.        
	 A ratio of 1:2 in allowances for personnel below officer rank and officers is to be maintained. For example, if a high-altitude allowance for an officer is Rs 6,000, a soldier in the same place will be given Rs 3,000.

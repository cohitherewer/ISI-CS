          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajanikanth                                  
	Chennai, April 7: Rajanikanth has denied maligning Kannadigas over the Hogenkal controversy but, faced with a ban threat, is willing to apologise anyway.        
	If senior artistes in Karnataka, like Ambarish and Vishnu Vardan, feel I had said something really offensive or demeaning against Kannadigas, I will not hesitate to apologise, the Tamil film superstar told a Kannada TV channel yesterday.        
	Pro-Kannada groups have threatened to ban Rajanikanths films in Karnataka unless he apologises for his anti-Kannadiga remarks at a recent protest here that took Tamil Nadus side in the Hogenkal dispute  the latest inter- state row over the Cauvery waters.        
	I had only condemned the arsonists who tried to burn buses and those who attacked movie theatres (in Karnataka) and only cautioned against those who tried to make political capital of the issue, the actor told the Bangalore-based TV channel.        
	There was nothing in my remarks to hurt the sentiments of Kannadigas as a whole, he added, saying a ban on his films would hurt his fans in Karnataka more than him.        
	Rajanikanth, a Marathi born in Bangalore, had attended Fridays public fast in Chennai where the local film industry protested against pro-Kannada groups ban on Tamil films in Karnataka.        
	He had then accused poll-bound Karnatakas politicians of stoking passions over the project, which involves Tamil Nadu drawing Cauvery waters beyond its tribunal allocation.        
	Shiv Sena-run newspaper Saamna had then lauded the actor for standing by his karambhoomi (place of work) rather than his birthplace and advised Amitabh Bachchan  accused of favouring Uttar Pradesh over Maharashtra to learn from him.

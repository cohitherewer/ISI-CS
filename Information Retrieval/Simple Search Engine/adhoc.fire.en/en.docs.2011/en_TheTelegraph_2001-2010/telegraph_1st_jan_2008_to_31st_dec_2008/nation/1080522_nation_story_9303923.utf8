          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 21: The Indian Army today gave a note to its Pakistani counterpart registering a strong protest against what it said was a violation of the ceasefire along the Line of Control on Monday.         
	Officers of the two armies held a flag meeting at a post in the Mendhar sector of Kashmir, not far from where a soldier was killed in the firing on Monday.         
	The army registered its protest even as foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee was talking peace in Islamabad.         
	The Indian and Pakistani delegations at the talks noted that the ceasefire along the LoC had held since November 2003 and both sides hoped it would continue.         
	But in Delhi, there were questions from within the military establishment about Pakistans intentions after three incidents of ceasefire violation in the last two weeks.         
	Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said after firing in the Tangdhar sector on May 13 that it was worrisome.         
	Both governments say they do not want the ceasefire to unravel but the armies are not so certain. Indian Army sources in Delhi said that as usual, Pakistan has denied that it violated the ceasefire.         
	But the Indian officer at the flag meeting, Colonel Manish Kumar, was understood to have given evidence of the firing to his counterpart, Colonel S. Malik.         
	The flag meeting was held at the Roshni post in Poonch district. The Indian side said the Dhip post was targeted with small firearms, grenades and rockets and a soldier of the 2/8 Gorkha Rifles was killed.         
	In Delhi, one officer said the incident was near Salotri, one of the villages closest to the LoC, where firing was frequent before the ceasefire.         
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said after talks with Pakistans foreign secretary Salman Bashir yesterday, both sides made it clear that they attach great importance to the ceasefire and they want to make it hold.

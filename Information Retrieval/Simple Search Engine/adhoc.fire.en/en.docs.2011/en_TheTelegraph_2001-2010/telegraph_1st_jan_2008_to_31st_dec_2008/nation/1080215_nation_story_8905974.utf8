	Mother of all long drives, for a cause    
	As far as drives go, this one is truly a long haul, with pit stops in 30 countries spread across seven continents. Except, it is meant to send people on a green overdrive.    
	Sreenivasa Rao and Gnanasekharan, who will take turns behind the wheel in their Hyundai car, are on a mission to warn countries about the dangers of global warming, the need to reduce emissions and protect forests.    
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi handed the drivers a huge, symbolic key as he flagged off the marathon from the Marina sands recently. The Korean car company has gifted the sedan, which was driven down the Tamil Nadu coast to Tuticorin before being loaded on a ship to the US.    
	In New York, the 40-year-old globetrotters will meet UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and then resume the odyssey that is supposed to take them through more than a lakh kilometres. The duo plan to return home in April 2009.     
	hey have another responsibility, too: Karunanidhi wants them to raise awareness about the perils of nuclear weapons.     
	Games push to green drive        
	Games push to green battle    
	The Delhi government is in a sweat over parks, rather the lack of it, ahead of the Commonwealth Games.    
	The Sheila Dikshit cabinet, concerned the capital didnt have enough green cover, recently cleared a plan to set up a parks and gardens society. The body will be tasked with pushing authorities at MCD, controlled by the BJP, to spruce up existing parks and plant more trees.     
	It will also hand grants to resident associations and experts to maintain the green spaces, Dikshit added. The aim is to convert the green enclaves into tourist magnets for the Games in 2010.    
	 quot;Nearly 14,000 of the 15,000 parks and gardens are not well maintained. There is scope for raising the green cover in these spaces, quot; Dikshit said after the meeting where the garden society plan was green-lighted.    
	Cough leaves ribs cracked    
	Gayatri Wagle was like many who believe that a sore throat is nothing more than a mild passing affliction.     
	The 45-year-old family law advocate woke up one morning with cough last month.     
	After throwing up and wheezing continuously, she returned to bed. But once she lay down, she felt an unbearable pain in her chest, one that made it impossible for her to sit up straight.     
	A trip to the family physician and a radiologist revealed that she had cracked her eighth rib bone while coughing.    
	Initially I thought it was just muscle pain. I went to a doctor only when I couldnt stand, said Gayatri, who had the cough for eight days before the fracture. The lesson is the syrup is to be taken immediately, before the problem forces one to cough up a huge medical bill.         
	Perfect vision    
	At 20, Vishes Kothari has won himself the title of a visionary.    
	The student of Delhis elite St Stephens College has bagged the prestigious Habitat Young Visionary Award, winning a summer fellowship at the University of Cambridge.     
	Organised by the India Habitat Centre and National Geographic here, the award saw five college students battle it out, each speaking at length about their vision for India.     
	Indian Institute of Technology (Chennai) student Sayan Ganguly stressed the need to inject creativity in to Indias education system. Others spoke about gender sensitivity.     
	ut Kothari, with his ideas on how to eliminate the rot of rote learning in education, was the winner hands down.

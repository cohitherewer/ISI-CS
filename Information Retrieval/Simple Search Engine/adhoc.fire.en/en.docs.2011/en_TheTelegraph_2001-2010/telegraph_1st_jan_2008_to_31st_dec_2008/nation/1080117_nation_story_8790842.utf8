	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: Rural and minority students studying in city colleges would soon get an opportunity to match up to their counterparts with the help of remedial classes. 
    
	In a letter received by the city branch office of Ranchi University today, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked city colleges to introduce these remedial classes in their respective educational institutions for different subjects. 
    
	The classes are designed with the objective to help students with weak academic profile to match up to the performance level of their more proficient counterparts. 
    
	The remedial classes would run parallel with the degree course for students. 
    
	We have been asked to send a list of candidates who would benefit from introduction of these courses. With the right kind of help, they can actually match up to the performance of their fellow classmates, said S.S Razi, the co-ordinator of the university branch office in city. 
    
	Based on the list forwarded by the respective constituent colleges, the university would then recommend the names to the University Grants Commission, which will also take into account the feasibility of running the courses in all the centres. 
    
	These remedial classes are a common feature in all the states, and the results suggest that the introduction of these classes in the academic structure has helped, said Razi. 
    
	Help would be extended to students who are into off beat courses like Christianity and Buddhism. Students who are learning about religion and similar lesser-known subjects need help and more attention to will be given to them. 
    
	It will definitely help the students who hail from financially weaker backgrounds and are unable to attend private tuition to come out with flying colours, said Razi. 
    
	The branch office, which controls all constituent and affiliated colleges under the Ranchi University in the Kolhan region, would soon despatch the notice to all colleges in its jurisdiction. 
    
	This is the first time that the UGC has sent in the directive to this part of the state.

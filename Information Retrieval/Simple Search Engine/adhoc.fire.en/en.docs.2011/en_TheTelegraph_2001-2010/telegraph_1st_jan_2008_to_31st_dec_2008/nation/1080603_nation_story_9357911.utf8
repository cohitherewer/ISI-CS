	New Delhi, June 2: A breakthrough in the negotiations on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project appears imminent, the impetus coming from Chinas keenness to join and Pakistans own soaring demand for fuel.        
	A pact could be finalised before the fifth round of India-Pakistan composite dialogue in July, external affairs ministry officials said, adding both countries were moving in the right direction.         
	The dialogue itself hasnt got anything to do with the pipeline but the $7.5-billion project is seen as a confidence-building measure between the neighbours.        
	China, too, has shown interest and while Pakistan has been keen to get that country on board, Iran insists the pipeline should reach India first, the ministry officials said.        
	Visiting Delhi in April, Irananian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had sounded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about Pakistans proposal to involve China.        
	For India, the main sticking points with Pakistan have been the transit fee, the pipelines security and assurance of uninterrupted gas supplies, the officials said.         
	These are the issues to be addressed. Pakistan is keen on resolving them at the earliest, an official said.        
	Islamabad has been pushing the project in a series of meetings with Iran, the latest being the discussions between Shafkat Saeed, Pakistans ambassador to Iran, and Ali Kordan, the Iranian deputy oil minister, last week.

	Ahmedabad, Sept. 11: Gujarat has kept on hold a proposal to allow schoolchildren to write exams with their books open following an uproar on the feasibility of the system.        
	Government spokesperson Jaynarayan Vyas maintained the system would be introduced, but only after consulting educators and parents.        
	The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board had triggered a controversy on Monday by announcing that the Open Book Examination system for Classes VIII, IX and X would be introduced in the current academic year.         
	Board chairman Rohit Pathak had claimed that no clearance was required from the government to implement the system.         
	Board sources said Pathak had taken the cue from Narendra Modis Teachers Day speech where the chief minister had emphasised the need for open-book examinations.        
	Pathak argued that the system would benefit weaker students and was aimed at curtailing the high failure rate among students taking the Class X exam. The idea is to take the fear out of exams, he said.         
	The board said that under the new burden and exam-free system, children would not be required to memorise, and would be allowed to carry only the textbook of the subject to the examination centre.         
	The open-book exam will not test students memory skills but their application abilities, it said. The three-hour examination will have two parts  objective questions worth 60 marks and subjective questions of 40 marks.        
	All subjects are to be divided into three groups. There will be a language group which would include Gujarati, English and either Hindi or Sanskrit, Pathak said. Another group will be that of the core subjects like math, science and social science. The third group will have auxiliary subjects like computers, drawing and physical education.         
	Students, according to Pathak, would not face any problem since there would be no change in the syllabus. The question setters would be selected through a test.         
	Educators were sceptical about the hasty decision. The new format, they argued, should have been implemented in select schools on an experimental basis since students were not exposed to the open-book system and were conditioned to write exams accordingly.

     RASHEED KIDWAI
               
	Bhopal, Feb. 4: Madhya Pradesh is hoping mothers can do what the cane cant.
    
	The vice-chancellor of Barkatullah University, the states largest, has planned a convention where he will urge mothers to dissuade erring sons and daughters to kick the copying habit.
    
	Like neighbour Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh is notorious for rampant cheating during examinations  sometimes with the knowledge of supervisors. 
    
	Measures like hiring retired police officers and flying squads to keep an eye on students as well as stringent penalties if caught cheating have failed to curb the menace.
    
	A common sight at many centres is students leaning out of windows and passing question papers to friends waiting outside. 
    
	There have also been cases where courier boys were seen rushing back and forth with answers and question papers while college authorities looked the other way.
    
	By organising the convention, vice-chancellor Bhopal Singh hopes he will be able to replicate the success of an experiment he had undertaken as Ujjain collector in 2001. He had organised saas-bahu sammelans to resolve family disputes, encourage birth control and push vaccination and safe motherhood campaigns. 
    
	Women are the best carriers of social messages, he said.
    
	Singh wants to start the anti-copying campaign with an interactive session on February 21 with mothers of school and college students. 
    
	 We want to listen to their suggestions and formulate a joint strategy, he said.
    
	The vice-chancellor said he would spread the message  that mothers disapprove of exam malpractice  through television and billboards. 
    
	 I have reasons to believe that it will have a sobering influence on college and university students, Singh said.

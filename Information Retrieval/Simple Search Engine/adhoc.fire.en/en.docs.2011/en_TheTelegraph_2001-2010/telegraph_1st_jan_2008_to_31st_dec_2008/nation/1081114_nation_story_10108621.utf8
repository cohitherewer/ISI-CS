          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The rural development ministry has decided to make the central job scheme more transparent and accountable by monitoring wage payments and addressing workers complaints.        
	The move comes days after the UPA got a rap on the knuckles from the Comptroller and Auditor General over its flagship programme.        
	As a first step, the ministry has sent letters to all state governments, asking them to make it mandatory to pay workers wages through accounts in banks and post offices.         
	The CAG had said in its report that the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had failed to make the desired impact. The reasons listed were poor maintenance of records, delayed payment of wages and non-payment of unemployment allowances.        
	The ministry is considering a proposal to set up independent grievance redress mechanisms through lok adalats in consultation with the National Legal Services Authority for those seeking 100 days job in a year. Toll-free helplines may also be started.         
	To make the scheme more transparent, the ministry plans to ask the IITs, IIMs and universities to make independent appraisals in various states.        
	The CAG had pointed out instances of laxity on the part of authorities in issuing job cards to below-poverty-line households. The report had said that since the rural employment guarantee act was a central legislation, the rural development ministry should accept the responsibility of co-ordinating and monitoring its administration.        
	It should also ensure economical, efficient and effective utilisation of funds provided by the central government, it had said.         
	In its letter, the ministry has asked states to be vigilant in ensuring that funds for the programme are not misused and to initiate a time-bound scheme to affix photographs to existing job cards so that chances of corruption are minimal.

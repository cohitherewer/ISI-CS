	Calcutta, Oct. 12: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today told the partys central committee that the chances of forging an anti-BJP, anti-Congress secular alliance at the national level looked bleak.         
	Sources said Karats comments suggested that he would focus on finding allies among regional parties.        
	Karat said elections can be held anytime. But he made it clear that the chances of forming a pre-poll platform at the central level are remote, a central committee member said.        
	With the Samajwadi Party in the Congress camp and Mayavati non-committal, CPM leaders denied having thought of sewing up a secular alliance with the Uttar Pradesh chief minister as candidate for Prime Minister.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sketches of three Ahmedabad blast suspects released by police on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The ban on student outfit Simi, lifted yesterday by a high court tribunal, is back in place.        
	The Supreme Court today stayed the tribunals order after an urgent plea by the Centre that the controversial group, blamed for the recent serial blasts, would use the opportunity to regroup and intensify its communal and anti-national activities.        
	Additional solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam told the court the tribunal had ignored the evidence placed before it ignored intelligence inputs evidence of 77 witnesses and did not go into the merits of the evidence.        
	At least 10 states have also deposed before it. Surely, there must be some material to it, he said. The tribunal order has serious consequences and should be immediately stayed.        
	A two-judge apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, immediately issued notices to Simi to present its case before it.         
	The designated tribunal under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, had yesterday overturned a February 2008 central government notification banning Simi, or the Students Islamic Movement of India, an organisation believed to be working towards replacing the concept of a nation state with an international Islamic order.        
	Simi had yesterday welcomed the tribunals order saying successive governments had prosecuted it merely on half-baked suspicions, not on any evidence.         
	Under the law, the Centre has to within 30 days of notifying a ban refer it to a tribunal set up under the act for deciding whether the ban was justified or not.        
	Subramaniam today told the apex court several people were in custody in connection with offences under the act and objected to the tribunal not recording a finding on whether there was a cause for banning the outfit.        
	The tribunal did not record a finding on whether there was a cause or not, he said and added that it had overturned the ban on the ground that the government note justifying it had been compiled almost a month after the notification was issued.         
	The tribunal has used earlier precedents of the VHP and the Bajrang Dal to justify its decision, he said, referring to the post-Ayodhya ban on the two Hindu outfits that was overturned.        
	We understand your problem, Balakrishnan told the government, minutes before passing the stay order.        
	In a petition filed later in the day, the Centre claimed that Simi did not believe in Indian nationalism, or the Constitution, or a secular order, regarded idol worship as a sin and that its holy duty (was) to end such idol worship.        
	The government also blamed the outfit for the Malegoan and Ghatkopar bomb blasts.

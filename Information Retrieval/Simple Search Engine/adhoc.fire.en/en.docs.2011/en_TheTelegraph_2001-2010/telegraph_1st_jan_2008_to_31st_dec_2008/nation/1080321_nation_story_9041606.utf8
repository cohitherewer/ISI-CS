          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 20: It would be his first free steps after 16 years of confinement in a 24sqft cell if district administration offers Bikash Mohanty financial assistance for his treatment.         
	The 35-year-old has been in confinement since 1993, when he was diagnosed mentally unstable and showed signs of violent behaviour and hysteria.        
	Bikashs father, Baman Mohanty, a retired Grade-VI government employee in Orissa, could barely bear the cost of his treatment and get his four daughters married off.         
	I tried my best to get him cured. My savings were drained in trying to marry-off my four daughters and in providing psychiatric treatment for my son, said a visibly broken Baman.        
	When Bikash first developed the symptoms he underwent treatment at a mental institute in Cuttack.         
	With little signs of improvement, doctors suggested prolonged medication besides shock therapy for the 35-year-old. But costs were too high, Baman said.         
	I have no money left to treat Bikash. As his bouts of insanity increased, he started to disturb the neighbours and I was forced to cage him. He would often turn hysteric and would display violent behaviour, said the helpless father.        
	Media reports on Bikashs confinement followed and the district administration woke up to the issue recently  an irony considering the fact that the mans home is a stones throw away from the residences of the district collector and the superintendent of police.        
	We were not aware of the matter. It was only after Baman sought assistance last week that the administration came to know about his condition, said Kendrapara collector Kashinath Sahu.        
	The district administration seems willing to bear the treatment costs of Bikash. Probably we will send him to Central Institute of Psychiatry or to Rinpas in Ranchi. We are trying to sort the process out. The official procedures have started and might take a week or so, said Sahu.        
	Till that happens Bikashs home would be the single-window cell with an attached toilet. Till the time Bikash is free, the 35-year-old would spend his time gazing out of his grilled windows. Staring at the open sky is what he has been doing for years now.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 24: A street dog mauled a 13-month-old baby to death in a slum on Sunday, metres from the steel-and-glass buildings of Hyderabads IT corridor.        
	Gopal, son of day labourers Argotu Batiya and Sakri, was sleeping on a mat on the floor of their one-room tenement in Madhapur, Hitec City, when the dog sneaked in. Mother Sakri had gone to the market to buy vegetables, leaving the door ajar.        
	By the time the babys screams attracted his maternal uncle Balu from the neighbourhood, the dog had bitten his right hand off and was chewing on it.        
	Balu tried to shoo the animal away but it would not let go of its prey and dragged the baby a few yards outside the room. It finally ran away when Balu threw a stick.        
	The uncle took Gopal to Osmania General Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Officers said the animal later bit two other children before it was trapped by municipal dog-catchers. Dogs have been posing a danger to Hitec City after the government built a garbage dump in the area.        
	In January, a three-year-old baby had fallen into a water tank and drowned while being chased by dogs in the city.

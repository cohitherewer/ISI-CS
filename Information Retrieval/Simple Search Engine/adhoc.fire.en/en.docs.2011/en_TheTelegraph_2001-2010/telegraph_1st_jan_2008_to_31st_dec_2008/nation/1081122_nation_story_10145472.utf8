          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: Former BCCI president Sharad Pawar moved the Supreme Court today seeking to quash a perjury case that Calcutta High Court has directed to be filed against him.         
	Pawars petition also sought an interim stay till the apex court hears his challenge to the November 12 order.         
	Five other former and present BCCI officials, against whom Calcutta High Court had sought perjury proceedings, will move the apex court later, sources said.         
	Pawar said in the petition the order against him was passed ex parte, without giving him an opportunity to defend himself. This, he said, was a violation of the principles of natural justice.         
	The high court order came on a petition filed by Jagmohan Dalmiya accusing six BCCI office-bearers of filing a false affidavit to justify his expulsion from the cricket board in 2006.        
	Action was directed against BCCI president Shashank Manohar, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, secretary N. Srinivasan, vice-president Chirayu Amin and former secretary Niranjan Shah.         
	Dalmiya had asked the court to initiate contempt action against the six after the bench set aside his expulsion as illegal.         
	The court held that the office-bearers had falsely stated that the amendment, which empowered them to expel Dalmiya, was registered on time with the Chennai Registrar of Societies. Dalmiyas counsel claimed that the amended Clause V of Rule 38 had not been registered on time. Under the rules, it has to be registered within three months of passing the amendment.

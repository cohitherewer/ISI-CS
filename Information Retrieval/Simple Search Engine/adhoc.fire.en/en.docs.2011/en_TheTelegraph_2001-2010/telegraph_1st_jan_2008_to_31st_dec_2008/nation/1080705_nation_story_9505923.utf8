          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Gaya, July 4: RJD chief Lalu Prasad while addressing reporters today assured those gathered that the Left was not as foolish to let a secular alliance fall apart.        
	The RJD, an important component of the UPA alliance, hoped that the government would survive the nuclear deal crisis to complete its full term in the office. The RJD resolution has favoured the deal and dubbed it as a must for growth.         
	Lalu Prasad, while briefing reporters on resolutions passed at the national executive committee meeting of the RJD, commented: Left utna bewakoof nahin hai jitna ap samajhte hain (The Left are not as foolish as one understands them to be). He added that they would not bring down a secular government at a crucial moment when communal forces were trying to get to the centre stage of Indian politics.         
	The deal will be inked and the govt will survive, said an optimist Lalu. We will get uranium for power generation from where it is available, he added. Allaying apprehensions of Indias subjugation to the US, Lalu, in his inimitable style said: Divorce is always an option if something goes wrong.         
	During his media briefing, the RJD chief also reminded the congregation that Narendra Modi and not Advani was the real face of the BJP.         
	Accusing the BJP and its leaders of double speak, Lalu said the party remembered Ram before polls and Advani wears the secular mask in Pakistan and plays the communal card back home.         
	Lalu added that his party was ready to sacrifice and forge alliances to promote secular politics and he made a special reference to the Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav as a future ally.         
	The RJD chief also alleged that the state government was sabotaging centres developmental schemes, including National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Sarva Shikchha Abhiyan.

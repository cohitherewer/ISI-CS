	Srinagar, April 24 (PTI): Cable operators in the Kashmir Valley today stopped all telecast to protest a ban on Pakistani TV channels.         
	The Congresss coalition partner PDP and the Opposition National Conference said the government order made no sense.        
	The cable operators association said all national and international TV channels have been taken off the air as a mark of protest against the government imposing the ban on some channels.        
	Srinagar district magistrate Sheikh Aijaz Iqbal had yesterday asked cable operators to stop relaying PTV, Geo and Aaj, saying permission of the information and broadcasting ministry was required for telecast.

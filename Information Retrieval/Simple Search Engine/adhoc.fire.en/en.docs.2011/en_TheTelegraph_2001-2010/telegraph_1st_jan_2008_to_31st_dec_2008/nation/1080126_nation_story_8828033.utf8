     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 25: First it was the Katihar administration to order culling of chicken at six Azamnagar panchyats adjoining Maldah, now Purnea administration has asked people not to eat chicken and eggs as precaution. 
    
	Purnea regional deputy director of health R.D. Ranjan today said: As culling is being carried out in the adjoining Katihar, we thought it was proper to sound an alert. 
    
	Bihar, however, has not reported any incident of bird flu as yet. And no other district has put a bar on eating chicken or eggs in Bihar. Chicken sale has dipped in Patna while in Purnea, Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj  sales have dived. Rapid response teams are working across the state to prevent the spread of the deadly H5-N1 bird flu virus from neighbouring Bengal. Nine of West Bengals 19 districts are in the grip of the bird flu. 
    
	Ranjan said with Bengal culling chicken in large numbers, there was every reason for the neighbouring state to take preventive measures, even thought they come at the expense of trade. Bihar has already banned chicken from Bengal.

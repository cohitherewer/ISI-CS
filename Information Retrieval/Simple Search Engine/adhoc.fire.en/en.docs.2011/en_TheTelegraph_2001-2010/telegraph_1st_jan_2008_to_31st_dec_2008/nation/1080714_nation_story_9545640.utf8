	Patna, July 13: The pressure of swirling waters on embankments is building up with rains beating down upon southern Nepal and north Bihar plains  home to rivers that played havoc in the state last year.         
	Sources in the water resources department said the situation in West and East Kusheshwarsthan blocks was alarming. The embankment in Ladaho panchayat near Katiya Mushari has weakened due to the currents of the Kamala. Similarly, the western embankment of the Kamala in Tardih has weakened at some points.         
	All the places fall in north Bihars Saharsa, Madhepura and Supaul regions referred to as the Kosi belt.         
	In Darbhanga, the worst-hit region in last years floods, rivers are flowing below the danger level, but the level has been on a rise with passing day, the flood management information system of the water resources department said.         
	As of now, the Bagmati is flowing only 3.09m below the danger level at Hayaghat, 1.92m below the danger level at Kamtoul and 2.46m below the danger level at Ekmighat.        
	Darbhanga district magistrate Arun Kumar said adequate measures such as food arrangement and stocking of essential items like medicines, boats and polythene sheets have been taken.

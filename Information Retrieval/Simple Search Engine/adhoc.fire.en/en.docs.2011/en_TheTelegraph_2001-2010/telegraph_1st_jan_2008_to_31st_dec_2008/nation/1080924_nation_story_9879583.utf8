	New York, Sept. 23: Travelling through four continents and crossing the Atlantic on his first visit to the US after three years, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may be feeling as if he has not left New Delhi.        
	If the Prime Minister had hoped to get rid of the babus on Raisina Hill and planned to benefit from the wisdom of his close friend and fellow economist Professor Jagdish Bhagwati in New York on the tsunami of Americas current financial woes, he is sorely disappointed.        
	A huge segment of the Government of India has preceded Singh and travelled to New York to be here during the Prime Ministers four-and-a-half-day stay in the US. (See chart)         
	Among the visitors are public sector bigwigs representing conventional energy giants such as the National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Power Grid Corporation and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in an assertion of Indias proximity to the US after the UPAs divorce from the Left and its objection to closer ties with America.        
	The joke among protocol officials making arrangements at the New York Palace hotel here, where Indian Prime Ministers have stayed for almost a decade, is about the heavy presence of Indians representing the countrys conventional, non-nuclear power sector during Singhs visit which is focused on the nuclear deal in public minds.        
	Officials rib each other that if the nuclear deal is not operationalised during Singhs journey from here to the White House on Thursday, the captains of Indias conventional, non-nuclear power industry are at hand to boost the Prime Ministers confidence that they can meet the countrys energy needs even if the deal is delayed.        
	Deal moves to Senate        
	At one stage on Tuesday, hopes raised yesterday  that the nuclear package would be attached to a continuing resolution to fund the US federal governments budget until November  appeared to suffer a setback.        
	Christopher Dodd, the pro-deal Democratic senator who was standing in for the even more pro-deal vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden, could not initially preside over todays meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which decided on sending the nuclear deal to the Senate floor.        
	Dodd was called away but he returned midway to make a decisive thrust in favour of the deal. The foreign relations committee eventually cleared the deal 19-2 and sent it to the full Senate, lifting a big cloud over the finalisation of the agreement while the Prime Minister is in America.        
	Committee sources said Dodd, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was needed for congressional work on the $700-billion financial rescue package that is now facing resistance on Capitol Hill.         
	Some of the 12 senators who voted against the Hyde Act for enabling the nuclear deal in 2006 are said to have held a meeting last night and authorised West Virginias veteran Democratic Senator Robert Byrd to hold up the deal package which President George W. Bush sent to the US Congress on September 10.        
	Byrd is not dependent on Indian Americans for either campaign funds or other support since West Virginia has few voters or businessmen of Indian origin.         
	During Singhs first visit to New York as Prime Minister in 2004, he spent quality time with his friend Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia University and senior fellow in international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.        
	New to his security-infested job, the Prime Minister then wanted to walk down Madison Avenue with Bhagwati and buy some books at the Barnes and Noble bookstore, but was dissuaded by his Special Protection Group.        
	He eventually gave the list of books he wanted to then national security adviser J.N. Dixit who procured the volumes.        
	Attempting to eat into the Prime Ministers time with Bhagwati in New York this week  and also his time with his daughter Amrit Singh, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union actively fighting Bush policies  are several other prominent Indians who have preceded Singh here.         
	One heavyweight in government, finance minister P. Chidambaram, will be here for a UN meeting that Singh cannot attend.         
	Two other ministers, Anand Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs, and Ashwani Kumar, minister of state for industrial promotion, are also at hand during Singhs stay in New York.

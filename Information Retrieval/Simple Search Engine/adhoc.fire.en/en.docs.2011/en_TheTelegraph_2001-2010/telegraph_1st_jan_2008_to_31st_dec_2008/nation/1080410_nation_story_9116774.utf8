          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Bhubaneswar, April 9: The state government has been pulled up by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India for the spurt in jail escapes in 2006-07 due to absence of proper watch and ward arrangements.         
	A recent CAG report revealed that incidences of escapes had shot up from six in 2002-03 to 15 in 2006-07.         
	In all, 77 prisoners had escaped from jail custody in 43 incidents reported during 2002-07 by making hole in perimeter wall, cutting iron bars, scaling the perimeter wall at night and overpowering staff during treatment at the medical colleges and hospitals.         
	Only 30 prisoners out of 77 could be recaptured by June 2007, while the remaining are still at large.         
	Recurring escapes were noticed in three circle jails  Baripada, Choudwar and Sambalpur  and two district jails  Balasore and Sundargarh  during 2002-07.         
	Though inspector-general (prisons) and his deputy inspected jails after the escape of prisoners, yet effective steps were not taken, observed the CAG report.         
	Identifying poor security arrangements as the main reason for the escapes, the report has stated that 39 hand metal-detectors in 11 jails and 22 walkie-talkie sets in eight jails were found in unserviceable condition during a test check.         
	Also, it was observed that the staff in all the 18 jails had bypassed the annual firing target practice in the past 10 years and dummy exercises were also not conducted.         
	Out of the 18 jails where test checks were undertaken by CAG teams, no arms or ammunition were provided in five jails (Angul, Bhadrak, Rairangpur, Rayagada and Sambalpur).         
	Modern security equipment, such as cellphone jammer, cellphone detector, livewire fencing and metal-detector doors were not available in any of the 18 jails.         
	Proper lighting arrangement was also absent despite a government instruction issued in February 2004.

	Panaji, Nov. 4 (PTI): The Goa education ministers son, Rohit Monserratte, today surrendered to police almost a month after he was accused of raping a minor German girl.         
	Accompanied by his father in a beacon-fitted car, the 21-year-old surrendered before inspector Tushar Vernekar at 12.45pm.         
	Rohit, whose statement was recorded on November 1, went missing after the girls mother lodged a complaint on October 2. The police said he was not arrested on November 1 as the girl had not given her deposition till then.        
	His father Atanasio Monserratte said: This is a frame-up to actually pin me down.

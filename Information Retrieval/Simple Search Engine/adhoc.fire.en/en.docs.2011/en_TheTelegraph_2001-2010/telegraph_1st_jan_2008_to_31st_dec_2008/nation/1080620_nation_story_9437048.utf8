	Guwahati/Itanagar, June 19: Suspected Bodo militants kidnapped former Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Gegong Apangs youngest son from his car just outside Itanagar last evening.        
	Getam, 29, had driven out of the Donyi Polo School of Music, where he was a director, with a teacher of the school around 6.30pm. That was the last time anyone saw them. Getam and Narain Rai were on their way to Guwahati to perform at a concert.        
	Getams black Hyundai Tucson was found at Holongi near the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border, barely 20km from MLA Cottage where the music school is located.        
	The Apang family received a call at 5 this morning, asking for money in return for their sons freedom.        
	We suspect Bodo militants, though we are not sure which group it was. There have been several instances of Bodo groups, operating from the Gohpur area of Assam, kidnapping people for ransom in Arunachal Pradesh, the Papum Pare district superintendent of police, Hibu Tamang, said.        
	Subhas Padi, the watchman at the music school, said Getam and Narain had arrived at the school around 5.30 last evening to rehearse. They left after about an hour.        
	Padi, 45, said Getam had appeared tense for the past few days. Whenever he was in the school, he would insist that the main door was locked.        
	Apangs other son Omak, former Union minister for tourism, said the abduction had proved how unsafe Arunachal had become.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 28: The Orissa crime branch is planning to map the brains of four men suspected to be involved in the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates.         
	The government has granted approval for the tests and two crime branch officers have left for Bangalore to make arrangements for the tests.         
	The men  Bijoy Sanseth, Garnath Chalanseth, Budhha Nayak and Bhaskar Sunamajhi  were arrested on December 14 from Katgarh area in Kandhamal, and till date, have denied all links with the murders.         
	Swami Laxmananda and four of his associates were shot on the night of August 23 at a Jalespeta ashram in Kandhamal.         
	On October 6, Duryodhan Suna Majhi, Sanatan Badamajhi and Munda Badamajhi were nabbed from Kotgarh on similar charges and two guns, two black masks and four black shirts were also recovered from their possession.         
	Sources said 20 more suspects were also detained and are being interrogated, while search operations are on in Kandhamal and Rayagada to nab culprits.         
	However, the prime accused in the murder is yet to be nabbed.         
	Pressure on the crime branch is mounting, as it is running against the one-month deadline given by chief minister Naveen Patnaik for the arrests. Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Shraddhanjali Samiti, a Sangh Parivar outfit, has deferred its call for Orissa Bandh following the assurance of the chief minister.

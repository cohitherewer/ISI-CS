	Minds at war, for business ideas     
	Students played business strategists at a competition last week to come up with the best ideas to boost profits.    
	Sponsored by Tata Indicom, Poseidon  the Business Plan Contest, was part of Parivartan, the annual festival of IIT Delhis management sciences department.    
	The competition, named after the Greek god of the seas, earthquakes and horses, was won by the team from Mumbais National Institute of Industrial Engineering.     
	Top B-schools  IIM Calcutta, the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, Faculty of Management Studies, the Management Development Institute Gurgaon and others  and engineering institutes like IIT Kanpur were in the fray.    
	It is our effort to connect with the youth not only as consumers but to participate in their empowerment. Poseidon helps students showcase entrepreneurial talent, said Vineet Bhatia, Tata Teleservices head of the northern region.     
	Each team had around two weeks to prepare and submit a business idea on the strategy the company should employ to boost profitability, measured in revenues.        
	Sleaze pops up on police site     
	Salacious videos, e-books and music downloads  Mumbai traffic polices website had all this and more but no information on roads, vehicle movement and speed limits.    
	The entertainment wasnt intended. It was the result of a hacking offensive that left the site looking more like a voyeurs forum than a place for instant traffic updates.    
	Until the site was sanitised, visitors to the site were redirected to megainfa.t35.com instead of policemumbai.org.    
	Joint commissioner (traffic) Vijay Kamble initially denied there was a problem. Later, officials in the traffic police headquarters blamed the computer firm responsible for the sites upkeep.     
	ne cop trotted out an explanation made popular by systems engineers: We have been told that the servers are down. Mahesh Murthy, who fixed the problem, said the hacker had blocked the source code.     
	Film fest at NCERT    
	For once, films overshadowed books at a central agency that has become a byword for school course material.    
	Student film producers were invited to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) childrens audio-visual festival, hosted in Delhi for the first time.    
	The festival, which kicked off recently, had instituted awards for films in 10 categories. For the first time, nominations from student producers were invited, said Vasudha Kamat, joint director of the Central Institute of Educational Technology, which is a division of the NCERT.    
	Entries from Saarc nations were screened during the initial two days of the five-day festival, Kamat said, adding this, too, was a first. However, the screenings from these countries did not compete for the awards, she clarified.     
	Direction, audio production, video production, camera work, video script, audio script, video editing, audio recording, set designing and production were some of the categories in which the awards for excellence were given.         
	Cool signal    
	That air-conditioned commute to office on the fast track might not be the mirage it has been all these years.     
	If Lalu Prasad keeps his promise, many office-goers can bid goodbye to the overcrowded compartments and hop on to an air-conditioned local train.    
	The city appears closer to such a service now than it has ever been.     
	We have decided to conduct a pre-feasibility study for introducing a fully air-conditioned service between Mumbai Central and Virar stations on the Western Railway, he said during the railway budget.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani alters taste in babas
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani alters taste in babas
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: L.K. Advanis makeover from rabble-rousing rath yatri to Prime Minister-in-waiting is being reflected in the kind of babas he now hobnobs with.        
	Yoga guru Baba Ramdev and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living fame attended Advanis recent book release in Bhopal at a time the BJP leader has been carefully distancing himself from the strident Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) sadhu babas.        
	Ramdev and Ravi Shankar, familiar faces on TV who have millions of devotees in India and the West, flew to Bhopal for the programme although they were scheduled to travel abroad that night.        
	A grateful Advani arranged a special aircraft to allow his two prize catches to return to Delhi in time for their international flights. The two babas photographs and speeches at the release have been uploaded on Advanis website.        
	This is definitely noteworthy, said a BJP official with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh links. Advani has probably taken a leaf out of Narendra Modis book.        
	Modis relations with the VHP have soured to the extent that its international president, Praveen Togadia, openly campaigned against him in the last Assembly elections.        
	The chief minister, on his part, has rebuffed the VHP and its holy men and established a rapport with spiritual guru Asha Ram Bapu, who has a huge following in Gujarat and outside.        
	Advani, too, has been avoiding the VHP. He gave its ambitious Ram Setu rally in Delhi a miss although all senior BJP leaders and chief ministers (except Modi) turned up at the programme.        
	VHP president Ashok Singhal had earlier announced that the BJP would not be handed over the leadership of the Ram Setu movement. His colleague Acharya Giriraj Kishore even said Advanis involvement had harmed the Ramjanmabhoomi movement in Ayodhya.        
	The new babas, however, dont attack Advani. Unlike the VHP sadhus, they praise his experience, commitment and vision.        
	More important, these babas dont speak the language of communalism and this fits Advanis new quest for a liberal image. He now cannot afford to be seen with those VHP sadhus who used to spout poison against Muslims during the Ayodhya movement.        
	Advani has to reach out to a wider audience, and in a far more sophisticated manner, than the VHP does. The idiom and the message have to be different, a BJP leader said.        
	But party officials deny that the shadow Prime Minister has adopted an attitude of confrontation towards the VHP.        
	Modi may have some personal problems with the VHP but Advaniji doesnt have any, an official said. He would like to take every Sangh parivar outfit along with him. But there has to be some change in style after stepping into (Atal Bihari) Vajpayees shoes.

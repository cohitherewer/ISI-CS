          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	 Mumbai, Aug. 10: From soap to soup.        
	Two actors associated with Ekta Kapoors Balaji Telefilms stepped out of a party late last night and drove straight to lock-up after police booked them for driving under the influence of alcohol.        
	Prabhat Bhattacharya, who plays Ajay in the popular Balaji soap Kahani Ghar Ghar Kii, and Paresh Ganatra, who stars in Baa Bahu Aur Baby, were picked up in Andheri during a weekend crackdown on drink-driving.         
	Another television personality, whom the police identified as Abid Abiz, was also arrested, but it was not immediately clear if he is from the Balaji camp, too.        
	Yes, we have booked them on the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. We dont keep a list of Page 3 regulars, but some of those identified were these three. Their licences and cars were confiscated and they would be produced before a court tomorrow, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Harish Baijal.        
	The soap stars were stopped reportedly after they left a party at Ekta Kapoors house last night.        
	An award-winning theatre actor, Ganatra acted in Paresh Rawals acclaimed play Andhalo Pato before starring in several serials, including Ek Mahal Ho Sapno Ka and Baa Bahu Aur Baby.        
	He won the award for best supporting actor for his role in Baa Bahu Aur Baby and has also acted in films like No Entry.        
	The police campaign against drink-driving has come in the wake of a series of hit-and-run accidents, especially on weekends.         
	A 42-year-old executive driving a Mercedes was among the first women to be booked last week. She was later sent to jail for a day.        
	The police have registered close to 23,000 cases till August this year and suspended about 8,100 licences. More than 8,000 drivers have been sent to jail.        
	Last night alone, we booked 120 cases. We have taken consistent action but the fact that the number is as high as 120 in a single night indicates that our message is still not being taken seriously, DCP Baijal said.        
	The drive has, however, helped reduce the number of fatal accidents by 20 per cent, traffic officials said.

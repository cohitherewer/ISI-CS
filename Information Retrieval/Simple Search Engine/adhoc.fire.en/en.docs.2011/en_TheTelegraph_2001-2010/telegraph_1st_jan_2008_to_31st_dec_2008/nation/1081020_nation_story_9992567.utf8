          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The government should have greater control over the IIMs key policy decisions, a central panel has said.        
	The panel, set up to review the functioning of the premier B-schools, also wants each Indian Institute of Management to increase its student intake to 750, three times the average 250 seats in each IIM.        
	The panel has suggested that a council of the IIMs be formed, headed by a government-appointed chairman. The council will be above the board of governors of the individual institutes.        
	The human resource development ministry, sources said, is broadly satisfied with the recommendations of the panel, headed by R.C. Bhargava.         
	The IIMs now have the powers to decide most of their policies, including fee structure.        
	The panels proposals avoid any mention of restricting the B-schools decision-making powers, and says the board of governors of each institute is entitled to set its own fee structure. However, the decisions taken by the individual boards can be scrutinised by the council, according to the fine print in the recommendations, a member of the Bhargava panel said.        
	So, in effect, while an IIM can decide to hike its fees, the council can intervene if it feels the rise is too steep, or that enough measures have not been taken to ensure scholarships for poorer sections, the member said.        
	Each IIM will have representatives on the council, with five other members from the government and a chairman nominated by the Prime Minister, the panel has suggested.

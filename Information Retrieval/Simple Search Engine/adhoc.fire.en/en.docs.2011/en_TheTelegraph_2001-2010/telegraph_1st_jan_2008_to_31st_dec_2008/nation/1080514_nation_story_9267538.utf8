	Cuttack, May 13: Orissa High Court today refused to intervene in the matter of ordering a CBI probe into the murder of Biranchi Das and arrest of IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik for his alleged role in the murder.         
	The two-judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B.N. Mohapatra directed police to complete the inquiry soon, while disposing off an PIL lodged by one Manas Ranjan Sahoo.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Raipur, Jan. 7: More than seven Maoists, including top leaders, were reportedly killed after a team of security personnel stormed a rebel camp in Kanker, early in the morning today.
    
	The personnel have received evidence from the spot to suggest that more than six rebels were killed in the Kanker encounter today, said the Bastar inspector-general R.K. Vij said. 
    
	The Kanker police, it is said, received a tip-off on Sunday night that stated that rebels were camping in Koyalibeda forests, about 300km from Raipur, in Kanker. The police moved to Koyalibeda to launch an offensive and located the spot around 1.30am to cordon off the temporary camp. 
    
	The rebels opened fire soon after spotting some movement. But, unlike most times when they are left to defend, the personnel where prepared to attack this time and a two-hour long gun battle ensued. 
    
	The rebels fled the spot and escaped into the forests; leaving a huge cache of arms and ammunition. Besides five rifles, Vij said, rebels left 15 detonators and explosives in the camp. About six caps carrying stars, a symbol for senior members were also recovered. 
    
	Usually rebels do not leave behind any caps or uniform  its clear that a huge casualty happened and they fled in panic, Vij said, adding that no policemen were injured. 
    
	The police later spotted bloodstains at many places and human flesh as an affirmation.

	Patna, Feb. 7: The two-day token strike by government doctors in Bihar to press for multi-point demands, including a pay-hike according to the central scale, from today hit health services across the state.         
	Over 3,000 doctors working in hospitals and public health centres in Bihar are protesting against the alleged failure of the government to provide them with central scale pay, implement an assured career promotion scheme and disallow police complaints against doctors without verification.         
	Almost all the state doctors are participating in the two-day token strike, said Dineshwar Singh, the general secretary of Bihar State Health Services Association. The experts would not attend emergency services or conduct post-mortem during the strike. Doctors in the six state medical colleges, however, did not join the strike despite extending their support.        
	Patients in several medical centres kept waiting for doctors today, but to no avail. Many had travelled miles to get to the health centres. The decision to go on strike was taken last week at the state executive committee meeting of the doctors body in Patna.        
	The doctors were disappointed about the chief minister Nitish Kumars lack of interest in their welfare despite Patna High Court intervening in the matter and specifically ordering the state to react to doctors demands.         
	Health minister Chandra Mohan Rai today assured that the state would try to meet all the demands of the doctors.        
	Only, if they submitted affidavits assuring that they would not resort to strike or private practice.

	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Supreme Court today blamed the attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra and retaliatory strikes on Marathis elsewhere in the country on the lack of political will to deal with the problem sternly.         
	If political will is there, everything can be done, but if political will is not there, nothing can be done, an apex court bench said, hearing a public interest petition filed by Salek Jain.         
	Jain, Aggarwal, Bihari, Mukherjee everyone is the same for this court, the bench observed when Jain, a grain supplier, sought its intervention to stop the violence.         
	Agreeing to hear the petition in greater detail on Monday, the court asked Jain to amend it to make his case water-tight.         
	You have approached a very serious issue in a non-serious manner. You have not referred to Article 355 even once in your petition, the court said, pointing to the tough line it could take. By bringing up Article 355, the court suggested that while holding the states responsible, it was not sparing the Centre of blame either.         
	Article 355 says that it shall be the duty of the Union to protect every state against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the government of every state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.         
	Jains lawyer, Sugriv Dubey, had urged the court to intervene to protect the fundamental rights of ordinary people as enshrined in Articles 19 (1) (d) and (e) of the Constitution. The articles guarantee all citizens the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of the country.         
	No one is concerned about the ordinary people. The politicians are not bothered. Its up to the court to step in and protect the fundamental rights of the people and protect their life and property, he said.         
	The court initially sounded reluctant. Its a political issue, it has to be dealt with by political parties, the two-judge bench said. Can courts stop such incidents? You have to educate people, it added. Later, however, it relented and agreed to hear the petition.

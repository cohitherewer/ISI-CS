          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Most Pakistani prisoners in Tihar have told a delegation from their country they are happy to be where they are and wont like to return home.        
	The team of four judges, part of an eight-member Indo-Pak judicial committee, has been touring jails in India to try and speed up the release of prisoners from that country.         
	Yes, most Pakistani prisoners in Tihar refused to be deported. They said they were happy here and wanted to stay on in India if they are released, said an embarrassed member of the team after their visit yesterday.        
	Tihar officials confirmed that most of the 63 Pakistani nationals had told the delegation they were not keen to go back home and that their names should not be included in the list of possible release cases. Most of them have been lodged here for the past two years.        
	A senior jail official said most of the inmates who snubbed the Pakistani team were Gohar Shahis, a sect culturally close to Hinduism. They claimed they face torture in Pakistan and had entered India to escape the ordeal. In fact, they were arrested for burning their passports.        
	But it is unlikely that the prisoners will be allowed to stay forever.         
	They have to be deported because they are illegal migrants. They have not given us any trouble and have been active participants in all jail activities, but we have no option (but to deport), the official said. The prisoners were denied asylum in India two years ago.        
	No member of the delegation was prepared to comment on what the Pakistani inmates had told them but they appeared happy with the living conditions of the prisoners. We saw Pakistani prisoners happy and healthy. They hadnt been tortured and showed no signs of mental illness, said Justice Nazir Ahmed Zahid.        
	Earlier, on Monday, the members had met 54 Pakistani citizens lodged in Amritsar Central Jail. They verified the antecedents of 12 of them to ensure they could be freed quickly, a spokesman for the delegation said.        
	Recommendations were made for the immediate release of a woman and her one-and-a-half-year-old daughter. The woman was pregnant when she was arrested while crossing over to India. The baby was born in the jail.        
	Arrangements were made to give some of the Amritsar prisoners consular access and to get their credentials checked by calling their relatives in Pakistan.         
	Justice Zahid said the delegation would also meet Pakistanis lodged in a Jaipur jail before leaving for home.        
	In June, an Indian delegation had visited prisoners in Pakistan.        
	A joint statement will be issued at the end of the Pakistani delegations visit.

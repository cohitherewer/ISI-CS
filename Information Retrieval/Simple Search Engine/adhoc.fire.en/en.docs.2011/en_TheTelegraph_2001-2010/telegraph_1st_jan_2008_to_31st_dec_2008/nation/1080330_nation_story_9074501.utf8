The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Call to undo defence pact
                                                                                                               Call to undo defence pact
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Coimbatore, March 29: Prakash Karat today said the CPM had a second task in hand apart from resisting the nuclear deal  to undo the Indo-US defence pact.        
	The defence framework agreement and the nuclear co-operation agreement are part of an overarching alliance. The CPM and the Left parties have already declared that the nuclear deal cannot go forward, Karat said in his opening speech at the CPMs 19th party congress.        
	But the task is not over. We have to undo the military collaboration agreement. We have to continue to struggle to disentangle India from the strategic embrace of the US.        
	Karat said the CPM could take legitimate credit for bringing foreign policy and strategic matters to the centre-stage of Indian politics.        
	If it were not for the CPM and the Left, the nuclear deal would by now have been wrapped up, he said.        
	Karat also attacked the Centres economic policies that benefit big business and the affluent and spoke of the need for a third alternative. But he balanced it by talking of isolating the BJP.        
	He said the third alternative would not be an electoral alliance unlike previous versions but a general platform based on a pragmatic unity of Left and democratic forces.        
	Jyoti Basu, in his video message from Calcutta, however, harped on the danger the BJP poses and stayed silent on the third alternative despite criticising the Centres foreign policy and failure to keep pro-people promises.        
	The ailing 93-year-old, who wants the Congress given a longer rope, is believed to have doubts about the feasibility of a third front anytime soon.        
	CPM leaders from Bengal, however, refused to read too much in Basus message. What Karat said is the party line. The third alternative is our political goal but it should not be confused with our tactics for the general election next year, a central committee member from Bengal said.        
	Karat said the need for a third alternative was being felt more and more. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, too, criticised the nuclear deal and the Centres economic policies and stressed the need for a third alternative.        
	The CPM chief slammed the Centre over the continuing agrarian crisis and price rise. He said the CPM had been trying to goad the government towards pro-people policies and had fought several proposed economic changes, such as foreign direct investment in retail and reforms in pension, insurance and banking.

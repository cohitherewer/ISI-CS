The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish aide resigns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nitish aide resigns
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 25: Taking a queue from the turmoil in the BJP over the recent reshuffle in the Nitish Kumar-led council of ministers, a JD(U) leader, who was dropped from the cabinet, resigned from his partys vice-president post today.        
	Former transport minister Ajit Kumar is the second vice-president to resign after Monazir Hasan, who had resigned after he was dropped from the ministry. Previously, Kumar had dropped eight JD(U) ministers from his council and all of them were appointed as party vice-presidents.         
	However, the leaders are not complaining and if they are  their tone is softer when compared to the BJP rebels who are openly demanding Sushil Kumar Modis replacement as the BJP legislature party leader and deputy chief minister.        
	In his resignation letter addressed to the state party chief, Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh, Ajit Kumar has said: I quit my party post in the larger interest of the people in my constituency. I will continue to work as a party worker to fulfil the chief ministers dream of shaping a strong, prosperous and vibrant Bihar.         
	I was removed from the council of ministers for my poor performance and I felt I would not be doing justice to my constituency due to my preoccupation with the party affairs as the vice-president, Kumar told The Telegraph.        
	Since Lallan Singh left for New Delhi early this morning, it was not clear if Ajit Kumars resignation from the party post had been accepted.         
	Monazir Hasan, too, had resigned on similar lines.         
	I belong to a minority community. It will be hard for me to work for my community while working as a party vice-president, Hasan had said.        
	Both leaders, however, left the post after expressing faith in the party leadership.        
	Insiders believe that unlike Sushil Kumar Modi, Nitish Kumar enjoys a vice-like grip over his party.         
	Given the control that Kumar enjoys over the party and given his popularity among the masses, few leaders can afford to get belligerent against Nitish Kumar, particularly when polls are around the corner, said a party leader.        
	Observers believe that few JD(U) leaders can exert a little pressure on the chief minister taking queue from the BJP rebels, but the former can ill-afford to cross the their limit with Nitish Kumar at the helm.         
	Meanwhile, Sushil Kumar Modi and state BJP president, Radhamohan Singh have gone to New Delhi, answering to a summon of the BJP high command, to the douse dissent fire while the BJP rebels seek Modis head.

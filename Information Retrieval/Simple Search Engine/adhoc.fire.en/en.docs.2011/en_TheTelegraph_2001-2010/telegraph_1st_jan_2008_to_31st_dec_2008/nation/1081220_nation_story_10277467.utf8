  - Kandhamal nun rape case        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, Dec. 19: The test identification parade (TI) of the accused in the Kandhamal nun rape case will be conducted at the Choudwar circle jail on January 3.        
	The date and venue of the parade was fixed by the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Cuttack. A notice had been issued to the 29-year-old nun to present herself for the TI parade, a crime branch officer said.        
	The nun has been staying away from Orissa since the alleged incident of August 25, two days after VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati was murdered. She was interrogated by the crime branch officers at an undisclosed location in New Delhi on November 18.        
	Earlier, the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate at Baliguda had issued notices to the nun for TI parade on November 10. But she filed a petition seeking more time and for shifting the venue of the TI parade to New Delhi.        
	The Baliguda court, however, had rejected her plea on November 2. She had later filed a petition in the high court for TI parade outside Kandhamal, preferably in Bhubaneswar or Cuttack.         
	The high court had on December 5 directed for TI parade in Cuttack. The crime branch had on December 16 filed a petition in the Baliguda court for the TI parade. The Baliguda court had allowed shifting of the accused to Choudwar circle jail, 11km from here, but directed the crime branch to move the Cuttack court for fixing the date of TI parade.        
	Ten persons have been arrested so far in connection with the rape that allegedly took place at K. Nuagaon under Baliguda police station area in Kandhamal.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 18: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, Y. V. Reddy, today lauded Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for accelerating the pace of development in Bihar and assured the banking sectors special attention to it. 
    
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, too, has signalled for special attention to Bihar in view of its governments interest in accelerating development here, Reddy told reporters after meeting Nitish Kumar and senior state officials. The RBI governor, who addressed a bankers meeting, said: We are working on to improve the inter-institutional mechanism and develop co-operation between the banking sector and the state agencies. 
    
	Reddy said the improvement in inter-institutional mechanism will open a new chapter of co-operation and collaboration between banks and the state agencies. 
    
	He added that the challenges before Bihar were daunting. But the RBI would help the state in providing relief to the flood-hit people, ensuring education loans to students and promoting medium and small-scale industries. 
    
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was accompanying the RBI governor when he addressed the meet, said he and his officials had a very satisfactory meeting with Reddy. I am hopeful that the meetings would ensure a better credit deposit ratio and increase the quantum of loan in rural areas, he added.
    
	Asked if the RBI had special plans to improve the rural areas, Reddy said: It has to be done through concerted efforts by all agencies, including banks.

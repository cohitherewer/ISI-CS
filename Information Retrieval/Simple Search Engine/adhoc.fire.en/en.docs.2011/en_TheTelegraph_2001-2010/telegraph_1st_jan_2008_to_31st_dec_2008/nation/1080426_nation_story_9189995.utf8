	New Delhi, April 25: Job quotas for all categories taken together should not exceed the 50 per cent cap, the Supreme Court said today.        
	The quotas could be for SCs, STs and OBCs or for special categories such as the disabled, women, sportsmen, war widows or refugees.        
	Quoting from the earlier Mandal judgment, the court said vertical reservations  for SCs, STs etc  and horizontal reservations  for the disabled, women etc  should be applied in such a way that the 50 per cent cap is not exceeded.        
	This could be managed by accommodating the horizontal categories within the appropriate vertical categories, it said.        
	So, the quotas for women, sportspersons etc could be accommodated in their relevant ST, SC, OBC or general categories so that reservations for backward classes never fall below 50 per cent, it added.        
	Horizontal reservations cut across vertical reservations. Suppose 3 per cent of the vacancies are reserved in favour of physically handicapped persons.        
	Persons selected against this quota will be placed in the appropriate category; if he belongs to SC category he will be placed in that quota by making necessary adjustments; similarly, if he belongs to open competition (OC) category, he will be placed in that category by making necessary adjustments, it said.        
	Even after providing for these horizontal reservations, the percentage of reservations in favour of backward class of citizens remains and should remain the same. This is how these reservations are worked out in several states and there is no reason not to continue that procedure.        
	The court made the observation to uphold the appointment of a lady associate professor to Roorkee University in 2000, challenged as void by another candidate, Shiva Prasad.        
	Prasad had first challenged Madhu Jains appointment in Uttaranchal High Court. The court set aside Jains appointment in September 2003, but called for a fresh selection for the post.        
	Prasad then appealed against the order in the apex court.        
	In August 2000, the university had issued an ad for six vacancies in the mathematics department. There were six posts for professors (unreserved) and three for associate/assistant professors.         
	Of the three posts, two were reserved for SC candidates and one for the general category. The selection committee appointed Jain as associate professor. Prasad claimed he should have been selected.        
	He contended that since there was only one post for the general category, it could not be reserved for women. Also, since there was no combined cadre of associate/assistant professor, horizontal reservation could not be applied to it.        
	But the state claimed the cadre of associate and assistant professor was combined and even the ad showed both the cadres as combined. One post had been reserved for women according to the state policy of having 20 per cent reservation for women candidates.

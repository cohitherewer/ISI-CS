     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Guwahati, Jan. 9: Three armed men fleeing with a stolen car were gunned down after a high-speed police chase through empty streets and a shootout in the dead of the night.
    
	The trio stole a Maruti 800 parked outside a restaurant and were heading to an unknown destination when a police patrol spotted the vehicle without number plates around 3.30am. 
    
	On being asked to stop, the driver of the car stepped on the accelerator while his accomplices opened fire from pistols. The pursuit ended near a tennis complex, just over a kilometre from where the chase began.
    
	When they were cornered, two of the thieves came out of the vehicle and started firing at the patrol party again. Our shots hit all three, including the man who had stayed inside the car, a police officer said.
    
	Only three bullets fired by the thieves hit the patrol vehicle. An officer and his guard suffered minor injuries.
    
	Two .32-bore Italian pistols, four empty cartridges and a live cartridge were found on the slain thieves.
    
	The police said the three were in their twenties, but they could not be identified till this evening.

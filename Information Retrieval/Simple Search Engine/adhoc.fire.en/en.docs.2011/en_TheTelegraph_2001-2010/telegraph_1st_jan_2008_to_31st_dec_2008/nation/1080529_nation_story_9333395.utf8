          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, May 28: Taking a leaf out of Munnabhai MBBS, Porabai did all that could fetch her the states highest mark in the higher secondary school certificate examination.        
	But her luck ran out today.        
	The experiment was exposed with the shining result achieved by Porabai, a village girl who appeared in the exams from Birra Government School in Janjir district neighbouring the state capital.         
	She secured the first position with a score of 484 out of 500.         
	The results were announced on Monday.        
	We had some doubts and the answer sheets of Porabai were examined again to get the shocking facts out. The sheets used in her script carefully replaced the sheets that were given to the student in the examination hall, Chhattisgarh Board of Secondary Education chairman B.K.S. Ray said.        
	There was not a single mistake or overwriting in the sheets that were neatly written, he added.        
	Besides the serial numbers of the sheets that were distributed in the examination hall were different and even the handwriting of the girl  verified later  did not match with the sheets that were evaluated.        
	Sources said there was an alleged involvement of teachers and officials who conducted the exam at the centre, as the answer sheets of the girl were replaced with sheets written by someone else.         
	There are ample evidences to establish the facts as the handwriting of the girl has been verified with the answer sheets of her previous exams and found to be totally different, a senior official, who had conducted the preliminary probe, said.         
	The board has cancelled the merit list and ordered a high-level probe into the matter.        
	The detailed probe would further reveal the modus operandi used in the experiment, the officials added.        
	Ray said the prime task of the investigating officials was to reach up to the persons who helped Porabai.         
	The officials or teachers found guilty in the probe would certainly face strict action, the board chairman said.        
	The board is completing official formalities to hand over the case to police. An offence is likely to be registered against Porabai also, the board officials hinted.        
	This is probably the first time in the history of a board examination that the topper faces charges of cheating in the test.

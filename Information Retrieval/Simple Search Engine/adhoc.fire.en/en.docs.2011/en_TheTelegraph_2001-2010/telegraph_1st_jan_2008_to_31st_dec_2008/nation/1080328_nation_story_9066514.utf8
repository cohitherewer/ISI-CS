          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	March 27: Madhya Pradesh police have claimed to have busted the brain trust of the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) and arrested 13 leaders, including a man apparently responsible for indoctrinating engineers and IT professionals.        
	A computer engineer suspected to have played a role in the train blasts in Mumbai is also among those arrested.        
	The special task force of Madhya Pradesh police arrested Safdar Nagori, the general secretary of the banned outfit blamed for several blasts and tied to Lashkar-e-Toiba modules.        
	Nagori was reportedly involved in recruiting professionals from the engineering and the IT sectors. He was also associated with a suspected plot to target foreign tourists in Goa, the police said.         
	Son of a retired assistant sub-inspector of police, Nagori had been absconding since Simi was outlawed on September 27, 2001. His brother Kamruddin was also arrested.        
	State police officials said Nagori was also facing cases for spreading religious discord. In Madhya Pradesh alone, over 40 cases have been registered against Simi activists.        
	Intelligence agencies have been claiming that Simi was involved in the serial blasts on Mumbais rail network in which over 180 commuters died in July 2006. Simi has denied the allegations.         
	Task officials said Nagori and the others were arrested during an early morning raid in the temple town of Ujjain today. The officials said intelligence agencies had been keeping tabs on their movement for sometime.        
	Apart from Nagori, Simi leaders, including unit heads of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, have been arrested, the officials said. Weapons, money, computers and incendiary literature have been seized from the 13, they added.         
	Among those arrested was Shibly Peedicaal Abdul, wanted in connection with the Mumbai train blasts.        
	 Shibly is considered a prize catch as he is alleged to have been part of the conclave that met in Ujjain ahead of the Mumbai blasts.         
	A team is on its way from Karanataka to Madhya Pradesh to question Shibly who is wanted by Bangalore police.        
	Shibly, a computer engineer from Kerala, used to work in a multinational company and later set up his own firm which, police suspect, is involved in money laundering for Simi.        
	 Shibly had escaped last months police sweep against terror suspects in Karnataka.        
	 The arrests came a little over a month after the arrest of Raziuddin Nasir and Kerala-origin computer engineer Yahya Kamakutty, who were allegedly planning bombings in Goa, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai.

                                                                                                            Stephens in principal row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The countrys apex minority education body has asked Delhi University to urgently remove Rev. Valson Thampu from the post of principal of St Stephens College and appoint a principal in accordance with law.        
	The National Commission for Minority Education Institutions today dismissed a plea from St Stephens questioning its jurisdiction, and iterated an earlier stand that Thampus appointment was illegal.        
	Thampu, who was appointed an officer on special duty (OSD) to act as principal for three years by the St Stephens supreme council in May 2007, said he would appeal in Delhi High Court.         
	St Stephens rules mandate that the principal must hold a PhD degree. The rules also do not allow the appointment of an OSD for over six months.         
	Sheetal P. Singh, the petitioner, had challenged the appointment on these grounds.         
	The reverend did not hold a doctorate degree at the time of his appointment and recently acquired a PhD in theology from Allahabad Agricultural University, a deemed varsity.         
	The minority panel has questioned the authenticity of the degree and asked Delhi University to evaluate whether Thampus doctorate meets the academic standards required of a principal at the university.         
	We hope that the Delhi University would not compromise on principals qualification and the academic credentials prescribed under the (universitys) ordinance, it said.         
	In November 2007  on the completion of the first six months of Thampus three-year tenure  the supreme council accepted that the rules did not allow it to appoint the reverend for over six months, but extended his tenure by another six months till May 2008.         
	Thampu today said he would step down in May, but did not rule out applying afresh.        
	Reverend Thampu is eligible for the post of principal, since he now has a PhD degree. He is fully eligible to apply for the post in May 2008, said Vinod Choudhary, media adviser to Thampu.         
	The panel, however, has asked DU to take urgent corrective measures... in accordance with law.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Silly prank? No, 72m bank fraud
  - UK court jails Indian for nine years										      Amit Roy                  
	London, July 7: Jagmeet Channa, a 25-year-old Indian finance desk clerk with HSBC at its Canary Wharf headquarters in London, certainly thought big when he set out to defraud the bank of nearly 72 million.        
	Using the passwords of two of his colleagues, he entered the online system and followed the orders of fellow conspirators, who had promised him a cut, by first sending 60 million euros (47,970,227) from one of its trading accounts to Morocco.        
	Minutes later he wired 30 million euros (23,984,113) to a branch of Barclays in Manchester. His actions were described as one of the biggest frauds of its kind.        
	Today, Channa, who got his comeuppance with a nine-year prison sentence, was told by judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC: Huge sums of money were involved. These speak for themselves. This was no silly prank. This was a carefully planned and very serious attempt to transfer a fortune in money away, and it almost succeeded.        
	Channas dishonesty may reflect poorly on Indians, who are employed in large numbers by British banks, both for their skills and also to target Indian-origin clients in the UK and now, increasingly, develop links with India.        
	The judge said to Channa: Others were involved, perhaps several others, and in the absence of any explanation from you I must assume this was a planned and sophisticated criminal enterprise. You say you had no idea who these people were or what was going to happen to the money. I regret I cannot accept this statement. These offences were committed in breach of trust.        
	Channas mistake was to forget that the account he raided had to show a zero balance at the end of each day. The massive debit was first discovered by HSBC workers in Malaysia on a Sunday. They alerted their colleagues in London and an investigation was immediately launched.        
	Electronic footsteps on the banks mainframe initially pointed to Channas two colleagues, whose passwords had been used. They were arrested, questioned and finally declared innocent.         
	Shortly afterwards, security camera checks and other inquiries identified Channa. By then, both Barclays and the bank in Casablanca had been contacted, the account frozen and the stolen money returned.         
	Channa, of Church Road, Ilford, Essex, who had only been working at the bank for a year, admitted one count of conspiracy to defraud between April 1 and 18 this year and one of money laundering by sending the larger sum to the western Saharan state.        
	A third count, alleging abuse of a position of trust, was left on the file.        
	The judge said: The fact is you first gained information and then used the identities of two fellow members of staff. Accordingly, they were arrested as suspects in this fraud. They were released, having convinced police of their innocence but no thanks to you. From their point of view this must have been a very worrying experience, if not a terrifying one.        
	The judge told Channa that while his guilty pleas would attract some credit, the evidence against you is quite overwhelming.        
	The judge said he was sorry he could not give Channa a longer sentence.         
	Where anyone acting in flagrant breach of trust and attempts to steal many millions of pounds, the sentence will inevitably be a very long one. As you have demonstrated, it is all too easy to commit offences of this nature. As you yourself said, perhaps putting it too simply, a couple of clicks on a computer is all that is necessary.        
	If successful, the alleged fraud would have accounted for a big percentage of the UKs total figures  it is estimated that total UK card fraud in 2007 was 327.6 million.        
	High Street banks have managed to lose much greater sums through their own investment activities, and French bank SocGen misplaced 4.9 billion euros thanks to rogue trader Jrme Kerviel.

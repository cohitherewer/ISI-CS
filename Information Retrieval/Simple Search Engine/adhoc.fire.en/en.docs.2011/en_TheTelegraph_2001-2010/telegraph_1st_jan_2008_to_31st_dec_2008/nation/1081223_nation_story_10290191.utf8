  - Campaign ends in whimper, black flags of boycott fly atop mosques        SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          A PDP supporter kisses party chief Mufti Muhammad Sayeeds hand at an election rally in Srinagar on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, Dec. 22: This is infinitely closer to the theatre of a could-be war than New Delhi but Srinagar appears far more distant from its ominous intimations than the national capital. At the moment it is merely sensing relief at the winding down of what has been the longest election in the nations history.         
	Campaign-end is usually a raucous hour, the final rush of competing clamour for power. In Srinagar, canvassing ended just as it had begun  in a whimper. And just where it had begun  in the sparse semi-rural outskirts.         
	National Conference (NC) president Omar Abdullah closed the campaign in forlorn corners of Brane, off the far-eastern reaches of the Dal Lake. His PDP counterpart, Mehbooba Mufti, chose the villages of Malbagh on the high northern fringes of the town. And even there, there were loose clusters to hear them out, no more. Neither of the chief contenders for power bothered  rather dared  coming anywhere closer to Srinagar, which is up for grabs on Christmas Eve.         
	They know there isnt any point, said a former Congressman who has now given up the business of politics. They would only expose themselves if they tried enacting a show of strength here. They have no takers here.        
	The heart of town, long the stronghold of separatists, posted closure after its own fashion  a rejectionist black flag rally in Zainakadal, a hail of stones at passing paramilitary vehicles in Hawal, a grenade chucked in the maze of Batmaloo, an independent candidates blundering car dismembered in Maisooma.         
	Damn the elections, said an angered young man watching the violent commotion, and thank Allah they are getting over.        
	He was, he said, a committed boycotter, but his irritation with the election went beyond that. It has become a daily nuisance, he said, there is a curfew every other day because the government apprehends trouble, shops are closed, everything is shuttered, normal life has been totally disrupted. Elections are meant to be about freedoms, this election has been totally about restrictions, is this an election?        
	Despite the high turnouts in rural areas phase after phase during the last six weeks, Srinagar remains largely averse. Proof of it is that the campaign is now over and the city has barely seen any campaigning.         
	It is not secure, a candidate from Amirakadal constituency admitted, and the people are mostly hostile, we havent been able to do much beyond word-of-mouth campaigning, and that too mostly on local cable networks.        
	Where the campaign did go, it went enclosed in security bubbles and mobile rent-a-rally crowds  the same people making up gatherings meeting after meeting.         
	What is one to do, said an NC manager, a little embarrassed and quite exasperated, the leaders need some people to address, best to carry them along, everyone feels secure and there is a sense people are clustered around. It is impossible to find people in the city.        
	The NC patron and once and would-be chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, went out seeking votes for himself in posh Sonwar last evening and there werent more around than he had carted along in his long caravan.         
	There was a time, not so long ago, when the mere rumour of Farooqs presence would conjure an excited throng; now they flee from his shadows.        
	Black flags flutter atop the citys many mosques, the accepted signature of boycott and strike on the day of polling. The ground crawls with gunmen in camouflage gear, dozens of platoons of them freshly arrived from other parts of the Valley to see through the final chapter of this poll.         
	The city teems with new fortification  spools of shining concertina wiring around polling stations, makeshift bunkers and sandbagged embattlements, trucks coughing troops into every nook and alley, their boots mulching on the mud, their guns cocked. Every street looks its own frontier.        
	Its a faraway war that New Delhi is hotting up over; Srinagar is gearing for its own.

	New Delhi, May 3: Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav has donned the firefighters gloves as discontent in the party has refused to die down after last months revamp of the Bihar cabinet.         
	Party insiders said Yadav was concerned about the image of the coalition government  the Dal (U) and the BJP are allies in Bihar  because the problem has dragged on for nearly three weeks now.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has dropped eight Dal (U) ministers and who is seen as arrogant by several party leaders, met Yadav in Delhi yesterday to discuss the crisis.        
	Some Dal (U) leaders, who did not want to be named, said the crisis had arisen because of the chief ministers poor management.        
	Yadav said it was natural for those dropped from the cabinet to be agitated. I will be talking to some of them over the next two-three days. I am confident the matter will be resolved soon and all their issues will be addressed.         
	The Dal (U) chief has also met Monazir Hassan, the leader of the rebels. Hassan, who lost the building and construction ministry, claims he has the support of 11 legislators.        
	The BJP camp is not free of discontent either.        
	Legislators have demanded the ouster of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi as they hold him responsible for the removal of some ministers.

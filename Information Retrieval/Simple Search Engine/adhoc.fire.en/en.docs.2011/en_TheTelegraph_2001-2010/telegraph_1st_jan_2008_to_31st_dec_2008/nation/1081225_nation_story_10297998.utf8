          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 24: Orissa High Court today admitted a petition challenging the clean chit to former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty by the Orissa Human Rights Commission (OHRC) in the Gayatri Panda sexual harassment case.         
	In March, Mohanty had stepped down on moral grounds following harassment charges made against him. However, the OHRC recently exonerated Mohanty of the charges citing lack of credible evidence.         
	Gayatri Panda, the 29-year-old Marshal of the Assembly, today challenged the ruling stating that the panel had no ground to probe into the case without her approaching the panel first.        
	Panda had lodged an FIR at Bhubaneswar Mahila police station alleging that Mohanty harassed her after she refused to grant him favours. A criminal case, based on her FIR, is pending before the Bhubaneswar SDJM, while the State Commission for Women is also in the middle of their investigations. Dropping charges against the accused could influence the process of justice, the petition pleads.         
	Acting on the petition, the two-judge bench of Justice I.M. Qudussi and Justice B.P. Ray issued directions to list the case in the last week of January, while issuing notice to OHRC. The court also issued notices to State Commission for Women and state home department.         
	The PIL also alleges that the panel violated justice during the proceeding by not cross-examining the former Speaker.

	Bhubaneswar, May 21: The Orissa government today set a target to ensure bank credit linkage for self-employment of 2.18 lakh unemployed youths in the current fiscal.         
	The decision was taken at a meeting to review the implementation of schemes under the Orissa Employment Mission. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik chaired the meet.        
	Chief secretary Ajit Tripathy, who was also present at the meeting, said commercial banks have provided credit assistance to the tune of Rs 2,394 crore to 3.14 lakh to educated, unemployed youths since 2005-06. A target of extending that credit linkage to another 2.18 lakh jobless youths has been set for the current fiscal.         
	Also, necessary training is being imparted to jobless youths for skill enhancement. Development training was imparted to 4,516 youths during 2005-06, 11,822 youths in 2006-07 and 18,0007 in 2007-08. A target has been fixed to train 34,400 unemployed youths during the current fiscal. The training is being provided through 25 government-run industrial training institutes and 360 private industrial training centres.         
	Besides, training would be imparted by tourism, textile and handloom, IT and related departments. Banks, too, have set up centres and are providing training for skill up-gradation.         
	The government is also organising annual counselling fairs to guide youths and sort out problems related to financial matters such as bank loans under schemes.

	New Delhi, Oct. 12 (PTI): A surgeon who left cotton rags and pieces of bone inside a patients wound has been asked to pay Rs 50,000 in damages by a consumer court.        
	From the medical reports, negligence is apparent, Delhi Consumer Commission president Justice J.D. Kapoor said about the surgery performed by Faridabad-based doctor R.K. Mathu.         
	Taking an overall view of the matter, we deem that a lump sum compensation of Rs 50,000 would meet the ends of justice, he said.        
	The patient, Subhash Chandra Mishra, had undergone a surgery in the left leg in Faridabad in 1998. But after some days, the condition of the wound deteriorated. He went to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung Hospital, but failed to get any relief.        
	In 2000, another surgery was performed at Daffodil Medical Centre in Bengal where doctors found the cotton rags and bone chips inside the wound.        
	Mishra approached the consumer panel seeking a compensation of Rs 7 lakh and alleging that Mathu handled his case negligently.         
	The commission rejected the doctors contention that Mishra had filed the complaint with mala fide intention and with the motive to harass and blackmail him.        
	Relying on medical reports, the commission said Mishra contracted the infection because of the surgeons medical negligence.         
	It observed that there were pieces of bone that were not removed by the doctor from the left foot during the surgery.         
	All this resulted in the forming of pus and pain to the complainant, Justice Kapoor said, directing the doctor to pay the money in 30 days.

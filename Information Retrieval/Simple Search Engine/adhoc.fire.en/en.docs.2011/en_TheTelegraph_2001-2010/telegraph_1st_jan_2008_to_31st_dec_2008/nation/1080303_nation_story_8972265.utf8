          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Patna, March 2: The BJP, a partner of the ruling alliance in Bihar, is in the grip of infighting as several leaders are vying for the lone Rajya Sabha seat that the party is likely to get on the basis of its strength in the Assembly.         
	The post would be vacant when BJP Rajya Sabha member Shatrughan Sinha completes his tenure on April 2, which is also the date for the biennial polls. Sinha is himself a candidate in the race.         
	Others in the poll ring include former Union minister C.P. Thakur, former Chapra MP Rajiv Pratap Rudi and leader R.K. Sinha. The opponents are clamouring to deny Sinha the seat this time on the logic that the star has been an MP for two consecutive terms.         
	No one, except party veteran L.K. Advani, has been granted a third term in the BJPs history. But given his closeness to the Advani camp, Sinha might eventually have his way.         
	Supporters of C.P. Thakur, a prominent physician belonging to the Bhumihar community, believe that Thakur is entitled to the seat, as he cant contest for any two of Patnas Lok Sabha seats for the Delimitation Commission has thoroughly changed the caste equations that helped Thakur in the past. Thakur represented the Patna seat before RJDs Ramkripal Yadav defeated him in 2004.         
	Similarly, Rudi does not wish to contest the Chapra Lok Sabha seat, which Lalu Prasad represents in the Lok Sabha. Its always tough to contest against a Union minister. The party must compensate leaders who fought against Lalu Prasad, said a Rudi supporter. Lalu Prasad defeated Rudi in the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	R.K. Sinha, a claimant, is a veteran and BJPs face in the Kayastha community, which is numerically preponderant in Patna. His supporters say that his party has not given anything to Sinha by way of his representation in the Houses.        
	The party, which has 55 members in the Assembly, can get a lone seat against the two that the JD(U), with 88 members, has its claim on. The BJP is said to be persuading the JD(U) to spare at least one seat. But, its not yet known if Bihar chief minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar would oblige his alliance partner  especially since he has other claimants in his party.

	Bangalore, Aug. 14: Eight children were among 11 persons who drowned when a school bus fell off a bridge into the Falguni river near Mangalore this morning.         
	Fishermen and residents of neighbouring areas rescued 20 children and an adult.         
	The bodies of five girls and three boys, between seven and 10 years, were found.         
	The cleaner of the bus has run away. Only he can give the exact number of children on the bus, inspector-general of police A.M. Prasad said in Mangalore.        
	Two women, thought to be escorts appointed by the school, were brought out dead from the overflowing river.

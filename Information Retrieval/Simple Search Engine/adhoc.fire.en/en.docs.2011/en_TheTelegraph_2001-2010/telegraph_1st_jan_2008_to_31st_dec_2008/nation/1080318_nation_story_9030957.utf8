                                                                                                               Govt push for coastal highway
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 17: The Orissa government may resubmit its proposal to the Centre for a 573km highway along the coast of Bay of Bengal from Gopalpur to Digha (Bengal).        
	We will prepare a fresh feasibility report taking into account the possibility of proposed ports at Gopalpur, Dhamra, Astaranga and Kirtanika along the coast and the location of tourist destinations such as Konark, Digha, Chandaneswar and Talsari, said parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty.         
	We will send in the proposal to the Centre after the feasibility report is ready, Mohanty added.        
	The idea of constructing a coastal highway was mooted soon after the devastating 1999 Super Cyclone that had hit Orissa.         
	The road, it was said, would serve as a barrier to the tidal surge.        
	The state government had set up a task force to prepare a feasibility report on the proposed highway after the Union ministry of surface transport sought a report on January 13, 2000.         
	A detailed report with an estimated cost of Rs 19,880 crore was prepared by the task force in collaboration with IIT, Delhi, for the 573-km coastal highway and was submitted to the surface transport ministry for its approval and financial support.         
	According to project report details, Rs 7,060 crore was earmarked for drainage, while Rs 461 crore was estimated for the construction and Rs 146 crore for irrigation, official sources said.        
	Out of the total length of 573-km proposed highway, the distance between Gopalpur and Astaranga is expected to be around 180 km, that between Astaranga and Dhamra around 245 km and that between Dhamra and Subernarekhas mouth will be 148 km.         
	However, earlier the Centre had turned down the proposal stating that it could not be included in any scheme since the cost benefit ratio would be less than 1.         
	Meanwhile, the state government has decided to resubmit the proposal, this time highlighting on its commercial importance and tourism potential.

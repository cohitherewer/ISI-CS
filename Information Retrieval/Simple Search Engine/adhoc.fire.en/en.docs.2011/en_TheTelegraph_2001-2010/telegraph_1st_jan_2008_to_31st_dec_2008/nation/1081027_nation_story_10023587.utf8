	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 26: Four out of every 10 married women in Orissa experience domestic violence  either physical or sexual in nature, states a report conducted under the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3).        
	The report offers the first comprehensive picture of health and well-being of women, men and children in Orissa.        
	Although the prevalence of spousal violence is lower among the more educated, one in five women who had passed Class X experienced spousal violence, the report says. Physical violence includes pushing, throwing, slapping, twisting arms, punching, kicking, dragging and beating up. It also includes trying to choke or burn her, threaten with knife or any other weapon. Only 1 per cent of married women have ever initiated violence against their husband.        
	Women with husbands who consume alcohol and get drunk are more likely to experience violence than those having non-drinking husbands. About 14.7 per cent of women between the age of 15 and 49 experienced sexual violence. Similarly, about 19.8 per cent of women have been emotionally tortured  by humiliation and insulting her in front of others, the report says.         
	The survey was conducted by the Union health and family welfare ministry with Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences.        
	The 2005-06 NFHS3 is the third in a series of national surveys of population, health and nutrition. Earlier, NHS surveys were carried out in 1992-93 and 1998-99.         
	Orissa, however, positions itself at the 11th place in the spousal violence chart with Bihar topping the list with 59 per cent women admitting experience of violence. Its followed by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur and other states, said Sulabha Parasuraman, the head of the department of population policies and programmes at International Institute for Population Science.

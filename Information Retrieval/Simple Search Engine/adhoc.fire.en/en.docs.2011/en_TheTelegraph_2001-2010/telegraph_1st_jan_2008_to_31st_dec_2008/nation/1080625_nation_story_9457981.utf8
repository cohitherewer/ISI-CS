          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 24: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today drew flak from the NCP on flood relief.        
	Accusing the chief minister of using relief machinery for political purposes, NCP today demanded that relief operations be handed over to the Indian Army.         
	Addressing a news conference today in the state capital, NCP unit president Bijoy Mohapatra alleged that relief had not reached 90 per cent of the flood-hit areas even after eight days. While the state government failed the marooned people, the chief minister and a top dignitary preferred to take a pleasure trip to Balasore where they did nothing, said Mohapatra.         
	He alleged that the state heads flew to Balasore by a helicopter, landed at Chandipur military base (a protected area where public are disaalowed) and returned without meeting flood victims.

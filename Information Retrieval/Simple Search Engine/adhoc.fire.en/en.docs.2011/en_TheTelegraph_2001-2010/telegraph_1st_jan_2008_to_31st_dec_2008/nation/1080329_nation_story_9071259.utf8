          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: The Opposition legislators today marched to Raj Bhavan and sought the intervention of Governor M.C. Bhandare in the harassment slur on the Speaker after the government rejected their demand for an impartial probe.         
	Led by the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, the Congress, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and SUCI legislators met the governor and urged him to pressurise Speaker Maheswar Mohanty to step down and uphold the dignity of the high office in public.         
	If the Speaker does not step down, the governor should direct the chief minister to ask him to do so, said an Opposition legislator.         
	The Opposition has been baying for the Speakers head ever since the allegation was made. The Assembly has been paralysed for the past three days over the issue.         
	However, chief minister Naveen Patnaik has rejected all the demands of the Opposition. I believe no one should be asked to step down without an inquiry, he said.         
	He also did not concede to the Oppositions demand for an inquiry into the allegation by an impartial agency, other than a House committee, as suggested by the Speaker and ruling parties. As the charge is against the Speaker, it should be inquired into by his peers (MLAs) and not by any outside agency, Naveen has said.         
	After the chief minister rejected the Oppositions demands yet again, the protest shifted from the Assembly to the Raj Bhavan. J.B. Patnaik apprised the governor about the constitutional deadlock in the wake of the sexual slur and urged him to resolve the deadlock.         
	We feel that the governor has been convinced about the justification of our demands, Patnaik said.         
	Alleging that the police have refused to register a case based on the FIR lodged by the victim, as the chief minister is shielding the Speaker, Patnaik said the Opposition MLAs have also urged the governor to ensure that a case is registered immediately.         
	Deputy commissioner of police Amitav Thakur told The Telegraph that the case had not been registered as a verification of the complaints authenticity and the victims signature was still awaited. Meanwhile, Youth Congress activists staged a demonstration in front of the state secretariat demanding Mohantys resignation.

	Pune, April 2: A group of 15 youths belonging to an RSS affiliate vandalised the CPM office in Pune today.         
	Police said members of the little-known Hindu Garjana attacked those present at the first-floor office at Narayan Peth with sticks. Three CPM activists were injured.        
	The police suspect the attack was in retaliation to the clashes between RSS and CPM cadres in Kannur, Kerala, last month, which killed seven persons.

     OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Supreme Court today permitted jallikattu to be held under the states watch, bowing to public sentiments expressed by the Tamil Nadu government. 
    
	Just three days ago, the apex court had refused to permit the sport, which pits man against bull, on the ground that it was barbaric and uncivilised. Jallikattu has been part of Pongal celebrations for hundreds of years.
    
	The relaxation is conditional in that no harm can be caused to either men  participants or spectators  or animals. It is valid only this Pongal, which started today. 
    
	Whether it can continue will depend on whether the state government manages to pull this round off without major injuries or any casualty. 
    
	The court is yet to decide on a petition filed by the Animal Welfare Board seeking to stop the annual event. It is contrary to the Animal Protection Act, which bans all forms of cruelty to animals, the board has said. 
    
	Pleading for a one-time waiver, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian insisted the state government was ready to keep an eye on the 110 to 112 jallikattu events held in and around Madurai during Pongal to ensure that neither men nor animals are injured. 
    
	The event involves releasing an enraged bull, with a gold coin or any other prize tied around its neck, into a crowd. Participants or spectators, whoever succeeds in taming the enraged bull, wins the prize. 
    
	The Tamil Nadu government insisted that this time it had galvanised hundreds of sub-collectors, veterinarians and security personnel to ensure that nothing untoward happens in the 400-odd villages where it is held. 
    
	The purpose of holding the event is not only cultural but also religious, Subramanian argued. It involves the sentiments of the people. It should be allowed under whatever guidelines the court thinks fit.
    
	 Subramanian assured the apex court that the festival would be held in the right spirit.

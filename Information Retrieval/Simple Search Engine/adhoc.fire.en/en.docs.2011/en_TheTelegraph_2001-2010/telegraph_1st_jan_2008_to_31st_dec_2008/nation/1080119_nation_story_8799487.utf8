     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	INS Chilka, Jan. 18: To prepare them for the technological changes sweeping across the world, the Indian Navy is now planning to churn out technical graduates, instead of science graduates, out of cadets, said Vice-Admiral Sunil Damle today.
    
	Damle, who was in Orissa to attend a graduation ceremony, said cadets passing out of the Goa Naval Academy, from July 2009, would be given BTech degrees instead of BSc. The same would start in Ezhimala later.
    
	Till now, the academy took in boys between 16 years to 19 years, after they passed their higher secondary science and gave them BSc degrees after training.
    
	We have to make the cadets technology savvy. Its important that their education enables them to grasp technology, said Damle, the Flag-Officer and the Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Naval Command in Kochi. 
    
	BTech graduates would receive their degrees from Jawaharlal Nehru University and the course would be affiliated to AICTE. 
    
	The navy has already made some changes  in its entrance examination. From this year, it has raised the eligibility criteria to take in higher secondary students instead of matriculation pass outs. 
    
	The batch that passed out from INS Chilka today after a 24-week training are also higher secondary graduates.
    
	The vice-admiral who is in-charge of one of the important water corridors of the Asian region said the navy wants to make the traffic through Indian Ocean peaceful. 
    
	Our territorial rights over Indian Ocean extends up to 200 nautical miles off the coast. We are capable of showing the world that we can guard our territory, he said. 
    
	Today, 1,046 trainees comprising 804 senior secondary recruits and 145 Naviks earned their spurs from INS Chilka after doing a 24-week rigorous basic training. 
    
	The trainees would be deputed to training schools under the Indian Navy for professional courses, which would help them to man frontline ships, submarines and air squadrons of Indian Navy and the Coast Guard.

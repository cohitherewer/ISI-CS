	New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): A hospital is duty-bound to prevent patients from inflicting injury on themselves out of depression, Delhi High Court has said.        
	It also granted Rs 7 lakh as compensation to a patient who was seriously injured after allegedly jumping from his ward on the third floor of Batra Hospital in south Delhi.        
	Justice Sanjeev Khanna passed the order on a plea by Ashish Kumar Majumdar, who was admitted to the hospital in 1988 with fever but suffered multiple fractures after the fall.         
	The court turned down the plea of the hospital that it should not be held liable as Majumdar had intentionally jumped the roof out of depression. The patients family claimed that he became paraplegic because of the hospitals negligence.        
	Duty of care in the case of hospitals is not limited to diagnosis and treatment but extends to providing safe and secure place to ensure that the patients do not injure themselves, Justice Khanna said.        
	Majumdar, 30, went missing from his room around 2.30am on November 1, 1988, and was found in a seriously injured condition on the ground.

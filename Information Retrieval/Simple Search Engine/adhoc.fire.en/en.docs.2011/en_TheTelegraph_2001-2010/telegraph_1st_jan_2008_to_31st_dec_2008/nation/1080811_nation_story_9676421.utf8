          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug 10: Uttarakhand chief minister B.C. Khanduri arrived here tonight to stem a rebellion within his BJP MLAs, hours after 25 of the 36 lawmakers met party chief Rajnath Singh.        
	Khanduri is expected to explain his position to the BJP brass, a PTI report said, following this mornings meeting where the dissidents, led by state BJP chief and former chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshiari, pressed Rajnath for the chief ministers removal.        
	The rebels are said to have told Rajnath that Khanduri, said to be close to L.K. Advani, was neither popular with people nor within the organisation. Sources, however, said a change of guard was unlikely ahead of the general elections.         
	General secretary Ram Lal is likely to hear the complaints and try to defuse the crisis. Koshiari, an RSS man, is seen to be close to Rajnath.

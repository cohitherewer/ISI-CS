	Srinagar, June 9: Public transport stayed off the roads today in response to a four-day strike called by transporters against the fuel price hike, throwing life out of gear across the state.        
	Protesters pelted vehicles with stones at several places in the city. Over 72,000 commercial vehicles went off the roads, affecting commuters.        
	The state-run Road Transport Corporation pressed extra buses into service.         
	We were forced to take this step as the government did not heed our demands. The government has not revised the transport fare for the last three years although the oil price has gone up significantly during this period, Bashir Ahmad Matt, the chairperson of All Kashmir Transporters Welfare Association, said.         
	We were already incurring huge losses and the fresh hike has put tremendous pressure on us, Matt added.        
	The transporters are demanding a significant hike in fare as well as a reduction in oil prices, but the government is treading cautiously ahead of the Assembly elections later this year.         
	Transport minister Hakeen Yaseen said negotiations with the transporters had begun.         
	We are sure that some breakthrough will be achieved and the strike will end soon, he said.         
	The local traders federation will join the transporters agitation on Wednesday.         
	The tourist season is at its peak in Jammu and Kashmir and all the hotels are booked.         
	Consumer affairs minister Taj Mohidin said the government had agreed in principle to slash sales tax.         
	We have a plan to slash diesel price by Re 1 or Rs 2 and LPG by Rs 14, but this will cost the government Rs 100 crore. We are meeting the Centre on June 16 to arrive at a decision, he said.

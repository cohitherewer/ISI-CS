          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 17: The midnight hoax of the red army yesterday made the Indian Railways sweat and caused inconvenience to thousands travelling via Gaya-Dhanbad line.        
	Traffic along the Gaya-Dhanbad line was stalled for more than six hours yesterday and services remained disrupted in parts till the morning.         
	According to reports that reached the headquarters, a group of armed rebels overpowered the stationmaster, porter and cabin man of Nathganj Halt on the BiharJharkhand border falling under the administrative jurisdiction of Gaya yesterday.         
	The captive rail staff were made to convey a warning (over the railway communication system) that a chunk of the track had been blown up by rebels.         
	Once the message flashed, the rail officials detained all trains. To add credibility to their claim, the Naxalites lobbed a couple of crude bombs on parts of the track.         
	The hoax was played before midnight. Fortunately, the Rajdhani Express had crossed by then.         
	Reports stated that the rail officials did not venture out to ascertain whether the track was really blown up or not in the dark.         
	It was only after daybreak that the reality dawned.        
	Dozens of long-distance trains, including HowrahMumbai Mail remained stranded at railway stations for nearly six hours. Embarrassed railway officials had a difficult time explaining the delay to passengers.         
	While admitting that no damage was caused to the track at Nathganj halt, Gaya stationmaster Sandeep Kumar insisted that the threats were not a hoax as and that bombs were blasted along the tracks. Fortunately the crude bombs did little damage to the tracks, said an apparently embarrassed stationmaster.         
	This is not the first time that the red army played such a bomb trick on the railway. A similar threat was played at Phesar railway station of Aurangabad district earlier.

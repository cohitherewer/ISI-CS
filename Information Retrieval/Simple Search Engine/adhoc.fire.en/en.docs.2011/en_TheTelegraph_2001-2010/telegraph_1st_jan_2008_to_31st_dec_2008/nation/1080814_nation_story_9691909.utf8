The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nikaah: clerics vs scholars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nikaah: clerics vs scholars
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Sayeda Hamid performs the nikaah. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, Aug. 13: Clerics of Deobands Darul Uloom today termed the marriage conducted by a woman qazi illegal but religious scholars sprang to the defence of the couple, saying there was nothing un-Islamic about it.        
	Four clerics of the theological school have issued a statement condemning the so-called marriage between Naesh Hasan and Imran Naeem in Lucknow yesterday that was solemnised by Sayeda Hamid, an Islamic scholar and central Planning Commission member.        
	The Sunni couple also broke another convention by choosing a Shia qazi to declare them married.         
	This kind of marriage under the arc-lights of the media is nothing short of a drama, the clerics statement said.        
	Ahmad Khizar Shah Masudi, Darul Ulooms deputy secretary in charge of education, said the marriage was a cruel joke on Shariat laws.        
	An exception to the Muslim Marriage Act under which a man acts as a qazi can be made when there is a compulsion. This could be over nonavailability of a qualified male qazi, which can happen in a rural area, he said.        
	The couple  she a social worker and he an NGO activist  insisted they had violated no laws. We followed basic Islamic tenets, said Naesh, 28, as husband Imran, 41, nodded.        
	The strongest point to prove the marriage is the nikaahnama that we have signed. This is the soul of this marriage and we are bound by this, she said.        
	Hamid, who popped the question nikaah qubul hai to the bride, said there was nothing in Islamic laws to suggest that a woman could not be qazi.         
	Marriage in Islam is a contract. A qazi is an arbiter who brings a man and woman together and asks ritualistically if they have consent to this contract. How does it matter if the job is done by a woman? she said.         
	Naim-ur-Rahman Siddiqui, scholar and founding member of the Lucknow-based Ulema Council of India who was present at yesterdays nikaah, admitted that several traditions and established norms had been broken but there was nothing un-Islamic about it.         
	Naim said the role of the qazi is not mandatory in the strict sense.        
	The khutba (sermon) recited by a qazi based on Quranic verses is addressed to the groom and highlights the significance of the association, he said.        
	Naim also pointed out the groom was accompanied by a male friend as witness. Under the Sharia, a womans testimony is valued at half of a man. So if two women or adult girls are witnesses, it meets the norm, said Mufti Mahfooz Illahi, a scholar from Bhopal.        
	In yesterdays marriage, the bride had four women witnesses, which is equivalent to the presence of two men.

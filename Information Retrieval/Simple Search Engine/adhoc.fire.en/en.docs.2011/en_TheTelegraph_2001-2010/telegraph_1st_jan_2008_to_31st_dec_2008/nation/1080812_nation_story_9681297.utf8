          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 11: The glittering gold may have made him Indias most eligible bachelor, but it is not enough to make Abhinav Bindra a suitable boy for the corporate brandwagon.        
	As a billion people feted Indias first individual Olympic winner, talent management companies remained sceptical whether Indias new sporting icon will make it to the list of top brand endorsers such as Sachin, Dhoni or a Shah Rukh.        
	His is certainly an exemplary achievement and there may be a couple of companies who would come forward for a tactical and topical relationship with him. But that will be in the context of only this achievement and will be a short-term affair. I dont see any advertiser seeking any long-term relationship with Bindra, said Vinita Bangad, vice-president, Percept Celebrity Management.        
	Brands, experts pointed out, look for high visibility and long-term appeal in an endorser.        
	Jeet Banerji, who heads sports management company Gameplan, said cricket, with its ability to attract eyeballs, would remain a brand managers favourite.         
	Other than cricket no other sport has that kind of following here. A gold medal, however historic, does not bring Bindra or shooting as a sport into the limelight to that extent that it becomes a part of our daily lives, he said.         
	Brand managers pointed to the case of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who won a silver at Athens four years ago, but failed to become a brand name.         
	Rathore briefly endorsed Cokes Piyo Sar Uthake campaign along with Jassi (Mona Singh). But commercials featuring them ran briefly and soon Aamir Khan became synonymous with the campaign.         
	This is an attitude Indian sports does not need from India Inc, said Moraad. A. Khan, ace shooter and Commonwealth gold medallist.        
	Khan, the only Indian member of the International Shooting Sport Federation, said he had approached 12 major companies for sponsoring the top seven Indian shooters, including Bindra, before they began preparations for Beijing. None of them refused, but none of them accepted my proposal either. After pursuing for months, I gave up.         
	According to Khan, if sport has to be promoted, it has to be delinked from corporate returns.         
	Brand managers disagree. But that is exactly how endorsements enter a sporting arena: through a sports or a sportsmans ability to bring returns by drawing eyeballs and influencing buyers, said Percepts Bangad.

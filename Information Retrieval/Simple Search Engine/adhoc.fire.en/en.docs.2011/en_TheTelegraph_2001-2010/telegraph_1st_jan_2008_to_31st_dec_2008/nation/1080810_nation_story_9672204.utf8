          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 9: Thrice in the last three years, Maharashtra has lost projects to Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. Now, it is adamant not to let Bengal walk away with its Videocon LCD panel unit.        
	Since the project was cleared on Tuesday, revenue minister Narayan Rane has been breathing fire at the chief minister. But Vilasrao Deshmukh has kept mum, letting his office fire back that the Navi Mumbai plot was not given to Videocon at throwaway prices.        
	Rane had alleged the 250 acres in Kalamboli could have fetched Rs 3,000 crore in the open market instead of the Rs 300 crore it went for. But a statement from Deshmukhs office said the land, belonging to the City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), had not been undervalued.        
	The statement said much of the plot was totally undeveloped and would require a basic investment of Rs 150 crore to make it suitable for use by an industrial house.        
	Spread over three villages in Kalamboli, only 55 hectares would be the actual saleable land while the rest would be used to develop essential infrastructure, the statement said. The Cidco had pegged the land value at Rs 792 crore.        
	Land given to Navi Mumbai SEZ (promoted by Reliance Industries) in 2003 in the same areas was at the rate of Rs 64 lakh per hectare. Land proposed to be given to Videocon is at the rate of Rs 300 lakh per hectare, the statement said.        
	This is about five times more than the land given to SEZ in 2002-03. This is the current land value in these areas and therefore there is no undervaluation of the land, it added.        
	Bulk undeveloped land like the one being offered to Videocon does not attract the market rates since the usable lands are about 55 per cent as per the planning norms and substantial investment in infrastructure is required for making such lands market friendly.        
	The statement waved off charges that the deal would lead to a huge loss of revenue, saying it had adequate safety features to ensure the Cidco would not lose money.        
	A joint venture between Videocon and the Cidco on a debt to equity ratio of 1:1 (Rs 4,000 crore equity, Rs 4,000 crore debt), the partners would contribute Rs 340 crore (34 per cent equity), and Rs 260 crore (26 per cent equity).        
	Set up under the semiconductor promotion policy of the information and technology department, the project would get another Rs 2,000 crore from the Centre. Forty per cent of the shares would be sold in the open market to raise Rs 1,400 crore while the rest would be raised through financial institutions.        
	To insulate the Cidcos interest from market fluctuations, Videocon has proposed to buy back 26 per cent of Cidcos equity after a lock-in period of five years for Rs 910 crore at Rs 35 per share, a government official said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Manmohan Singh at the DRDO event in Delhi. (AFP)		    
	New Delhi, May 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today felicitated Indias defence scientists but did not mention a word on what the military technology establishment ranks among its biggest achievements  the May 11 and May 13, 1998, nuclear tests.         
	What will rankle the BJP even more is that the Prime Minister was speaking not to a political audience but to a hall full of scientists and technologists at the headquarters of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) here, on the golden jubilee of the organisation, on a date that coincides with the 10th anniversary of Pokharan II.         
	The Opposition BJP has already alleged that the UPA government was not giving the nuclear tests pride of place in the way the NDA government did.         
	And today, in the heart of Indias military science establishment at the headquarters of the DRDO, the Prime Minister chose not to even mention the event.         
	The immediate conclusion that many people in the audience drew was that the Prime Minister was unwilling to attract international attention to Indias nuclear programme when New Delhi was trying to resolve delicate issues over the India-US civilian nuclear deal.         
	Shortly after the Prime Minister gave away the awards and gave his speech and left to meet selected DRDO scientists in a separate room, the organisation screened a documentary showcasing its achievements beginning with the nuclear tests.         
	Singh, however, congratulated a team of scientists led by Avinash Chander  director of the Hyderabad-based Advanced Systems Laboratory who is Indias latest missile man  on the successful firing of the 3000-km range Agni III missile that was tested last week. The missile is said to be capable of delivering a one-and-a-half tonne nuclear warhead.         
	But even that could not stymie the murmur that arose in the hall shortly after the Prime Ministers departure. In his speech, the Prime Minister noted that during the past 50 years, the DRDO has created an extraordinary range of infrastructure and technologies covering aeronautics, missiles, radars and electronic warfare systems, combat vehicles and armaments, naval systems and special materials and manufacturing processes. The country is proud of your achievements.         
	The Prime Minister said successful tests of long-range ballistic missiles indicate growing technological prowess. He even congratulated the DRDO on its delayed projects, such as the Light Combat Aircraft (Tejas) and the main battle tank Arjun.         
	The only concession he made to the strategic weaponisation programme was in the broad-brush statement that it is imperative that India is fully equipped to effectively respond to any external threat.         
	Manmohan Singh expressed his concern over delays in DRDO projects while noting that development of high technologies was complex and time-consuming.

	New Delhi, June 6: The BJP, buoyed by the trust vote victory in Karnataka today, has decided to play a new game: split H.D. Deve Gowdas flock and beef up its bench strength.        
	BJP leaders said despite breaching the southern barrier, the party was dogged by a sense of insecurity as it had not won a simple majority on its own.        
	The party had fallen short of three seats in the House of 224 and had to seek the support of six Independents to make the magic number. Five of them have been made ministers but the BJP is not confident about how committed they are.        
	Sources said the BJP had decided to strike when the iron was hot as Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) was not in good shape and there was a strong undercurrent of resentment against him.        
	The message has gone out that the BJP is here to stay. We are not going to be the third party in this state any more and that enhances our bargaining power. We would definitely like to exploit this situation to optimise our strength in the House without losing much time, a party leader said.        
	Only two days ago, chief minister B.S. Yedyurappa had called on Gowda at his home and exchanged pleasantries.        
	Gowda had then said he was happy that Yedyurappa had taken the oath of office in the name of God and the farmers.        
	No chief minister has taken the oath in the name of farmers. It shows his concern for peasants. I welcome this gesture and extend all co-operation to his efforts for the welfare of farmers, he had said.        
	The first step the BJP has taken to keep its house intact is make veteran leader Jagadish Shettar the Speaker. A prominent Lingayat leader and four-time MLA, Shettar was forced to accept the job as the Speaker holds the key in defection games played in states having fractured mandates.        
	The second step it is setting out on is to create a rift in Gowdas party, which has 28 MLAs.        
	BJP leaders said many Dal (S) legislators were already in touch with the party and efforts were on to win over some others. The idea was that even if a vertical split in the Dal (S) legislature party was not possible immediately, some of Gowdas MLAs had to be in the BJPs pocket to ensure its survival in times of crisis.        
	The party is also worried about internal factions and the growing clout of the Bellary brothers. These three Reddy brothers, who are iron-ore millionaires, and a friend had won Bellary, Davangare, Gadag and Haveri for the BJP.        
	Some in the party said there was need for an MLA cushion as the chief minister was temperamental and could upset the fragile balance any time.

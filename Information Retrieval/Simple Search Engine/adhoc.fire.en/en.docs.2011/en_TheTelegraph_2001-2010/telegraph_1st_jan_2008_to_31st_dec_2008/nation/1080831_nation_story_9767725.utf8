          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Aug. 30: Christian schools and colleges in Karnataka that remained shut yesterday to protest attacks on the community in Orissa have angered the states BJP rulers.        
	Primary and secondary education minister Vishveshwara Hegde Kageri has directed his department to send showcause notices to some 2,000 institutions that declared a holiday as part of a nation-wide call by the Catholic Bishops Conference of India and Christian associations.        
	Kageri said their decision was unauthorised. The institutions, he added, didnt seek approval from the government, which lays down the list of holidays, before joining the protest against the violence that has claimed over 10 lives since Sunday, one of them a woman burnt alive in an orphanage.        
	Educational institutions should not become a tool in their hands to make capital on such issues. Such actions will influence the sentiments of young people and affect learning, the minister said.        
	The institutions resented the interference.        
	Sister Sajitha of a Bangalore womens college said Fridays protest was against all forms of violence. The country is increasingly becoming intolerant. We need to stop and think where it is leading us to. The events in Orissa should be an eye-opener, she said.        
	A principal of St Josephs institutions, which run several schools and colleges, said the government couldnt dictate what they should do.

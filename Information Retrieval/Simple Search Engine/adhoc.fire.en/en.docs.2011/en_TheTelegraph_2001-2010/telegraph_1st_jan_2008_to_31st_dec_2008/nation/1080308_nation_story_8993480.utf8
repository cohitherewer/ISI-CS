	Bhubaneswar, March 7: The parents of mariner Rajesh Sarangi are still hopeful of hearing from their son, soon.        
	The 31-year-old Rourkela-based man was one among the 25 Indian crew of the cargo ship, Rezzak, which disappeared on February 18 near the Turkish coast.         
	The ship was carrying steel billets and had left Russia for Turkey on a 24- hour voyage.         
	Rajeshs family suspects foul play behind the vessel disappearance and has urged the Indian government to probe into the incident, including the Russia angle the vessel was anchored there.         
	The ship belonged to Mumbai-based Pelican Marine and was carrying steel billets from Russia to Bartin Port in Turkey.         
	Tracking centres lost contact with Rezzak on February 18.         
	Turkish authorities have reportedly launched a search for the ship.         
	Though the vessel should be well within the satellite range, no official messages are being received. The authorities are telling us that details of the ship and crew is still not known, said Rabinarayan Sarangi, Rajeshs father.         
	The search for the vessel is being conducted by International Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre has been unsuccessful: Only a raft belonging to the vessel was found drifting some 5 nautical miles off the Turkish coast.         
	The ship was 26-year-old. Its not clear how the ship was allowed to sail to Turkey despite hostile weather. I would only request the government to follow the case up. We are feeling so helpless without our son, Sarangi pleaded.         
	Rajesh joined as chief officer on November 26, 2007.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The NDA today asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to remove railway minister Lalu Prasad from the Union cabinet citing proof of his involvement in a land-for-job scam.         
	NDA leaders said they had submitted the evidence to the Prime Minister. In a letter to Singh, the NDA leaders alleged that people had got jobs in the railways after handing over land to Lalu Prasads relatives. They also accused the minister of giving jobs to those who had deposed in his favour in the fodder scam.         
	A delegation made up of BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Janata Dal (United) leaders Sharad Yadav, Shivanand Tiwari and Rajiv Ranjan Singh called on the Prime Minister.         
	The Dal (U) leaders, who had levelled the charge against Lalu Prasad before the media earlier, also accused Union ministers Premchand Gupta, Kanti Singh and Raghunath Jha of involvement in the scam.         
	Naqvi said the Prime Minister should not keep silent on the matter. If the Prime Minister does not act, this will send a wrong message that he is also hand-in-glove (with Lalu Prasad). The leaders said the documents could be verified by the PMO or an investigating agency. Yadav said the Prime Minister had promised to look into the matter.

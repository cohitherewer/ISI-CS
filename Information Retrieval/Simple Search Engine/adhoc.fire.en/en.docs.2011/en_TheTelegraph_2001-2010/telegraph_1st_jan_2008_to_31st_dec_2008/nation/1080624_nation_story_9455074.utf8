          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Rashtrapati Bhavan: Green spree                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam lit up the Rashtrapati Bhavan with his ideas about solar power. Pratibha Patil, with a yen for more earthy matters, is treating trash.        
	The President, on a spree of making things green, is turning over a new leaf with a waste-segregation plan on the sprawling estate.        
	Roshni, as the programme is called, is aimed at encouraging people to see things in a new light by turning eco-friendly. Patil will formally launch the drive next month, but 7,700 residents in areas around the Rashtrapati Bhavan have already made a beginning of sorts.        
	The New Delhi Municipal Council, the civic body for Lutyens zone, made a presentation to the residents over the weekend. There was also a street play to spread the message about the seriousness of the problem as landfills (where garbage from across the city is dumped) are almost full, said a Rashtrapati Bhavan official.        
	Delhi generates 8,000 tonnes of waste every day, which is projected to go up to 15,000 tonnes by 2015 according to government estimates. And with landfills literally overflowing with garbage, time and space is running out.        
	Residents were lured into Roshni with bright blue and green buckets so they could start separating waste at home.         
	Leading by example, the Rashtrapati Bhavan kitchen  which, on the Presidents instructions, now specialises only in desi fare to give foreign delegates a taste of real India  has started separating what it discards.        
	The kitchen waste is dumped in compost pits to create manure that is to be used in the estates gardens.        
	The manure created by kitchen waste is not sufficient for our gardens. The aim is to be self-sufficient and in a year we hope to have enough manure. The next step is vermi-composting, the official said.        
	Patil, who has decided to embrace all things green, from organic manure to rainwater harvesting, is also known to have issued instructions to ban plastic.         
	More eco-friendly products will be used and the complex will become a plastic-free zone, the official said.        
	The President is also doing her bit to reduce carbon emission.        
	For a start, Rashtrapati Bhavan will make efforts to reduce its electricity bills.        
	Stickers have been pasted in the estates offices asking staff to save on electricity. Kalams solar power will also come into the picture.        
	Solar energy will be used. There will also be energy audits, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salmans poison, Pakistans meat
                                                                                                               Salmans poison, Pakistans meat
                              Salman: Pakistan-bound?                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 23 (PTI): Salman Khan could have spared himself a lot of trouble by crossing the international border from Rajasthan when the urge to shoot black bucks possessed him.        
	It is legal to hunt the endangered species in Pakistan, and the government invites you to do it in its wildlife sanctuaries.        
	At least 96 people registered on Thursday to hunt at a wildlife park in Pakistans Punjab in response to a government advertisement that promised recreation and joy in hunting opportunity.        
	In the half-page newspaper ad, the director-general of wildlife and parks had invited applications for trophy hunting of blue bulls, black bucks, mouflon sheep and hog deer for three weeks.        
	Beginning tomorrow, at the Perowal Wildlife Park in Khanewal, 250km from Lahore, 20 of the hunters will be trying to shoot black bucks. Another 20 have registered to hunt the blue bull, 41 have opted for the hog deer and 15 for the mouflon sheep, wildlife officials said.        
	The fee for shooting a male blue bull is Rs 60,000 in Pakistani currency and that for a black buck, Rs 40,000. To hunt a hog deer, you must pay Rs 21,000 and for a mouflon sheep, Rs 25,000.        
	If you accidentally shoot and injure a second animal, you must pay double.        
	To ensure maximum comfort for the hunters, the director-general has provided camping facilities in the park.        
	The advertisement justifies the trophy hunting: As a result of successful captive breeding... the department has a variety of males of wild species (of) trophy size, which will be offered to genuine hunters for trophy hunting (in) 2008.        
	A wildlife official said from Lahore that only old and weak animals had been sorted out for hunting. Old animals create problems for others in the breeding process and are useless, he said.        
	Black bucks live 12 to 16 years and are believed to be one of the fastest animal species on the planet. In India, the animal is protected by the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.        
	Ten years ago, during the shooting of Hum Saath Saath Hain, Salman had gone hunting with a group of co-actors and allegedly shot a black buck and a chinkara in Rajasthan. Handed a five-year term, he has been out on bail after spending about a week in jail last year.        
	Pakistans wildlife department had earlier placed another newspaper advertisement inviting people to shoot pheasants and the urial (a wild sheep).        
	Arab sheikhs flock to the country every year for trophy hunting, with the troubled North West Frontier Province being the favourite spot.

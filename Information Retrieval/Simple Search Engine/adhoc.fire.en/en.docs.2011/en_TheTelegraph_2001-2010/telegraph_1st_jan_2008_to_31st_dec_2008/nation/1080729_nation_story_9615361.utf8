	Ghar mein shaadi hai, band bajane wale ko bulana hai  phone call from Delhi to PoK before the July 2005 Ayodhya attack              
	Neota baant diya hai (invitation cards have been distributed)  message sent before the November 2007 court blasts in Uttar Pradesh              
	Lucknow, July 28: Indias militants have devised a new code language abandoning their earlier hate-filled parlance, peppered with rants at dogs, police sources say.        
	Now, all their talk of terror plots and weapons is apparently couched in references to everyday things like foodstuff and weddings, or harmless animals like rabbits.        
	Two state police cells are now working round-the-clock to try and decode thousands of intercepted phone messages, looking for clues to where and when the next terror strike is likely.        
	Officers say they first noticed the militants new language around the time the Ayodhya complex was attacked three years ago. They believe that the conversation about the ghar me shadi  apparently between a Jaish-e-Mohammad man in Delhi and his handler in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK)  was a reference to the strike.        
	The shadi (marriage) was the attack; the band were the suicide attackers who needed to be summoned, a source in Uttar Pradesh polices anti-terrorist squad (ATS) said.        
	The ATS and the special task force (STF), each of which has set up a decoding cell, say the militants often refer to hand grenades as sev (apple).        
	One conversation said, Im hungry and need some apples. It was a request for hand grenades, the source said.        
	Ration pani (food and water) apparently stands for explosives, khargosh (rabbit) for pistols and revolvers, and calling a doctor means getting helpers for terror operations.        
	The ATS says that four suspects arrested after the November court blasts  Khalid Mujahid, Tariq Qazmi, Sajjadur Rahman and Akhtar  had used the new code to communicate with accomplices.        
	Old grenades that needed to be replaced were referred to as rotten tomatoes. A bird with a long neck meant AK-47s, an ATS officer said.        
	If they said, Its raining, spread your umbrella, they were warning accomplices that police had laid a trap, so they must hide in a safe place.        
	The problem, however, is that the code keeps changing. For example, a rotten tomato may mean an expired grenade today, but tomorrow it may mean a cadre who has betrayed the group, an officer said.        
	Or perhaps the code varies from one outfit to the other. We are already struggling to keep track of the changing names of the organisations themselves. Today it is Simi (Students Islamic Movement of India), tomorrow its Huji (Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami), the day after the Indian Mujahideen. One never knows who stands where, the officer said.                    TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

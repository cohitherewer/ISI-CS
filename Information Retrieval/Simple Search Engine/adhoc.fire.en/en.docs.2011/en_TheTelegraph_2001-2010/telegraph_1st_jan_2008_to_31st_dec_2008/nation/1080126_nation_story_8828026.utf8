	Patna, Jan. 25: Kahalgaon shopkeepers today downed shutters seemingly more for security reasons, than as a response to an all-Bihar bandh called by the RJD, LJP, CPI, CPM and NCP. 
    
	Flag-bearers of the peoples protest for adequate electrical supply, the Nagrik Sangarsha Samiti, abstained from the bandh altogether after having made peace with the government two days ago. 
    
	Bhagalpur, however, observed an almost successful bandh with most shops and markets being closed for the better part of the day. Though trains, buses and taxis plied, the Opposition was upbeat about the successful bandh.
    
	At Patna, there was a mixed response. Most public schools were closed, while mini-buses and autorickshaws, the citys lifeline, continued to ply. 
    
	Prominent leaders Shyam Rajak, Ramkripal Yadav and A.B. Siddiqui of the RJD, state NCP president Upendra Kushwaha, LJP leader Pashupati Paras all courted arrests along with 2,000-odd political workers. A senior police officer, however, called them preventive arrests. 
    
	Everyone would be released by the evening, he said. RJD national general-secretary Shyam Rajak told The Telegraph: I hope the government sends us to Phulwarisharif jail in stead of keeping us in Gardanibagh police station. 
    
	He added: We received a strong response from all corners of the state regarding the bandh. Railway Protection Force has been monitoring tracks and railway related establishments.
    
	Additional director-general (law and order) Anil Sinha said: We have alerted all police stations and made arrangements to monitor traffic. The government had ordered a judicial inquiry into Kahalgaon police firing on January 17 and 18, which had killed three people. 
    
	The protesters were demanding adequate power supply from National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at Kahalgaon. Though NTPC cannot provide direct electricity to people, the state electricity board has been providing 24-hour power to Kahalgaon after firing.
    
	Todays bandh was probably the first time in the recent times when Bihars people, while seeking their share of development, have not allowed the Opposition parties claim to be their natural allies.

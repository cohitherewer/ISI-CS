	Dynasty drama in Andhra    
	A dynasty drama that played to packed houses in Maharashtra has now moved to Andhra Pradesh. The cast of characters has changed but not the theme.    
	Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Raos son K. Rama Rao has stepped in to work for the party in the run-up to the May 29 bypolls. No problem with that yet, except that Chandrasekhar Raos nephew, Harish Rao, who was seen as the second-in-command has had his task sheet cut drastically short in a matter of months.    
	He was first limited to Siddipet constituency and later given responsibility of just one district, said a TRS leader. He was all powerful just three months back.    
	Rama Rao is now in charge of the bypoll campaign and is also running the partys student wing.    
	Sensing change in the air, many senior leaders are gravitating towards Rama Rao. When TRS organised a public meeting at the Parade Grounds under the banner on April 27, the cut-outs and banners of Rama Rao, who was little heard of till then, filled the entire area.    
	In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray has a similar problem in the family. His son, Uddhav, leads the party. But his nephew, Raj, has formed the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.     
	Online connect for zoos    
	Zoos across the country will soon be able to share information online with those outside, updating status and breeding programmes of the animals in a scientific manner.    
	The central zoo authority will sign an agreement of membership with the US-based International Species Information System, which has worldwide presence with 700 members.    
	The move would help 62 zoos in India get first-hand information about animals in other facilities across the world as well as exchange animals whenever required.    
	For instance, through the online system, it would be easy for the members to directly contact his counterpart in another country and facilitate early exchange of the animals as desired. A lot of time is consumed in tracking the animals required for exchanging, B.R. Sharma, a member secretary of the zoo authority, said.      
	Indian film in UN campaign    
	A story about a young boy who discovers the solution to global warming from a monk in the Himalayas has been adopted by the UN as part of its initiative to green the planet and stop global warming.     
	The documentary by Mumbai filmmaker Nitin Das has become part of the UNs worldwide campaign to plant trees.    
	he seven-minute film is part of the Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign that encourages people, communities, civil society and governments to plant trees aiming for a total of 1 billion trees worldwide each year.    
	The video advocates tree planting. We explored whether there was any hidden political or other message and when we were assured we uploaded it on our website, Meryem C. Amar, information officer of the UN Environment Programme, said.     
	The initiative has been well received by countries, with nine NGOs and several government organisations including the government of Uttar Pradesh participating.

	Taare Zameen Par has left the Indian Prime Minister moved.     
	Manmohan Singh, who watched Aamir Khans film with his family on Sunday night at his official residence, said: The film has lessons for our educational system.     
	Aamir acts as a teacher in the movie and Darsheel Safary plays a dyslexic student. The film shows how the child suffers in school until the teacher identifies that he suffers from dyslexia  a learning disability.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, May 3: In election-bound Madhya Pradesh, the ruling party is holding all the demonstrations while a divided Congress has hardly got its campaign off the ground.        
	Over the past one week, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and the state BJP have been busy attacking the Centre on price rise, an alleged supply of substandard wheat and a range of other issues.        
	In the Congress, leaders are attacking each other. New state party chief Suresh Pachauri has already seen his authority weakened by defeats in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha bypolls.        
	Chauhan kicked off his offensive on the Centre with a 24-hour fast. Next, the BJP organised dharnas and demonstrations at all district headquarters against the Manmohan Singh governments alleged neglect of the state and its poor.        
	The chief minister has mocked Rahul Gandhis visits to tribal homes in the states Bundelkhand and Mahakaushal regions.        
	We had asked for rahat (relief) against drought conditions but what we got was Rahul, Chauhan said.        
	He has accused the Centre of supplying substandard red wheat for the poor: I inspected the FCI godown after receiving complaints. The wheat supplied by the Centre is not even suitable for animals.        
	Chauhan has launched a scheme under which the state government offers wheat at Rs 3 a kg and rice at Rs 4.50 a kg to people below the poverty line.        
	The Congress has launched its own demonstrations. In Bhopal, district Youth Congress chief Nasir Islam is agitating for disciplinary action against former party MP Gufran-e-Azam, a vocal and known adversary of state unit chief Pachauri.        
	Congress leaders said party general secretary V. Narayanswamy and secretary Jitin Prasada were more concerned about their ministerial assignments than the state polls.        
	The BJP is now planning a signature campaign, to be followed by a nyaya yatra (journey for justice). There will be an indefinite fast if the Centre fails to resolve the states problems.        
	Chauhan has written an open letter to the Prime Minister, asking him to answer 10 questions.        
	For instance, why has power supply to the state been cut from 350MW to 31MW from the central grid, he has asked.         
	The chief minister also wants to know why his state is being supplied low-grade coal; why the drought-hit are being denied central aid; and why the state is not being given its full foodgrain quota under the BPL category.        
	Chauhan has alleged that the foodgrain allocation has been for just 41 lakh of the states 62 lakh BPL families.

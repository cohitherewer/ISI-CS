  - Panel explains recommendations to defence top guns        OUR BUREAU                          Air cleared?                                        
	New Delhi, April 4: Members of the Sixth Pay Commission today sought to assuage the military brass after concerns that its recommendations were not matching parity of pay with length of service.        
	Close on the heels of the armed forces asking for an improvement in pay, the police brass also got into the act, asking for home minister Shivraj Patils intervention.        
	The meeting of the senior defence officers with the pay panel members followed two representations to defence minister A.K. Antony by the chiefs of staff committee.         
	The military brass pointed to several anomalies but emphasised it was important for the government to address the issue of ensuring pay on a par with officers in the civilian bureaucracy because armed forces personnel retire early with fewer avenues for promotions.        
	In a two-hour presentation to Antony, Air Chief Marshal F.H. Major, the vice-chief of naval staff and the vice-chief of army staff, the pay panel members said the bulk of the hike it had recommended for central staff was for the uniformed forces.        
	The defence ministry is now likely to take the armed forces plea for an improvement on the pay panel recommendations to the finance ministry. What we have got is a better understanding of the recommendations. There are some anomalies that are being addressed, a ministry official said.        
	The military brass was worried that the recommendations had given a short shrift to officers, who have shorter tenures in service than the civilian staff, and also that personnel below officer rank were not being given their due. The armed forces were particularly concerned that officers from the rank of lieutenant (and equivalent) right up to brigadier (and equivalent) had been placed in a single pay band.        
	The reason for the single pay band, pay panel members explained, was that it would guarantee increases in earning even for personnel who were stagnating. In effect, the pay hike had been delinked from promotion. The retirement ages of armed forces officers is staggered between 54 and 60 years, depending on rank.         
	The defence ministry official said anomalies arose when comparisons were drawn with other central services and when attempts were made to quantify risk factors of serving in dangerous areas in value terms. The armed forces want a hike in risk insurance for their personnel serving in counter-insurgency areas. But the central police forces, too, run a high risk in Naxalite areas.        
	Risk allowance was one of the demands that senior police officers of the central IPS association, including directors-general of paramilitary forces, had put before the home minister.        
	Internal security seems to be last on the governments priority, said an officer. The phrase internal security appears in the pay commissions recommendations only four times.        
	The officer, expressly peeved about the perks drawn by IAS officers, said the governments argument that IAS officers work more was ridiculous.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           A car damaged in the Jaipur blasts. (Reuters)                                  
	Calcutta, May 13: The blasts in Jaipur today unsettled the Jhawar family in Alipore for over 90 minutes.         
	Three of my uncles  Satish, Harish and Girish  went to Jaipur last week on a business trip. We knew they would be somewhere near Johri Bazaar as their business associates have shops there, said Atul, who began dialling his uncles the moment he learnt about the blasts from a friend.         
	But he could not get through to anyone or the familys business associates in Jaipur.         
	We were really tense. But around 9pm, my uncle got through and called us from a relatives house and informed they were safe, Atul said.        
	According to him, the three, scheduled to return to Calcutta on Thursday, stepped out of their business associates shop this evening to purchase ghewar  a Rajasthani sweet  from the famous LMB (Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar) in Johri Bazaar.         
	They were leaving for one of our relatives houses in an autorickshaw when they heard an explosion behind them. Then they got stuck in the chaos, said Atul.         
	At least eight blasts in a span of 20 minutes rocked the Rajasthan capital.         
	As the news of the blasts spread in Calcutta, panic gripped the close-knot Rajasthani community, which numbers around 12 lakh in and around the city.         
	In the Burrabazar area, people remained glued to their television sets to get information.         
	Almost everybody from Rajasthan has some link with Jaipur. Either they have relatives in the city or they have huge business interests, said Sundeep Bhutoria, secretary of the Rajasthan Foundation, an autonomous body of non-resident Rajasthanis.        
	According to him, the biggest reason behind the panic was lack of information from the city.         
	Prakriti Jalan spent over an hour trying to contact cousin brother Rabindra, a trader in gems and jewellery in Johri Bazaar before finally getting through to him.         
	He (Rabindra) told me that he was in his shop when the blast happened barely 100m away. I am relieved that he is fine, said the homemaker, who grew up in Jaipur and got married to a Rajasthani family in Calcutta three years ago.         
	As reports suggested that the death toll was rising, a pall of gloom descended over the Rajasthani families in the city.         
	Jaipur has always been a peaceful city. We cant believe that it has become a terror target, said Nirmal Saraf, a Calcutta-based jeweller, who has his origins in Jaipur.

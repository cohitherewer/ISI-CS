	Patna, Jan. 15: Gammon-India, a leading construction company involved in Bihars highway projects, has charged JD(U) MLA Neeraj Kumar Babloo of extortion. 
    
	Babloo, an associate of Anand Mohan who is awaiting death sentence in the Beur central jail, represents Raghopur constituency in Supaul. 
    
	The authorities of Gammon-India has lodged an FIR against the MLA for making extortion threats and maltreating the manager of the firms unit building at the East-West corridor under the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral project in Bihar. 
    
	The FIR has been registered under Balua Bazaar police station in Supaul. 
    
	The MLA, with his henchmen, reached the camp office of Gammon-India at Madhubani on January 6 and misbehaved with the camps office manager P.K. Basak. The MLA demanded money from him, said the local manager Ramesh Madhubhasi of Gammon-India. 
    
	Madhubhasi also said the MLA asked for Rs 9 lakh every month from Basak to allow the company carry out its work in the region. He said the local management had lodged an FIR after receiving a clearance from Gammon-Indias headquarters at Mumbai, which was apprised of the matter. 
    
	When contacted Babloo clarified that he had not demanded any extortion money from the company. He admitted that he had gone to meet the firms local management on January 6. But, I had gone there to seek jobs for the local people, too. I had received complains from the locals which stated that the firm was engaging only outsiders in the work, which was naturally causing resentment. 
    
	Babloo described the FIR as a political conspiracy to tarnish his image. 
    
	I will meet chief minister Nitish Kumar and will request him to get the entire episode investigated by the CBI, he added. This is not the only extortion case against MLA Babloo. He has been charged with several other cases, which includes extortion, road hold-ups and dacoity.

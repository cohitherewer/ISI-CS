                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Not yet the time to disco, says Cong
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Pranab in New Delhi after the NSG waiver. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Congress members today crowed over the Vienna win, took swipes at the BJP and the Left, but put off full-scale celebrations till the nuclear deal had passed through the US legislature.        
	Pockets of euphoria sprouted in South Block and 2km away at 24 Akbar Road. The Congress headquarters, almost deserted as the NSG talks went down to the wire, swarmed with spokespersons and general secretaries as soon as news of the waiver arrived. They vied with one another to give their take to the media.        
	But keeping in mind the deals tortuous journey so far, the party decided not to rejoice too early. We are recognised globally as a nuclear power, but we should keep that part out of our campaign because we cannot queer the pitch for the US Congress by shouting we are a nuclear power, a source said.        
	However, a victory march outside Sonia Gandhis home by the party student wing, which had won three of four posts in the Delhi University polls, threatened to turn into a celebration of the Vienna win.         
	But as the marchers were about to break into bhangra, they were told to just burst crackers and let the band belt out a few numbers. The balloons carrying pro-deal slogans that lay limp on the lawns were inflated and illuminated, though.        
	Party leaders attacked the CPMs sovereignty plank, trashed the BJP as a sham flag-bearer of patriotism and projected the Congress as the true upholder of nationalism.        
	We did not sign the NPT or CTBT because all the NSG countries have accepted Indias commitment as a non-proliferationist. No other country has ever achieved this, said Digvijay Singh.        
	Minister Kapil Sibal broke into verse: Atal kabhi atal nahi raha, lekin Hindustan hamesha atal raha (Vajpayee was never unflinching but India always was).        
	Congress sources thanked George W. Bush, Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee and Amar Singh  if he hadnt bailed the government out, there would be no deal  the UPA allies and the bureaucrats and scientists involved in the deal, especially Anil Kakodkar, in that order.        
	Party sources said the government could now confidently walk into Parliament, which meets from October 17, and claimed an outmanoeuvred Opposition would not have the energy to move its threatened no-trust vote.        
	They said the waiver had taken the sting off the secret letter leaked to a US paper. Its a dead letter, chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.

	Vaishali, Jan. 21: Vaishali or Hajipur is literally going banana over it  threads woven out of the banana plant. 
    
	Hajipur supplies banana to the rest of Bihar and to parts of Jharkhand, Bihar and Bengal. After a single harvest tonnes of pieces of banana plants are disposed off leaving little space around Hajipur. Now plans are on to utilise this so-called waste to yield something that is productive and profit making. 
    
	Dining tablemats, bags, caps, bowls, wall-hangings, and a number of decorative items can be made from the banana thread  as Hajipur is finding out. The districts agriculture research institute, funded by Indian Council of Agriculture Research, has devised methods to extract banana threads  within the shortest time possible. 
    
	Hariharpur-based Krishi Vikas Kendra (KVK) has started training farmers to extract threads with a machine. KVK programme co-ordinator Brajesh Shahi told The Telegraph: It takes three to four days to extract 250gm of thread by hand. With our newly-designed machine, a farmer can extract up to 2.5kg in a day. 
    
	Shahi, however, stated that wherein the institute trained farmers in the production process, it was up to the Khadi Gramodyog, the Khadi Village Industries Commission and the state government to promote products both at national and international levels  to make the trade a success. 
    
	KVK has so far trained 300 people and has managed to produce 100 varieties of thread from the different types of plants. 
    
	Ramesh Singh, a farmer, said: We had never thought that the banana plant was worth anything. We thought the bark had a single use  helping children learn how to swim. 
    
	So far, only 10 farmers from across Vaishali and Gaya have shown interest in trying out banana extraction for marketing. But Shahi said the word was spreading and if the government came forward banana by-products would do well. 
    
	This is not KVKs first attempt at something unique. Previously it experimented with 15 varieties of mangoes and varieties of roses, marigold and lily. 
    
	After successfully trying out new methods, it also trains women and youth to start growing the plants and earn their livelihood in flower production. 
    
	People like Bineshwar Singh and Rajesh Singh have already become model farmers for their cauliflower seeds cultivation, thanks to KVKs constant help.

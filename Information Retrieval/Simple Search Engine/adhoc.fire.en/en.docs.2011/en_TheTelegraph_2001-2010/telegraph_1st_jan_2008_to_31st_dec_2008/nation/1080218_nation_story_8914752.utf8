          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 17: On the pristine beaches of Orissa, two battles are being fought.         
	One involves Olive Ridley turtles fighting for their survival against illegal trawler fishing. The other battle involves traditional fishermen, fighting a losing battle for livelihood.        
	Of the five arribada or mass nesting places all over the world, three are in Orissa  Gahirmatha (Kendrapada), Devi river mouth (Puri) and Rushikulya (Ganjam).         
	Every year, about 4-lakh Olive Ridleys journey to the coasts in Orissa, to feed, mate, congregate and nest. The season starts in October and lasts till the end of May. However the species are under immense threat falling a victim to illegal fishing, especially trawling and gill netting.        
	 The death toll is pushing the species near extinction. According to reports, there are only 8,00,000 female Olive Ridleys in the world. Looking into their reducing population, the species have been declared endangered by the International Conservation Union. Also, the turtles have been enlisted as Scheduled-I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.        
	Those areas where mass nesting of the Olive Ridleys happens, is also home to large number of traditional fishermen, who depend upon the sea for livelihood.        
	According to fisheries department, around 15,359 households, including some 9,568 BPL ones, from 165 villages in nine blocks of five districts (Jagatsingpur, Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Puri and Ganjam), have lost their livelihood due to a fishing ban during the turtle breeding season. Orissa has 589 fishing villages with a population of 3.32 lakh.         
	The prohibition in place within a radius of 20km from Gahirmatha in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary has been adversely affecting the mobility of fishing vessels and their livelihood. This has been affecting approximately 23,000 active fishermen from 15,359 households. This apart, the total amount of loss incurred by the marginalised communities in each year comes around to Rs 40.37 crore.        
	Despite recommendations provided by Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to arrange an alternative livelihood for those affected by the ban, no compensation has been provided as yet.         
	The CEC, on 6th April 2004, recommended directions that are yet to be implemented by the fisheries or wildlife department. The CEC had recommended a pass to traditional fishermen for passage through the core area of the sanctuary, and the involvement of traditional fisher community in conservation efforts. The traditional fishing communities residing in and around the three major nesting sites have been collectively protecting the Olive Ridley sea turtles from mating to hatching.         
	While mechanised fishing posing a threat to the turtles and their protection posing a bar on the fishermens livelihood, the area is locked in a battle to survive.

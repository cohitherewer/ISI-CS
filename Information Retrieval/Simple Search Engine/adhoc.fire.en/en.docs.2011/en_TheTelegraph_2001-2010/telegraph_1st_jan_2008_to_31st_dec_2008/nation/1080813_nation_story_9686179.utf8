          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 12: A young nun killed herself in her room yesterday after leaving an alleged suicide note blaming the mother superior, prompting calls for a probe into unsavoury happenings inside convents.        
	Sister Anupa Marys father Pappachan, a cook at Catholic Bishops House at Kollam, 70km from the Kerala capital, claimed she had been sexually abused.        
	He said Mother Superior Albena forced his daughter, 22, to go into her room to share her bed.        
	Congregation Superior-General Boniface Mary welcomed an impartial probe but another nun said the mother superior was a different person, Sister Seeja.        
	Pappachan said his daughter  found hanging from the fan in her room at St Marys Convent, Port Kollam  was driven to the extreme step by the callous mother superior.         
	A nun at the congregations headquarters at Kollam said the nun had never given them any clue to her alleged problems.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Das shows his resignation letter. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 6: Akhilesh Das, Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, today resigned from the party, blaming yuvraj Rahul Gandhis coterie for the organisations poor state in the heartland.        
	Das, an influential leader from Lucknow who till last month was a minister of state for steel, said: There is an unconstitutional power coterie. They dont have any knowledge, they are not Congressmen and they are all surrounding the yuvraj of the Congress party.         
	He said: It is unfortunate that only that coterie has an access to him, nobody else can tell him anything. He is controlling the entire Congress party and he is controlling the entire nation. If he is not happy with you, I mean specially if his coterie is not happy with you, you cannot be in the party.         
	Dass revolt is the first against Rahuls ascendancy in the Congress. Sources said he would move to the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	Congress insiders said influential party leaders from Varanasi, Mathura, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Padrona and Amethi were also in touch with BSP chief Mayavati, who is the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. A prominent Congress leader from Uttarakhand is said to be weighing options.        
	Dass exit has sent shock waves in the party, ahead of the 2009 general elections. But for the record, the Congress dubbed his move a sign of frustration for being removed from the council of ministers.        
	Spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: Many people like him come and go without a ripple in the Congress. His comments were made out of frustration for not including him in the council of ministers. We reject the allegations with contempt. This is the worst kind of political opportunism. She reminded all that he had been a Congress MP for the last 12 years.         
	According to the sources, Das used his connections with an IAS official to move closer to the BSP. The official, said to be close to Mayavati, was part of Dass staff when he was the Union minister. He reportedly quit after getting a favourable signal from Mayavati.        
	Das, though, owes his entry into politics to Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose support helped him get elected as Lucknow mayor in the early 1990s. The son of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Banarasi Das, he got a Congress ticket for the mayoral election but struck a tacit understanding with Mulayam. Minutes after getting elected, he drove to Mulayams residence to touch his feet.        
	He has resigned from the membership of the Rajya Sabha that was to end in a few months anyway.

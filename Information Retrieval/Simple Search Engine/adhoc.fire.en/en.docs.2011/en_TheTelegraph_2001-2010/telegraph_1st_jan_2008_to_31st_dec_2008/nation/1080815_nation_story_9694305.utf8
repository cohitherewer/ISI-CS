          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Cuttack, Aug. 14: The Orissa Board of Secondary Education (BSE) has issued a revised merit list for High School Certificate Examination 2008 after finding discrepancies in the tabulation of the marks.        
	The goof-up, they claimed, occurred due to computer-generated error, thereby, altering the sequence of the merit list of top 10 rank-holders.         
	Thus, students who had missed coveted positions have a reason to rejoice, as their names may appear in the revised toppers list. But few in the initial top 10 list might have to make way for others even as their marks would remain the same.         
	The revised matriculation merit list declared by the BSE yesterday has eight new names  pushing seven students out of the list.         
	The modified list was drawn after checking answer scripts and re-adding marks of applicants, said A.S. Bhol, the BSE controller of examinations.         
	The board authorities first stumbled upon the error when they found that some 10 points secured by Pragyan Paramita Pradhan in the (optional) science practical paper was not added to her aggregate. Pragyan of Saraswati Vidyamandir at Bhoinagar in Khurda ranked fifth when the results were declared on June 25. Now she has been catapulted to the top spot with her aggregate marks going up to 765 from 755. With that Bimal Prasad Panda (with 761) has slipped to the second spot after remaining the topper for 49 days. Bimal now shares the second spot in the revised list with two others  Madhusmita Sahoo and Girija Shankar Pati, as their aggregate marks have increased by nine and 10 marks, respectively, after re-checking and addition.         
	In yet another slip-up committed by the BSEs tabulation branch, Bijan Sarangi ranked ninth was credited with nine marks less than what he had actually secured. With his aggregate marks increasing to 760 from 751, he has been ranked third in the revised merit list.         
	The BSE officials have taken a serious note of the whole episode. They declared a revised merit list of the top 100 rank holders. From now on, the list of top 100 rank-holders will be published, said Nihar Mohapatra, the BSE secretary.

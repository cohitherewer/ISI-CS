	Raipur, March 4: Former BJP MP and VHP leader Ram Vilas Vedanti is back in controversy  this time for passing derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.         
	The comments were made in Rajim Kumbh (a state-sponsored religious event) in Rajim, 45km from Raipur, on Monday night. The state government cannot escape its responsibility, as Vedanti was invited as a state guest, said the leader of the Opposition, Mahendra Karma. State members of the Congress today created a ruckus in Chhattisgarh Assembly and forced Speaker Prem Prakash Pandey to adjourn the House till Wednesday.        
	As the House assembled at 11am, Congress members raised the issue and demanded an immediate discussion. The members charged the state government for using a religious event to propagate political agenda. They also demanded immediate action against Vedanti.

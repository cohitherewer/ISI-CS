	Patna, July 14: With every man likely to matter in the confidence vote of the UPA government, key allies in Bihar  the RJD and LJP  have started wooing their jail bird MPs to vote in favour of the confidence motion on July 22.         
	Two RJD MPs, Mohammad Shahabuddin of Siwan and Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, stand convicted for life terms for murder.         
	Recently, a Begusarai fast-track court convicted Ballia LJP MP Surajbhan Singh to 10 years imprisonment for a farmers murder.         
	The appeals against the lower courts convicting our MPs have been admitted by Patna High Court, said RJD spokesman Shyam Razak, adding: They are now entitled to participate in the parliamentary process.         
	Shahabuddin was recently shifted from the Siwan central jail to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), New Delhi, to be treated for his slip disc. Thus, he is in the capital, while Pappu Yadav is in the Tihar jail.        
	LJP spokesman Sanjay Singh has revealed that relevant judicial procedure would be followed to take the partys Ballia MP to the Lok Sabha on the day of voting.        
	Shahabuddin, though already behind bars, and Pappu Yadav had voted in the presidential polls that made Pratibha Patil the countrys first lady President.        
	It should not be a problem. We will pray in concerned courts for the MPs temporary release in order to participate in the trust vote. Going by the precedent and law, the court should permit their participation in the trust vote, Rajak hoped.         
	RJD boss Lalu Prasad said that his party has issued a whip for all its 24 MPs to remain present in the House in course of its two-day session and vote in favour of the UPA government and on the nuclear deal issue.         
	The partys chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Ram Kripal Yadav, has been issued the whip.         
	Out of the 24 RJD MPs, 22 belong to Bihar, while remaining two are from Palamau and Chatra Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand.

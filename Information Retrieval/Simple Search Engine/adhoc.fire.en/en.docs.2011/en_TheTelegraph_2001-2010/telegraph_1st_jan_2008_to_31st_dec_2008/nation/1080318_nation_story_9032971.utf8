                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Dad stone cold, mom rock solid    
	Neeta Bhanushali can move heaven and earth for her son, but cant make her husband budge an inch.    
	When Neeta, 27, could not convince Praful to pay for their five-year-old thalassaemic sons treatment, she decided to move court.    
	Four months after Jay was born, the couple learnt that he was suffering from thalassaemia and would not live beyond 20-22 years.    
	Praful said that since Jay would die eventually, we shouldnt waste money on his medication. When I refused to give up, he turned us out of the house, said Neeta.     
	For the next four years, Neeta tried to make Praful see reason, but he remained unmoved.     
	Jays medical expenses amount to around Rs 25,000 a month, and Neeta cannot afford such a huge sum.    
	Last year, she approached the Thane court, which directed Praful to take her and Jay back. When Praful refused to comply, Neeta forcefully entered the house.    
	Praful denied the allegations. I never said I would not spend money on Jay. Since the doctor had told us he would live only up to 20-22 years, I just told Neeta not to have any expectations from him, he said.        
	CM sees rhyme in crime    
	As muses go, this one is beyond rhyme and reason.     
	Poet-chief minister M. Karunanidhi recently found inspiration in a group of women smugglers.     
	When Tamil dailies flashed pictures of the five women, caught smuggling out rice meant for the public distribution system to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the DMK patriarch was more pained than peeved.     
	And arent the sweetest songs those that tell of the saddest thoughts?    
	So, Karunanidhi poured his heart out through his pen, wondering how the women could snatch food from the mouths of the poor.    
	The poem was titled A New Bharti Will Arrive, recalling nationalist poet Subrahmanya Bharatis ideal of women as the embodiment of love and mercy.     
	Hotels left high amp; dry    
	The greenfield airport at Shamshabad may have come as a boon for travellers, but for hotels around the old Begumpet airport, it means bad news.     
	Developers say Saifabad, Khairatabad, Secunderabad, Somajiguda, Ameerpet and Punjagutta in the citys central business district must brace themselves for a rough ride once the airport takes off and the red light flashes for Begumpet.    
	The hotels  most of which banked on the busy air traffic  seem to be the hardest hit.     
	The government should consider the proposal to allow domestic flights at Begumpet airport, said Muhammad Saleem, chairman of the Twin Cities Hotel Owners Association. That will ensure economic activity is not affected in the core city.    
	The booming real estate industry around the area, too, is set to nose-dive. Several developers have shelved their ventures, fearing there will be no takers for their properties once the airport is shifted to Shamshabad, 25km from the city.        
	On the ball    
	Cricket and climate were the flavours of a recent Saarc meet.    
	The conference had architects and students from India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka holding forth on how to shield the region from natural calamities.     
	But it wasnt all work and no play for the brainstormers at the conference, which ended on March 13. With cricket being a way of life in most of the Saarc countries, most members were game to pad up.    
	And gully cricket it was  short and sweet like the Twenty20.     
	Bangalore: Kits amp; Concepts is holding an exhibition of books for children of all ages. So all you little bookworms, head to TV Loganathan Towers at VM Street in Mylapore. The exhibition is on till March 30. Time: 10am to 4pm. Call 24985335 or 24985336 for details.

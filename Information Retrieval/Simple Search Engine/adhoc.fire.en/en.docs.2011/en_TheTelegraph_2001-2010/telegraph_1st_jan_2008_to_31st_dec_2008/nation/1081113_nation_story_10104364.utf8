                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP seizes ticket ad-vantage
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          The ad featuring Alvas allegation. (Saeed Faruqui)                                  
	Bhopal/Raipur, Nov. 12: The BJPs campaign managers have gleefully latched on to Margaret Alvas allegation that tickets were sold in the Congress.        
	They sell election tickets, we sell rice cheap, a BJP advertisement mocked in Chhattisgarh.        
	Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh sought an explanation from Ajit Jogi, the Congress candidate for chief minister        
	The BJP brought out several such advertisements in newspapers in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, which vote this month.        
	One that was released in prominent Hindi dailies screamed: Save Madhya Pradesh from getting sold. It added: If the Congress can sell tickets to its own party leaders, it will sell the state if it gets voted to power.        
	At a dozen public meetings he addressed, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan urged voters to pick those committed to development over those who were cheating on their own party colleagues.        
	Alva has resigned as Congress general secretary and been relieved of her responsibilities as member of the central election committee and the Congress Working Committee.        
	The ad said: She may have been shown the door but can it get rid of the prevailing culture in the party? The Indian democratic set-up has been vitiated just think what will happen next.        
	Alva, 66, had lashed out at the party for not giving her son Nivedith a ticket in the Karnataka elections in May but handing out tickets to relatives of leaders in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan that are going to the polls now. She alleged that cartels had sold party tickets in Karnataka.        
	Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee chief Suresh Pachauri reacted sharply to the BJPs ad campaign starring Alva, saying: It is unethical and uncalled for. It is an internal matter of our party and the BJP has no right to interfere. The campaign would have no impact on the ground level, he added.        
	Congress candidates and leaders believe silence will not do. Either Alva should have been expelled or forced to take back the allegation. We have no answer to it except to threaten the BJP that we will go to court over the ad. Alva continues to be part of the Congress, a state spokesperson said.

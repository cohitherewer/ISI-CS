                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Crossfire on Kashmir begins again
  - Embattled Pervez utters K-word and Pak House seeks global intervention; India livid         OUR BUREAU                          Musharraf                                        
	Aug. 13: When in trouble, cry Kashmir.        
	The Valley is back on the lips of the embattled Pervez Musharraf and it is again threatening to cloud India-Pakistan relations.        
	Kashmir beats in the heart of every Pakistani. Every Pakistani is with our brothers and sisters in Kashmir, Musharraf told his country on the eve of its independence day as calls mounted for his resignation.         
	His political opponents at home also sought to turn the Kashmir gun on him in the middle of an impeachment stand-off, accusing him of changing his stand and selling out to India on the issue.        
	The Pakistan National Assembly later adopted a resolution condemning the killing of Hurriyat leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz and others in Jammu and Kashmir and expressing solidarity with Kashmiris. It called on the international community to use its good offices with India to end atrocities on the Kashmiri people.        
	The resolution was moved by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party leader and information minister, Sherry Rehman, and supported by members of all parties represented in the lower house of Parliament.        
	The resolution drew a sharp response from India that said Pakistan was repeating mistakes of the past.         
	The late-evening statement from India was more strongly worded than the view officially expressed from New Delhi yesterday.         
	The Government of India finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in Pakistan on recent events in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. We are witnessing a recurrence of Pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality. To call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of India is gratuitous, illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for Pakistan in the past, the external affairs ministry said.         
	A warning added muscle to the Indian response. The Indian spokesperson said Pakistans leadership should understand that it should correct its position to avoid being confrontationist.         
	It is not too late for Pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon, and we would urge them to do so forthwith, said the ministrys spokesperson.         
	Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Sadiq had earlier said Islamabad was deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the Indian state that is resulting in loss of life and property of the Kashmiri people.        
	In the Pakistan National Assembly, an Opposition member, Marvi Memon, said the current government was extremely defensive on Kashmir and its decision to reinforce trade ties with New Delhi was a sellout to India.        
	Culture minister Khwaja Saad Rafiq said Musharraf took a U-turn on Kashmir and handed the issue to India for his vested interests, alluding to, among others, the former army chiefs proposal to demilitarise the entire Kashmir region.        
	In 1999, Musharraf had said nothing less than self-determination for Kashmiris was acceptable.        
	Rafiq also said the 1999 Kargil incursion had led to Pakistans humiliation before the world. I would appeal to all the political forces not to bail him (Musharraf) out in this House. People are not ready to listen to anything in his favour, the official Associated Press of Pakistan quoted him as saying.                    WITH INPUTS FROM NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD

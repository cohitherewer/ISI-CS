     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Gaya, Jan. 13: The arrest of Krishna Murari Yadav, allegedly a Naxalite leader and a suspect in the murder of former MP Rajesh Kumar, has shed no light on the circumstances that lead to the MPs death in Imamganj.
    
	Rajesh Kumar, it may be recalled, was assassinated during a campaign for the 2005 Assembly elections on January 23. After Yadavs arrest in Jehanabad a few days ago, it was believed that Gaya police would move closer to an answer. 
    
	Rajesh Kumar was contesting as an LJP candidate from Imamganj reserved constituency under the Gaya district. Kumar earlier represented Gaya in Lok Sabha between 1991-96 and he was twice elected to the Bihar Assembly from Bodh Gaya. When contacted, the Gaya superintendent of police, Amit Jain, conceded that the initial interrogation of Yadav has not been very fruitful. The police have sought five more days of police remand for the rebel. He would be quizzed intensely once the remand is granted, the SP conceded.
    
	Officers are hopeful that some link would be established once print outs of mobile bills, seized from the rebel, is made available.
    
	The Gaya polices track record in solving high-profile cases so far has been lack-lustre and as almost all political murders have remained a mystery.
    
	The death of deputy chief minister Jagdeo Prasad remains under a cloud even today. Though Prasad, the co-founder of Mandal politics in Bihar, (the other being late Karpoori Thakur) was killed in police firing in Kurtha (then part of Gaya) on September 4, 1975, allegations of a conspiracy dominated headlines after his death. Prasad was the father-in-law of present supply minister Suchitra Sinha.
    
	Few years later, Janaki Yadav, the Konch MLA, died under mysterious circumstances. The death was attributed to an accidental fall  but a question mark remained. Rajesh Kumars predecessor in the Lok Sabha and three-time MP Ishwar Chaudhary was also gunned down in the final stages of a campaign for the 1991-Parliamentary polls. 
    
	The investigation of that case yielded little result. 
    
	The problem with all police investigators, observers believe, is that besides being overworked, ill-trained and ill-equipped, they have a tough job at hand, as former politicians all had a number of enemies and all had been controversial figures all through their careers. 
    
	Those nursing a grievance against slain MP Rajesh Kumar included a hospital nurse who lodged a case of rape against Kumar when he was the parliamentary secretary in the Karpoori Thakur government in the seventies.

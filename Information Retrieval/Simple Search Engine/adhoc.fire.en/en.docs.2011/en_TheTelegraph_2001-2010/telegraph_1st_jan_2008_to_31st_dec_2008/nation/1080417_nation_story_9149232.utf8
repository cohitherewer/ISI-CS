	Brasilia, April 16: During the one week that they have of Indias woman President Pratibha Patil, Brazilians and Mexicans are seeking out of her presence what they themselves cannot, but would like to be.         
	On Tuesday, as Patil was leaving Rio de Janeiros Hotel Sofitel, a group of Mexican tourists found out about the presence of Indias woman President in their midst.         
	The tourists immediately dropped the pull of Rios famed Copacabana beach, a stones throw from the hotel, and gravitated towards Patil instead. She readily obliged the Mexicans, greeting them and posing for impromptu photographs in the hotel lobby as the tourists pulled out their cellphone cameras to record what for them was a slice of history.         
	One of the Mexicans said in broken English that she would show the picture of hers with an Indian President in her curiously resplendent silk sari and beige jacket to her daughter when she gets back to Mexico City.         
	Although Brazil and Mexico are large Latin American countries with stable political and social institutions, womens representation in those institutions is way behind that of India, South Asia or the Nordic countries.         
	But Hillary Clintons run for the US presidency this year has caught the imagination of people in Brazil and Mexico, which have become wistful about a woman President of their own, or at least, greater representation for women in their political institutions.         
	For people in Brazil and Mexico, Patils presence amidst them is a brief tryst with that fantasy, especially with neighbours like Argentina and Chile already having elected women Presidents. But it is not only Latin Americans who have had a taste of Patils informality this week.         
	At her very first programme in Sao Paulo on Sunday, a reception hosted by Hardeep Puri, Indias ambassador to Brazil, people of Indian origin were pleasantly surprised by her brevity. For decades, overseas Indians all over the world have been used to long speeches by Indian politicians, often delivered in a monotone.         
	After making her short speech at Sundays reception, Patil surprised Indians in Brazil by agreeing to pose for photographs with them in small groups although she had landed in Sao Paulo only hours earlier after a long flight.         
	For her overseas hosts used to ceremonial heads of state who merely repeat talking points prepared by ministers, Indias recently elected President is going to be a surprise, going by the Brazilian experience.         
	Her meeting yesterday with Brazils environment minister, Marina Silva  a 45 year-old woman who lived in the Amazon jungles until she was 16 years old and walked 14km every day with her father through the forest in search of natural latex  was anything but a discussion between a President and a minister.         
	Silva, who did not learn to read or write until she was 17 but is now a graduate in history, studying at night and working during the day as a maid, shared her powerful story with Patil.         
	Overcome, the President departed from her brief and narrated the story of Indias Bishnoi community, 363 members of which laid down their lives in 1730 in Rajasthans Jodhpur district against attempts by a local king to cut down trees.         
	They talked about someone both women know, ecologist Vandana Shiva, who is often at the receiving end of official ire. Listening to Patil it would have been difficult to believe that she was speaking on behalf of a government that is viewed by much of the world as intransigent on the environment.

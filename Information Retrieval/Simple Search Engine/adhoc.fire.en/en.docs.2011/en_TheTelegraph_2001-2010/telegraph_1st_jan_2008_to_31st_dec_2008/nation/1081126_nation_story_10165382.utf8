                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Husains Eyes not for Goa fest eyes
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Husain: Blacked out                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: M.F. Husains long-forgotten, award-winning documentary has come under the axe at the International Film Festival of India in Goa though it has nothing to do with goddesses.        
	Under pressure from Right-wing groups opposed to Husains works, the directorate of film festivals deferred the screening of Through the Eyes of a Painter that was to have been screened today.         
	The 18-minute documentary, an impressionistic collage on celluloid depicting Rajasthan through the eyes of Husain, won the Golden Bear in the short-film category at the 1967 Berlin Film Festival.         
	Right-wing organisations such as the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti and Sanatan Sanstha, which have been at the forefront of an intense campaign against Husain that forced the painter to go into self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, had raised objections to the screening yesterday.         
	In a letter to Goa chief minister Digambar Kamat, who belongs to the Congress, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti repeated the old allegation that Husain had hurt religious sentiments with his nude paintings of Indian gods and goddesses. The outfit pointed out that 1,250 police complaints had been lodged against the painter across the country.         
	At this stage, you are glorifying an accused person by exhibitioning (sic) his documentary and hurting our religious and national sentiments. Your action of inclusion of M.F. Husains documentary for your noble objective is not justified as a noble objective cannot be fulfilled at the cost of national honour, the letter said.         
	Festival director S.M. Khan left the door open for some compromise that could yet see the film being shown at the festival, on till December 2. The screening of the documentary has been deferred as we anticipated a law-and-order problem. It could be shown later, he said.         
	The film was to have been shown at 3pm today in the Framing Time section put together by the films division.        
	Khan admitted that the film, Husains first celluloid venture, had no controversial content and was just a depiction of the desert state.         
	The painter later made two other movies  Gaja Gamini (2000) with Madhuri Dixit and Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities (2004) starring Tabu  neither of which found many takers.        
	Film-makers and art critics expressed outrage at the decision to defer the screening.         
	This is ridiculous. Just because some people have problems with a film-maker, it (the documentary) cannot be treated like this, Assamese film-maker Jahnu Barua said.         
	Barua said he had seen the film six times and had found nothing objectionable. Its withdrawal, he added, amounted to an attack on freedom of expression.         
	Demanding that the film be screened, Dadasaheb Phalke winner Adoor Gopalakrishnan said: An artist should not suffer because of politics.

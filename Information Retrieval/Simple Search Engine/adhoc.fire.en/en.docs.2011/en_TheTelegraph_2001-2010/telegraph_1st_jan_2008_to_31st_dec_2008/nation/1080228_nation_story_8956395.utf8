                                                                                                               Nitish rap on Opp. fury
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 27: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today stressed that Bihar House condemned the Oppositions insinuations against Governor R.S. Gavai.         
	Concluding a debate on the governors opening speech, he said: Even if the Assembly records dont mention any defamatory reference on the opening day, Oppositions parallel speeches and barbs, though not on record, did hurt the governors sentiments.         
	With the incident, Nitish said, a wrong message was propagated to the nation about Bihars legislative culture. I want to make it clear that the whole House respects the governor and extends their co-operation, he said.        
	The chief minister said he went up to the governor after the Assembly ruckus was over and apologised on behalf of everyone.         
	Lambasting the Opposition, who had preferred to walkout during Nitishs speech, the chief minister said: You (RJD) should rather pressurise the Centre to intervene in the Maharashtra affairs as it can do so under the provision of Article 355 of the Constitution. It (the section) empowers the Centre to direct a state in event of internal disturbances.         
	The leader of the House reminded all that Maharashtra was known for its social movements. Only a few people have been fomenting trouble to grab mileage there, he added.         
	Nitish also read out a letter that he wrote to his Maharashtra counterpart Vilasrao Deshmukh on February 6 to express his anxiety over the regional and linguistic flare-ups there.         
	He wondered why the Congress-led UPA government had been keeping mum on the issue. There must be politics behind the silence, he said.         
	When RJD leader A.B. Siddiqui intervened to confront Nitish about the absent monitoring cells to take care of people coming back from Maharashtra, Kumar said the home secretary and director-general of police and he, himself, had been taking care of them.

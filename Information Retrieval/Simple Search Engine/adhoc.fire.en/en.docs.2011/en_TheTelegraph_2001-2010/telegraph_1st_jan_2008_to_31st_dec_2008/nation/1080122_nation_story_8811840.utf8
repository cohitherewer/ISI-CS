	New Delhi, Jan. 21 (PTI): None of the 14 persons arrested in Spain for allegedly planning terror attacks appears to be from India, according to information reaching official agencies here tonight.
    
	Sources said Indian agencies had approached Spanish authorities for the identification of the 14 arrested in Barcelona on Saturday and taken to Madrid for questioning the next day. Two of them were believed to be Indians.
    
	However, reports reaching here indicated the group had no Indians and mainly comprised Pakistanis and Saudi Arabians, the agencies said.
    
	The foreign ministry had approached the authorities in Madrid for providing immediate consular access in case any of the arrested 14 was Indian.
    
	The Spanish police today linked all the arrested men with the Lashkar-e-Toiba.
    
	Those who gave the orders are in Pakistan. They were preparing suicide attacks. Those that came here were ready to commit suicide, a Spanish daily quoted a source as saying.

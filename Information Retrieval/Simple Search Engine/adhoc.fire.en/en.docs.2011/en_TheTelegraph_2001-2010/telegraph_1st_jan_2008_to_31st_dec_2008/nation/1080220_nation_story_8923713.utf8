The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Top judge salvo at shameful Teesta
                                                                                                               Top judge salvo at shameful Teesta
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan today lashed out at social activists, particularly Teesta Setalvad, for accusing the apex court of deliberately delaying trial in the Gujarat riot cases.        
	It is shameful not in good taste, Balakrishnan said, minutes after a bench, headed by the CJI, convened to hear the bail petitions of several Muslims who have been charged under the defunct anti-terror act (Pota) and are languishing in jail.        
	A section of the media had quoted Setalvad and other social activists as saying the cases were being adjourned repeatedly and shunted from one bench to another since 2004 to delay their hearing.        
	The Gujarat government has charged at least 89 people under the anti-terror act, although a committee reviewing the law had given them a clean chit. They have been behind bars ever since the apex court stayed their trial in 2003. The Supreme Court had said the stay would be vacated once it had taken a decision on transferring the case outside Gujarat. The decision is still pending.        
	The court specifically voiced its displeasure over remarks attributed to Setalvad, whose NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace, has been at the forefront of the fight for justice in the Gujarat riots cases.         
	Who is this Teesta Setalvad? Is she a spokesperson of these persons or petitioners? the bench asked. If she is representing these persons (those seeking bail), we do not want to hear them.         
	The lawyers for the bail seekers, Harish Salve and Colin Gonsalves, stepped in to pacify the judges. You should treat it with contempt and ignore it, Salve said.         
	The court then resumed hearing the bail petitions.

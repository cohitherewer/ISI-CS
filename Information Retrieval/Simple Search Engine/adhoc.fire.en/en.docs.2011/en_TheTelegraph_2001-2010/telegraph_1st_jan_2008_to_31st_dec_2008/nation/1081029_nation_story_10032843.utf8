  - Crunch delays setting up of several IITs and IIMs        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Centre has invested less than a fifth of the money needed to carry out the never-before expansion in higher and technical education it promised under the 11th five-year plan.        
	The government has accepted it is woefully short of funds to build the new premier institutions envisaged, Planning Commission documents reveal less than a year after the five-year plan was adopted.        
	Only Rs 37,724 crore has been allocated though the requirement is over Rs 210,000 crore  more than five times higher  says a concept paper drafted by the commission.        
	The Telegraph has a copy of the document, now in circulation among various arms of the government including the human resource development (HRD) ministry, which looks after education.        
	The gap between the amount required and the amount available is so huge that it may not be made up even by the 12th plan (2012-2017), leave alone the 11th plan for which these promises were made, a commission official said.        
	The commission has suggested a way out: embrace the public-private partnership (PPP) mode of funding, but HRD ministry officials are uncomfortable given Indias policy against commercialisation of education.        
	It is true that we are faced with a desperate shortage of funds, but the PPP mode of funding, we believe, is not necessarily the panacea, a senior ministry official said.        
	The government had last year signalled a shift of focus towards expanding higher education after three years of making it more inclusive through the Other Backward Classes quota and the scholarships and schemes for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities.        
	By announcing new premier institutes, and thus more seats, in the special plan, the United Progressive Alliance hoped to placate those it had angered by introducing the OBC quota, a senior government source said.        
	Among the planned institutes are eight Indian Institutes of Technology, seven Indian Institutes of Management (see chart) and 20 Indian Institutes of Information Technology. There are to be 16 new central universities  one in each state that lacks any  and 14 other centrally funded universities of global standards.        
	The Prime Minister also announced 370 model colleges, one in each educationally backward district, where gross enrolment is lower than the national average.        
	According to the commission document, the total sum required to carry out the expansion was calculated from the costs for individual institutes estimated by the HRD ministry at internal meetings.        
	For instance, the ministry cited a requirement of Rs 800 crore for each new IIT in its note to the expenditure finance committee. For the eight institutes promised, the amount works out to Rs 6,400 crore. But the Planning Commission has allocated only Rs 2,000 crore to the ministry to build the new IITs.        
	The special plan includes funds to states, meant as incentives, to meet the goals of expansion, inclusion and excellence in higher education, and to increase scholarships for MTech students.

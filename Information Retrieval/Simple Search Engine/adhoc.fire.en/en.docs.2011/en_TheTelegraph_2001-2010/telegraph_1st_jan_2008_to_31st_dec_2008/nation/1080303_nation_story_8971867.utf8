          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 2: Cuttack Municipal Corporations budget estimate presented for the year 2008-09 is being seen as old wine in new bottle.         
	Development projects listed in this years estimate were already present in the previous years package. Apparently, no new projects have been included in the Rs 159-crore estimate in 2008.        
	Sources in the civic body conceded that projects listed in the public convenience category in the last years estimate could not be completed. The reasons for that is best known to CMC officials and elected representatives.        
	In 2007, CMC had proposed a Rs 7-crore package for the improvement of roads and street lighting in Cuttack. The amount has not been increased this time.        
	Similarly in the past estimate, Rs 5.86 crore was allotted under the category of public convenience which included sub-categories of public health, sanitation and medical services.         
	The amount has been raised to Rs 8.27 crore this year.        
	In the last budget estimate, CMC had allotted Rs 1.5 crore for mosquito control. This time a package of Rs 2.3 crore has been suggested even though the civic body failed to spend less than Rs 1 crore last year for the task.        
	Similarly, in the 2007-08 budget estimate, CMC had kept Rs 4.20 crore for improving the citys drainage. This time a Rs 5-crore package has been proposed. With this amount, the civic body plans to remodel, renovate and repair main storm water channels and tertiary drains.        
	According to the 2008-09 budget estimates, an amount of Rs 24.76 crore has been kept for public convenience, as against the Rs 23.38 crore allotted last year.         
	Fund utilisation trends for the first three-quarter of the past fiscal indicates that in within that time, the civic body managed to spend less than 30 per cent of the proposed amount.         
	Mayor Nibedita Pradhan placed the estimates as a surplus budget proposal before the Municipal Council yesterday.        
	While the expenditure estimate for 2008-09 has been pegged at Rs 159.34 lakh, the projected receipts for the year is Rs 160.93 crore, she said.         
	The budget estimates had carried forward Rs 7.17 crore from the past fiscal  while at the same time has proposed no new projects to utilise the amount.         
	Corporators have already expressed their displeasure of the budget estimate taking into consideration the receipts against targeted estimates last year.         
	Some sections have been grumbling that the 2008-09 budget is less than 25 per cent of what was projected in the 2007-08 budget.         
	Its no wonder that the targeted receipts has been brought down from Rs 171.93 crore last year to Rs 153.75 crore this time, added a corporator on condition of anonymity.

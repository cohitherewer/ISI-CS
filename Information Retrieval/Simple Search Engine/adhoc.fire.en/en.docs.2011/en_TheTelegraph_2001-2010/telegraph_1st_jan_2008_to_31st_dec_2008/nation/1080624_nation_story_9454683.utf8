The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | China angle to N-debate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     China angle to N-debate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: L.K. Advani today brought the China angle into the nuclear debate, arguing that nuclear power was a more comprehensive concept than energy security.        
	Not uttering a word on his partys position on the Indo-US deal, the BJP leader talked of nuclear power in relation to the Chinese attack of 1962 at a book release event.        
	They are talking of nuclear power today. We had vowed to make India a nuclear power in 1964. And we decided about it because we hadnt forgotten the humiliation inflicted on India in 1962, he said.        
	I think no Indian can forget the Chinese attack. Even Pandit Nehru died in 1964 because he could not overcome the shock of 1962. He was so good to the Chinese and they betrayed him.        
	The BJP has been harping on Chinas so-called expansionist agenda each time there have been reports of intrusions in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Party chief Rajnath Singh, too, recently mentioned China while criticising the Left parties for the nuclear deadlock.        
	Advani today avoided linking the Left to China but hit out at it for paralysing governance. He said what was happening in Delhi was not surprising as the opportunistic alliance between the Congress and the Left could not have delivered any better.        
	This has never happened in the country that two parties having fundamental contradictions on economy, foreign policy and other vital issues came together to rule the country, he said.        
	He rued that the Left had attained a status disproportionate to its political strength because of the Congress.        
	They were never truly a national party. They won seats from different states but never enough to even get recognition as the main opposition in the Lok Sabha. They used to ridicule us but we finally turned Indian politics into a bi-polar system.         
	Advani avoided raising Hindutva despite the occasion  release of a compilation of speeches by Jan Sangh presidents  being right for such issues. Instead, he argued that the RSS was formed with the twin goals of making India powerful in the comity of nations and cleansing politics, and the BJP would achieve that objective.        
	He said BJP leaders would change the image of the ugly politician by their conduct.        
	Rajnath, however, talked of contentious issues, asking who would have raised topics like minority appeasement, true secularism and the minority headcount in the army had the Jan Sangh not been formed.

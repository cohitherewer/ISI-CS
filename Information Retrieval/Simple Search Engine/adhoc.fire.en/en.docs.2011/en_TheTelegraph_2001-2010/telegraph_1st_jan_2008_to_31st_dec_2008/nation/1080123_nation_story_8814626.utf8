     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Lalu Prasad: Back in the game 
                 
	Patna, Jan. 22: Political observers, commenting on Lalu Prasads absence from Bihar politics in 2008, believe it a case of shock after RJDs defeat in the Bikramganj polls. 
    
	The railway minister, who was quick to attack Nitish Kumar government throughout 2007, has indeed been silent. 
    
	Silence is a dangerous virtue for a leader, remarked the state RJD chief Abdul Bari Sidiqui with humour before adding: But nothing can silence our eloquent leader. 
    
	What Sidiqui observed is true, as Lalu Prasad is back to launch a scathing attack on the government over the issue of the NTPC police firing which killed three people in Kahalgaon. 
    
	And once more he has announced the fall of the Nitish Kumar government. 
    
	At the same time, Lalu Prasad also inaugurated the Patna-Calcutta Garib Rath, a super-fast express (130km per hour) and a unique train, which has pantry in all its bogies, a feature that no other Garib Rath running across the country, has. 
    
	Yesterday, he also went to meet party workers at Muzaffarpur and Motihari in north Bihar. There he assured more benefits for the poor in the new railway budget. 
    
	He also used the occasion to train his guns on the Nitish government. 
    
	This government has formed a habit of blaming the Centre for everything  power crisis, poverty and backwardness, roared the railway minister, adding: The habit would not last. The government will go sooner than expected. He claimed that there was better power management in Bihar when his RJD was in power. This government is speaking through guns and bullets instead of ensuring regular supply to the people. 
    
	Nitish Kumar, however, stayed unfazed by Lalus diatribe. I have called an all-party meet on January 29 to apprise the Opposition about the quantum of deduction that the Centre has made in Bihars quota of electric power. Everyone would know the truth then. 
    
	The NTPC is going to re-open the closed Kanti thermal power unit soon. The next fiscal would see both Kanti and Barauni units generating power worth 500MW each. The process is on to set up a 2,000MW plant in Navi Nagar, Nitish Kumar said, adding, There is light at the end of the tunnel.

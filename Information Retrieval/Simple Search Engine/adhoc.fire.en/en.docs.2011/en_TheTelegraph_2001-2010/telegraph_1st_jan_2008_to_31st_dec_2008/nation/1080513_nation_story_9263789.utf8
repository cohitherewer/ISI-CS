	New Delhi, May 12: Government departments and units must communicate to an employee any entry  positive or negative  in his or her annual confidential report for the sake of fair play and transparency, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	Not revealing the information would amount to being arbitrary, a bench of Justice H.K. Sema and Justice Markandey Katju said today.        
	Government employees are generally told about the negative entries, not the positive ones, in the annual confidential report that decides their promotions.         
	The bench said giving the employees the information would help on two counts. The employee would get an opportunity to improve his performance. Also, he would get an opportunity to make a representation against the entry if he feels it is unjustified and pray for it to be upgraded.         
	Every entry relating to an employee under the state or an instrumentality of the state, whether in civil, judicial, police or other services (except military) must be communicated to him within a reasonable period and it makes no difference whether there is a benchmark or not, the court said. Employees of public sector units also come within the purview of this ruling.        
	In a scenario where comparative merit is being considered, a person with a good, average or fair entry has lesser chance of being selected for a promotion or benefit than someone with an entry that says very good or outstanding, the bench said.         
	An employee would be entitled to make a representation against an entry and such representation must be decided by an authority higher than the one who made the entry within a reasonable period.         
	The apex courts ruling came on an appeal filed by an engineer of the Border Roads Engineering Service against a November 2001 Gauhati High Court order.         
	The employee, Dev Dutt, was promoted as executive engineer on February 22, 1988, and was eligible to be considered for promotion as superintending engineer after completing five years in that post.         
	He completed the five years on February 21, 1993. The promotion committee of the organisation met in 1994 and selected some juniors for promotion, but not Dutt.

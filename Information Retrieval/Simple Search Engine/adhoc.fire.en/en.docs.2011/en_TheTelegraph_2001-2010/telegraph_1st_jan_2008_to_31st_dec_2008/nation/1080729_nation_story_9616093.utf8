	Ranchi, July 28: JMM chief Shibu Soren returned to the Jharkhand capital after days of politicking in New Delhi to publicly declare that he was keen on becoming chief minister of his home state.        
	I am interested in the politics of Jharkhand. This has been communicated to the Congress as well as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said Soren who, along with four of his MPs, voted in favour of the UPA to help it sail through the confidence vote in Parliament.        
	The matter will be finalised soon after Singh returns from his foreign trip, he added, referring to the Prime Ministers scheduled August 1-3 visit to Colombo for the Saarc summit.         
	Chief minister Madhu Koda, who has been saying all along he is ready to vacate the seat for Guruji, wasnt that categorical today. I was installed as chief minister with the support of several political parties, including Independents. So all of them have to be taken into confidence before a change of guard, he said.        
	Koda, who is believed to have played a key role in bringing Soren to the UPAs negotiating table, would not specify the nature of the deal struck. However, it is widely believed that the JMM has been promised the coal ministry and a minister of state berth. JMM MP Hemlal Murmu, who was with Soren today, said his party was ready to accept the leadership (of the state) under the UPA.

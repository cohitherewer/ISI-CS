	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 10: Three persons died in the past 24 hours in rain-related causes, as heavy showers triggered by a low pressure area continued in the state.        
	The Indian Meteorological Department today issued a warning of the possibility of heavy rains in parts of the state. Most river basins in Orissa have received substantial rainfall in the past 24 hours causing them to swell close to the danger level.         
	Today, the depression over coastal Orissa moved in a north-west direction and lay over the north interior of Orissa, close to Keonjhar.         
	The system is likely to move further in a north-westerly direction, as an official release from the Met department stated. Heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places in the state is expected in the next 24 hours.        
	Two women, belonging to Kesinga block of Kalahandi, died today after they were struck by lightning in the afternoon.         
	Another woman from Rayagada, identified as Urmila Goud, lost her life last night after the bus she was travelling in was swept away by the floodwaters of the Badanala river, a tributary of the Bansadhara.        
	Water-levels in rivers including the Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani and Subernarekha continued to show a rising trend today.         
	The situation is more acute in western and southern parts of Orissa, as smaller rivers such as the Hati, Tel and Jhandavati are swelling. Reports coming in from the special relief commissioners office have stated the possibility of impending disaster if the trend continues.        
	For the next 24 hours, the Met office has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall over the upper Mahanadi, Rusikulya and Bansadhara with heavy fall at a few places over lower Mahanadi catchment areas.        
	Madanpur-Rampur in Kalahandi recorded the highest rainfall of 22cm in the past 12 hours.        
	Wind speed reaching 45-55kmph from south-easterly direction over north Orissa and north-westerly direction over south Orissa is likely to prevail along and off the coast, the release further said.        
	Fishermen have been warned not to venture into the sea. Local Cautionary Signal Number Three (LC-III) has been lowered at Chandbali, Puri, Paradeep and Gopalpur Ports.        
	Intermittent rains in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have also affected normal life. Bhubaneswar received 105.8mm rainfall, the highest today, followed by Balasore that received 43mm rain and Bolangir district that recorded 30.4mm of rain.

	Puja without CMs blessing    
	The BJP government is on a U-turn, within a month of its formation.    
	It has withdrawn an order that asked temples under the state endowment (muzrai) department to perform pujas for the well being of citizens on behalf of the chief minister.    
	The prayers were to be performed at least once a day, endowment minister Krishnaiah Setty decreed, getting nearly 35,000 state-administered temples to fall in line.    
	The loka kalyana pujas failed to get the blessings of Settys boss. To avoid a controversy, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa ordered a halt to the rituals and called a meeting of the cabinet to withdraw the circular issued by Setty.    
	But the minister was unrepentant. Such pujas were performed even during S.M. Krishnas regime, when the state was reeling under drought. This circular has been withdrawn by the chief minister not because of any pressure from the Opposition parties, Setty explained.    
	Curiously, the IAS officer who signed the circular has been transferred. The minister, however, defended the move, saying the bureaucrat was shifted on promotion.          
	Actor on bouncy wicket  
	Sarath Kumar films havent had problems making money but the actor is facing the heat over barren bank accounts.    
	The actor, who set up his party, Samuthuva Makkal Katchi (SMK), was last week hauled to court along with his organisations treasurer for having issued cheques that bounced.    
	The petitioner is Balakrishnan, an advertising agent who claims he has to be paid for newspaper ads for the partys state-level conference in Madurai on February 10, 2008.    
	Post-dated cheques for Rs 26.01 lakh were issued for various dates from March 3 to March 30 but all of these bounced because of insufficient funds at the account in Chennai, Balakrishnan said. A notice was sent to Kumar but, after he didnt respond, the agent filed the case. The duo have been asked to appear for the hearing on July 25. (PTI)    
	Clean-air fund grows    
	Delhis clean-up kitty is swelling faster than expected, helped by a diesel cess that is rising with fuel prices.    
	The state recently announced it had mopped up Rs 10 crore from the levy in the three months since February and looked poised to garner Rs 50 crore for the full year. Initial estimates had put the total at Rs 45 crore.    
	The cess fund is expected to swell, environment secretary J.K. Dadoo said of the levy that kicked in last December to encourage a change to fuels less polluting than diesel.    
	The cess, 25 paise per litre, is being widely seen as one of the several measures meant to promote a clean-air policy, Dadoo said, adding the 30 per cent subsidy being given on electric vehicles is met through this fund.    
	He insisted that the levy isnt a penalty but a way to raise awareness about cleaner technologies. The tax was introduced after the state government realised that it didnt have the powers to impose a blanket ban on diesel vehicles. (PTI)          
	Blaze blow  
	A blaze ruined a large swathe of a prominent landmark in the Garden City.    
	The flames leapt up last week in Jayanagar, gutting more than 88 shops. It took fire fighters more than 10 hours to tame the blaze.     
	Owners have reckoned that it could take them a couple of months, maybe more, to set up the shops again.     
	Jayanagars fourth block market, a big draw with bargain hunters, has been in business for more than 40 years.    
	MUMBAI: This Monday (June 23), Suchitra Krishnamurthi presents her most recent collection of art works at Museum Art Gallery. The exhibition is from 11am to 7pm. The venue, a well-known Mumbai landmark, is at K Dubash Marg, in Kala Ghoda.

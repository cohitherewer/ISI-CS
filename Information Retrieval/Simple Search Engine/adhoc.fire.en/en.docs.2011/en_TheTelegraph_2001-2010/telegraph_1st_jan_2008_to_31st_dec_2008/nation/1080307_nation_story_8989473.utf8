          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, March 6: Education and healthcare organisations will hand out the largest number of appointment letters this calendar year, according to a survey.        
	The two industries have emerged at the top of the league table compiled by Ma Foi Management Consultants, which studies employment trends in the industry.        
	The education sector, which includes training and consultancy companies, will generate more than 1.04 crore jobs in 2008, the highest among all industries. (See chart)        
	The hospitality industry could recruit a large number of freshers. Almost 25 to 26 per cent will be freshers, said Ma Foi MD Pandia Rajan. The hiring spree will be supported by an anticipated investment of $11.41 billion in hotels over two years.        
	The picture in power, traditionally a large job generator, isnt as bright, partly because of fewer new projects.         
	The brightest spot in the survey was the finding that the average salary hike in India, at 13.5 per cent, last year was the highest in Asia-Pacific. The highest average raise, at 16.8 per cent, was offered in the power sector, followed by real estate at 16.1 per cent and IT at 15.7 per cent.         
	It looks like a tough time for those in the IT and the ITeS sectors. Most mid-sized and big companies have decided to give campuses a miss this year. Those who have offered jobs are delaying joining dates, said Rajan.

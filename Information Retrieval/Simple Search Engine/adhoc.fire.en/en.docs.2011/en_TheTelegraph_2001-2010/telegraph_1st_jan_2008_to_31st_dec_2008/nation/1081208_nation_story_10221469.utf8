                              Rice on Sunday. (AP)                             
	Washington, Dec. 7 (PTI): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice today said there was evidence of involvement somehow on Pakistani soil in the Mumbai attacks and pressed Islamabad to act quickly to arrest suspects to avoid any follow-on attacks.        
	Rice also advised an outraged India to exercise restraint so as not to make the situation worse.        
	I think we do believe that there was  there is evidence of involvement somehow on Pakistani soil... even if these were non-state actors, which I believe they were  non-state actors operating on Pakistani soil. It is still Pakistans responsibility to respond, Rice told Fox News, when asked if she thought the Mumbai strike was launched from Pakistan and if the attackers were trained by current or former officers of the Pakistani military or intelligence.        
	Rice said she stressed during her visit to Pakistan last week how important it was for Islamabad to act quickly but denied there was a 48-hour deadline to take action.        
	The important thing is that Pakistan act and that these people are brought to justice and that any information that they may have is put to use in making sure follow-on attacks dont happen.         
	On whether she had asked Pakistan to arrest a former head of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Rice said: Well, I dont want to get into the details of this. This is counter-terrorism work. And obviously, I dont want to tip their hand or ours. But Pakistan must act in concert with India, with the United States. Great Britain is helping.        
	I was absolutely convinced that President Zardari, Prime Minister Gilani and other officials understand this is also Pakistans fight.... But now we have to see follow-through.        
	The secretary of state said though she could understand the anger of India, Delhi should restrict itself from any action that could make the situation worse.        
	I said to India the issue here is an effective response. And I understand the frustration and the anger in India. In fact, it felt a little bit to me like the USs post-9/11. But in this case, there are actions that India could take that could make the situation worse, she added. We dont need a crisis in South Asia.

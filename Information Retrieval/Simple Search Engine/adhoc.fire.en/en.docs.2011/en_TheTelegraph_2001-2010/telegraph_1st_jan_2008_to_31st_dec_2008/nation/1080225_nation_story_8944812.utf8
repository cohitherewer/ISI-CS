          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Mayavati today reiterated her promise to provide reservation for Dalits and Other Backward Classes in the private sector, throwing the gauntlet at the UPA government, which is yet to fulfil a similar pledge.        
	The Congress-led coalition had said in its common minimum programme that it would introduce a private-sector quota but failed to push it through.         
	Addressing a rally  mainly comprising Dalits and OBCs  at the Ramlila ground here, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister today said she alone had the political resolve to enforce the reservation. She cited the Ganga Expressway project in her state, where 20 per cent jobs had been given to Dalits and 27 per cent to OBCs on the basis of an agreed formula.        
	Mayavati said her government would allow only those industrialists to set up shop in the state who agree to reservation.         
	She also advocated the need to bring Dalit Muslims and Christians under the quota ambit. I have written to the Prime Minister demanding reservation for Dalits who have converted to Christianity and Islam, the BSP leader said.

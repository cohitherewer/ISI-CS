The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students in third year, degrees not in sight
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Students in third year, degrees not in sight
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 4: Over 250 students at the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, billed potential Indian Institutes of Technology, are studying for degrees not yet recognised, two years after the courses were first offered.         
	Now, as students from the first batch  2006-07  at the IISERs in Calcutta and Pune enter their third year, the directors of the two institutes have pleaded with the Centre to rush through the recognition process for the degrees.         
	The Centre has not legalised the degrees offered by the institutes, started in Calcutta and Pune in 2006, and at Mohali in 2007, based on recommendations made by Dr C.N.R. Rao, chairman of the Prime Ministers scientific advisory council. The government has also announced plans to set up two more IISERs  in Thiruvananthapuram and Bhopal.         
	The recognition of the degrees hangs on a crucial law  to be called the IISER Act  that the Centre needs to finalise, and pass through Parliament.         
	The unique nature of the institutes means their degrees cannot be recognised under existing laws, officials at the IISERs in Pune and Calcutta said, and other officials at the ministry of human resource development conceded.         
	Unlike the IITs or the NITs, the IISERs offer a five-year integrated masters course with an MS degree. Students study a combination of physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology for the first two years, and choose a specific field for the subsequent two years. The final year is spent on a project.         
	Had the students been elsewhere studying the sciences, they would have completed graduation after three years. That is the reason why it is essential that we get recognition for degrees before too long, an IISER Calcutta official said.         
	In a letter sent earlier this week to the MHRD, IISER Pune director Krishna Ganesh has indicated that the institutes are apprehensive about questions from students and parents on the degrees, top officials told The Telegraph.         
	As the students from the first batch enter their third year. the pressure for establishing the validity of the degrees is expected to increase, Ganesh has written in his letter.         
	Ganesh has also sought an appointment with higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal to discuss the concerns of the IISERs, sources said.         
	Indicating the anxiety at the IISERs, Ganeshs letter mentions that the institutes have, on their own, prepared a draft of the law  normally a job for the government  to rush through the recognition process.         
	Sources at the IISERs confirmed that the letter had been sent after a meeting between Ganesh and Sushanta Duttagupta, director of the Calcutta IISER.         
	It is a major problem for both our institutes. Our students are among the brightest in the country. After all, we aspire to provide them education of standards comparable to the IITs. Parents and students are bound to ask us questions this year. What do we answer? a senior official at the Calcutta IISER said.         
	The official claimed the problem has been festering for a long time.         
	Now, it has come to the fore, the official said.         
	The Calcutta IISER admitted 39 students in its first year, and another 72 last year (111 in all) for the five year course, officials at the institute said.         
	IISER Pune admitted 46 students in the first year and 62 last year (108 in all), officials said. The Mohali Institute admitted 36 students in its first year  2007-08. In all, 255 students are studying at the three IISERs at present.         
	But the MHRD notification, through which the IISERs were created, states that each of the institutes is to have an intake of 2000 students a year by the end of five years.         
	Imagine a scenario where you have thousands of students studying at institutes billed as among the best, but in courses with no legitimacy. The centre needs to act now, a senior official at IISER Pune said.

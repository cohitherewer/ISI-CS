Its a Congress sweep in Mizoram 
          SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA                            Incoming chief minister Lalthanhawla and outgoing chief minister Zoramthanga                                 
	Aizawl, Dec. 8: Rise because of rats, fall because of rats, too.        
	The Congress today rode to power in Mizoram after 10 years in the Opposition, gnawing through the ruling Mizo National Fronts support base by cashing in on a rodent-inspired corruption scandal.        
	Such was the ferocity of the anti-incumbency wave that the MNF could not ensure chief minister Zoramthangas victory though he contested in two seats. In the 40-seat Assembly, the Congress bagged 32, up from last times 12, and the MNFs strength has been reduced to 3 from 21.        
	The Congress focused on corruption charges associated with central funds allocated to fight a feared famine similar to the one that played a key role in the MNFs birth.        
	Last year, bamboo flowered in Mizoram  a curse that befalls the state once in half a century. The flowers bring out armies of rats which gorge on whatever lies in their path. The invasion of the rodents is often followed by widespread crop destruction and starvation, though the situation was not as worse as usual last year.        
	However, unwilling to take any chances, the Centre had granted Rs 125 crore, which the Congress said was misused by the state government. The charge was referred to by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a campaign speech.        
	Ironically, the MNF owes its existence to such a famine. The MNF was born out of the Mizo National Famine Front which was floated by the legendary Laldenga in the late fifties in the aftermath of a bout of bamboo flowering in the Mizo heartland, which was then a district in Assam. Laldenga went on to lead the MNF in guerrilla war which culminated in the signing of the Mizo Accord.

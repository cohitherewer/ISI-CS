                                                                                                               House adjourned sine die amid din
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 31: The Assembly was adjourned today sine die amid the Oppositions uproar seeking the former Speaker Maheswar Mohantys resignation and an impartial probe into the harassment charges levelled against him.         
	The current budget session was scheduled to conclude on April 2.         
	Significantly, Mohanty resigned from the Orissa Assembly Speakers post today, while information and public relations minister Debasis Nayak was removed in connection with the sexual harassment case involving the former Speaker and an assistant marshal Gayatri Panda.        
	The Appropriation Bill, which seeks to authorise the government for payment and appropriation of Rs 28747.08 crore out of the Orissas consolidated fund (2008-09), was passed without discussion and amid an Opposition boycott.         
	After the bill received the House approval by a voice vote, deputy speaker Prahlad Dora announced that the Assembly was adjourned sine die and thanked the chief minister and other legislators for their co-operation.         
	Protesting against the abrupt conclusion of the session, the Opposition refused to participate in the valedictory session.         
	We will meet the governor and go to people explaining to them the undemocratic and unconstitutional acts of the BJD-BJP government, the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, told the reporters talking from his Assembly chamber.         
	Pressing the demand for an impartial probe into the sexual slur, Patnaik said the case should be investigated by a CBI team or a sitting high court judge.         
	The veteran Opposition leader also sought the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	Maheswar Mohanty has described the allegations (against him) as a conspiracy. Who knows if the chief minister himself is not involved in the conspiracy? Patnaik added.         
	Earlier, in the morning, the House witnessed bedlam, as the deputy speaker did not allow the leader of the Opposition to raise the Speakers issue. Angry Opposition members stormed the well raising slogans against the chief minister and snatched away the Speakers microphone and papers.         
	Ruling BJP member Kishor Singhdeo was seen rushing to the well and engage in a heated argument with the Opposition.         
	Deputy Speaker Dora was forced to adjourn the House twice for more than two hours in view of the pandemonium.

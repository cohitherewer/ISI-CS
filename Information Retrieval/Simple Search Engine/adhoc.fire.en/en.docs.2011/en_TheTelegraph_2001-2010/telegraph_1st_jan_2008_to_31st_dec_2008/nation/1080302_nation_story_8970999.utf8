          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, March 1: On a day economists in the country were busy analysing the budget, top security and intelligence experts got together to discuss the damage being caused by the circulation of counterfeit currency.        
	Senior officers from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, RBI, Central Economic Intelligence Bureau and the CBI racked their brains to find ways to check the rampant circulation of fake Indian notes.         
	CBI director Vijay Shankar, who inaugurated the one-day workshop, said there was a strong indication that profit was not the only motive of the terror groups engaged in currency rackets. Rather destabilisation of the economy and causing panic is becoming the obvious motive.         
	Expressing concern over the culprits ever-changing tactics, Shankar said the Dubai-based gangs had shifted operations from western India to the south, and trans-shipment points had moved to Sri Lanka and Malaysia.        
	First, we find constant improvement in the quality of fake currency notes and that, too, in higher denominations. Second, we find that increased enforcement efforts in one geographical area have resulted in shifting of operations to another area, he said.        
	IB officials said these gangs  an obvious reference to operations largely run by Dawood Ibrahim  were being backed by Pakistan. The counterfeit currency is printed on security paper either in Pakistan or its friendly countries and is transported to India via the UAE, an official said.

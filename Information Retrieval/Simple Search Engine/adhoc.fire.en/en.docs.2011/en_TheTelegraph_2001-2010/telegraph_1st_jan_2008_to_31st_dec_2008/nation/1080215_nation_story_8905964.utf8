          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The CPM will warn the government that the budget session is its last opportunity to make a mid-course correction and honour its pro-people promises.        
	The party has already threatened a nation-wide agitation if the fuel price hike announced today is not rolled back.        
	An editorial in next Saturdays issue of CPM organ Peoples Democracy will imply the Centre hasnt done enough to keep its poll promises or to prove that it isnt under Americas thumb.        
	It will suggest that President Pratibha Patils address at the joint session of Parliament should break the reluctance of the UPA government to carry out the promises in the common minimum programme. Also, Delhi should allay fears concerning Indias pursuit of an independent foreign policy.        
	This is the last opportunity (for) this UPA government to effect a mid-course correction to redeem its own pro-people pledges.. This is the fifth and final budget of this UPA government, goes the text of the editorial.        
	The course correction suggested includes addressing the agrarian crisis, revamping the public distribution system and doing away with corporate-tax concessions.        
	Today, the CPM demanded a fuel price rollback for the sake of the inflation-hit common man.

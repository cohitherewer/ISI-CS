  -   Leader at head of farmer protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi walks with farmers to the Jhansi commissioners office on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Lucknow, April 18: Rahul Gandhi today announced he was ready for street fights with a dharna on a Jhansi road.        
	Accompanied by a busful of farmers he had been barred from taking to the divisional commissioners office, the Congress MP squatted on the road for 20 minutes this afternoon  his first street protest bringing back memories of uncle Sanjay.        
	Rahul was on a bus with over 300 farmers, who wanted to complain to the commissioner that they had not been given job cards although they were drought victims, when police stopped it.         
	The bus was stopped about 500 metres from Jhansi commissioner P.B. Jagmohans office. The police told the MP he could proceed no further. Rahul stepped off the bus with the farmers and led them to the middle of the road, where the men sat down.        
	Congress leaders threatened to surround the office if Rahul was not allowed to meet him. District magistrate Rajiv Agarwal had told him that not more than 10 farmers could accompany him if he wanted to meet Jagmohan. There was tension in the air till, finally, around 3.30pm, he was allowed to go with 70 farmers. They all carried petitions in their hands seeking job cards.         
	Inside the commissioners office, Rahul drew Jagmohans attention to the farmers suffering and said he should hear them out and redress their grievances speedily. Give me the petitions and I will surely do the needful, the commissioner said.        
	After about half an hour, the Congress general secretary returned to the circuit house for rest before leaving for Delhi.         
	Sanjay Gandhi would often hit the streets in the seventies, promoting literacy and birth control, planting trees and campaigning against dowry and the caste system. He also raided godowns of shop-owners as part of an anti-hoarding agitation.         
	For Rahul, this was a first. So far, he has been touring backward regions, as mother Sonia does, and making unannounced visits to Dalit homes. The visit to drought-hit Bundelkhand that he wrapped up today was one such.

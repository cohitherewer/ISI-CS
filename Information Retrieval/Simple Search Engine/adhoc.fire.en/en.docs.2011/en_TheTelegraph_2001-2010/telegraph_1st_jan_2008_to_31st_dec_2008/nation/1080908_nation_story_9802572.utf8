          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Ice samples from Greenland, corals from Australia and Madagascar and ring patterns on tree trunks in North America, Mongolia and elsewhere indicate that Earths northern hemisphere is now warmer than ever over the past 1,700 years.         
	A new study by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania in the US has shown that the warmth of the past decade appears higher than at any time in not just the past 1,000 years as previously shown, but at least for 1,300 years and perhaps even up to 1,700 years.         
	Their reconstruction of the climate was based on the study of buried ice, corals, lake sediments and tree rings  all of which can hold signatures of changing climate  and historical records dating back to early 17th century.         
	Attempts to reconstruct ancient climate had been criticised by some sections of the scientific community as relying too much on tree rings  patterns within the trunk of a tree that can reflect changes in seasons during the growth of the tree.         
	Weve been able to eliminate tree ring data and still get a reliable reconstruction back to 1,300 years, said Michael Mann, associate professor at the Earth System Science Centre at the University of Pennsylvania.         
	If we do include the tree rings, reliable reconstruction can be pushed even further back to 1,700 years in the past, Mann told The Telegraph.         
	The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicate that the chemical signatures in buried ice and lake sediments and old weather records also show the changes shown by tree rings alone.         
	But the climate reconstruction map that Mann and his colleagues have created display no data from India  a possible indication that research on ancient climate done by Indian scientists is yet to slip into global paleoclimate databases.         
	This was surprising. I know there are scientists in India whore also working on tree rings and paleoclimate, Mann said.

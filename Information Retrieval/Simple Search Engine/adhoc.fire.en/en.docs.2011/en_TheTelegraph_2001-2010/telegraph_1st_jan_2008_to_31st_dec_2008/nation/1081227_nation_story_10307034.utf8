	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 26: Taking cue from the recent Assembly poll results in five states, the ruling BJD here has decided to make development its main plank in the coming general elections.        
	BJD, which had been floated as a regional outfit with an objective to fulfil the dreams of Biju Patnaik to turn Orissa into a prosperous state, celebrated its 11th anniversary today.         
	During the past 11 years, our party has gained popularity for its development agenda. My government has always given top priority to development, said chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik.        
	Stating that development would be the main electoral plank of BJD in the general elections, Naveen asked party workers to reach out to people with the message of various achievements of his government.        
	Listing out the development and welfare schemes undertaken by his government, Naveen said agricultural development and irrigation had been their main focal points. The government had formulated a new agriculture policy and announced a package of assistance to farmers. Agricultural inputs, including seeds, fertiliser, irrigation, credit and marketing facilities, would be provided to farmers at a subsidised price.

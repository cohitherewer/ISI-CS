          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, March 15: Ranchi police today inducted 229 Friends of Police (FOP) to facilitate the concept of community policing in the capital.         
	The FOP along with the men-in-uniform would help keep a check on crime.         
	While administering the oath of secrecy to the newly inducted FOP, senior superintendent of police M.S. Bhatia described the move as humanisation of the police force. He said better relations with the public in the form of FOP would go a long way in developing a crime-free society.         
	The publics expectations from the police is always high and we want to live up to them. In return, all that we want is a positive approach and co-operation from them, he said.         
	The FOP idea is a brainchild of Bhatia, who is also a management graduate.         
	The FOP includes citizens from different walks of life, a students wing and a womens wing. They have been provided with a blue arm band with Friend of Police and Police Mitra in Hindi printed on it. The members have also been given special identity cards and their services would be pressed in during emergencies to help the police manage traffic or in lifting roadblocks.         
	Alam Ara, an FOP, said: The police sharing its responsibilities with the people is a healthy sign. The image of the police is tarnished, but there can always be a new beginning.         
	Birendra Singh, another FOP, said: This concept has erased fears that one should never have anything to do with men in khaki.

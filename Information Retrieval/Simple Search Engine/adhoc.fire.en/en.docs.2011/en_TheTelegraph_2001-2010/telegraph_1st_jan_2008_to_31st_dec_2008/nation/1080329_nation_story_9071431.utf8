The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Absent: founder duo, present: big Prakash
                                                                                                               Absent: founder duo, present: big Prakash
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Jyoti Basu                                  
	Coimbatore, March 28: The CPM is beginning its party congress without its last remaining founding fathers, Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet.        
	This is the first time the two veterans  members of the original politburo that had presided over the CPMs formation by splitting the undivided communist party in 1964  will be absent from the important meeting. Both have opted out, citing their advanced age.        
	The CPM, which wanted Basu and Surjeet to remain in the politburo as symbols of continuity, however, ensured their legacy was highlighted on banners that adorned the partys news conference room.        
	Although the posters of Basu, Surjeet, E.M.S. Namboodiripad and other Marxist icons line thoroughfares in this industrial town in Tamil Nadu, the change of guard in the CPM is unmistakable.        
	Prakash Karat shares a larger-than-life poster with Fidel Castro, and it is closer to the venue of the party congress that will also host fraternal delegations from 24 countries.        
	Brinda Karat, one of the most high-profile faces of change in the party, spoke to reporters, sitting under the shadow of the living legends. Comrade Surjeet could not come since he is not well.         
	But she hinted that Basu would be missed more. Unfortunately, our leader, Jyoti Basu, will not be able to join this congress. Its very sad. His absence will be deeply felt by the delegates, she said.         
	Brinda Karat said Basu would send his message through video conference on the congresss opening day tomorrow.         
	The nonagenarian Basu has asked the party to relieve him from the politburo. But the party is dithering. The party congress will decide on the issue, Brinda Karat said.        
	Backroom parleys are still on over possible inclusions in the new politburo. Nirupam Sen and Shyamal Chakraborty are the front-runners among the Bengal nominees. Keralas Paloli Mohammad Kutty and M.A. Baby are being tipped likely successors to the late E.K. Nayanar and the ageing Citu leader, K. Balanandan.         
	However, CPM leaders said more younger leaders could be elevated in view of the partys plan to strengthen its centre in Delhi, make inroads into the Hindi heartland and speed up its growth in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

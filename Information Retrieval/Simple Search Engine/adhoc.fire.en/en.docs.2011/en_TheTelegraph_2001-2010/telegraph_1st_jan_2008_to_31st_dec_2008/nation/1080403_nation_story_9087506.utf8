  - Staff in red dens under insurance umbrella           OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Light in red corridors                                        
	Bhubaneswar, April 2: In the wake of increasing Naxalite attacks on the forest department personnel, the Orissa government today decided to extend insurance cover to forest officials working in Naxalite-hit districts.        
	The staff would also be entitled to compensation and grant in case of death or injury, special pension, as well as a special family pension at a par with the police.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today took a decision to this effect at a meeting with a delegation of the forest department employees. At the same meeting plans were made to set up a special striking force with adequate staff, vehicles and arms at 50 sites across Orissa to facilitate co-ordinated action against offenders.        
	The chief minister also conceded to long-standing demands of forest employees, including filling up vacancies, promotion and payment of special allowance as well as Grade-II status for forest rangers.        
	The vacancies would be filled up through regular recruitment tests  again a move similar to one taken in case of the police force.        
	Presently, foresters and forest guards are appointed on contract, which has created resentment among the personnel. When a delegation of forest personnel aired their grievances on the matter, officers present at the meeting attributed bottlenecks in the forest subordinate cadre to the delay in promotion and filling up of vacant posts. Thus, it was decided to reorganise the forest subordinate cadre in order to rationalise the structure. As an interim measure, the sanctioned strength of deputy rangers would be increased from 62 to 168.        
	Other decisions taken in the meeting include the sanction of motorcycle allowance (Rs 350 per month) for rangers, deputy rangers and foresters and a diet allowance of Rs 350 per month and a cycle allowance of Rs 75 per month for the guards.        
	Besides, the fitment committee has said it would consider the demand for Grade-II status for rangers and pay parity with officials of equivalent ranks in the police.

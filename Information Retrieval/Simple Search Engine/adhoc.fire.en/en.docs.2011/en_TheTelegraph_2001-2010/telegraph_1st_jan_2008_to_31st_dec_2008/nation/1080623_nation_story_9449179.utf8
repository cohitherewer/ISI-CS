	Bhubaneswar, June 22: Orissa that records the highest infant mortality rate in the country, will start an Integrated Management of Neo-natal and Childhood Illnesses course (IMNCI) in the syllabi of most medical colleges and nursing schools.        
	The course will be introduced in SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack, VSS Medical College and Hospital at Burla, MKCG Medical College and Hospital at Berhampur (all three run by government) and KIMS, Sum and Hi-tech private medical colleges and nursing schools.        
	The course decision was taken collectively by the Centre, Unicef and WHO keeping in mind the high infant mortality rate in Orissa. The Centre has taken up IMNCI as a key component in the second phase of infant mortality reduction programme. This is being implemented in 16 districts where childrens health has improved considerably.        
	Health secretary T.K. Pandey said doctors, anganwadi workers, health workers and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) would be imparted training in IMNCI.        
	IMNCI is currently regarded as an efficient strategy for reducing the disease burden and disability during the first five years of life. Its a strategy that integrates measures for disease prevention in childhood, early detection of diseases, treatment and promotion of healthy habits within the family.         
	Based on this evaluation, the course gives clear instructions on disease classification and problems and for establishing treatment that should be administered for each one.        
	The strategy also provides instructions on how to control the progress of treatment, in order to identify the need for applying prevention measures as well as how to inform and educate parents on disease prevention and child health promotion.

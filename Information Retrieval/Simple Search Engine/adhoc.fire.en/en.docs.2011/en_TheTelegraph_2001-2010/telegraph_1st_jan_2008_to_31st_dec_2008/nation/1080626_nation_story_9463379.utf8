          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: The BJP will not come to the governments rescue if the Left withdraws support over the nuclear deal.        
	There is no question of bailing out this government, senior leader M. Venkaiah Naidu said today.        
	But he could not hide the BJPs growing unease over how the urban middle class would react if the Congress-led regime were to fall on the nuclear issue.        
	Naidu was extremely reluctant to talk about the deal and dismissed the UPA-Left meeting as a ploy to divert attention from real issues.        
	The real issues are price rise, fertiliser crisis, strife in the Jammu and Kashmir government over the Amarnath shrine, Gorkhaland trouble. But the government is desperate to brush them under the carpet, Naidu said.        
	The Left is a willing party in this game. Otherwise, it could have bluntly told the government there is no urgency about the 123 Agreement and lets first discuss the burning issues. But the Left is satisfied with meeting the UPA leaders to decide when to meet again.        
	Asked if his party was planning to bring a no-confidence motion, the former BJP chief went on to give details of inflation rates in other countries.

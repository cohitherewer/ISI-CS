          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 29: Led by president Ramsunder Das, the Bihar unit of Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP) today merged with the JD(U).         
	The SJP had virtually fallen leaderless after the demise of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar who headed it. Das, a veteran socialist and former chief minister was looking for a suitable political space in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls due in April-May 2009. And the ruling JD(U) in the state, too, was looking for a man of stature to counter Dalit rivals Ram Vilas Paswan and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati  actively trying to increase Bahujan Samaj Partys influence in Bihar.         
	In the emerging scenario, both Ram Sunder Das and Nitish Kumar found each other. JD(U)s politics suits Das and vice versa, said an observer, describing the development as a well-oiled move to strengthen JD(U)s Dalit base.         
	The Nitish Kumar government has been doing great work for the Scheduled Castes described as Mahadalits by constituting the Mahadalit Commission and taking up measures to improve the peoples lifestyle.         
	JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, presiding over the merger function, said: Das has been a great leader and today he has strengthened our party by joining it. Sharad also attacked Lalu Prasad for hailing from a backward family and bent on promoting his own family before his people.         
	Nitish Kumar promised that the next poll would mark an end of Lalu politics.         
	The polls in other states have established that the electorate would vote on basis of performance, Nitish Kumar said, adding: Everyone now understands why Lalu Prasad, who would be irked by the word, is chanting the development mantra.

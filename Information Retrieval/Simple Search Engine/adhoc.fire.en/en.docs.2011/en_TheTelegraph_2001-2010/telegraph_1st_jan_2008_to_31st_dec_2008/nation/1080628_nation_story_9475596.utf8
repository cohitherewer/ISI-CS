The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani banks on Modi model
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani banks on Modi model

	Kanpur, June 27: Narendra Modi had said: Jeetega Gujarat. L.K. Advani now says: Jeetega Bhajpa, Jeetega Bharat.        
	The BJPs shadow Prime Minister has turned to the Gujarat model to try and win the Delhi crown.        
	As he launched his poll campaign from this Uttar Pradesh city today, Advani took a leaf out of the Gujarat chief ministers book by seeking to identify the BJP with India. Modi had used this trick  merging the BJPs and his states identities through his Gujarat asmita (pride) slogan -- to great effect in the 2002 and 2007 Assembly polls.        
	Advani has steadfastly refused to accept that the Gujarat model was just about communalism. Amid pouring rain he told the Vijay Sankalp rally: Vijay sankalp (resolve of victory) is not just for a political party. We want India to be victorious among the comity of nations. You should think about how to make India victorious, how to help India attain supreme glory. The BJP is only the medium.        
	He carried on the effort to wrest from the Congress its traditional planks of nationalism and political morality.        
	The BJP has achieved its first target of turning Indias polity into a bi-polar system, he said. The other two goals are to make India strong and to cleanse the political system. We want politicians image to improve and become what it was during Gandhis and Nehrus days.        
	He recalled the recent terror strikes in the country and accused the government of lacking the political will to counter the danger. But his reluctance to enter the nuclear debate was more than evident.        
	There are several burning issues. People are in deep distress owing to inflation, farmers are committing suicide, terrorists are striking at will... but the government is wasting its time fighting with the Left on the nuclear deal.        
	Advani made it clear that if the Left withdrew support, the BJP would want a trust vote to take place immediately.        
	He drew the loudest cheers when he said the BJP wanted a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. But he avoided communal rhetoric and quickly added: We also want to make a Rashtra mandir in which everybody will be equal, everybody will get security and justice, everybody will get food, healthcare and education.        
	Advani presented a development-oriented agenda, different from what the Sangh parivar would have expected.        
	The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which too is holding its central committee meeting here, has turned the Amarnath shrine controversy into a big issue. It yesterday threatened to demonstrate at mosques and Haj houses across the country.        
	Advanis show was devoid of such belligerence. Amid streams of drenched people trooping in and out of the venue, he presented his agenda of good governance to offset the dysfunctional government of Manmohan Singh.        
	Sonia Gandhi had ousted the BJP in 2004 with the slogan Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath. Advani sought to turn the tables: Congress ka haath, aam aadmi se vishwasghat (treachery).

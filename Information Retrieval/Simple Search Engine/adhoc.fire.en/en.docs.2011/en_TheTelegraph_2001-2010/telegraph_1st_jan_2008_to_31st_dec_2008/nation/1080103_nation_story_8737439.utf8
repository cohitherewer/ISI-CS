	Rampur, Jan. 2: A New Years Eve party had ended at the CRPF camp in Rampur a little while before the firing began that led to seven jawans losing their lives.        
	From 8.30pm on Monday, officers had danced to the tune of a DJ invited for the bash at one of north Indias biggest CRPF camps.         
	The party carried on till 1am, when the officers went home after the exchange of greetings, sources said. Jawans were expected to be on duty.        
	When the terrorists struck at 2.45am, they found their victims resting in chairs at their posts or asleep in bed  the position the jawans were later found dead in.        
	They did not know what was happening, a senior Uttar Pradesh police officials said, suggesting that music and alcohol had done the damage. Police are looking for the DJ to find out more details about the party.        
	New Years Eve parties for officers are the norm, but the camp had received two intelligence warnings in a month about a possible attack and needed to be careful.        
	The CRPF denied that its men were drunk. Inspector-general Karamvir Singh said the party had ended at 12.30am. There was no lapse in the security set-up. The men killed or injured in the attack were not drunk, he said.         
	The jawans fought and cornered the two, forcing them to flee. Had they not done this, they might have caused more loss of life.        
	The militants could have destroyed the armoury had there been no resistance, official said. It was untouched.        
	Rampur superintendent of police Sandeep Gupta said there were at least three terrorists. They might have left through the same gate that they used to enter the camp and escaped in a car waiting on the Lucknow-Delhi National Highway, he said.         
	Special task force officials of the state police visited the spot today to reconstruct the incident.        
	An officer of the rank of inspector-general said the CRPF men were sitting by a fire when the militants struck.         
	Inside the complex, barely a hundred metres left of the main gate, a blood-stained quilt lay on a broken bed. Terrorists had barged into the DIG office building and shot dead a jawan warm in bed.        
	In Delhi, CRPF top guns and home ministry officials racked their brains to figure out how to prevent a repeat of the January 1 attack that has thrown up questions about the alertness of the force as well as the definition of peace posting.        
	 Manvir Singh amar rahe a CRPF jawan shouted, tears in his eyes, as he bade farewell to a colleague.         
	Sepoy Manvir Singh had served in troubled Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir but was killed on a peace posting at the Rampur training and recruitment camp, not far from his home in Baghpat.        
	He has a four-year-old son. It is the loss of a man whom a smile would never leave, said brother Sunder Singh.         
	As the coffins of the Amar shaheed were sent to their families, all a CRPF official could mutter was: The lapse was there, we are investigating into it.        
	The police have picked up two persons for interrogation.                     WITH INPUTS FROM TAPAS CHAKRABORTY IN LUCKNOW

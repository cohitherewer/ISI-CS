                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Renuka slams RAW in lady case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury has questioned the Research and Analysis Wings dismissal of sexual harassment charges by a lady officer and said she would personally intervene in the case.         
	A director in the countrys external intelligence agency yesterday tried to commit suicide outside the Prime Ministers Office after RAW dismissed allegations of sexual harassment she had levelled against seniors.         
	Men always find a way to defend each other. I condemn it (RAWs decision to dismiss the allegations), Chowdhury told reporters today.        
	I will need to study the case in detail, but prima facie, it appears the complainant was a genuine victim, the minister added.        
	Calling the incident shocking, she said she would write to the cabinet secretariat for details of the case.         
	Nisha Bhatia has alleged that senior officers had asked for sexual favours and that repeated complaints to her superiors had proved futile. A three-woman panel had rejected her harassment charges.        
	Yesterday, she consumed rat poison outside the PMO, but was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where she was declared out of danger.         
	Chowdhury also accused employees of UN agencies of trying to evade sexual harassment charges under cover of diplomatic immunity.         
	If the victim is an Indian lady, the law of the land will apply. No one can be allowed immunity, she said.         
	The Telegraph had reported on August 11 allegations of sexual harassment levelled by an employee of the World Health Organisation against a colleague. The WHO complainant had also accused the UN agency of trying to shield the accused.

	YSRs cops on terror overdrive    
	A string of terror strikes has shaken Andhra Pradesh really hard. It is evident in the number of bullet-proof vehicles the state has bought.    
	The Andhra police transport organisation has got at least 200 bullet-proof cars  the number puts the state only after Jammu and Kashmir on the list  for chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, his cabinet colleagues and other VIPs, including senior police officers working in Maoist-hit areas.     
	Some of these vehicles will be kept in Delhi and key districts where the chief minister is a regular visitor.     
	The police also plan to set up anti-fidayeen spike systems near the gates to all key installations in the state. The system will automatically attack and destroy any explosives-laden vehicle that tries to force entry.    
	But all this security overdrive might leave one man grumbling  Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu. He is left with his good old bullet-proof Ambassador when Reddy and his ministers have switched to the swankier Scorpios.        
	Football challenge for 15    
	Fifteen Indian boys will match their dribbling skills with footballers from across the world at an international soccer festival in England a few months from now.    
	The event, organised to promote the sport at the grassroots level, will involve Arsenal, the English Premier League club.     
	The Indian participants will be selected by a four-member group of experts from nine cities, where seven-a-side under-15 tournaments have been held.    
	The first kicked off in Bangalore on January 27.     
	The 15 chosen to represent the country will participate in an international seven-a-side tournament in London from July 29 to August 4 in which famous clubs from Europe and South America will also take part.    
	Song amp; dance about an auto    
	An auto was brought into the conference hall of a posh hotel in baraat style.     
	It turned out to be a group of Mahindra and Mahindra executives, led by a local band, out to launch their latest model  the Alpha auto. There were brightly dressed models showering the procession with flowers. And company executives Arun Malhotra and Vivek Nayar made their presentations as a jugalbandi, highlighting the autos many fine aspects in poetic Hindi.     
	Nayar later told reporters that the Alpha autos, manufactured at the Hardwar plant in Uttaranchal, would cater to middle-class commuters who cannot afford either two-wheelers or cars.     
	Ironically they will have to market their products out of Hyderabad as the Andhra Pradesh government has banned registration of autos in the state capital to reduce congestion on the roads.        
	Set for take-off    
	A bunch of Scheduled Caste boys are ready to fly, and the Tamil Nadu government is giving them wings.     
	Ten SC boys will get training as aircraft pilots. The cost  Rs 1 crore  will be borne by the state government.    
	The lucky 10 are part of 210 youths from the backward community who will be trained for jobs in the maritime and the aviation sector, minister A. Tamilarasi has told the Assembly.    
	Some 100 SC boys will train at the National Maritime Academy and the Tamil Nadu Maritime Academy. Fifty girls will train to become airhostesses. Fifty more youths will train as cabin crew.     
	Tamilarasi said there was great scope for employment in the aircraft industry.     
	Mumbai: The Satyam National Academy of Photography is conducting a workshop on digital photography. Professor Shreekant Malushte will address participants from 10am to 4pm. The workshop is on till April 28. The academy is at Senapati Bapat Marg in Dadar (West).

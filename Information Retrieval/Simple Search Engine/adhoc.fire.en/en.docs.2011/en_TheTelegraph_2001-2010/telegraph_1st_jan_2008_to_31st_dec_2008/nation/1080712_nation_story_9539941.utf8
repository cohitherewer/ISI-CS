	Court glare back on speed control    
	Finally, it appears the end of the road for speed demons in Bangalore.    
	Karnataka High Court last week directed the state government to strictly implement the rule making speed governors mandatory for all commercial vehicles.     
	A division bench of Chief Justice Cyriac Joseph and Justice A.N. Venugopalagowda granted the state three more months to fit the devices in existing vehicles and allowed registration of only those new ones that have the gadgets.    
	The judges were hearing a public interest petition challenging the government notification of June last year that extended the deadline for fitting the speed governors till January this year. They said there was no justification for the delay in installing the devices, which are compulsory under provisions of the motor vehicles act.    
	Y.N. Nanjappa, who lost his son in an accident and has since campaigned for the system, had filed the petition.    
	The state governments resolve will soon be put to test. One of the demands of the owners of commercial vehicles, including trucks, who went on strike recently was shelving the speed-governor rule.         
	Heat on petrol cheats    
	Costly fuel has burned pockets. Now, some in Chennai have gone to court saying pumps are fleecing customers.    
	Madras High Court last week asked the Centre to respond to allegations, made in a public interest litigation, that ordinary fuel sales had stopped  only to be passed on as premium branded petrol and diesel  in the city.    
	A group of advocates filed the plea seeking orders to ensure supply of ordinary fuel through pumps and retail dealers.    
	R. Balasubramanian, who filed the suit along with 50 fellow lawyers, alleged that pumps often claimed they didnt have ordinary fuel but sold the same as higher-priced versions under brand names like Speed, Xtra Premium petrol and XtraMile diesel. The practice has become more rampant after last months hike, the lawyers said. (PTI)

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 13: Rahul Gandhi owned up that social inequality within the youth Congress was a matter of concern while winding up his five-hour closed-door separate interaction sessions with tribal and Dalit youths in Cuttack today.         
	Rahul told reporters: Democracy in the youth Congress is a fundamental issue. We are working on it.         
	Two months after his maiden visit, the youth leader visited the state on a daylong follow-up trip.         
	During the March trip I noticed that Orissa did not have adequate representation of tribals and Dalits in the youth Congress, he admitted.         
	The Congress scion dismissed that his statements were poll-related by stating: Do I look like a person who is interested in electoral politics?         
	Rahul Gandhi interacted with 600-odd tribal and Dalit youths in small groups of 20-30 during the two sessions at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium and Stewart School, where he allegedly spotted a sizeable number of talented boys and girls.         
	The discussions reportedly dwelt on problems of tribal and Dalit youths and top Congress leaders and former ministers were denied entry to these discussions.         
	It was a memorable experience, said Motilal Tanty (30) of Jharsuguda.

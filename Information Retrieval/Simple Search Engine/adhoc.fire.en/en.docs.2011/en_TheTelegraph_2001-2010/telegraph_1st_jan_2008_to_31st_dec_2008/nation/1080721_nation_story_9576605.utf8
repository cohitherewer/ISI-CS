          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 20: Orissa police today started investigations into the alleged case of blood sample theft at SCB Medical College and Hospital here.         
	The probe was initiated after a complaint was lodged by the father of Rebati Kanhr, suffering from ambras syndrome, at Manglabag police station on Friday night.         
	Balakrishna Kanhr, the father of Rebati, had alleged that his daughters blood was being drawn for business purposes.         
	The FIR was apparently lodged at the behest of the hospitals doctors.         
	A senior police officer said: The complaint points to the need to keep the patient closely guarded.         
	The 16-year-old has a rare condition called ambras syndrome or congenital hypertrichosis, which is a condition involving excessive growth of hair all over the body.         
	According to experts ambras syndrome is a genetic condition that affects less than one person in a billion. Fewer than 40 such cases have been documented in the world over and there are only 19 people alive today who are known to have hypertrichosis.         
	The hospitals superintendent has been asked to provide explanations regarding the conspiracy slur and the reason behind the collection of blood samples from Rebati and her father, said the inspector in charge of the Manglabag police station Pradyumna Kumar Jena.         
	The FIR names Dr Pratima Sahu (of the biochemistry department) and Malati Swain, a staff nurse, as accused.         
	A doctors team at the periodontics department, treating Rebatis unusual gingival (jaw and gum) enlargement, brought the matter to notice for the first time.        
	We (the police) will proceed further after we receive a reply from the superintendent, said the inspector in charge. The case has been registered under Section 379 and 120 of IPC.

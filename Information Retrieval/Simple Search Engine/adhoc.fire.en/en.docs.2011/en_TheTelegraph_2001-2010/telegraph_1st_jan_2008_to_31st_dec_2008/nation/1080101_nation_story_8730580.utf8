     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Dec. 31: The CPM will ask the Bengal government to ensure jobs in adequate numbers for the minority community in all its offices. 
    
	A subcommittee on minority communities today finalised a draft of its demands, which will be circulated at a closed-door meeting on January 5. All minority leaders in the party, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state party secretary Biman Bose would attend it. 
    
	CPM state secretariat members, district committee secretaries, district secretariat members in charge of minority affairs and the Calcutta mayor and his councillors will also be there. 
    
	A gathering of such a large number of Muslim leaders and those from other communities is needed to sensitise the entire party about the problems of the minorities. Many of us dont understand how urgent minority development projects are, a member of the subcommittee said. 
    
	The partys state and district committees do not have enough minority representatives, he added. 
    
	Party sources said todays document mentioned some of the factors behind the Muslims backwardness in Bengal, the partys achievements in their uplift and the tasks ahead. The focus was on employment, health, education and housing. 
    
	We will also highlight how the CPM took the initiative to get the Sachar Committee formed, where we agree with its report and where we dont, a leader said.
    
	The Sachar report had accused the CPM-led government of not doing enough for minority uplift.
    
	A Muslim leader said: Our party brass has realised that it would be more realistic in the Indian context to move away from the traditional class-based approach to the question of underdevelopment of minorities.
    
	With the panchayat polls around the corner, the growing alienation of some Muslims in the wake of the Nandigram violence and the emergence of hardline minority politicians challenging the CPMs clout in the community also prompted the meeting.

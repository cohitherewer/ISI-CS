	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Youths aspiring to join the armed forces are being put through psychological tests in a new system introduced to make the soldiery mentally tough following several cases of stress-related suicides and fraggings over the years.         
	Psychological tests were a must for youths wanting to join as officers  they were tested for OLQ or officer-like qualities  but so far personnel below officer rank were evaluated only for physical abilities.         
	In the new system devised by the Defence Research and Development Organisations Defence Institute of Psychological Research, personnel below officer rank will have to give evidence of aptitude for military responsibilities.         
	So far, they were tested only for physical abilities, said W. Selvamurthy, the chief controller (research and development).        
	This system has just been introduced and we expect that all services selection boards for personnel below officer rank implement it, said Selvamurthy, who heads the DRDOs cluster of nine life sciences laboratories.         
	The decision to introduce psychological tests to evaluate personnel below officer rank was taken after successive years in which the number of soldier suicides and fragging (soldier killing soldier) was high.         
	Soldier wannabes are being evaluated to see if they can withstand the stress associated with prolonged deployment in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast. The tests are meant not only for the army but also for the navy and the air force.         
	Selvamurthy said that starting 2009, the Indian Air Force would also adopt a new DRDO-devised pilot aptitude battery test that would decide if a recruit was psychologically fit to be a flier and whether he or she should be sent to fighter aircraft, helicopters or transporters.         
	At present, this trifurcation of cadets is done by instructors in the Air Force Academy near Hyderabad.         
	Selvamurthy said that the pilot aptitude battery test that is now done was formulated in the 1960s. Since then, the Indian Air Force has inducted high-performance aircraft. The current system tests pilots on eye-hand-leg co-ordination.         
	The new system would evaluate cognitive processing ability because pilots on modern aircraft were multi-tasking every moment, said Selvamurthy. Fighter aircraft pilots are now also expected to fly for upto 10 hours at a stretch with induction of mid-air refuellers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, April 12: A salesgirl at a Gurgaon DVD rental store allegedly stabbed a man in defence after a group of six men attacked her for not delivering a film disc home last evening.         
	The girl was beaten by the men for over 15 minutes following a spat over the delivery of a DVD to a nearby address, police said. The wounded man  stabbed in the abdomen  is recovering in a Gurgaon hospital.         
	The others have been detained and are being questioned.         
	The girl has been arrested and charged with Section 307  attempt to murder  of the Indian Penal Code, officers said.         
	The girl appears to be in shock. We have been asking her to tell us what happened before the stabbing. But she has not been able to tell us much. Even her age is not yet confirmed, though we believe she may be 19, Gurgaon police commissioner Mohinder Lal said.         
	The incident occurred around 7pm at a shopping complex in Sector 29 of Gurgaon.         
	According to the police, the girl had started working at the store only in February.         
	Around 6.30pm yesterday, a woman came to the shop and complained loudly to the girl that a DVD she had ordered had not yet been delivered. According to the girl, the woman abused her and demanded her money back.         
	The girl told us that the abuses angered her and she refused to pay the woman back, an officer said.         
	The woman disappeared, only to return minutes later with the group of six men.         
	The men beat the girl for over 15 minutes. Some of them were drunk, the officer said.         
	Overpowered, the girl managed to grab a kitchen knife lying on the shop counter and allegedly stabbed one of the men, the officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 17: The Orissa Private Engineering College Association today boycotted admissions to the first-year BTech and MCA courses in private engineering and MCA colleges for the session 2008-09 as a mark of protest against allegedly faulty admission procedure and fee structure fixed by the government.         
	The Orissa government had decided to start counselling for private engineering colleges through JEE from July 18. The association has made it clear that they would not be responsible for any student seeking admission into private colleges. Their future will be in the hands of the government and JEE authorities, the panel said.        
	We are left with no option but to stall admission for 2008-09 session because the state did not respond to our proposal for amendment in the admission procedure and fee structure, the secretary of the panel, Binod Dash, told The Telegraph here today.

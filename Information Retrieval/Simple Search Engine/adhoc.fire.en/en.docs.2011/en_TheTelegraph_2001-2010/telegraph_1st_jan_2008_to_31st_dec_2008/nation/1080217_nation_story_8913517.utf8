                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Claim unpaid, leave the chair      
	One determined petitioner did what many valuers might struggle to with all their number-crunching skills. He has demonstrated that the commissioners chair at the Bangalore Municipal Corporation is worth Rs 5.7 lakh.    
	No, it isnt whether the official bribed a minister with that kind of money to grab the chair, but a story straight out of a court case. It all began when the city corporation acquired 35sqm land to widen a road.     
	The land owner, Megh Nath, unhappy with the compensation he got, appealed in a court in 2001. After many years, Karnataka High Court awarded him Rs 5.7 lakh.     
	The blow to the civic body did not end there. The court ordered the attachment of moveable property in the corporations offices if Nath did not get the compensation.    
	Armed with the order, Nath approached the corporation this week and claimed the commissioners chair.     
	Embarrassed officials realised Nath meant business. They scrambled and paid up the amount to stop him from walking off with their bosss chair.        
	Literary heir off power play      
	She is happy being a Rajya Sabha MP holding forth on the US nuclear deal and getting her speeches in the House published in a Tamil journal.     
	But Kanimozhi, M. Karunanidhis poetess-daughter and his self-proclaimed literary heir, cant rest easy amid the buzz about her power tryst.    
	Speculation has been rife that she would be made the Union minister for environment and forests before its incumbent, her DMK colleague D. Raja, was handed the communications portfolio. Repeated denials, sometimes by her father, have failed to put an end to the guessing game.    
	The first woman DMK MP in recent decades, Kanimozhi has spent much of her time outside Delhi organising the womens wing of the party and carrying her fathers literary legacy. The power play seems some way off.    
	YSR calls for budget battle    
	The budget is on the agenda but a war of words is in the air.    
	Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has dared the Opposition to raise any allegation it wants to during the ongoing budget session. He has promised his critics a fitting reply.    
	The chief minister, nettled by accusations from the Telugu Desam and the CPM of stealing public money, has decided to take the bull by the horns than issue tame denials.    
	Reddy took a swipe at Desam, saying the party was still obsessed with hunting for loopholes in Obulapuram mining deal  in which some of his Congress ministerial colleagues were accused of corruption  when other Opposition parties had buried the matter.    
	We are spending public money to the tune of Rs 7,000 per minute. People will not excuse us if the time is not utilised to address their problems, Reddy said.    
	This years budget will be the last to be presented by the Reddy government. Next year, when elections in the state are scheduled, is likely to see only a vote-of-account.        
	Ground reality      
	Blackout blues reached the airport last week.     
	The evening power cut lasted a few minutes but set off a scare and disrupted flight movement for some time.     
	Two planes about to touch down were asked to hover above for a while before they were cleared for landing.     
	p to 36 flights are run per hour during peak time  morning and evening. An official said the landings were halted as a safety measure. The power cut was blamed on grid failure.  
	Mumbai: Watch C for Clown, which portrays a day in the life of five clowns and their anxiety before the final performance. The play, at Juhus Prithvi Theatre, is presented by Cinematograph, a theatre group of friends. Date: February 19 to 22. Shows at 9pm. Call 022-26149546 for details.

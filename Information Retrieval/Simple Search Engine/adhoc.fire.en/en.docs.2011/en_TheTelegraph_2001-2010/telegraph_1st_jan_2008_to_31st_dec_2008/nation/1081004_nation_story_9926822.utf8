          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Over five lakh college and university teachers may soon get unprecedented salary hikes, additional fringe benefits and new titles, according to a pay panels recommendations submitted to the University Grants Commission today.        
	The pay panel headed by G.K. Chaddha, a member of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, has also recommended new posts in the faculty structure to counter stagnation at a particular salary grade.        
	The new scales will place entrants to the teaching fraternity above counterparts in the bureaucracy despite the Sixth Pay Commission implementation, Chaddha said.        
	The biggest challenge in higher education today is attracting fresh talent. Teachers need to be given the best deal possible. We have been lavish, generous... perhaps a little extra generous, he said.        
	Most central universities have over 20 per cent vacancies in their teaching staff as young academics opt for better paying corporate jobs, government statistics show.        
	The UGC is meeting on October 7 and 8 to discuss the report before it is forwarded to the HRD ministry, commission chairman Sukhdeo Thorat said.         
	Lecturers should be renamed assistant professors and readers renamed associate professors, the panel has suggested.        
	Apart from existing allowances, all teachers should be granted a special academic allowance. But in a break from practice, the panel has recommended that fresh entrants receive higher academic allowances than senior faculty.        
	The principal thrust of our recommendations is to try and capture young talent and retain them. Professors require this allowance less than a young assistant professor, H.C. Narang, a member of the panel, said.         
	At present, colleges are not allowed to recruit professors. The panel has recommended that all postgraduate colleges be allowed to directly recruit professors  as opposed to promotions.         
	For all colleges, the panel has recommended the new post of senior associate professor, just below the rank of professor. For universities, it has suggested the post of senior professor above the rank of professor, and a professor of eminence who will earn the same salary as the vice-chancellor.        
	The panel has recommended two years childcare leave for women. For the first time, it has proposed 15 days paternity leave for childcare.        
	In a first, the panel has also recommended a regular administrative structure encouraging faculty members to offer consultancy services to private firms alongside their teaching duties.         
	The panel has suggested that in cases where the consultancy fees earned is less than 30 per cent of the gross salary, the teacher be allowed to keep the entire amount.

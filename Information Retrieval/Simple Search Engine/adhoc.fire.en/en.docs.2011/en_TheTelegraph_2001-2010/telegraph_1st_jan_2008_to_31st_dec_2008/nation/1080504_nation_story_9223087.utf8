                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     House fight brews over unruly 32
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Somnath Chatterjee                                  
	New Delhi, May 3: The Opposition is bracing for a confrontation with Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee over his partisan and undemocratic decision to haul up 32 protesting MPs.        
	Sources said a meeting of National Democratic Alliance leaders on Monday would decide the BJP-led blocs future course of action.        
	NDA leaders feel that though there is growing discontent among people about unruly scenes in the House, the Speakers action will not win popular support because the issue involved was inflation.        
	Chatterjee had referred 32 MPs to the House privileges committee for their conduct in the Lok Sabha last week.        
	Senior BJP leaders feel the Opposition should not bow to the Speakers dictatorship as it had an ideal opportunity to politically exploit the crisis generated by rising prices.        
	If the issue of price rise is not to be raised in Parliament, what is the Opposition there for? said BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra. All the NDA leaders are agitated and our response will be decided on Monday morning.        
	Chatterjee had been threatening errant members for quite some time as disrupting House proceedings had become almost routine.        
	Even on small issues, some party or the other would rush to the well every other day to force an adjournment. There have also been instances when BJP leaders have announced in advance their intention to disrupt the House.        
	Sources in the government argue that price rise had been thoroughly discussed in Parliament and there was no need to create a ruckus every day.         
	Recently, Chatterjee had asked House officials to note down names of unruly members. He also warned that the cheerleaders would face action.         
	The Speakers stand has triggered a larger debate on falling standards of parliamentary behaviour. Politicians have divergent views on punitive action but there is overwhelming consensus that MPs should conduct themselves with greater responsibility.        
	Even Opposition leaders concede the Speakers point but see a method in his anger as he has spared some regular troublemakers from the Left and the ruling United Progressive Alliance.         
	Most senior leaders agree that the dependence of parties on disruptive techniques to highlight issues requires introspection.        
	They feel that party chiefs should realise the virtues of debate for effectively making a point and avoid disrupting the House as their first course of action.         
	Most leaders blame the medias obsession with trouble for the growing disruptive tendencies among members but are unwilling to speak on the subject.        
	It is not a general debate. The Speaker has taken a decision and we cannot comment on that, said the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta.        
	The Congress supports the Speakers move but party leaders are not willing to join the debate. One cabinet minister said Parliament was obviously not a corporate boardroom where everybody works towards his own benefit.        
	Members have to fight for the peoples cause in a democracy. You dont expect peace all the time, he said on the condition of anonymity.        
	But we are not expected to respond to every situation by creating trouble. Paralysing Parliament at the slightest excuse is not helping anybody. We need to introspect.

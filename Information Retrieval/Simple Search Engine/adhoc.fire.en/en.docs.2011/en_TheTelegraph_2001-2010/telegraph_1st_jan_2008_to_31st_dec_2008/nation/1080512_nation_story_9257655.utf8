	Srinagar, May 11: Eight people, including a photojournalist and three other civilians, died today in a daylong encounter in a village in Samba district that had managed to stay untouched by attacks for six years in southern Jammu.        
	At 5.50 this morning, two militants in army fatigues broke into the house of Hoshiar Singh, the general secretary of the newly formed Indian National Democratic Party, and opened fire.         
	Singh and his wife, Shashi Bala, died on the spot. Bindu and Darshan Devi, two other women, were injured.         
	Realising that militants had struck Kali Mandi village, some 38km from Jammu, residents shut themselves indoors.         
	By the time police, the BSF and the army arrived, the militants had moved to another house nearby and taken five members of a family hostage.         
	Troops stormed the house but the operation claimed a woman hostage, though the other members of the family were rescued.         
	Ashok Todi, a photojournalist of Excelssior, a Jammu-based English daily, was also killed. The 45-year-old, who was taken to a hospital, succumbed to injuries there.         
	The encounter occurred at a time when areas that have borne the brunt of the two-decade-long insurgency are seeing a decline in violence.         
	Security forces saw in the attack an indication that rebel groups were trying to open new fronts as militants had not struck the southern district for the past six years.         
	Intermittent firing continued for much of the day as reinforcements were rushed to the area to fight the militants, who repeatedly lobbed grenades to push back the forces.         
	The militant duo, who are believed to have infiltrated the border in Samba on Friday night, were later killed.         
	Two army jawans  Aziz Mohammad and Atul Negi  also died.         
	An army major, Mukul Chowhan, was among the several security personnel injured. The encounter ended in the evening.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP seals fortress in Karnataka
                            
	Bangalore, Dec. 30 (PTI): The ruling BJP today won five of the eight seats in the Karnataka bypolls, securing an absolute majority seven months after taking power.        
	The Congress, the main Opposition party, drew a blank in the December 27 bypolls, while former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) won three seats.        
	The results have taken the B.S. Yeddyurappa governments strength in the 224-member Assembly to 115. In addition, the ruling party has the support of six Independents.        
	Four ministers were among the BJP winners. Another party candidate, J. Narasimha Swamy, was declared elected from Doddaballapur.        
	Dal(S) candidate Anita, the wife of former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, was elected from Madhugiri, defeating the BJPs C. Chennigappa. The Kumaraswamys will become the first MLA couple in the state.        
	The party retained the Maddur seat, which had fallen vacant following the death of its MLA, M.S. Siddaraju. His wife Kalpana defeated BJP rival D.C. Tahammanna.        
	The Dal(S) also bagged Turuvekere, where losing BJP candidate M.D. Lakshminarayana was rushed to hospital after he collapsed at the counting centre.         
	Sources said the 53-year-old, leading until the final round and having started celebrating, was stunned by a late reversal.        
	The results are seen as a blow to the Congress and the Dal(S), which had urged people to punish the defectors during the campaign. Instead, voters seemed to have preferred the BJPs stability slogan. Three Congress and four Dal(S) MLAs had joined the BJP.        
	This unprecedented verdict has further increased our responsibility. On behalf the of government, I assure the people that the government will strive to live up to their expectations by accelerating development and giving good governance, Yeddyurappa said late this evening.

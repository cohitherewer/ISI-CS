	New Delhi, Dec. 8: For the BJP, the election results were disappointing but not disastrous.        
	The party leadership, however, admits that it missed the bus in Delhi, which offered ideal conditions for victory, and Rajasthan could have been salvaged with a little extra care.         
	The BJPs parliamentary board met this evening to discuss the results in five states and the dominant view was that the party had lost a great opportunity to deliver a debilitating punch to the Congress before the general elections.        
	The outcome in Rajasthan particularly rattled the top leaders. Fierce infighting and ineffective political management were identified as reasons that helped the Congress crawl ahead.         
	Party general secretary Arun Jaitley said there was a casual approach towards the over 60 rebels in the fray against the BJPs official nominees in the state. No attempt was made to dissuade them from contesting, he added.        
	Three rebels had the official backing of the Sangh parivar. Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and state party president Om Mathur worked at cross-purposes and the central leadership allowed the situation to drift, Jaitley said.         
	The leadership, however, can draw some consolation from the point of view of next years parliamentary elections as the Congress has bagged barely 1 per cent more votes.        
	Jaitley admitted that the party was reasonably satisfied as its support base was intact despite the loss of power. The impact of these results was more psychological than numerical, he argued.         
	The party leadership rues letting the Congress off the hook after a string of serious electoral reverses.         
	The Congress, by retaining Delhi and snatching Rajasthan, can claim a draw in this round of elections. But what has encouraged the BJP leadership is that its governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have earned peoples support on the basis of their performances.        
	Jaitley said it was heartening to see that pro-people schemes could create a pro-incumbency factor for governments.         
	But the results have given the BJP a new cause for concern. The party has discovered that terrorism and price rise are not enough to sink the Congress and it would have to project other issues to make its national campaign more effective. Both the Delhi and Rajasthan elections were held under the shadow of the Mumbai attack and the global economic slowdown. The two issues were expected to hurt the Congress but the results proved otherwise.        
	The BJP has decided to set up committees to analyse the results in each state and recommend suggestions for strengthening the party. This is, however, a movement in reverse gear, as the party has already identified issues, finalised its strategies and even gone ahead with declaring candidates for the Lok Sabha elections.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 6: District administration today lodged an FIR against 12 rebels lodged in Sasaram divisional jail in connection with Saturdays clash between two groups of prisoners on the prison premises. 
    
	The two groups comprised supporters of former JD(U) MLA Sunil Pandey, who is an inmate, and Maoist prisoners  allegedly over the issue of who would lord over the prison premises. 
    
	The rebels, too, lodged an FIR against the imprisoned former MLA for provoking his supporters to attack the Naxalites. 
    
	Assistant sub-inspector of police Ravindra Nath Singh was seriously injured in the clash between the two groups. 
    
	Prison sources said Maoists, including hardcore leaders Munna Gupta and Krishna Ram, lodged in ward number 12 clashed with one Janardan Yadav and others  all believed to be Pandey supporters. The warring prisoners hit the ASI in his head when the latter went to intervene. 
    
	The administration has been, of late, constantly battling with the growing incidents of violence in the states jails. Recently, Maoists prisoners had liberated the premises of the high-security Beur central jail for eight hours, indulging in violence and slogan shouting. 
    
	The rebels had also disturbed peace in Jehanabad jail recently.

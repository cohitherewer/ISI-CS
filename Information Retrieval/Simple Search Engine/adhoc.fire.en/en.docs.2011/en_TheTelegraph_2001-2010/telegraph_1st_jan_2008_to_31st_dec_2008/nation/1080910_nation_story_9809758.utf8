	Serampore, Sept. 9: Congress supporters today snatched a man charged with the murder of a party leader along with an accused in another case from police and battered them.        
	The police said the incident occurred at 11am when Ashok Shau, 37, arrested in the murder of former Congress councillor Ananta Srivastav last night, was being taken to court from a hospital.        
	The other person beaten up, Krishna Chakraborty, 30, is accused of a minor offence.         
	Congress supporters had gathered outside Walsh Hospital, where the post-mortem on Srivastavs body was on. Both men, cuffed and escorted by two constables, were walking to a police jeep when some Congress supporters recognised Ashok. A police officer said the mob battered their heads with stones. The two were later hospitalised.

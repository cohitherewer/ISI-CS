	 New Delhi, Oct. 13 (PTI): Delhi police have asked paan shops selling cigarettes and soft drinks to close by 1am.           
	The order aims to prevent a gathering of people that may lead to quarrels or escalate into riot-like situations.

	 New Delhi (PTI): A psychopath cannot escape punishment for murder on the grounds of abnormality of mind, the Supreme Court has ruled. A bench dismissed the appeal of a convict who had committed the murder while undergoing treatment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, May 29: A JD(U) minister allegedly bashed up a senior BJP MLA yesterday, further straining the relationship between the two NDA partners in the grip of rebellion since April 13 when Nitish Kumar shuffled his ministry.         
	MLA Phalguni Yadav, who reportedly broke one of his legs in the incident, said he was attacked after he raised issues related to irregularities at a meeting in Jamui yesterday. The minister, Narendra Singh, jumped from his seat, pushing Yadav off his.         
	His son, Abhay Singh, rained blows on me. I fell from the dais and broke my leg, the MLA said.         
	Narendra, however, denied the allegation. There was a scuffle between my supporters and Falgunis on the dais. Falguni fell from the dais while trying to calm frayed tempers. I regret the incident, he added.         
	The incident today led the BJP workers to stage demonstrations at places in Jamui. The party activists demanded a criminal case against the minister and his arrest.         
	Falguni said: This was a pre-planned conspiracy to hurt me.         
	The episode has now provided an opportunity to the BJP rebels to step up their ire against the embattled deputy chief minister and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.         
	A dissident MLA Awanish Kumar Singh said: The BJP MLAs have been suffering humiliation due to the weak-kneed BJP leadership.         
	Singh elaborated: Sushil Kumar Modi always wishes to stay stuck to chair. Thats why he desists from taking up issues that may make him less popular in the government.        
	Awanish demanded the high command to intervene in Bihar and save the maan-samman (prestige) of the MLAs. Other dissident BJP MLAs  Chandramohan Rai, Satyadeo Narayan Arya and Rameshwar Chourasia condemned the incident.         
	Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi are yet to react to the incident, but BJP spokesman Vinod Narayan Jha described it as an attack on the party. The scuffle took place when Falguni criticised the government for changing the name of a road and for delaying a proposed bridge at Baltharghat in Jamui.         
	BJP minister Prem Kumar also witnessed the incident.

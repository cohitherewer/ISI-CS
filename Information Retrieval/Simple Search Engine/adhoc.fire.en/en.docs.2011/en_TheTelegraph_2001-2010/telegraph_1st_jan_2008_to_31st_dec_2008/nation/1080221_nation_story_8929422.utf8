The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress shrugs off warning
                                                                                                               Congress shrugs off warning
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Congress today sounded unfazed about the June deadline set by some US senators to clinch the nuclear deal and stressed that India would not be dictated to.         
	The party also made it clear that its first priority would be to sort out the sticking points with the CPM and its allies through the designated UPA-Left mechanism.         
	The Congress said Delhi would follow its own timeline  hold talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency before agreeing on a text, which would be placed before the Left before the deal is inked.        
	From the start, the nuclear deal has been negotiated on our terms alone. National interest is supreme. We also have to think of our allies who support the government from outside. We will try and reach a consensus before doing anything and we are on the job, Congress spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.        
	He stressed that no extraneous force could dictate terms. We have our own deadline and we will work according to that.        
	On the senators warning that the next government in the US would want to re-negotiate the treaty and this might not suit India, Moily said: We will cross the bridge when we come to it.        
	A Congress source involved in the talks with the Left claimed that Delhi was in no hurry to put the deal in place and that things will be allowed to proceed on their (own) momentum without anyone getting pro-active.         
	However, the source clarified that this statement did not mean that India was giving the deal a quiet burial.        
	The Congress believes that the next big hurdle would arise only if India failed to extract a document to its liking from the IAEA. Liking is a broad term because our friends from Bengal and Kerala will have to accept what we come back with, a source said.         
	The source also emphasised that none of those engaged in the exercise had bought the line that the pact could be delinked from the Hyde Act and, by implication, the US, and used as a mechanism to facilitate dealings with Russia and France.         
	This line is being peddled to make the deal more palatable to the Left hardliners. If they dont accept it, the Congress expects it would have to take a call on whether to keep sustaining the government on the Lefts life-support or go for an early election.         
	The party continues to be divided on the issue with some still believing that no electoral gains can be made by sacrificing the government at the nuclear altar.         
	The votaries of the ekla chalo (go solo) theory  mostly Rajya Sabha MPs  say it is better for the Congress to have a spell or two in the Opposition than survived on the mercy of the Left and other allies.

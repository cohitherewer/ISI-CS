	Vatoli (Adilabad), Oct. 13: When his relatives advised Mehboob Khan to take shelter in nearby Bhainsa town after Fridays communal flare-up, the vegetable seller had just laughed.        
	Ive been living in Vatoli for over 20 years and know everyone in the village by name. No one here would dream of harming me or my family, he had told brother-in-law Mujahid Khan, a shopkeeper from Bhainsa, 275km north of Hyderabad.        
	Yet, when Mehboob, 50, was burnt to death with his wife, daughter and three grandsons at his home late on Saturday night, no one came to help.        
	The villagers claim they didnt torch his home and that it must have been the handiwork of outsiders. But they admit that none tried to douse the fire because they thought no one was in the house  although many acknowledged seeing Mehboob at a village bhajan till midnight.        
	Vatoli had only two Muslim families  and the other family had fled on Friday itself, when a Dussehra procession set up a Hindu-Muslim clash that killed four persons in Bhainsa. The situation in the town had been brought under control but the tension spread to neighbouring villages, prompting families to take refuge in Bhainsa.        
	I had warned him and also the local police. While my brother-in-law was overconfident, the police were indifferent, Mujahid said.        
	The dead include Mehboobs wife Sufia Begum, 45, daughter Rizwana Begum, 28, and grandsons Aslam, 7, Nuwan, 3, and Tuba, 2.        
	The villagers expressed shock. We never thought such an incident could take place here, said Govinda, a farmer and neighbour.        
	The villagers said a bhajan had been held on Saturday night and Mehboob had been among the audience till midnight. Around 2.30am, someone noticed that his home was on fire. We didnt hear any cries for help and thought Mehboob must have left for Bhainsa with his family after the bhajan, a villager said.        
	At dawn, a local leader spoke to the police. When officers entered the house, they stumbled on Mehboobs partially burnt arm, still wearing a wristwatch that had stopped at 2.40am. In one of the rooms, the police found the skull of one of the children and the remains of the rest of the family.        
	Officers suspect the attackers killed the family and then torched the house. Mehboobs brother Mumtaz, a schoolteacher who has arrived from Bhainsa, said he noticed bloodstains near the house.        
	A team of 100 policemen is guarding the village of 2,000 people. Police patrols are roaming the dozen-odd villages around Bhainsa and pickets have been posted in some of them. Curfew continued in Bhainsa for the fourth day while stray clashes were reported from other towns and villages in Adilabad and neighbouring Karimnagar.

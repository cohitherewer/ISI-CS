	New Delhi, July 17: The chief of the army staff, General Deepak Kapur, has requested President Pratibha Patil to intervene in the armed forces negotiations with the government on their demand for better wages.         
	This is the first time that a service chief has sought the direct involvement of the high office on a matter that is essentially to be settled between the Prime Ministers Office and the defence and finance ministries.

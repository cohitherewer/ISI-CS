                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Whos the lucky bride? Rahuls not telling
          OUR BUREAU                          Rahul in a turban in Bathinda. (PTI)                                  
	Sept. 23: Rahul Gandhi is still waiting for a perfect match.         
	As he charmed his way through Punjab, one of the countrys most eligible bachelors again repeated what he has been saying for sometime now: I will marry soon.        
	The Nehru-Gandhi scion didnt wait to reply to the inevitable question on who the lucky bride was, choosing instead to hurry back to his car parked on the dusty roads of Bathinda.        
	Congress watchers said Rahul has for quite some time been saying he wants to tie the knot. At a recent interaction with teenagers in Bhopal, he had said he was hopeful it would happen soon.        
	A persistent ninth-grader had then asked the 38-year-old what his idea of a perfect match was. Pat had come the reply: had he got one, he said, he would have been married by now. His idea of a perfect match, Rahul added, was a caring person sensitive towards others.        
	Congress observers reasoned that his assertions on marriage could be a defence mechanism as most of his peers in the party  the young brigade of future torchbearers  were married and raising a family.         
	Even Rahuls father, Rajiv Gandhi, was a professional and married with two children when he was 38 (the former Prime Minister was born in 1944), which made him an acceptable figure as head of the Congress party when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984.         
	To that extent, the observers said, the Harvard-educated Rahul was still seen as a kid learning the ropes and not yet ready for the top job. Rajiv, they pointed out, became Prime Minister at 40.         
	In the absence of any confirmation or denial, there is a persistent buzz in Congress and social circles that Rahul is still involved with a young South American girl.         
	A section of the Congress is a little wary that marriage to a foreigner could revive the anti-foreign origin backlash mother Sonia Gandhi has had to face.         
	But another section of party leaders believes that following the May 2004 act of renunciation by Sonia (choosing not to become Prime Minister), the issue of her foreign origins is dead and, consequently, would not affect Rahul.         
	Much like Operation Bluestar, whose ghost has haunted the Congress but doesnt seem to have touched the young Gandhi. A quarter of a century after the army operation inside the Golden Temple in Amritsar to drive out pro-Khalistan militants in June 1984, which turned Punjab against the Gandhi family, it now appears that the past is buried.         
	The reaction from the people suggested as much. From Sirhind to Patiala to Sangrur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Faridkot, Rahuls charm was at work. He reminds me of Rajiv Gandhi and he is so sona (handsome), said 76-year-old Kuljeet, who had come to welcome him with the Congress flag in Bassi near Patiala.         
	He should be welcomed with open arms. His visit should remove the scars of Operation Bluestar from the Gandhi family, he added.        
	Clad in a crumpled white kurta-pyjama and plain sandals, Rahuls insistence on eating local food, especially makki-di-roti and sarson-da-saag, has endeared him to the people.         
	When he landed at the Golden Temple yesterday, devotees were startled to see him. His eyes looked moist when he walked along the parikrama and then inside the sanctum sanctorum, a Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee official said.

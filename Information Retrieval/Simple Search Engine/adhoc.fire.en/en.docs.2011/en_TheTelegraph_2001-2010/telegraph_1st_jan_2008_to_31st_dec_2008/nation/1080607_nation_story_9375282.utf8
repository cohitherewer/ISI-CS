  - Quantity of relief materials to be distributed revised          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The 1999 super cyclone                                        
	Bhubaneswar, June 6: With the south-west monsoon set to hit the Orissa coast shortly, the state government today decided to release Rs 60 crore from its Calamity Relief Fund to tackle natural calamities.        
	The state-level natural calamity committee, headed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, met today to chalk out contingency measures, said disaster management minister Manmohan Samal.        
	District collectors were asked to stock adequate rice in 5,800 panchayat stores across Orissa 15 days in advance and store kerosene oil in inaccessible pockets, said the minister.        
	The food stock started to move from today, said Samal, who heads the food supplies department as well. Two hundred metric tonnes of polythene sheets had also been procured for makeshift shelters if required, he said.        
	Engineers and senior officials of water resources department were asked to close all breaches on river embankments by June 15. Also, boats to be hired had been identified by respective district administrations to carry out relief and rescue operations during floods, Samal said, adding that collectors were instructed to make provisions for drinking water.         
	It was also decided that vacant posts of doctors and paramedics in flood-prone areas would be filled up on a war footing.        
	The government also revised the quantity of relief to be distributed among marooned people. The quantity of dry relief material for a single adult has been revised from 500 grams per head to 1kg and for a child from 250 grams to 500 grams.         
	Similarly, the price of cooked food to be supplied from free kitchen has been increased to Rs 20 from Rs 10 for an adult and from Rs 8 to Rs 15 for a child.        
	Steps are being taken for prevention of coastal erosion at Puri and Gopalpur beaches with assistance from experts from Goa and Chennai. Alternative homestead would be provided to residents who have lost their homes to an advancing sea or rivers.        
	Besides, strengthening of saline embankments, mangrove plantation and regeneration are being undertaken in seven coastal districts under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Programme.         
	Proposals to the tune of Rs 600 crore are pending approval of the Centre.

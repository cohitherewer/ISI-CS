          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Deve Gowda                                  
	Chennai, May 23: H.D. Deve Gowda hopped across temples today amid exit polls predicting Sundays Karnataka poll results would hand him the kingmakers role again.        
	The first stop for the former Prime Minister, accompanied by elder son H.D. Revanna, was Sri Varadaraja Swamy Temple in Kancheepurams Vishnu Kanchi, sources said. Special pujas were performed for him at the shrine, where the annual festivities are now under way.         
	The duo flew into Kanchi from Bangalore in a chartered helicopter, which landed on the grounds of a local college.        
	The next halt was at the Kamakshi Amman temple, part of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, in the Siva Kanchi area. They also went to Sri Ahobila Mutt, a Vaishnavite institution, but skipped the Kanchi Mutt during their 90-minute Kancheepuram trip, the sources said.        
	Gowda, a devout Vaishnavite, then flew to Tiruchirappalli, close to Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, which is an island formed by the Cauvery.        
	Their darshan at the shrine, believed to ante-date the Ramayana period, was first scheduled at 5pm but was put off for later in the evening, the sources said. Police officials said the two were slated to stay overnight in a local hotel amid signs they could have a Vishawaroopa Darshan, of the reclining Lord Vishnu, in the wee hours tomorrow.

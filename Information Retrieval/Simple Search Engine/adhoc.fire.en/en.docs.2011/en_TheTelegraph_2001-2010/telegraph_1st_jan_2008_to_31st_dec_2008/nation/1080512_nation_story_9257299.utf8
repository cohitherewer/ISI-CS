The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red-faced CPM in central force dilemma
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Red-faced CPM in central force dilemma
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Biman Bose                                  
	Calcutta, May 11: The CPM held fire at the CRPF after an initial fusillade, apparently embarrassed by the widely televised spat between a party strongman and a paramilitary officer.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, not known for verbal restraint, skipped the controversy during the media briefing at the state party headquarters this evening. He kept referring to the generally peaceful election, barring a few incidents but was extremely reluctant to touch upon the most talked-about event of the day.        
	The restraint was in sharp contrast with the comments of the partys de facto spokesperson, Shyamal Chakraborty, earlier in the day. Supporting Lakshman Seth, Chakraborty, said CRPF officer Alok Raj had been harassing and intimidating CPM supporters at the instigation of the Trinamul Congress.        
	He (Seth) pulled up the officer after getting complaints from the local people, the minister added.        
	Chakraborty said the partys women leaders would visit Nandigram after the poll to meet those who had lodged complaints of alleged molestation against Raj. Why is Raj asking for a CBI inquiry? Our state CID is capable of conducting it, he added.        
	However, by the evening, the partys belligerence was under wraps, apparently following the advice of the partys central leadership.        
	At the CPM congress in Coimbatore, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had moved a hard-hitting resolution complaining of the Centres delay in deploying the CRPF in the state.        
	With Seth targeting the same CRPF, the controversy could backfire on the CPM, the party leadership feels. Besides, the state is depending on the Centre for additional forces for the remaining two phases of the panchayat polls.         
	I cannot comment on this on the basis of TV reports. I have to gather information when that officer had gone on patrolling, where he had gone and who were with him. Also, I have to know whether Raj acted in accordance with election rules. After all, I am not in the administration, Bose said.         
	He parried questions on whether Seth was right in asking the CRPF officer to stay put in the camp. Wait for few days till I gather detailed information, Bose said.         
	Asked whether he had received party feedback on the allegation of molestation against Raj, Bose said he needed independent confirmation. It is not enough for me to be informed. I have to find out everything for myself, he said.         
	Party sources said Bose was waiting for the chief ministers return to the city before commenting on the controversy.        
	Bhattacharjee, who was in Malda during the day for campaigning, said in the evening that the people of Nandigram showed the state and the country that apprehensions of trouble during polling were unfounded.        
	Barring an incident in Bandwan, where Maoists blew up a police outpost the first phase of the polls was by and large peaceful, even in Nandigram, he said.        
	But CPM allies like Forward Bloc leader Asoke Ghosh and RSP leader Manoj Bhattacharya criticised Seth. This was unbecoming of an MP and would not brighten the image of Left MPs, Bhattacharya said.        
	Bose took the middle path on alleged assaults on CRPF personnel as well as the state police. Neither of the incidents should have happened, he said.

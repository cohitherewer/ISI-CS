	New Delhi, Feb. 2: The five sailors who died aboard the US-origin INS Jalashva yesterday inhaled deadly gas leaking from a compartment and were not killed in an explosion as reported earlier, a navy spokesperson said today.
    
	The five electricians and maintenance experts inhaled hydrogen sulphide while trying to locate the source of the leak, the spokesperson added.
    
	The naval personnel were carrying out maintenance work and died inadvertently by inhaling the leaking gas and not because of any fire or any other cause, he said.
    
	The 7,020-tonne amphibious vessel, known as the USS Trenton before it joined the Indian Navy around six months ago after a refit, was in the middle of a war game in the high seas between Visakhapatnam and Port Blair when the mishap occurred.
    
	The vessel, the second largest ship in the Indian Navys fleet after the aircraft carrier Viraat, reportedly berthed at Port Blair today.
    
	Other sources in the navy said the sailors did not merely inhale toxic hydrogen sulphide, which smells like rotten egg, but also deadly carbon monoxide and suffocated.
    
	Explaining how it happened, they said two of the sailors were cleaning the ships sewage treatment plant while another was overseeing the operation when they inhaled the lethal mix. The other two died when they went to investigate what had happened to their colleagues.
    
	The dead sailors have been identified as K.V.R. Krishna Rao, D.R. Kumar Chaitanya, Ramesh Kumar Nayak, Deepak Shivran and Narendra Yadav, all members of the repair team.

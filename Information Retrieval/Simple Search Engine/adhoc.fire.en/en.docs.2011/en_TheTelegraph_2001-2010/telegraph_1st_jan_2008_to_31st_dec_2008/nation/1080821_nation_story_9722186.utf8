	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Sonia Gandhi will address a rally in Uttar Pradeshs Dadri on September 13, taking the battle to Mayavatis territory a month after four farmers were killed there in police firing.        
	The police opened fire when the farmers of villages around the Dadri power project in Greater Noida had gathered to demand more compensation for land the state government acquired in 2006. Initially, local Congress leaders had taken the lead in protesting the firing. However, with the tragedy acquiring political overtones, the leaders felt that Sonia should step in.        
	Chief minister Mayavati, who had withdrawn support to the UPA government, today sent emissaries to the farmers.        
	Softening their stand, the farmers left it to the government to seek legal advice on how the land compensation could be increased.

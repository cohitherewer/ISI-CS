	Bangalore, Oct. 21: A Wipro executive was rescued after a five-hour kidnap drama staged by her driver, months after an attempt to abduct her family members had failed.        
	Vijayalakshmi was waylaid by two bike-borne men who faked an accident to get into her Ford Ikon as the 40-year-old divorcee was on her way home around 10 last night.        
	The duo, accomplices of her driver of two years, Lakshmipathi, then bundled her into another waiting car and drove away.         
	Soon after, Lakshmipathi, 29, called Vijayalakshmis father Shivaramaiah to say she had been kidnapped. He said he was coming to pick up her chequebook and credit cards.        
	Suspicious, Shivaramaiah called police. Officers waited at the familys house in Tilak Nagar for Lakshmipathi, who arrived around midnight. After being grilled, he confessed to having hatched the plot with three others. Vijayalakshmi, a mother of two, was rescued and the three arrested from a factory shed in Bommanahalli, 20km away, around 3am.        
	An attempt to kidnap Shivaramaiah and granddaughter Divya had failed four months ago. The police had suspected Lakshmipathi but the family said they trusted him.

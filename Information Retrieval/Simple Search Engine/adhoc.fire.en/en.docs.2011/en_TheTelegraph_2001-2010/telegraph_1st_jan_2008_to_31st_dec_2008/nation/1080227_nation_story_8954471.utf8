     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Chandigarh, Feb. 26: The CBI today arrested two senior Punjab police officers in a sex and blackmail racket.
    
	Additional inspector-general (security) Davinder Singh Garcha, a former hockey player, and Ropar superintendent of police Paramdeep Singh were held after the agency questioned some 100 people, including two dozen policemen.
    
	The Moga sex racket, unearthed last April, involved a collusion between police officers and a few women who allegedly extorted money from wealthy and influential people by threatening them with sex abuse cases.
    
	Two women accused, Manpreet Kaur and Manjeet Kaur, are in judicial custody. 
          
	The interrogation of the duo and former Moga station house officer Raman Kumar had provided some leads on the two officers, agency sources said.
    
	A CBI officer said more arrests were likely.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Wazwaan being served in Kashmir                                        
	Srinagar, Aug. 8: The economic blockade of the Valley has gobbled up a feast almost deemed sacred at weddings  the lip-smacking wazwaan.        
	Kashmiri weddings are deemed incomplete without wazwaan, made up of an assortment of preparations like gushtaba, rista, kebabs, tabakh maaz and rogan josh.         
	The blockade by Amarnath protesters in Jammu has starved the Valley of mutton, forcing cancellation of invitations and a rush for more austere wedding ceremonies.        
	Earlier, if there was scarcity of mutton, people would postpone weddings rather than solemnise them without wazwaan. But this time they are preferring simple marriages, said Zareef Ahmad Zareef, president of the Valley Citizens Forum, a group fighting social evils.        
	Ghulam Jeelani, manager of English daily Greater Kashmir, is flooded with requests for notices by families wanting to inform guests about cancellations. In last three days alone, we received over a hundred such notices and we are preferring them over other advertisements to help such families in this hour of crisis.        
	Many ingredients  other than mutton, wazwaan requires chicken and vegetables  come from other states, through Jammu, but the blockade means the highly popular fare is off the menu in some of the recent weddings.        
	Inayat Khan is one of those facing the effect of the supply squeeze. The 26-year-olds family in Srinagars Zakoora has had to withdraw invitations for his walima (the ceremony day after the wedding) on August 11 simply because they arent in a position to serve wazwaan.        
	The invitation cards were handed out a fortnight back. Some 500 guests were called for my walima and wazwaan for them would have required three quintals of meat. There is no mutton in the market. We have told guests through a paper the invitation is cancelled, Inayat said.         
	Personally, though, Inayat sees the cancellations as a blessing since he didnt want his wedding to be a lavish affair.        
	I had always preferred a simple marriage but had to bow before the wishes of my parents. The blockade has come as a blessing in disguise. Now, a handful of relatives will join us and they will be served kehwa (spiced tea). Only four people will accompany me on my baraat and kehwa is the only thing we will have at the brides place.         
	An average Kashmiri wedding needs four to five quintals of mutton, which means such parties Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh.         
	Some people can afford only a quintal or less. The affluent prepare wazwaan with several quintals. It depends on your wealth, said Riyaz Ahmad Khan, a local chef whose family is in the business for over a 100 years and whose legendary culinary innovations have earned them the queer epithet of shaitan waza (devil chefs).         
	But Khan is an angry man these days. Ten of customers informed me they had cancelled wazwaan. Two others said they are postponing their marriages, he said.         
	Some are getting tired of the lavishness and the food fetish in spite of the fact that many guests from outside Kashmir attend weddings largely to relish wazwaan.

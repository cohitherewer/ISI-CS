                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amar rubs topple salt into BJP wound 
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                          Amar Singh                                  
	July 6: Amar Singh was today quoted as telling a television channel that the BJP had approached him with a fresh proposal four days ago to topple the UPA government with the help of the Left and the BSP.        
	The BJP reacted with derision, terming the claim irresponsible and uncivilised.        
	According to a release by television channel IBN7, Amar said during an interview that the Samajwadi Party had rejected the proposal by BJP leader Jaswant Singh as it did a year back during the 2007 presidential elections.        
	At a news conference with L.K. Advani yesterday, Jaswant had said he had visited Amars house four days ago to see which way the wind is blowing in the Samajwadi Party.        
	The release said that when Amar was quizzed further on any communication between the BJP and the Left, the Samajwadi leader said he had no idea.        
	Asked about the comments attributed to Amar, BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said: We dont want to add dignity to his irresponsible statements by responding to them. The country knows Amar Singh with, or without, his statements. Rudy added that the outlandish statements were meant to conceal the Samajwadis private deal with the Congress.        
	The new controversy comes at a time sections of the BJP are uneasy at Jaswants disclosure in public yesterday that the leadership had a plot to topple the UPA during the presidential poll last July.         
	Away from the BJP fusillade in Delhi, Mulayam Singh Yadav arrived in Lucknow to reassurances that minorities wouldnt be hurt if he backed the nuclear deal.        
	Mulayam was told by his party colleagues that key minority bodies had backed his stand. One of them was Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, which said if the deal serves Indias interests, it will also do good for all, including Muslims.         
	Darul Uloom Deoband said the deal had nothing to do with Muslims. Some parties have linked the issue with Muslims for their own interests.        
	Support also came from Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, who wields considerable influence over Muslims in western Uttar Pradesh.

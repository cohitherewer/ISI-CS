                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bihar CM calls for communal peace
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, July 28: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today strongly opposed the attack on intelligence agencies and revival of Pota-like rules to counter terrorist attacks in parts of the country.        
	Attacking the intelligence agencies is not in the interest of the nation at this juncture, he said, adding: Its not desirable to discuss the Pota-like law either. Whats needed is communal harmony.        
	The chief ministers stand is different with that of BJPs Prime Minister in waiting L.K. Advani who strongly attacked the Congress-led government for repealing Pota during the Manmohan Singh sponsored trial of strength.        
	Advani and senior BJP leaders also attacked the central intelligence agencies in the wake of blasts.        
	It is not the time for us to fight among ourselves. We should be united and rise above politics to meet the challenges thrown by the disruptive forces. They are at work to impede the steady pace of development and progress. We can counter them when we maintain communal harmony, Nitish Kumar said.        
	Diversity is our strength. Disruptive forces are trying to exploit the diverse nature of our country to their ulterior advantage.        
	He clarified: If we fight among ourselves over issues created by them, we will do what they want us to do. We will fall in their trap.        
	Asked to comment on the formation of a new political front with the combination of the Left, Mayawatis BSP and regional forces, the chief minister said: Everyone has the right to form the front. But, I am committed to the NDA. I have nothing to do with a new front.        
	Nitish Kumar also expressed anguish over the Opposition stalling proceedings in the assembly for the second consecutive day.         
	What do you want? What is your issue? The government is ready to answer all that you ask during the question hour, the CM said, as an RJD-led Opposition trooped into the well stalling the House proceedings.        
	Nitish stressed that bedlam does not serve any purpose.        
	You must come up with questions on specific issues you wish to raise, rather than create pandemonium, he said to an unruly Opposition shouting anti-government slogans.

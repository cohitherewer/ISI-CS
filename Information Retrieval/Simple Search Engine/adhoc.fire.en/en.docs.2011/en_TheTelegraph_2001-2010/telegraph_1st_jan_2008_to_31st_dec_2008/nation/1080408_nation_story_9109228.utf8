	Islamabad, April 7 (PTI): Lata Mangeshkar would be happy if her songs improved relations between India and Pakistan, the singer has told a Pakistani channel.         
	Lata, who has never visited Pakistan, said she was once invited to perform there by the late Zia-ul-Haq but the show was called off at the last minute.         
	Everything was finalised and then the show was cancelled at the last minute. The organisers said they could not take responsibility for the show, she told the Dawn news channel last night.        
	When the interviewer told her a Pakistani writer had written a poem in which an Indian and a Pakistani in a tea shop stopped squabbling over Kashmir after the shop owner played a Lata song, she said: Aisa ho toh bahut achchha hoga (if this happens, it will be very good).        
	I would love to visit Pakistan but no one has invited me in the last 20 years. If someone invites me, I will come, Lata said.         
	Lata is working on an album titled Sarhadein (Borders), which features singers from Pakistan and India. We have recorded three songs so far, she said.        
	Pakistani singers Farida Khanum, Abida Parveen and Mehdi Hasan will sing solos for the album. Lata has a duet with Hasan.         
	The Pakistan Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, is a fan of Lata.

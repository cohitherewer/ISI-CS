          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Imphal, Oct. 19: A grenade exploded near Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singhs office-cum-residence this evening, half a kilometre from where the state police were celebrating their victories over insurgency.        
	The grenade, suspected to be of Chinese origin, went off on a road near the western gate of the chief ministers office complex in VIP Colony at 8.15pm.        
	Ibobi is in Delhi and is expected to return to Imphal tomorrow.        
	No one was injured but a passing car was partly damaged. As the grenade exploded just after the car had crossed the area, the police got suspicions. We chased the car and stopped it after 200 metres, an officer said.        
	The occupants of the car turned out to be a city businessman, Kulwand Singh, and his son. They said they were headed for the banquet hall of 1 Manipur Rifles, about 500 metres from the explosion site, where director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh was hosting a dinner. It was attended by several senior police officers and bureaucrats.        
	The police could not say if the chief ministers office, which has been attacked twice, was the grenades target. A CRPF officer posted at the office complex said the grenade could have fallen off a passing vehicle.        
	The police, however, said no other civilian vehicle or pedestrian had passed by immediately before the blast.

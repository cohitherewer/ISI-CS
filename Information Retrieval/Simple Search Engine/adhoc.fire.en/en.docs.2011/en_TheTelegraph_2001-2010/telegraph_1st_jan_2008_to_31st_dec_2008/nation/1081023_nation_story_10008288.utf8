          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Raj-Pawar      
	Mumbai, Oct. 22: Raj Thackeray slept at his Krishna Kunj home after spending a night in a dingy police lock-up, but the anti-migrant leaders worries are far from over.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief faces the prospect of fighting an estimated 25 cases lodged against him in six districts across the state by the Vilasrao Deshmukh government, which is under pressure from the Centre to act ahead of elections.         
	Amid the legal battle, divisions have surfaced within the ruling Democratic Front government of the Congress and the NCP on Raj.         
	Reports quoted NCP chief Sharad Pawar as saying there was no question of banning the MNS as it was a political party recognised by the Election Commission.         
	Late tonight, Maharashtra revenue minister Narayan Rane, a former Shiv Sena leader now with the Congress, said Rajs stance on the issue was okay but not his methods.         
	We will not let anyone fighting for the cause of Marathi people be isolated, PTI quoted Rane as saying. Rajs stance is all right but his methods are not.         
	Police sources said that while Raj has managed to get bail so far, the other cases have several stringent provisions invoking non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code and Damage to Property Act.         
	Also, the government said, the deaths of three persons in Kalyan in clashes triggered by the arrest of Raj had made their case stronger.         
	The deaths occurred last night after MNS workers in Kalyan had gone around Pisoli village forcing shops to shut. However, shopkeeper-brothers Omprakash and Jayprakash Dubey resisted, sparking a verbal duel with MNS activists. The quarrel led to a violent clash in which both the Dubeys and MNS worker Gurunath Bhoir were killed.         
	Sources said the manner in which the Kalyan police took the MNS chiefs custody on a transfer warrant immediately after he secured bail at the Bandra court yesterday was an indication of the government strategy of entangling Raj in a web of litigation.

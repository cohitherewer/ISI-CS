          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          DMK supporters gift of a spear and shield made of currency notes. (PTI)                                  
	Chennai, June 3: The fragrance of a fragile truce blew through M. Karunanidhis large household here amid a collage of memorable moments as the DMK patriarch and Tamil Nadu chief minister turned 85 today.        
	The day started with the Dravidian leader and his second wife Rajathi Ammal planting a sweet-smelling plant in the garden. Kanimozhi, his daughter by Rajathi Ammal, was also present.        
	The DMK boss later cut a huge 85kg cake as his first wife Dayalau Ammal, her sons M.K. Azhagiri, M.K. Stalin and M.K. Tamilarasu, and daughter Selvi looked on.         
	In the afternoon, estranged great-nephews Dayanidhi Maran, a former Union minister, and television magnate Kalanidhi Maran dropped in to complete the family reunion.        
	A huge digital banner put up near the DMKs Anna Arivalayam headquarters with all the Karunanidhi siblings smiling around the octogenarian leader said it all: that all seemed to be well with the ruling partys first family.        
	The gift-rain started early. Shawls, bouquets, fruits and other presents poured in as political leaders from across the spectrum, bureaucrats and party men gathered at the chief ministers residence and the party headquarters to wish him. Karunanidhi acknowledged every greeting, sitting patiently for hours, despite recovering from an acute back pain just a week back.        
	Among the top leaders who greeted him today were Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee called on him personally.        
	When Singh spoke to him over the phone this morning, Karunanidhi reminded him of a vexing problem  the stalled Sethusamudram ship channel project.        
	In the evening, national leaders like Mukherjee, the CPMs Sitaram Yechury and the CPIs D. Raja felicitated the DMK boss from a huge dais built like a ship.        
	The message was clear: the DMK wants the ship channel project  a 150-year-old dream of Tamils  to be completed.

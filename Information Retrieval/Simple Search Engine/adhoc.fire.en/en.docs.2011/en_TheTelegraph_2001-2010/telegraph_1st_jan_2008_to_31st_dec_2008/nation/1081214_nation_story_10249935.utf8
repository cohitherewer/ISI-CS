          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party supporters clash at a Pulwama polling booth. (PTI)                                  
	Wachi (Shopian), Dec. 13: The pen competed with the sickle here today and voting with violence elsewhere in Kashmir, as the Valley witnessed its first death on a polling day this election.        
	As people thronged the booths in Wachi, in south Kashmirs Shopian district, police firing killed a student and injured at least two dozen at Koil in neighbouring Pulwama.        
	About 57 per cent voted in the fifth phase of polling in the state, across 11 constituencies in three districts.        
	In Wachi, Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, inkpot and pen painted on her partys green flag, was locked in a tough contest with sitting MLA Khalil Naik of the CPM.        
	Along with Kulgam in Pulwama, Wachi had backed the hammer and sickle in 2002 but Mehboobas entry  the first time she is contesting outside her home district of Anantnag  has pepped up the fight.        
	Both Wachi and Kulgam have sizeable populations of separatist Jamaat-e-Islami sympathisers, who are believed to have largely voted for the communists.        
	Yes we support the Jamaat-e-Islami and azaadi, but Mehboobaji has promised us good roads, jobs and power, said Haji Abdul Khaliq Hajam, 70.        
	In Koil, hundreds of people chanting pro-aazadi slogans were on their way to a booth to disrupt polling when the forces stopped them. Clashes followed and the police opened fire, killing Muzaffar Ganai.        
	A police spokesperson said six CRPF men and eight police personnel were injured. The condition of two personnel is serious, he said.        
	Kashmirs divisional commissioner, Masood Samoon, said a magisterial inquiry had been ordered.        
	Protests continued in Koil till late in the evening. Protesters tried to lynch polling staff who were returning in the evening. They somehow saved their lives, an official said.        
	Another stone-throwing mob tried to capture a booth at Kiranabal, Pulwama, but dispersed when the security forces fired two rounds in the air.        
	Wachis CPM candidate said he was confident of victory. I do not know any Jamaat-e-Islami man but I have heard that they like us because we both strive for a corruption-free society, he said.

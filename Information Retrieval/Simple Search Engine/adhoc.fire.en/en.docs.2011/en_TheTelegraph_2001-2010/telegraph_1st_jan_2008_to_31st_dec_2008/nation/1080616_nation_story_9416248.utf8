	Mumbai, June 15: Police are investigating whether a road crash that killed matka don Suresh Bhagat on the outskirts of Mumbai on Friday was an accident or murder.        
	Bhagat, 52, who inherited the illegal gambling business from father Kalyan Bhagat, was killed along with six others when his Scorpio collided head on with a truck on the Alibaug-Pen highway.         
	He was returning to Mumbai from a court hearing in a narcotics case in Alibaug.         
	A month ago, Bhagat had written to the crime branch chief, joint commissioner Rakesh Maria, alleging that his ex-wife Jaya Chheda, estranged son Hitesh and henchmen of don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli could try to kill him over property disputes.         
	He had named Gawlis close associates Anil Pujari and Suhas Roge in the letter, a crime branch official said.         
	Matka is described as poor mans gambling.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Aug. 27: Magadh divisional commissioner K.P. Rammaiah today quizzed Magadh University personnel deputed in the establishment section of the varsity for investigations into the alleged appointment scandal.         
	The government had ordered an inquiry into the appointments following a call attention motion in the Assembly during the monsoon session. The issue was first raised by JD(U) MLA Jagdish Sharma at the university senate meeting.         
	The university establishment section officials washed their hands off the entire affair and told Rammaiah that the establishment section of the university was bypassing them when it came to appointments. Every action, they alleged, was being taken from the residential office of the vice-chancellor.         
	Rammaiah was further told that the establishment section did not have the details of the sanctioned posts in the constituent units of the university.         
	According to university insiders, the establishment section was kept out of the appointment business.         
	Earlier, the vice-chancellor was called in the commissioners office in connection with the inquiry in the matter.

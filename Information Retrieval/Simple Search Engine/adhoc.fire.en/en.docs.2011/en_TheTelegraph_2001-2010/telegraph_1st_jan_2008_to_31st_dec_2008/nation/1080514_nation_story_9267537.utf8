	Cuttack, May 13: Even as heat wave conditions continued in Cuttack, with power cuts adding to residents woes, collector Sujata Kartikeyan met district administration officials and legislators at the collectorate conference hall on Monday for a session.         
	At the hour-long meeting of the district natural calamity committee, Kartikeyan took stock of the condition of river embankments categorised as vulnerable.         
	Legislators alleged that lack of communication between officials and peoples representatives over development works, including embankment repair, led to worsening of a flood situation.

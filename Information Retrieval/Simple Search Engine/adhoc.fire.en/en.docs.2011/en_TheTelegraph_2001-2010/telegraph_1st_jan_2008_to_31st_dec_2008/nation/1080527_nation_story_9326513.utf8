          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Gujjars eat on a blocked railway track in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Jaipur, May 26: The Rajasthan government today tried to pass the Gujjar problem on to Delhis plate while pressuring the community to give up its agitation by blaming it for many of the 37 deaths since May 23.        
	No deaths or injuries were reported today but the four-day-old standoff continued with the Gujjars  an Other Backward Classes community demanding Scheduled Tribe status  blocking highways and squatting on tracks.        
	At a news conference addressed by four state ministers, the government said the Gujjars themselves were behind many of the 37 deaths and 45 injuries.        
	Health minister N.S. Rajvi said the medical reports on the 26 injured brought to Jaipurs Sawai Mansingh Hospital say that 13 had pellet injuries from country-made pistols and had been shot from the back.        
	Since the police do not use pellets, these injuries have been caused by the protesting Gujjars themselves. They are blaming the police but their medical reports show otherwise.        
	He said that by squatting with the bodies and not allowing either post-mortem or cremation, the protesters were trying to hide the cause of the deaths.        
	Chief minister Vasundhara Raje lobbed the ball to the Centres court by writing to the Prime Minister, urging him to call a meeting of states with large Gujjar populations and framing a policy on reservation.        
	The Gujjars leader, Kirori Singh Bainsla, has said he would not talk peace till the state writes to the Centre recommending ST status for his community. But Rajes letter is believed to have said that the National Tribal Policy 2006 doesnt allow ST status for Gujjars.        
	Despite this, minister R.S. Rathore said, Raje has urged Manmohan Singh to grant four to six per cent reservation to the Gujjars as a denotified tribe outside the ST category.        
	Denotified tribes are ones that were notified as criminal tribes by the Raj before the stigma was removed in independent India. Some of them are classified as ST while the rest fall under the Scheduled Caste or OBC categories.        
	The Gujjars today held bandhs in 35 places in their strongholds of Bharatpur, Dausa, Pali, Ajmer and Karauli districts. Reports said at least two buses were attacked and railway tracks uprooted in Dausa. The Jaipur-Agra highway was hit hard, and nine trains passing through the state were cancelled and others diverted.        
	The government has ordered TV news channels to be pulled off the air in areas of Bharatpur and Bayana.         
	Bainsla wants Raje to come to the protest site and hold talks but Rathore said the government was open to talks but could not go to the tracks.        
	Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh were detained on the outskirts of Bharatpur today while on their way to meet Bainsla. The police explained that these leaders could not be provided z-class security for the journey since most of the security forces have been deployed to tackle the Gujjar protests.        
	Twenty-six people had died during last years May 29-June 4 Gujjar agitation.

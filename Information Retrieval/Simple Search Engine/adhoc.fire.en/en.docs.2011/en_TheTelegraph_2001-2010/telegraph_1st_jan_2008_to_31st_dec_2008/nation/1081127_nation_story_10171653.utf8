          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Lack of co-ordination might have forced the Indian Navy to mistake a Thai fishing trawler for a pirate mother ship, the destruction of which has prompted Bangkok to seek a clarification from New Delhi.        
	Thailand has given a note verbale to the Indian mission in Bangkok seeking information and details on the circumstances that led to the INS Tabar firing at and sinking the trawler, Ekawat Nava 5, on November 18.        
	New accounts suggest the Indian Navy did not get information that such a vessel had been hijacked in the vicinity where the INS Tabar sank what it called a mother ship off Somalia last week. The naval operation has turned out to be an embarrassment because of a possibility that several crew members of the vessel might have been killed. At least 13 people are missing and presumed dead.        
	The world body that monitors piracy has defended Indias action but the warlike action stood out in sharp contrast with that of a British warship that decided not to engage the Thai trawler.        
	Sirichai Fisheries, the owner of the trawler, said it had contacted the International Maritime Bureau after getting messages from other boats in the region that the Nava 5 had come under pirate attack.        
	Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, the managing director of Sirichai Fisheries, said the company asked if any naval ships were in the area to help their boat. The British navy responded and sought information but later told the company that pirates had already boarded the ship and any sort of attack on them could cause harm to the crew.        
	The British navy instructed us to wait until the pirates contacted us, Wicharn said.        
	The maritime bureau then alerted the multi-coalition forces patrolling the region and other military agencies in the area, sending them photos of the vessel, Noel Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureaus Piracy Reporting Centre, said in Kuala Lumpur.        
	It was unclear if the Indian Navy had received the information because it has no direct communication links to the maritime bureau, he said. In Delhi, sources said the message did not get through to the Tabar.         
	We hope that individual navy warships will co-ordinate with the coalition forces or request information from us to avoid such incidents, he added.        
	However, he defended the Indian action. The hijacked Thai fishing vessel was (of) the same size and had all the hallmarks of a mother ship used by pirates in the African waters with heavily armed pirates on board when the Indian Navy tried to intercept the vessel and was attacked.        
	The Indian Navy insisted that the Tabar fired at the ship when it sighted gun-toting pirates on the deck and after the frigate was fired upon.        
	The navy chief, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, said the Tabar was operating within the rules of engagement to combat piracy. The rules of engagement obviously are that if you are threatened by someone, you take necessary action and that is how it is done by everybody.        
	All action to prevent piracy will be pre-emptive because once a ship has been hijacked by pirates, it is very difficult to take any action. That is where the lives of the hostages will be involved, Mehta said.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed deep condolences for the lives that might have been lost.         
	It must be kept in mind that the trawler was under the command of pirates. As for international law and practice, if pirates dont surrender and if a ship or vessel is sunk, it (the sinking of the ship) is perfectly within international law, Mukherjee said in Delhi.        
	Asked whether India would compensate for the loss of lives, he said: The international community should take concerted action against piracy.

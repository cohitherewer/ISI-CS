     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
                      
	New Delhi, March 3: One Bengal MP called another a murderer in Parliament today and was threatened with a slap.
    
	CPM member Mohammad Salim, angered by a taunt on Nandigram, accused the Congresss Adhir Chowdhury of murdering people in his home district, Murshidabad.
    
	Tumhara muh mein ek thappar marna chahiye (You deserve a slap on the face), replied a furious Adhir  recently acquitted in a murder case  perhaps choosing Hindi for maximum effect.
    
	CPM members rallied to their comrades defence, and the battle raged on before a stunned Prime Minister and an agitated Lok Sabha Speaker.
    
	If Manmohan Singh was worried about the renewed Congress-Left tension over the nuclear deal, he witnessed how local rivalry can upstage an issue that threatens to pull the government down.
    
	Salim, participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address, spoke of a link between the Trinamul Congress and Maoists in Nandigram, and asked the Prime Minister to rein in one of his cabinet ministers.
    
	The probable allusion to new Bengal Congress chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who has been hobnobbing with Mamata Banerjee, set his protg Adhir off. He got up to ask Salim if the 14 people killed in last Marchs Nandigram firing were Maoists.
    
	Salim responded by asking Adhir who the people he had killed in Murshidabad were. At this, Adhir flew into a rage and shouted that Salim deserved a slap.
    
	CPM members raised a ruckus, asking how an MP could threaten another with a slap in the House. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee tried to calm tempers in vain.
    
	Salim refused to carry on till the Prime Minister had reined in such lumpen elements in his (party) ranks.
    
	This provoked Adhir into repeating his threat. Ek thappar marne chahiye tumko. Tum MP ko House mein khooni bolega (You need to be slapped. You dare call an MP a murderer in the House)?
    
	Chatterjee had the unparliamentary expressions expunged, but they had already been beamed live across the nation.
    
	A promise from the Speaker to deal with the issue of physical threat finally calmed the Left down.
    
	Salim resumed speaking and did not hold back, reeling out instances of how the Centre had flouted the common minimum programme (CMP).
    
	He repeatedly taunted the government for its concern over how time (was) ticking away on the nuclear deal, asking if time was not ticking away on the pro-poor promises made in the CMP.
    
	The budgets promises in the social sector were meaningless, he said. The government would be judged by its common maximum performance.

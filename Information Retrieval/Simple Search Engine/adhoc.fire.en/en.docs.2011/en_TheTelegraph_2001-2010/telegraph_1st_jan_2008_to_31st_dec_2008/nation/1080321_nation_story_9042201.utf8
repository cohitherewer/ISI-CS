	Ranchi, March 20: The state government has announced a job for a relative of Bhrigu Pandey, who succumbed to his injuries in New Delhi last night due to burns he sustained while attempting self-immolation at the secretariat building on March 7.         
	While chief minister Madhu Koda made the announcement in the Assembly today, the leader of the Opposition, Arjun Munda, declared he would not celebrate Holi in protest against the ugly treatment being meted out to the agitating secretariat employees. Later, Koda also said he would not celebrate Holi.         
	With the governments negotiation with agitating employees demanding timely promotions and central government payscales yet to make a breakthrough, the Opposition sought to gain mileage from the development by stalling the House throughout the day.        
	Therefore, the budgetary demands of tourism, urban development, housing, energy and raj bhasha departments had to be passed without discussions.        
	As soon as the House assembled, the Opposition demanded a government statement on Pandeys death. The attack on a retired judge in Jamshedpur and the self-immolation bid by a CISF jawan in Ranchi added fuel to the fire.         
	Unable to restore order, the Speaker adjourned the House thrice.        
	Later talking to newspersons, Koda expressed his sympathy for the striking workers and said employment would be provided to the next kin of Pandey.         
	The state government would also bear the cost of his treatment. But he made it clear that his government would not succumb to pressure tactics. Munda, who flew in from New Delhi this morning, said all NDA MLAs would be donating one months salary to Pandeys widow as their daughter was to get married soon.

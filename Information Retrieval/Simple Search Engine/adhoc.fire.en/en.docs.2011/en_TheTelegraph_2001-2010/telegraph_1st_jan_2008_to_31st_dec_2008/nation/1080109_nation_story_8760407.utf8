                                                                                                            IT firms in the dark
          OUR BUREAU                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: Infotech companies that have projects in Malaysia said they had not heard of a ban on recruitment of Indians there.        
	We have not heard anything, said Tapan Bhatt, the human resources head of Wipro Infotech.        
	Satyam, which had opened a 500-seat Global Solutions Centre in Malaysia, is awaiting word from the consulate.        
	Given that our strategy has always hinged on local manpower, we do not anticipate it (a possible ban) will significantly hinder our expansion plans in this region, said Sucharita Palepu, who heads the talent management group in Satyam.        
	A TCS official said he had heard that the ban was applicable more to Malaysian companies that hire directly from India. We do not foresee any problem for the IT sector.        
	According to 2006 data, 55 Indian companies were operating in Malaysias Multimedia Super Corridor with investments exceeding $25 million.

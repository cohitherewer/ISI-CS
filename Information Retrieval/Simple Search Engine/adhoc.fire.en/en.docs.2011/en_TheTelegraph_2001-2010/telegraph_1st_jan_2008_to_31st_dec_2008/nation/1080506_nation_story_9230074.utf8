We need to diversify, he said, emphasising on the promotion of agro-based, food processing, leather, steel intermediaries, automobile and other related industries.

	The clear emphasis in the meeting was on the need for development of infrastructure to facilitate industrial investment in backward areas, as stressed on by the chief minister.         
	Naveen Patnaik suggested the upgradation of the NH-215 and construction of Ranchi-Vijaywada highway passing through the rebel-hit areas of Orissa.         
	The chief minister also urged the Centre for better rail connectivity for Malkangiri and incentives for entrepreneurs and traders in the KBK region.

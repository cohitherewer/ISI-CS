                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Final call on Prasar staff
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Group of Ministers on Prasar Bharati will tomorrow take a final call on whether the public broadcasters 40,000-odd employees would continue to be part of the central government.        
	An amendment to Section 11 of the Prasar Bharati act would mean that all employees, excluding those from the Indian Information Service and the Central Secretariat Service, would cease to be part of the central government and would be brought under the Prasar Bharati Corporation.        
	So far, the employees had been working on deemed deputation. The amendment will make them permanent employees of the corporation. It will also enable the corporation to frame its own rules and regulations for recruitment.         
	The GoM is also understood to be considering giving an option to employees to stay with the government or come under the corporations ambit.        
	Tomorrows meeting was convened in a hurry as the Supreme Court deadline for the government to decide on the matter expires next week.         
	Headed by home minister Shivraj Patil, the GoM comprises I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, finance minister P. Chidambaram, tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni, law minister H.R. Bhardwaj and communications minister A. Raja.         
	Most employees are believed to be against the amendment. Protesting employees had held a three-day relay hunger strike from March 26 this year in all state capitals demanding that either the corporation, set up in 1997, be scrapped or suitable amendments be made to the Prasar Bharati act so that they retained all the perks due to central employees. The employees had also marched to Parliament in April.         
	The National Federation of Akashvani and Doordarshan Employees wants the corporation wound up on the ground that the staff were getting a raw deal under it. For instance, they said, they were being denied allotment from the corporations accommodation general pool, and they could not avail themselves of the central government housing scheme either as the corporation was technically an autonomous organisation.         
	A survey conducted by the Akashdarshan Backward Classes Employees Association had found that 98 per cent of the employees in Delhi and Bangalore were against the amendment.         
	They believed that a government job would give them more security apart from the additional benefits provided to central employees.               
	For the Prasar Bharati Corporation, the amendment has several advantages. The move would give it absolute freedom with regard to its staff and a shield from government interference while deciding the posting of employees. Officials also feel the amendment would help them run the corporation in a more professional way.

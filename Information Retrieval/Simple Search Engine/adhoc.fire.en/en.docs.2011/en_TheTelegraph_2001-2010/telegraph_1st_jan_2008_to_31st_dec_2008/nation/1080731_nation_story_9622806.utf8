          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 30: The Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) on Tuesday demanded ban on export of iron ore claiming that unhindered movement of the ore out of the country would spell disaster for the indigenous steel industry.        
	The loss of iron ore advantage that our country has would put all investment at risk, while cost benefit of using domestic steel will also be lost, said Rajendra Prasad Singh, the vice-president of HMS at a conference held on Tuesday evening.         
	Singh said Indian steel makers had demanded some sort of control on the export of iron ore. Though the matter is stated to be under the governments consideration, a final decision is yet to be taken.         
	No country with such a large population and increasing per capita demand exports so much ore.         
	If growth in production is to be maintained at an average of 7.3 per cent over the next few decades, then Indias reserves will be wiped out in the next 30 to 40 years, Singh said.        
	The leader said export of ore in the last fiscal had gone up to nearly 60 per cent of the production from 44 per cent in 1997-98.

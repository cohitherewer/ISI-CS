  - Pak govt not so weak to bow to Indias demand, says front floated by founder                            Hafeez: In glare                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 5: Pakistan will not bow to Indias demand to hand over Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Mohammed Hafeez Saeed in connection with the Mumbai terror strikes, a front created by the leader has said.        
	The Pakistan government is not yet so weak that it would hand over its own citizens to India, said Abdullah Muntazir, a spokesperson for the Jamaat-ud-Dawa.         
	We condemn India for putting his (Saeeds) name on the list of terrorists.        
	The remarks come amid speculation in the Pakistan media that India is planning strikes on the Jamaat headquarters at Muridke on the outskirts of Lahore. Saeed is one of the 20 wanted criminals India has asked Pakistan to hand over.         
	The Jamaat condemned the strikes and denied links to militant activities. Its chief spokesperson, Yahya Mujahid, said his group only offered philosophical support to Kashmir militants.         
	Muntazir said an official of the Lashkars political wing, alleged to have been in touch with the Mumbai terrorists, was a central leader of the Jamaat. But the official has nothing to do with such acts, he added.        
	Indian officials have claimed that the names of several high-ranking Lashkar members were found in the satellite phones used by one of the attackers.         
	Indian and US intelligence officials have identified Lashkar operative Yusuf Muzammil as a mastermind. Yesterday, Indian sleuths named a well-known Lashkar veteran, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. Both names came up during interrogation of the lone surviving attacker, Muhammed Ajmal Muhammed Amin Kasab, Mumbai police said.        
	While Muzammil appears to have served as a control officer in Lahore, Lakhvi, the Lashkar operational commander, worked from Karachi, the sleuths said.        
	It appears that both men were in contact with their charges as they sailed to Mumbai from Karachi. They apparently monitored the attacks right through, directing the assaults and possibly providing information about the Indian police and the military response.        
	Some of the calls appeared to be conversations about which hostages to kill, according to an official who interviewed survivors and a report by security consultants.        
	While Indian officials have blamed Pakistani elements, terrorism experts and western officials have warned that the emerging sketch of the plotters was still preliminary and could broaden to include militants even within India.        
	Advani wanted        
	The Jamaat, in a statement on its website, said Pakistan should respond to Indias handover demand by seeking the extradition of the killers of thousands of Indian Muslims.        
	The wanted list includes BJP leader L.K. Advani, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and army officer S.P. Purohit, who is an accused in the Malegaon blast case.                    WRITTEN WITH AGENCY AND THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS

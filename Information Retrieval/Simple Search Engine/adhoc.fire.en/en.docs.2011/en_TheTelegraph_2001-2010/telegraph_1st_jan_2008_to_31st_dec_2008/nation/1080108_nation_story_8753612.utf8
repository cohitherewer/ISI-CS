     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Dhanbad, Jan. 7: The additional collector of Dhanbad, Birsa Orraiya, has sought a report from district officials on the land dispute involving Hemant Soren, son of UPA leader Shibu Soren. 
    
	The Telegraph had reported on January 4 how Soren Juniors claim of having bought a 2.3 acre industrial plot near Dhanbad was being challenged by the Miyan brothers who claim they are the rightful owners of the land and that they hadnt sold it to anyone.
    
	Orraiya expressed shock how the deputy commissioner (land records) of Dhanbad ordered the same plot to be registered in the name of Hemant when land records showed the plot as being mutated to the Miyan brothers Rahman and Kurban. 
    
	Former chief minister and leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda also joined issue and said he would ask the BJPs district chief to look into it.
    
	Arjun Munda said it was indeed a matter of very serious concern that two Muslims were cheated when Shibu Soren has persistently maintained his proximity to the minority community of the state.

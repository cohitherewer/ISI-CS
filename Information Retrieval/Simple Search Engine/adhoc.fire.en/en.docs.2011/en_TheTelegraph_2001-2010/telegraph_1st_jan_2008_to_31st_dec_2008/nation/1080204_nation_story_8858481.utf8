 - System engineer in US meets IIt aspirants

             Experience of a lifetime
                    
	Patna, Feb. 3: Super 30 fame mathematician Anand Kumar was in for a pleasant surprise yesterday when a system engineer from National Aeronautic and Space Administration (Nasa) met IIT aspirants of Ramanujam School of Mathematics.
    
	The institution, which has won accolades with sending 122 Bihar students, mostly from poor background, to IIT in the past five years, rose to welcome the Nasa system engineer with double pride with her Bihar roots.
    
	Anita Prasad, whose father had left Nawada in Bihar, told IIT aspirants last evening how her father had fought poverty and other odds to send her to higher studies and always kept her morale high. 
    
	She said: After completing my engineering, I went to United States and took up the Nasa job. I am associated with stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy project.
    
	She took up questions from confident Super 30 students on career and challenges abroad as well as on Indias sustained foray into academic and IT world. 
    
	Anita said: I had heard about Super 30. When I met Anand, I had decided to get the first hand experience of the institute being run at Kumhrar on the outskirts of Patna.
    
	Anita is on a trip to India and came to Patna to meet Super 30 students. Anand first met Anita in Califiornia, where he visited last year to attend American Mathematical Association Conclave.
    
	Anand told The Telegraph: I feel extremely humbled with Anitas noble gesture to come and talk to my students. She has presented a true model for students from weak socio-economic background. Kumar said Anita gave a fillip to students who knew a little about Nasa and only read about it in books and on Internet. Prasads roots in Bihar have further motivated students, said Kumar.

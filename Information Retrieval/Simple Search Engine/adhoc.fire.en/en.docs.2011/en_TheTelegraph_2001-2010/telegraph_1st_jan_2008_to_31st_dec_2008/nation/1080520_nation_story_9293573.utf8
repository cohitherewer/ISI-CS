	Mumbai, May 19: A cargo ship with at least 10 Indian crew members, including two Bengalis, has been hijacked 63km from Somalian capital Mogadishu.        
	MV Victoria, a Jordanian ship operated by a United Arab Emirates company, Marwan Shipping and Trading Co, was sailing from Mumbai to Mogadishu, carrying aid.        
	Sources said the ship had a crew of 23, including Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Kenyans, Somalis and Tanzanians. The Bengalis on board have been identified as cadet Uttam Bhattacharya and chief cook Iman Ghosh.        
	Jordanian authorities have told us that contact with the ship was lost at 8am on Sunday, Amman time, a top official in the directorate-general of shipping, Mumbai Circle, said.        
	The pirates approached the ship in three small boats and quietly boarded it. They then commandeered it towards the Hobyo region, 500km north of Mogadishu.        
	The official said the directorate was in touch with Jordanian authorities who were co-ordinating with the Danish embassy in Mogadishu for release of the ship and its crew. Denmark has an agreement with Jordan to protect Jordanian-flagged vessels passing or anchored off Mogadishu.        
	A month ago, the US and France had introduced a UN resolution that allows countries to chase and arrest pirates off Somalias coast.        
	While the directorate-general of shipping, Mumbai, is still trying to ascertain the exact number of Indians on board, the All India Seafarers Association said at least 10 of the crew members were Indians.        
	The ship left Mumbai earlier this month. It was carrying 4,200 tonnes of sugar donated by Denmark to Somalia as humanitarian aid, said Abdul Ghani Serang, general secretary of the seafarers association.        
	This is the second hijack bid on MV Victoria, Serang said.         
	Exactly a year ago, pirates had tried to board the ship outside the Somalian port of Merka. But the ship had been able to escape. Even then it was carrying humanitarian aid  4,000 tonnes of food for famine-stricken Somalia. A Somali coast guard died from wounds he received fending off the attackers after coming to the ships aid following an SOS.        
	Piracy is rampant along the 1,880-mile (3,000km) Somali coast, Africas longest and located near key shipping routes connecting the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. Somalian warlords and pirates frequently hijack ships and crew for ransom, often attacking vessels involved in humanitarian missions to their famine and clan war-hit nation.        
	Yesterdays hijack is the third in Somalian waters in the past five months. Somali officials say western companies embolden the pirates by paying ransoms that run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre throws spanner in Goa move to scrap SEZs
                                                                                                            Centre throws spanner in Goa move to scrap SEZs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The future of special economic zones in Goa hangs in balance with the Centre saying states cannot denotify SEZs and the Digambar Kamat government insisting that it would scrap them.         
	There is no provision under law (for states) to recommend de-notification. They have no locus standi to withdraw the notifications to the SEZs. We at the Board of Approvals will not denotify the SEZs either, commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said.        
	But chief minister Kamat told The Telegraph he was writing a letter to the Centre to denotify the SEZs.        
	He said the state government would go ahead with its decision to scrap all 15 SEZs, of which three have been notified and the rest are at different stages of approval.        
	We do not have any communication from the Centre on this. We will go ahead with our decision to scrap SEZs, the Congress chief minister said this evening.        
	Pillai said there should be no problem cancelling projects that had not been notified yet as the Centre would like to honour the sentiments of the state. Those projects could be shifted to another state, he hinted.        
	But SEZs that have been notified have become legal entities and cannot be de-notified, the commerce secretary said. The three SEZs  Ciplas Meditab Specialities, Peninsula Pharma Research Centre and K Raheja Corp  have already acquired land.         
	The promoters of the three notified SEZs may have to be compensated if Goa goes ahead with its decision  the first by any state government to abandon all SEZs.         
	Pillai said: Compensation is an issue that has to be decided between the developer and the state. We have nothing to do with it.        
	Duty-free equipment has also started coming in. In what manner will the state government compensate the developers?        
	Cipla has started work and pumped in about Rs 500 crore, sources said.         
	Kamat, however, said: Thats the amount being claimed to have been spent by the company.        
	Asked about possible legal battles over compensation, the chief minister said: We will see when that happens. I am not against SEZs. It is the people of Goa who are against SEZs and I have to go by their choice.        
	The Goa government had announced its decision on December 31 following protests by political parties, including the Congress and the Opposition BJP, against the tax-free industrial zones.        
	There have been protests against SEZs in several other states, including Bengal, Maharashtra and Haryana.        
	Bengal clearances        
	Twenty-eight SEZs, including three in Bengal, were approved today. The Bengal projects are being promoted by Capstone Developers Pvt Ltd, Bengal Shriram Hi-tech City Pvt Ltd and Orion IT Park Pvt Ltd.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 17: A parliamentary standing committee report has named Calcutta among five cities for starting Indias first maritime universities.         
	The committee on transport, tourism and culture, headed by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, also recommended setting up maritime universities in Mumbai, Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kochi.         
	The committees report was presented in Parliament today.        
	After examining the views of the stake-holders, the committee feels that one maritime university is not enough to serve the purpose of maritime studies and research. The committee, therefore, recommends that there must be one maritime university each in Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kochi with clear demarcated geographical jurisdiction, Yechury said.

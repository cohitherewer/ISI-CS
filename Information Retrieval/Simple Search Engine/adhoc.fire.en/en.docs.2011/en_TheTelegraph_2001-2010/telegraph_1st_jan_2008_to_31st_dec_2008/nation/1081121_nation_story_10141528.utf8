          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani: Means business?                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The leader who coined the India Shining slogan in the last general election is eager to appear different before the next electoral battle.        
	Prime Minister-in-waiting L.K. Advani today discussed the slowdown brought on by the global financial crisis with barons, warning them of an economic emergency if the situation wasnt tackled with determination, clarity of thought and creative approaches.        
	The suggestions from the captains of industry, invited by the BJP veteran to discuss the effects of the global financial crisis on India, could form part of the partys agenda for good governance, development and security, its main plank in the general elections months away.        
	I am concerned most about how the slowdown is affecting the poor. Even though I am concerned about the health of our airlines, I am more concerned about the economic wellbeing of our auto-drivers and rickshaw-pullers, Advani told the gathering that included Mukesh Ambani, Anil Ambani, Sunil Mittal, Rahul Bajaj, Sajjan Jindal, K.V. Kamath and Shashi Ruia.        
	Senior BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie, Vijay Kapoor and S. Gurumurthy were present at the meeting, held at Advanis residence over two weeks after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held talks with business leaders to limit the impact of the global slowdown.        
	Advanis speech was awash with politically correct metaphors like jobs, livelihood, rural economy and empowerment of weaker sections, with little mention of monetary measures and other finance jargons expected on such occasions. During my travels across the country, when I see work has stopped on half-complete projects, my heart goes out to the poor construction workers who have lost their jobs, he said, signalling his intent to snatch the aam aadmi plank from Sonia Gandhi.        
	Advani admitted being worried when he heard about IT companies halting recruitment or asking employees to go on a sabbatical with reduced salaries but stressed he was also concerned about those working in tea-shops and stationery stores who are more vulnerable.         
	The barons, who gave the BJP leaders a detailed account of the challenges in their industries, conceded that the loss of livelihood was a major problem. Advani thanked the industrialists for accepting his invitation, saying the meeting was the first of a series of consultations he had decided to have with representatives of different sectors of the economy such as agriculture, labour, small-scale industry, traders and consumers.                    
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate appeared a little wary of economic liberalisation, something his party has advocated and tried to follow in power. There is a massive change in the global opinion on the type of economic and financial model suitable to the world as a whole and also to different nations, particularly in the context of the experience of the last 15-20 years.

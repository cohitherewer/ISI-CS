          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 18: As Wall Street bleeds, the haemorrhage has begun in India. Four stockbrokers  three from Hyderabad  have ended their lives since yesterday.        
	A stockbroker couple allegedly blew up the gas cylinder at their Saidabad home, killing themselves and their one-year-old son last night, police said. A third broker reportedly jumped out of his third-floor office window in the city.         
	P. Upendra, 33, and his wife Swami, 28, had apparently suffered huge losses as NSE sub-brokers, possibly piling up debts.        
	The three were charred beyond recognition. It appears that the value of their investments had gone down to Rs 15 lakh, said a Saidabad police officer, quoting a suicide note found in the apartment.         
	It was not clear exactly how much they had at stake. But Harsh Kumar Gargia, a prominent city broker who knew them, said they had risen fast in recent years. The Upendras had Rs 25 lakh of their own invested besides Rs 75 lakh of their clients, he said.        
	The couple, who were from Warangal, were sub-brokers and agents for larger stock operators based in Mumbai.         
	The market slump in the past three days had driven them to desperation. The couple hadnt stepped out and kept their cellphones off, neighbours said, adding that they had seen the Upendras domestic help leave early yesterday.        
	The third suspected suicide was by Ganesh Bhat of Siddiambar Bazar. He was a regular trader on the BSE and the NSE and, like the Upendras, worked for Mumbai operators.        
	The market misery also seemed to have snapped nerves in Indore, where broker Ravi Sharma drank poison yesterday and died in hospital, the police told PTI.

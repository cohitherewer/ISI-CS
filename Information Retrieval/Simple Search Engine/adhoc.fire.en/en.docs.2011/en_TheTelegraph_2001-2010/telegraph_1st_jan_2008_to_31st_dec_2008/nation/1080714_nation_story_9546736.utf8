	Kabul, July 13 (PTI): India and Afghanistan today favoured targeting the bases of terrorist outfits and their financial links to root out the menace from the region.        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, in Kabul on a two-day visit to review security of Indian missions and workers in the wake of the suicide attack on the embassy last Monday, held talks with President Hamid Karzai.         
	During the 30-minute meeting, the two felt the strike was the handiwork of enemies of relations between the two countries.        
	Menon, who also met foreign minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, was assured that the Afghan government would do everything possible to protect Indian assets.        
	The two sides agreed that terrorism is a threat to both countries as well as stability and democracy of the region, foreign ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said.        
	Karzai and Menon agreed it was not enough to fight the symptom of terrorism, visible in Afghanistan, but to root out the menace from the region by targeting bases, recruitment places and financial links, Baheen said.        
	Among the 58 dead in the embassy attack, four were Indians, including defence attache Brigadier Ravi Dutt Mehta and senior IFS officer Vadapalli Venkateshwara Rao.        
	Spokesman Baheen did not say who the enemies of the relations between India and Afghanistan were but both governments have blamed Pakistans ISI for the suicide bombing.        
	Menon appreciated the solidarity shown by the Afghan government and people and conveyed Indias commitment to continue the reconstruction work in the country.        
	A memorial service, attended by foreign minister Spanta and Menon, was held at the embassy today for the victims.         
	Other than the missions, Menon is also discussing the security of the 3,000 Indians engaged in reconstruction and development work in the war-torn country.

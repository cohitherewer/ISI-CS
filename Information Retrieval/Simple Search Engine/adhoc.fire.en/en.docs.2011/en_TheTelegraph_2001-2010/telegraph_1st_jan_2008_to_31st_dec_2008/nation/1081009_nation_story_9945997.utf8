          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: A meeting between Christian leaders and the BJP today condemned the recent attacks on the minority community, stressing the need for an inter-faith dialogue and an end to forcible conversions.        
	The meeting, set up by Swami Chidanand Saraswati of Paramarth Niketan in Rishikesh, saw both sides slamming the Orissa and Karnataka violence. While the BJPs L.K. Advani termed the rape of an Orissa nun a shameful crime against humanity, the Christian leaders condemned the killing of VHP leader Laxmananda Saraswati that set off the violence.        
	A joint statement said both sides were unanimous that religious conversions or re-conversions  using coercive, fraudulent and allurement-based means or through denigration of other faiths  were condemnable and must be stopped. It resolved to support all efforts to restore peace and provide justice to the victims.        
	The meeting began on a bitter note with the Christian leaders complaining their small community was being targeted by a bigger one. They gave a detailed account of the attacks and alleged police had been mute spectators.        
	After hearing them out, the BJP leaders hit out against conversions and talked of the growing tendency to denigrate Hindu gods. They said all should exercise restraint and show respect to other religions.        
	The two sides agreed to initiate a sustained and sincere inter-faith dialogue.

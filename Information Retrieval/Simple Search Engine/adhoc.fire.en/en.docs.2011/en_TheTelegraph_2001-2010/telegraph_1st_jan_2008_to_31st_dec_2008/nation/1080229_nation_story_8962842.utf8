	Malda, Feb. 28: District authorities today stopped excavation by Visva-Bharati archaeologists who claim to have found a 1,300-year-old city in Amrita, about 10km from here.        
	The move followed a probe ordered after the Malda district heritage committee alleged that the researchers had not taken permission to dig and were taking away their finds.        
	They are not submitting to the district administration a list of what they have discovered. They are taking away everything, committee convener Pradyut Ghosh had written to district magistrate Chittaranjan Das.        
	Das said the excavators had been told to follow all the norms before further digging.        
	The excavation has unearthed several human skeletons and bits and pieces of pottery dating back to the eighth century.        
	The leader of the Visva-Bharati team, Moloy Kumar Sain, said the researchers had central government permission. However, since the district administration is raising objections, we are stopping work for now.        
	He added: We are making important finds dating back to the era of the Pala and Sena kings more than a thousand years ago.        
	Sain claimed his team had found the remains of a human settlement spread over 150 square miles.        
	Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Roy visited the excavation site today. Additional district magistrate Purnachandra Sheet said Roy did not meet any administration officials.        
	Officials said Roy had arrived on the Gour Express in the morning and left on the Kanchenjunga Express in the afternoon. The administration had arranged for his security.

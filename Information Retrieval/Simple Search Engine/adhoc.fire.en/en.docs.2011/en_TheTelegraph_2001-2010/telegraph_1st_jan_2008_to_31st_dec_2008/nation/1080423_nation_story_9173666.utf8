	Bhubaneswar, April 22: The heat wave sweeping across Orissa has claimed 28 lives forcing the government to close down schools a week before the summer vacations.         
	State records, however, refer to only four cases of death in this years summer spell.        
	The state has been reeling under the heat wave since past week. The mercury has hovered around 40 degree Celsius in the coastal belt, including cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, while in the Talcher-Angul coal belt temperatures have been recorded seven to eight degrees above normal  at 44 degree Celsius.         
	Director of Bhubaneswar meteorology centre S.C. Sahoo attributed the north-westerly winds to the heat wave condition. The humidity at the coastal Orissa and the dry air in western Orissa had made the situation worse, he added.         
	A senior officer at the state disaster management control room said reports of 28 alleged sun stroke deaths had been received. Out of it, four sun stroke deaths had been officially confirmed, following a joint inquiry by the health and disaster management departments. While two deaths took place in Angul, others were reported in the neighbouring Dhenkanal and Jajpur districts. The victims have been identified as Banambar Nayak and Gadadhar Nayak (both from Angul), Shyama Moharana (Dhenknal) and Khatrukari Sahu (Jajpur). Meanwhile, the government has announced an ex gratia assistance of Rs 10,000 to the family of each victim.

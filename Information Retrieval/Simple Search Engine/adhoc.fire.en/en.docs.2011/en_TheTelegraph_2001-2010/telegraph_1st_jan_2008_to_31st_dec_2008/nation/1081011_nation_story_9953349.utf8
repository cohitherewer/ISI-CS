The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Women vote Calcutta safest city at night 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Women vote Calcutta safest city at night

	New Delhi, Oct. 10: Working women have given Calcutta a Puja gift, voting it the countrys safest city in a survey by industry body Assocham.        
	Less than a fifth of women working in the Bengal capital feel unsafe while returning home after dark (see chart), despite many of them travelling by bus or train. In contrast, two-thirds of women feel insecure in Delhi even at the wheel of their own car at night.        
	If this comes as a fillip to the Calcuttans pride after the Singur blow, the flip side is the citys young women (and men) will, more than ever before, need to look for jobs in less safe cities after the Nano pullout.        
	The survey included women who work late hours in their daytime jobs as well as those who work night shifts  for instance, at BPOs or airports  and return in the small hours.        
	Assocham found that although women faced more commuting problems in Calcutta and Mumbai compared with Delhi or Hyderabad, the first two cities were considered safer by a mile.        
	Akansha Das, an IT professional in Delhi, said: I cant even count how many times I have been harassed while driving. Once two men on a bike tried to pull me out by the hair while my car was moving.        
	On September 30, a TV journalist, Soumya Vishwanathan, was shot dead early in the morning in her car a few metres from her home in south Delhi.        
	Now my family is too scared to let me drive back home alone, so I have to ask a friend for a lift if the office car isnt available, Akansha said.        
	The problem is that while we are all worried about driving back home alone at night, we cannot cite that as an excuse to opt out of night shifts. The weeks I have night shift, I am stressed the entire day, said Sujata Nair, a BPO worker in Bangalore, the second-most unsafe on the list.        
	Across the country, 53 per cent of working women feel unsafe commuting at night, the survey reveals.         
	Assocham has hinted that all companies may not have fully implemented the enhanced cab security drills it had recommended after Bangalore BPO worker Pratibha Srikant Murthy was raped and killed by a pool-car driver in December 2005.        
	The government should make it mandatory to install the global positioning system (GPS) in cabs used not only by BPOs but also other industries employing women on night shifts. Because of inadequate transport arrangements by employers, 86 per cent of women face commuting problems at night, Assocham secretary-general D.S. Rawat said.

	Mumbai, Nov. 8 (PTI): Health and family welfare minister Anbumani Ramadoss has turned his attention to junk food, alcohol and drugs after banning smoking in public places.        
	Apart from tobacco consumption, junk food, alcohol and drugs are also adversely affecting the health of the nation. They need to be regulated on a priority basis, he said today during a foundation stone-laying ceremony on the JJ Hospital campus here.         
	There is a serious impact on health of young India because of these four elements. Even parents are unaware of the seriousness of the adverse impact on their children because of these. We need to create awareness about it.        
	Ramadoss also appealed for public participation to enforce the smoking ban more effectively across the country.        
	India is facing shortage of staff in terms of doctors and nurses. The Centre is exploring all possible ways to improve the health service in rural and urban areas, he said.        
	Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh drew the attention of Ramadoss on the need of government medical colleges in the city.         
	The private medical institutes are charging exorbitantly.... Only students from the elite class can afford them. But there are many aspirants from middle class and lower middle class families, he said.

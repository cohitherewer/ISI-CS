          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, May 22: Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh would start warming up for the ensuing Assembly elections from tomorrow.         
	In a move to propel party cadre towards an election mode, Singh is starting a rath yatra based on a Gujarat model from Friday. During the six-phased yatra, Singh will address as many as 1,200 public meetings from the rath  Vikas (development).         
	This (yatra) is only a warm up to the Assembly polls due in November 2008, as the real battle lies ahead, said Singh, before leaving for Dantewada, the hotbed of Maoist movement, from where his chariot would rollout. The Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, L.K. Advani, will flag off the yatra. The chief minister will visit all the 90 Assembly constituencies and address at least a dozen public meetings in each segment.         
	As the chief minister, I want to hold a direct dialogue with the people to find out the governments performance, Singh said, adding that which was not possible when one travels in a chopper. Singh clarified that his travel was not aimed to note down the strength (read vote bank) of the Opposition or set his house (party) in order. In the trip, Singh would be reviewing works that have been completed and launch new ones.

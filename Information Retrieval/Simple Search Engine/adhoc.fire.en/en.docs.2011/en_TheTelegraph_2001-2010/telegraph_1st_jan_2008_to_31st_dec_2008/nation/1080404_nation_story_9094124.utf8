	New Delhi, April 3: China today increased pressure on India even after foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee asked the Dalai Lama and Tibetan activists not to mar relations between New Delhi and Beijing.         
	Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi telephoned Pranab Mukherjee and briefed him on the situation in Tibet. India restated that it considers the Tibet Autonomous Region part of China.         
	Beijing asked for Delhis cooperation on Tibet despite Mukherjees public warning to the Dalai Lama on Tuesday. Mukherjee asked him not to raise issues that could tell on bilateral relations in an effort to silence him.         
	The foreign minister told Yang, his counterpart, that India would not allow Tibetans to engage in anti-China political activities, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said.         
	However, in Delhi and elsewhere, peaceful demonstrations by Tibetans continued. Activists lit candles and held a meeting at Jantar Mantar, the capitals venue for public protests.         
	The Chinese foreign ministers call is the third high-level contact in a week initiated by Beijing in the wake of the protests and crackdown in Tibet and its nervousness about the Tibetan cause casting a shadow over the Olympics.         
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Indias ambassador to China Nirupama Rao were similarly briefed by their counterparts.         
	The Chinese foreign minister expressed his confidence that the passage of the Olympic torch through India would take place smoothly, an external affairs ministry statement said.         
	Mukherjee told him that India will take necessary measures to ensure that the passage of the Olympic torch is a success. Mukherjee also said the Dalai Lama is a religious and spiritual leader, implying that the leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile was not expected to be involved in politics while he continued to be a guest of India.         
	Yang told Mukherjee that the Chinese government appreciates the steps taken by the Indian side to ensure safety and security of Chinese diplomatic and consular establishments and Chinese citizens in India, the external affairs ministrys statement said.         
	Tibetan protesters had scaled the walls of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi on March 21.         
	Mukherjee and Yang also discussed Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Beijing in January.

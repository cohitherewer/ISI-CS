          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 30: One body of a Greyhound police force jawan from Andhra Pradesh was found today following intensive search operations in and around Balimela reservoir with the help of divers from the navy.        
	Malkangiri superintendent of police S.K. Gajbhiye said one body was recovered. But it was yet to be identified.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police (south-western range) Sanjib Panda said the body was found near the site of the mishap. So far, 29 persons had been rescued and 36 more were missing.        
	Gajbhiye said the search and rescue operation was going on with the help of naval divers. We have been able to identify the place where the boat ferrying the Greyhound jawans capsized and efforts were on to retrieve the vessel, he said.        
	The motorboat, Balimela, belonging to water resources department, capsized near Alampekka inside the 40m deep reservoir yesterday. It was suspected that the missing jawans were trapped inside the boat and some bodies might be recovered after it was retrieved.         
	The operation was being conducted on the basis of inputs received from the rescued boat staff, Santosh Sethi and Manoranjan Dey, and constables Tapan Mohanty and Ranjan Khara.        
	Sethi, the boat helper, said: We had travelled around 5km and were passing through a narrow passage when there was firing from atop the surrounding hills. The police personnel aboard the boat retaliated and there was exchange of fire for some time. But the boat capsized and we were drowned, he recalled.         
	Sethi, however, failed to remember how long he was in the water and how he was rescued.        
	Additional director-general of police Prakash Mishra said one missing Orissa police personnel was found in the forest during search operation this morning and hoped that some more might be in the jungle.         
	Search operation was also on in the forest surrounding the 61km-long and 70m high dam, said Mishra, adding that two naval helicopters were engaged in the operation.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of the personnel missing or dead.         
	The government would bear all expenses for the treatment of the injured persons.         
	Patnaik said of the 66 persons aboard the boat, 29 had been rescued including two Orissa police personnel and two boat staff.

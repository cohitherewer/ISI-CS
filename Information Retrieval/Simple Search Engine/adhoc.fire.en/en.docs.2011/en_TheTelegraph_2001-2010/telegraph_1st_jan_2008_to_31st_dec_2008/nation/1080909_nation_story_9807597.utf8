	Srinagar, Sept. 8: A Hurriyat team will travel to Muzaffarabad for talks on cross-LoC trade less than a month after eight marchers to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir died in police firing.        
	The decision, taken today, marks the separatist bodys bid to take the legal path to starting the trade after its August 11 procession was foiled, with senior leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz among those killed in the firing.        
	Todays Hurriyat move follows an invitation from the PoK government for the trade talks. The Hurriyat will apply for travel papers for its delegation, to be made up mostly by traders, which will discuss the modalities of the trade, moderate leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said.        
	State chief secretary S.S. Kapur has already said the Centre is ready to send a team of traders across the LoC or host one from the other side, whichever is acceptable to Pakistan.        
	Todays Hurriyat decision came as protesters clashed with the police for the third consecutive day on the streets. Over 100 people were injured, including six in firing by the security forces. Of them, six are critical.        
	The Hurriyat team is expected to leave for Muzaffarabad within 10 days. Before that, another Hurriyat delegation will travel to Delhi to discuss the matter with the Pakistan embassy.        
	We have accepted the invite from the azaad (free) J amp;K government. We will soon form a delegation of traders. They will apply for travel documents, the Mirwaiz said.        
	He stressed, however, that the cross-border truck service for traders should not be symbolic, like the movement of passengers across the LoC now. Only a handful of families can travel on what is virtually a skeletal bus service.        
	The separatists also want an alternative route in case the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road is closed for some reason. Another demand is that the paperwork should be reduced, with visa documents done away with.        
	Trade across the divided state will only be possible if the movement is free. The state-subject certificate (under Article 370) should be sufficient to cross over, and we want a viable alternative road for trade, the Mirwaiz said.        
	Two days ago, a central team had surveyed the feasibility of opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakote roads for LoC trade.        
	Chief secretary Kapur has promised facilities for such trade at Salamabad in Uri in three to four weeks. More land was being acquired for a modern custom checkpoint there, he said, adding that a similar facility was being set up in Chakan da Bagh in Poonch.        
	The Valley today observed another shutdown against plans to hold elections and Saturdays death of a youth in police action. In Delhi, the Election Commission held a meeting with parties to set the dates for the polls, due later this year.        
	A police shake-up was ordered today that saw Kashmir police chief S.N. Sahai being replaced with B. Srinivas.        
	The separatists today threatened a jail bharo if the government did not stop the arrests and harassment of Kashmiri youths.        
	The government is arresting people for participating in the recent marches. But they should know that lakhs of people joined the rallies. The government would better arrest all of them, the Mirwaiz said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today ruled out hasty action against Pakistan but warned that India was not satisfied with its show of arrests and raids on suspected militant camps.        
	The unambiguous message to Islamabad came with a stinging retort to President Asif Ali Zardaris claim that the militants who attacked Mumbai last month were non-state actors.        
	Were these non-state actors from heaven or a different planet, Mukherjee asked in Parliament as he urged the Pakistan government to act.        
	Non-state actors are operating from a particular country. What we are most respectfully submitting, suggesting to the government of Pakistan: Please act, the veteran leader said. Mere expression of intention is not adequate.        
	Mukherjee said terrorism was not a problem that could be switched on or off and had to be dealt with patiently. But he talked of resolute action and warned that Delhi would not let Pakistan off the hook this time.        
	Adequate pressure is being built on Islamabad we cannot change our neighbour but we cannot even live in perpetual tension, he told the House.        
	Mukherjee said Pakistans move to detain some militants was not enough.        
	We have seen this show of arrests and raids on terror camps after the (December 2001) Parliament attack, too. But what happened? We want them to follow up on these actions and take it to logical conclusion by dismantling the outfits completely, he said.        
	They ban one outfit and another springs up with the same faces, same agenda and only different signboards. How does it help us?        
	The minister said India had been demanding at meetings at different levels that Pakistan hand over wanted terrorists, and the list included 40 people, not 20 as reported.        
	We have given them lists of 40 people not 20 we have also pointed out that their denial is not going to resolve the issue, he said.        
	He also sent a firm message to those raising the Kashmir issue to rationalise terrorism in India. Cross-border terrorism is not an India-Pak problem. This has nothing to do with Kashmir. Dont give us general, straightjacket formula, he said.        
	Nobody will be allowed to play with our territorial integrity, nobody should dare to attack us.        
	Mukherjee also slammed Pakistan for creating a war hysteria on the basis of a hoax call about an impending attack by India.        
	He said it was worrying that the Pakistani establishment believed such a call can be made and spread a canard about a possible attack by India. Everybody knows such calls are fixed and nobody can directly call the President or the Prime Minister.        
	The minister also saw method in the attacks on Jaipur (a tourist centre), Bangalore (a science and technology hub), Ahmedabad (an industrial hub), Delhi (the countrys political capital) and then Mumbai (the commercial capital).        
	He defended Indias decision to move the UN Security Council, arguing that cross-border terrorism had international dimensions.  
	 lsquo;FITTING REBUFF rsquo;  
	Highlights of the Prime Minister rsquo;s speech in Parliament after a debate on the Mumbai terror attacks  
	On behalf of thegovernment, I would like to apologise to our people for the fact that these
  dastardly acts could not be prevented.  
	But it is important to ensure that the memory of their sacrifice does not get dimmed with the passage of time. The scourge of terrorism has to be, and will be, fought with determination. All means and measures needed for this purpose will be utilised.  
	Several heads of state and government have spoken to me in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Each one of them praised India for demonstrating restraint. They agreed that strong action should be taken against those responsible for these acts. I conveyed to them that we could not be satisfied with mere assurances.  
	We have so far acted with utmost restraint. But let not our commitment to civilised norms be misconstrued as a sign of weakness. Every perpetrator, organiser and supporter of terror, whatever his affiliation or religion or location, must pay the price for such cowardly and horrific acts against our people.          
	We need to recognise as a nation that we cannot depend on either of these two approaches for obtaining the outcomes that we desire. The Mumbai incident has
  highlighted gaps in our preparedness to deal with these kinds of assaults. We need to equip ourselves more effectively to deal with this unprecedented threat and challenge to our country rsquo;s integrity and unity.  
	The terrorist attacks in India have tried to sow communal divide in the country and weaken our polity and our social fabric. We have emerged stronger with every challenge, and will do so again. I have no doubt that the Mumbai attacks will also fail in their
  nefarious designs. All political parties have an obligation to unite against communal hatred and discord. We cannot fight and win this war against terrorism if we are a divided house.  
	I wish to say that it is in times of adversity that the true mettle of a nation is tested. We must remain calm and be resolute. We should stand firm as one nation and one people to meet this challenge posed by terrorism. We will give a fitting rebuff to our enemies. The idea of India as a functioning democracy and a pluralistic society is at stake. This is a time for national unity and I seek your co-operation. Truth and righteousness are on our side and together we shall prevail.

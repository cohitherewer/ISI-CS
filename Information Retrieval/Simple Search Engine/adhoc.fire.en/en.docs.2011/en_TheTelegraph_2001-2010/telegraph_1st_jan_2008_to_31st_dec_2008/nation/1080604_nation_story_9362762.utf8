          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 3: The countrys best political brand needs an ambassador.        
	In other words, a higher sales pitch if the Congress has to look like a winner.        
	The recommendation is among a host of others that senior leader M. Veerappa Moily has come up with in a report on behalf of the future challenges group, which he heads.        
	Moily said while the Congress was the countrys best political brand, it needed to be packaged better.        
	The report  discussed at a meeting attended by, among others, Rahul Gandhi  is expected to be submitted to party chief Sonia Gandhi shortly.        
	Asked what brand Congress meant, a source said: Plurality, diversity, inclusion, secularism, social justice and economic growth with a human face.        
	The Congress, the source added, was still the only party with a pan-Indian base. For all its claims, the BJP is non-existent in large parts of the Northeast and Kashmir. The Congress is a microcosm of India.        
	Another recommendation was making the Congress a cadre-based party with an ideological underpinning and reviving dormant wings like the Seva Dal which used to be active in elections.        
	The report also called for giving more respect to elected members instead of treating them like gate-keepers.        
	One grouse the partys Lok Sabha MPs have is under-representation in bodies like the working committee. The panel, the Congresss highest decision-making body, has five Lok Sabha members, including Sonia and Rahul, as against the 13 from the upper House who include Manmohan Singh, A.K. Antony, Shivraj Patil and Ahmed Patel.        
	At Saturdays CWC meeting, a Lok Sabha member had raised this point. He stressed that it was because the decision-makers from the Rajya Sabha were disconnected from the masses, the party couldnt firm up its stand on critical issues like the demand for a separate state and caste-based reservation.        
	The report has suggested finalising candidates well before elections so that they have time to understand and nurse their constituencies. It has recommended better booth management by reviving Nehrus plan of 10 youths for every booth, which, a source said, the BJP had borrowed and fine-tuned to near-perfection.        
	Another suggestion was media management and creating the atmospherics before an election so that the Congress looked like a winner and not a loser from the word go.        
	The report also called for transparency in functioning. A section of the Congress feels the party should shed its ad hoc style of working and, like the BJP, adopt a more scientific approach to elections.

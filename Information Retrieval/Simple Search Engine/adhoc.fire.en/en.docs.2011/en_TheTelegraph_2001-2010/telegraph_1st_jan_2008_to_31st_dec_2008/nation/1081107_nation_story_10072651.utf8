          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 6: Orissa High Court yesterday asked Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Aparajita Sarangi to explain within the next fortnight why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against her for skirting disposal of garbage at Bhuasuni on one pretext or the other despite several court directives.         
	The notice was issued after BMC counsel B.K. Das submitted an affidavit on Wednesday stating hindrance in the way of lifting all garbage from the temporary dumping yards in the state capital to Bhuasuni on the outskirts of the city.        
	The affidavit said BMC disposes nearly 450 metric tonnes of garbage everyday.         
	Transporting them to Bhuasuni requires Rs 3.60 lakh per day, entailing an annual expenditure of Rs 12.96 crore. The garbage carrying vehicles with three metric tonne capacity have to make at least 150 trips to Bhuasuni. The current transportation cost per trip is Rs 2,400.         
	Besides, an estimated Rs 2.5 crore is required for construction of an approach road and boundary wall of the dumping yard, the affidavit explained, pleading non-availability of such huge funds with the civic body.         
	But the two-judge bench of Justice L.K. Mohapatra and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty, which was hearing the matter, was not impressed.         
	It expressed displeasure and wondered why the civic body failed to foresee such financial implications when land was allotted for the purpose at Bhuasuni and inform the court about it during previous hearings over the past six months.         
	The court, however, directed the state government to provide Rs 40 lakh immediately to enable BMC to cover expenditure for 15 days and take a decision as to how further funds would be passed on to the civic body for the purpose.         
	The matter would be heard next on December 19.        
	The high court has been pressing for dumping garbage at one point at Bhuasuni since August 2007, while monitoring solid waste disposal in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar as part of a PIL.         
	We are unable to understand why the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has taken the orders of this court so lightly, the high court had observed on August 28, while issuing fresh directions for disposal of garbage at the dumping yard at Bhuasuni.

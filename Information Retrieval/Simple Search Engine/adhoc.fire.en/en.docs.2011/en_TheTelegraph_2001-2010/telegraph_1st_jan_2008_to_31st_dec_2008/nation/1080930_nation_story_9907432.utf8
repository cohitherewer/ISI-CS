The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, BJP not same: Karat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cong, BJP not same: Karat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prakash Karat                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Prakash Karat has drawn a nuanced distinction between the Congress and the BJP, saying it was wrong to say there was no difference between the two parties.         
	The subtext was if the CPM had to choose between a bad Congress and a communal BJP, it would have to be the former.        
	Asked if the BJP and the Congress were two sides of the same coin on the minority issue, the CPM general secretary said: Thats a wrong approach to say theres no difference between the Congress and the BJP.        
	As the Left-Congress contradictions over Indias strategic collaboration with the US deepened, sections of the CPM put imperialism on a par with communalism to buttress the partys ideological build-up.        
	Political observers, however, believe that with the recent rise in communal violence, this ideological thesis might get watered down.        
	Asked if he would consider backing the Congress after the 2009 elections or do business with it for the secular cause, Karat said: 2004 is not going to repeat itself. But definitely this time, our slogan will be defeat the BJP and communal forces and we do not want a strategic alliance with the US. If we have to support a government, we have to bring these factors together.        
	Karat, however, ruled out an immediate rapprochement with the Congress, keeping a small window open for the regrouping of secular forces after the next Lok Sabha elections.         
	He was circumspect about the non-BJP, non-Congress alternative that he had unveiled with much aplomb after the Left withdrew its support to the UPA government, lost an ally in the Samajwadi Party but picked up a weightier one in the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	In an interaction with members of the Indian Womens Press Corps, Karat was asked about a meeting he had addressed on attacks on Christians and if he had said the Left was ready to align with the Congress to combat communalism.         
	I made the point that the problem (the Hindu-Christian divide) was there to stay. This kind of deep communalisation requires to be fought with sustained effort, Karat said.        
	But he clarified that given the present political alignments, it was difficult for all the parties to come together. So, its better to create a platform on which people from various parties and organisations can come together, he said. In that context, I said I do not rule out the Congress.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi tells off Vatican
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: India has conveyed its displeasure to the Vatican for commenting on the attacks on Christians in Orissa, but has not reacted to its envoy being summoned by the Italian foreign ministry.         
	Delhi condemned the attacks but conveyed to the Vatican that its an internal law and order situation and that Indian democratic institutions and the government were capable of dealing with it, sources said.         
	This was conveyed to the representative of the Holy See in Delhi, Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana, by foreign ministry officials.         
	Archbishop Quintana met Indian officials last week after the Vatican issued a statement expressing concern over the attacks on Christians and others as a sin against God and humanity.         
	A spokesperson for the Vatican embassy said: We have no comments to make on this.         
	The spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, the apex body of Catholics, Fr Babu Joseph, said today: I am not commenting on what happens at the diplomatic level. But whats happening in Orissa is a systematic and planned attack on Christians. And this targeting of Christians and their institutions cannot be dismissed as merely a law and order situation.         
	The Italian foreign ministry had summoned the Indian ambassador in Rome, Arif Shahid Khan, on Monday to express its deep concern and sensitivity regarding the recurrent episodes of inter-religious violence, a statement on its website said.         
	It added that the ministry was hopeful that the firm measures already adopted by the Indian authorities  fully illustrated by Ambassador Khan  are successful in quelling the violence and reinstating dialogue and mutual respect between the various segments of Indian society.         
	Delhi has yet to respond to this. Sources said there was a technical problem  the foreign ministry cannot summon the Italian envoy to convey Indias position because the new ambassador, Roberto Toscano, has not presented his credentials yet.

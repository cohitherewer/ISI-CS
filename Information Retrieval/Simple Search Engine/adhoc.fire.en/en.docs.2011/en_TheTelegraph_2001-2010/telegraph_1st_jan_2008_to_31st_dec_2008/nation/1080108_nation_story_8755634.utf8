	Lucknow, Jan. 7: Sugarcane growers in an Uttar Pradesh district are suspected to have poisoned at least 50 jackals, a protected species under the wildlife act, for damaging crops and biting villagers while foraging for food.
    
	Wildlife officers said most of the carcasses were found scattered in a sugarcane field in Keshavpur, a village 20km from Dudhwa National Park in Lakhimpur-Kheri district.
    
	Twenty-three more were found buried elsewhere, said divisional forest officer K.K. Singh.
    
	The minimum punishment for killing a jackal, a Schedule (II) animal under the Wild Life Preservation Act, is jail for three years. An animal listed under this category is considered endangered, but not critically so.
    
	According to 2002 figures, jackals in India number around 4,300, most of them concentrated in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Chhattisgarh.
    
	Forest ranger S.K. Tiwari said the villagers were upset because the jackals were wreaking havoc in their fields.
    
	He said the common complaint, in this man-animal struggle for survival, was the jackals ate up growing sugarcane plants and damaged the crop.
    
	Another complaint was the animals often strayed into human habitation.
    
	Tiwari said villagers in the district, 175km from Lucknow, had told him the jackals would raid cane-crusher units that come up near the fields in winter when jaggery-making starts.
    
	He said many of the villagers had complained that the animals would bite workers, make a mess of the cane-crushing units and run off with chicken, kept as food for the jaggery makers.
    
	Sources in the wildlife department said some villagers working for a crusher unit in the area might have buried the jackals after poisoning them.
    
	Investigations by wildlife officers have so far revealed that the owner of a crusher unit, Santosh Kumar Verma, had mixed poison in molasses and kept them in small containers in his sugarcane fields.
    
	Once a jackal had tasted the poisoned bait, it was a matter of hours before it fell to the toxin.
    
	Forest officials said jackals had been dropping dead over the past three days. They said the villagers reported the matter to wildlife officials when the carcasses began to rot.
    
	We have registered a case against Santosh Kumar Verma but he is absconding, said divisional forest officer Singh, adding Vermas cane-crusher unit had been sealed.
    
	Samples from the carcasses have been sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, for viscera tests.
    
	Samples of the poisoned molasses have been sent to the Indian Chemical Laboratory in Pune.
    
	Last month, at least 17 gharials, a protected species of fish-eating crocodiles, were found dead on the banks of the Chambal river in Etawah district, raising fears of a mystery disease.
    
	A senior state wildlife officer said water contamination could be a reason as the gharials  moved from the endangered to the critically endangered category by the World Conservation Union  had no injury marks.
    
	The deaths kicked up a row amid allegations that wildlife officers were not doing enough to protect threatened species.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 8: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said that the results of the Assembly polls in five states would have no bearing on the Lok Sabha polls due next year.        
	There is no need to be either excited or anxious about the results of the polls, Nitish said, adding: There will be different situations during the Lok Sabha polls.        
	He said that the UPA government had failed to live up to the expectations of people. The rise in price of essential commodities and the manner in which the civil nuclear deal with the US was carried out will be the Lok Sabha polls issue, he said, describing the central governments decision to bring down the prices of petrol and diesel as a political drama.        
	He said that the electorate in five different states had voted in the context of different local situations prevailing in those states. The JD-U and BJP have been in alliance in Bihar for many years. The alliance has done well in the past. It will do well again in the coming polls, he said.        
	Asked if terrorism would be an issue in the Lok Sabha polls, Nitish said: Terrorism is a global issue and should be addressed globally.        
	Bihar Congress president Anil Sharma said that the results had dealt the death knell to the agenda on which the communal BJP was trying to ride to power. Sharma said that Rahul Gandhi campaigned intensively in the states where the Congress came with flying colours.

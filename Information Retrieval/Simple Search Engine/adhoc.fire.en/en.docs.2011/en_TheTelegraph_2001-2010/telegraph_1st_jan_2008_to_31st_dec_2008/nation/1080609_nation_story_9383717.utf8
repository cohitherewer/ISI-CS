          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           BJD members take out a rally comprising bullock carts to voice their protest against the UPA government at the Centre and the recent fuel hike. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 8: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) activists today took out a rally from the PMG Square protesting against the price hike of petrol, diesel and LPG.         
	The rally that started around 11am comprised protesters shouting slogans against the Centres UPA government riding on bullock carts and bicycles.         
	Some 200 members took out the rally from the PMG Square and reached the Raj Bhavan an hour later.        
	We are travelling in bullock carts as soon they will be the only mode of travelling that a common man will be able to afford if prices keep on rising every day like now under the UPA government. After a while, the residents of the state will not be able to afford a middle-class lifestyle. And the state of the poor will be dismal, said Artatrana Maharana, a senior member of the party.        
	Our protests will continue for five more days and we might prolong it further if our demands for a price slash are not met with, said MLA Arun Sahoo  who was marching with the other protesters, while two platoons of police looked on.         
	The rally, though peaceful, saw a heavy presence of police forces around rally members.        
	The activists also submitted a memorandum of demands to Governor M.C. Bhandare today.         
	Meanwhile, Berhampur BJD MLA Ramesh Chau Patnaik, who tried a similar stunt yesterday, escaped a close encounter of a bovine kind. While trying to climb up a cart during a similar protest, Patnaik fractured his leg.         
	Patnaik was participating in a rally organised by the Biju Yuva Janata Dal to protest against inflation, price hike of essential commodities and the fuel hike.        
	While Pattnaik was getting on to his cart, bus horns agitated the animals and they made an attempt to break free and the minister fell.         
	He was taken to a private hospital and was later shifted to the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Gajapati Medical College and Hospital, Bramhapur. Patnaik has fractured his right leg (near the thigh) and has been asked to take rest for two months.

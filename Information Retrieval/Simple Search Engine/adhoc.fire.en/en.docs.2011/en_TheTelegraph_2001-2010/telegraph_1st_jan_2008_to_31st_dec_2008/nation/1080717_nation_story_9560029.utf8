          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 16: The Supreme Court has held that refusal to act on the testimony of a sexual assault victim because of lack of corroborative evidence adds insult to injury.        
	The ruling came yesterday in a case where the apex court upheld a jail term awarded to a Madhya Pradesh man convicted of raping a married backward caste woman. His lawyers had claimed he was falsely implicated.        
	A girl or a woman in the tradition-bound society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident likely to reflect on her chastity ever occurred. When, in the face of these factors, the crime is brought to light, there is in-built assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated, the apex court bench said.        
	The judges urged courts not to be swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the victims statement. If evidence of the victim inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration.        
	If it is difficult to rely on her testimony, courts may look for evidence that lends assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice.        
	The bench said a victim of a sexual offence couldnt be put on a par with an accomplice. She is a victim. The evidence act nowhere says her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. Her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence.        
	The apex court said such victims were in the normal course reluctant to disclose the offence against them even before family members much less before public or police. The suggestion was that once she decides to speak about it in court risking her prestige, the testimony is likely to be true.        
	In the case at hand, the apex court dismissed the appeal by Moti Lal Gadariya against his conviction.

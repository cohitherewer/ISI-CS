	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Two engineering students returning from a late-night party died after their car crashed into a tree near India Gate early this morning.        
	Both were allegedly drunk, as was their friend behind the wheel.         
	Police said four persons, all in their early 20s, were returning from a party at the Intercontinental Hotel around 4.30am when their black Skoda Laura hit a tree before skidding off the road and turning turtle.        
	Shena Kapoor, a student at the Amity School of Engineering and Technology, and Anirudh Rawat, who studied at Delhi University, were in the backseat. Both died on the spot.        
	Satyajit Singh and Gaurav, who was driving, were seriously injured and have been admitted to a hospital in Noida.        
	Officers at the Tilak Marg police station said preliminary investigations pointed to rash driving as the cause of the accident. Broken liquor bottles were found near the site, they added. The police have not yet got the post-mortem report.

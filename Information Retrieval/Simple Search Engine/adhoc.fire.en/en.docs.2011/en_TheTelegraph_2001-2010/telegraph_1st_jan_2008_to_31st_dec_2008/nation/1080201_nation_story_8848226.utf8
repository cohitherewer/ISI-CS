     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
             Smart talk: Lalu Prasad
                 
	Patna, Jan. 31: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray has accomplished the impossible  he has united all Bihar political parties against him for his comment on north Indians and his description of Chhath as a natak (drama). 
    
	The parties have gone to the extent of demanding jail for Thackeray and have described his words as an act of treason and an attack on Indias unity and integrity. Common people have demanded his immediate arrest and trial under the IPC. 
    
	Thackeray recently questioned the use of celebrating Chhath and UP Divas in Maharashtra. Chhath is a natak which Biharis celebrate to increase their clout in Maharashtra. I dont understand where these festivals come from. Even in Uttar Pradesh you wont see UP Divas being celebrated in the scale it is celebrated here... 
    
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad worded his reaction in his own inimitable style. Raj Thackerays career is going through a bad phase. He should perform the Chhath puja to get some peace of mind. Chhath would help him tide over the crisis he is in, Lalu Prasad said, adding: The Thackerays are irresponsible and anarchic people. If someone has to go out of Maharashtra then it is the Thackerays. 
    
	State president of JD(U) Lallan Singh said Thackerays statement was thoroughly anti-national. Maharashtra, Bihar or for that matter any state of India is not the fiefdom of any particular leader or party. Biharis or any Indian for that matter living in any part of the country is well within his/her constitutional rights to migrate and live anywhere in the country, Singh said, describing the remarks as an attack on the Indian Constitution. 
    
	Union chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan described Thackerays words as utterly irresponsible and potentially dangerous for Indias integrity. Thackeray must be punished for his words, he said. 
    
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar described Thackerays comments as intolerable. Chhath is a great festival where people of every community are involved and it is a display of self-discipline, explained Nitish. 
    
	Senior BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad said the people of Maharastra had rejected Thackeray. He is speaking in frustration, he said.

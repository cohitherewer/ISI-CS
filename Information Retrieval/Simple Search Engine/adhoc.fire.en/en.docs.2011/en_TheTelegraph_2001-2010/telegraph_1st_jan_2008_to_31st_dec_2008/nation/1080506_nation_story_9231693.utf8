The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet nod to token thrust on women bill
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cabinet nod to token thrust on women bill
          HEMENDRA SINGH BARTWAL                              
	New Delhi, May 5: The Union cabinet is learnt to have cleared the introduction of the womens bill in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow.        
	Sources said it was believed that the draft has been cleared in its original form under which 33.3 per cent seats in Parliament and state legislatures will be reserved for women. Several parties wanted this formula to be amended.        
	However, the move is widely perceived as a token gesture as Parliament is expected to be adjourned indefinitely soon after the bill is tabled.        
	If the House is adjourned, the bill will be taken up for discussion only during the monsoon session, which will help put off a possible showdown between opponents and proponents of the bill.        
	However, no official announcement was made by the government, as was planned earlier in the evening, on the cabinet decision.        
	A senior official in the Press Information Bureau said the government had decided that the announcement would be made in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. This was in keeping with the tradition of not making announcements outside Parliament when it is in session.        
	The womens bill has been moved in Parliament by earlier governments, including the United Front government of H.D. Deve Gowda in 1996 and the NDA government in 1998, but without success as it ran into stiff opposition from many parties. Coming ahead of the Assembly polls in Karnataka this month and in several other states later in the year, the latest initiative is being seen as move on the part of the Congress with an eye on electoral gains.         
	The party is keen to display its commitment to the promises on the bill in its poll manifesto as well as the UPAs common minimum programme.        
	The Congress, BJP and the Left have been paying lip service to the womens legislation for many years now, but the bill has not taken shape because of opposition from pro-OBC parties as well as divisions within the two main political parties themselves.        
	The Congresss allies like the RJD and the DMK as well as outside supporters like the Samajwadi Party and the BSP are still against passing the bill without amendments to provide a quota within quota for Dalits and backward classes.         
	Indicating that there was no shift in his partys stand, railway minister Lalu Prasad said earlier in the day that he would oppose the bill if the government tried to push it through without modifications. The RJD would not, however, stop the government from tabling the bill as the Congress had given an assurance on the matter, he added.         
	The Samajwadi Party termed the government initiative as election propaganda.

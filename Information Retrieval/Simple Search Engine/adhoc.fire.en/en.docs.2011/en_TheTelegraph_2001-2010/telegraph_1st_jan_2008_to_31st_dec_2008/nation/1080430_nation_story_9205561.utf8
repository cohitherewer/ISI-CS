	A jubilant Anand Kumar told The Telegraph: I came to know of the films screening yesterday. Anand Kumar admitted that the experience of filming has been exhilarating and humbling at the same time. Who would have imagined that the my little-known Super 30 batch would be appreciated so much someday?         
	Quoting from the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles website the film has been higly praised. Mathematics teacher Anand Kumar and his dedicated colleagues choose the 30 most promising and at-need local students and for eight gruelling months train them rigorously for the all-important entrance exams for the Indian Institute of Technology.

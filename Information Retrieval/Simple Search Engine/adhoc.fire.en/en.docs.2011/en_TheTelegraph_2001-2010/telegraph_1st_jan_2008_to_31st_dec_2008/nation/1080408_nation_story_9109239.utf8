                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pilot unhappy buzz
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sachin Pilot                                  
	New Delhi, April 7: Hours of TV sound bites claiming Sachin Pilot was unhappy at being overlooked during Sundays shuffle could cost the young MP dear although he later tried to clear the air, Congress sources said.        
	I welcome the changes. Young people have been given a chance to work together as a team under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, the Dausa MP, denied a widely expected ministry berth, said.        
	Sachin had earlier kept quiet as groups of Gujjar supporters gathered outside his home to tell TV channels how the community felt betrayed by the Congress.        
	It was only after his silence had bewildered the Congress  where any hint of ambition or disappointment could invite questions about ones loyalty  that he came out with the clarification.        
	Asked if the Gujjars planned protests, he said: Nothing of the sort. Nobody even broke an egg. My people are more mature politically than all of us put together in Delhi.        
	The kindest explanation offered by party sources was that the vested interests around Sachin had overplayed his unhappiness and given a caste twist to the controversy.        
	People close to Sachin denied he was disappointed.        
	Sachin is a member of Rahul Gandhis future challenges group and is often seen in the Amethi MPs company in the Lok Sabha. The Congress has fielded him as a speaker at many important parliamentary debates.        
	Sources said the party had in mind a role for him in the Rajasthan polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India gives Pak elbow room on handover
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     India gives Pak elbow room on handover
  - Pranab tells Islamabad it can try its nationals as Gilani sticks to refusal to deport suspects        OUR BUREAU AND REUTERS                              Pranab Mukherjee (top), Yousaf Raza Gilani				                                       
	Calcutta/Islamabad, Dec. 13: The Centre today said Pakistani nationals linked to terror strikes in India could be tried in their country, making a distinction that takes into account concerns of a backlash in the neighbourhood if Islamabad is seen to be succumbing too much to outside pressure.        
	A few hours earlier, the Pakistan Prime Minister had promised to prosecute such elements and stuck to the refusal to hand over suspects.        
	So far, Delhi had been insisting that Islamabad hand over both Pakistani citizens and Indian fugitives accused of a role in terror attacks in India.        
	But foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Murshidabad today: There are terrorists who have been operating in and outside India against our country. They are either of Indian or Pakistani origin. Our stand is that all of them should be handed over to us.         
	If Pakistan has problems or objections to that, then terrorists of Indian origin using Pakistani soil to act against us must be handed over to us. In that case, the Pakistan government should, under their laws, arrest and try those Pakistani nationals who are creating and spreading terror in India.        
	Mukherjee stressed that the Pakistan government should ensure that this was no mockery of a trial.        
	Government sources in Delhi refused to confirm whether there had been a change of stand. But they said it would have been unrealistic to expect Pakistan to hand over its citizens and risk an uproar there that could affect the very future of its shaky civilian government.        
	The eternal affairs minister said that in 2004, the then Pakistan President, Pervez Musharraf, and the then Indian Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had struck an agreement and that this year, there was yet another pact that the soil of either country would not be used for terrorist activities.        
	But there are terrorists who are operating on Pakistani soil which means that the agreement is not being respected, Mukherjee said. Those now running the Pakistan administration do have the responsibility of honouring earlier agreements.        
	Earlier, Pakistan Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told Reuters in an interview that anyone caught in Pakistan would be tried there, and suspects wouldnt be handed over to India.        
	We will go according to our own law, he said. There is no such thing of handing over (suspects) to India.        
	Pressed on whether his government would act against armed groups based in Pakistan and fighting in Kashmir, Gilani replied: Certainly, if Pakistan soil is being used for any such activity... the law will take its own course.        
	He said India had not yet supplied hard evidence of Pakistani links to the Mumbai attack, but hoped this would be forthcoming when foreign ministers from both countries meet on Sunday in Paris on the sidelines of a conference on Afghanistan.        
	Gilani said Pakistan was taking its own action against groups and people put on a UN terrorist list, and the chances of India resorting to air strikes against militant targets were remote.        
	I think India is equally responsible and they wont. There is no fear of anything like that, Gilani said.        
	International diplomacy was defusing tension with India, he added. Normalisation takes time.        
	The US has been at the forefront of intense diplomatic efforts to stop tensions erupting into a full-blown crisis between the two countries. All our common friends and responsible statesmen are playing their important role in defusing the situation and Im pretty sure that will work, Gilani said.        
	Having seen the ineffectiveness of Pakistans past measures and harbouring suspicion that security agencies have retained links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba and other groups, Indian officials privately doubt whether any decisive action will be taken this time.        
	But Gilani said the latest crackdown on anti-India jihadi organisations would go beyond previous ineffective bans because UN resolutions gave the government a stronger legal position.

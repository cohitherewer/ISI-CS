The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Data duel over Bihar ratio
                                                                                                               Data duel over Bihar ratio
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 7: Bihar human resource development minister Brishen Patel has dismissed the report on the declining teacher-student ratio in Bihar.        
	New Delhi-based National University of Educational Planning and Administration (Nuepa), previously known as the National Institute of Planning and Administration, had prepared the report.        
	The survey suggests that Bihars teacher-student ratio stood at a dismal 1:90 in 2004-05, 1:91 in 2005-06 and the same in 2006-07. Trashing the report, Patel claimed that Bihar had achieved an improved ratio of 1:51 against a dismal 1:91 some three years ago.         
	He said: With the appointment of 3.4 lakh teachers over two years we have steadied the ratio. With the appointment of one lakh more, we hope to take the ratio to an ideal 1:40 within a years time.         
	The minister said independent studies and surveys do not bother him, especially as he had government data collected from primary schools in 38 districts to prove his point. He took a jibe at the Opposition for stalling the House proceedings by raising inconsequential issues without doing any homework.         
	Professor Sudhanshu Bhushan of Nuepa stressed that their data, too, was collected from districts all across the state.         
	He added that his agency (Nuepa) has been conducting researches on this topic for years using its own parameters into consideration  such as dropout rates and possible non-functioning of the mid-day meal scheme in schools.         
	He further claimed that the national average of the ratio has been dipping.         
	The average allegedly fell from 30 students in 2004-05 to 41 in 2005-06 and 30 in 2006-07.         
	N.K. Choudhary, a retired professor of economics at Patna University, said: Though I am not competent to comment on such reports, I can safely say that factors such as dropout rates and exaggerated attendance needs to be taken into consideration while compiling such a report. The government, he added, uses far too simple data to prove its points.

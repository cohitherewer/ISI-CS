          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today tried to allay fears that Barack Obamas victory would hit the outsourcing industry in the country.        
	A comment here, a comment there about outsourcing should not bother us. Once he is in office, he will realise that in this interconnected world, countries have to work together, Chidambaram said.        
	Obamas campaign website www.barackobama.com says he and Vice-President-elect Joe Biden will end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas. Obama and Biden will also fight to ensure public contracts are awarded to companies that are committed to American workers, it says.        
	Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy appeared to echo Chidambaram. We believe President-elect Obama to be a pragmatic leader who understands American industry needs to be competitive not just in America but in third countries as well, he said.

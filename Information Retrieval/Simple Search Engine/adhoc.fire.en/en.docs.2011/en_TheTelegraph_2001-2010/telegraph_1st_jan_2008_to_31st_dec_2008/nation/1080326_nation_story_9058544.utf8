The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quit notice: Your citys sinking
                                                                                                               Quit notice: Your citys sinking
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                          
	Mumbai, March 25: Shah Rukh Khan, Rekha and Farhan Akhtar will soon receive eviction notices at their Mumbai homes. Jyoti Basu is likely to get one at Salt Lake.        
	It may be a bit too early to warn them to leave  global warming will not raise the sea levels enough to submerge their neighbourhoods in another four decades at least. But Greenpeace activists are not taking chances.        
	The token eviction drive is the environment groups way of telling Indians they should start battling climate change, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions, in earnest.        
	So, scores of activists will paste these notices on the gates of structures they believe could be submerged between 2050 and 2100, when sea levels rise across coastal India, gobbling up parts of cities like Mumbai and Chennai.        
	In case of Calcutta, at a distance from the sea, the gobbling will be done by the Hooghly and its channels running through the city, Greenpeace says. The areas at highest risk include the generally low-lying east, from the airport and Salt Lake down EM Bypass, as well as Kidderpore, Garden Reach and Taratala in the west .        
	The group has used data and maps from Nasas Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to draw up similar lists for Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi and Goa.        
	Mumbais endangered list includes the Gateway of India. Chennai will lose Marina Beach, MGR Film City and the nearby heritage site of Mahabalipuram.        
	A new study predicts a massive humanitarian crisis in South Asia if the global temperature rise is not kept within 2C. It estimates that nearly 12.5 crore people could turn homeless in India and Bangladesh alone.        
	The study, Blue Alert Climate Migrants in South Asia: Estimates and Solutions, was carried out by Sudhir Chella Rajan of IIT Chennais social sciences department.        
	The climate-impacted migration will be 10 times worse than Partition. And it will not affect only the economically backward. When the sea levels rise they will not discriminate between the so-called posh areas and the ghettos, said Brikesh Singh, Greenpeace campaigner.        
	Government environmentalists in Mumbai scoffed at the doomsday predictions.        
	In the last 30 years, the sea level has risen by only a few millimetres. At the most, the mangrove regions will be at risk and even then, only a part of the land will be submerged, said R.V. Sarma of the National Institute of Oceanography.        
	Greenpeace, however, says a possible rise of 4-5C by 2100 will raise sea levels by up to 5 metres.

                                        D Prakash      
	Melbourne, April 7 (PTI): An Indian stage actor, found dead under mysterious circumstances in a Sydney hotel, had choked on his vomit after a heavy drinking session, a newspaper has said.        
	D. Prakash, 30, who was part of an Indian production of Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream, was barred from boarding a plane to India two days before he was found dead on March 25 after Sydney airport staff suspected he was too intoxicated to fly, the Herald Sun reported.        
	The actor, from Tamil Nadu, returned to his hotel where he continued to drink and later choked on his vomit, sources were quoted as saying by the daily. Prakash was found dead in the hotel room three days after the Sydney season of the production ended, Yadu Vansh Dayal of the Indian consulate in Sydney said.        
	This has shocked everyone. It is hard to understand how all this happened. He wasnt a heavy drinker. Perhaps he was looking to unwind after a hectic schedule and it all went wrong, fellow cast member Fazeh Jalali said. Prakash was popular in the theatre group and was a talented musician and actor, he added.

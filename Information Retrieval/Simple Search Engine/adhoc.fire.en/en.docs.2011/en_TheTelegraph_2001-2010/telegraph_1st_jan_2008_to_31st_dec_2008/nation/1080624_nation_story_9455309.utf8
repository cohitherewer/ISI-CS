	Games impetus to airport speed link    
	The drive to Delhi airport could be a breeze in two years.    
	Plans have been set in motion to open five new routes to the public before the 2010 Commonwealth Games as part of a larger plan to decongest existing roads.    
	Two underpasses are lined up at Rao Tularam Marg, near RK Puram, as is a separate route from Dwarka circle and a tunnel connecting Mahipalpur with Vasant Kunj, urban development secretary M. Ramachandran said recently.    
	A northern underpass, cutting through National Highway 8 and a separate access from the international terminal to the domestic, will also be made for a hassle-free drive.    
	The Delhi Development Authority will construct the underpass project at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore, while the state government will set up the four-lane Mahipalpur tunnel at an expected cost of around Rs 200 crore.    
	The other three proposed projects are to be finalised soon, Ramachandran said. He added that the Central Road Research Institute was being consulted for the projects. (PTI)

	Uncorked: liquor fury    
	Spirits arent really soaring in Andhra Pradesh at the governments decision to hawk licences for liquor shops.    
	Some political outfits are up in arms against the move, saying it amounts to fleecing people and making money at the expense of public interest. One such resistance group, the Loksatta Party, staged a protest last week.    
	But it was a demonstration with a difference  a blood donation camp. Loksatta convener Jayaprakash Narayan slammed the authorities for resorting to such auctions merely as a revenue-raising tool.    
	Shedding blood is the Gandhian form of protest the Loksatta chose in response to the government sucking poor peoples blood by way of liquor sales, spokesperson K. Gita Murthy said. The blood collected at the camp was handed over to a government hospital in the city.     
	Murthy accused the Congress and Telugu Desam of indulging in hypocrisy on the policy for liquor shops. While the Desam government initiated the belt-shop culture, the Congress regime nurtured and nourished it. (PTI)

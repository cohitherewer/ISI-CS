     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
             Facing floods 
                 
	Patna, Feb. 4: Farmers in 21 of the 38 Bihar districts just faced scourge of flood, lost crops and cattle to tunes of crores. 
    
	What is worse is that the chain of loss has become a routine with a variance in degree. When there is no flood, drought plays spoilsport. 
    
	Yet, majority of farmers at the receiving end do not plan to insure their crops or cattle, a decision that is abetted by a government which is equally reluctant to take up the task of recording and maintaining land records. 
    
	Case in point: the Land Reform Commission is yet to give its final recommendations for the process. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar conceded that the government had been distributing Kisan credit cards, but would not take up insuring farmers on a mass-scale as yet due to banking hurdles. 
    
	An officer in the rank of a deputy manager with State Bank of India told The Telegraph: Insuring a non-loanee farmer is an impractical proposition because a bank faces recovery problems as there are no land records and many a time the farmers dont hold any bank accounts.
    
	A senior official in the agriculture ministry said: The government can surely co-ordinate with banks. But banks have their formats before they grant agriculture insurance. Thus, the issue hangs in a limbo. 
    
	According to a rough estimate, only three per cent of Bihar farmers are insured. All of them are loanee farmers. 
    
	Experts, however, believe that involving panchayats would speed up the stalled process, especially in horticulture, floriculture, medicinal and aromatic plant farming. Once the panchyat head is involved and given responsibility to collect the premium for the loan, agriculture insurance can start working smoothly. A patwari or tehsildar would know about land records and average productivity of a crop, they added. 
    
	R.K.P. Singh, an advisor at Krishi Ayog, said agriculture insurance cover cattle and farm machinery. Weather-based insurance should be adopted for the state with banks having farmer-friendly policies. A minimum production of grains/seeds in a cultivation cycle should be ensured to make farmers feel secured. But banks find hitches in farmers insurance.

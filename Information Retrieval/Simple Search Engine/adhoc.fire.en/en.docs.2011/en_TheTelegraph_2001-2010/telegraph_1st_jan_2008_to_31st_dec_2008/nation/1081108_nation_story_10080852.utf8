          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A girl gives King Khesar Namgyel a peck during celebrations in Thimphu on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Thimphu, Nov. 7: Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk made his first address as Bhutans king today, sounding a note of caution and winning his peoples hearts with effortless charm.         
	The king, who assumed the Raven Crown yesterday, voiced his concern that the nations drive towards modernity may mean risking the loss of traditional values.        
	But in keeping with the views that saw his father pave the way for Bhutans first democratic elections, Khesar Namgyel said he would not serve his people as a king. Instead, he would assume the roles of a parent, a brother or a son.        
	A crowd of around 25,000, packed into the Changlingmethang stadium in the heart of the capital, listened to the king. President Pratibha Patil, Sonia Gandhi and her children were among the audience. Patil has invited him to India.         
	Khesar Namgyel stressed he would not rest till he fulfilled the peoples aspirations and helped them contribute to the kingdoms growth. My deepest concern is that as the world changes, we may lose these fundamental values on which rest our character as a nation and people, he said from the balcony of the royal pavilion.         
	He urged the people to pursue the simple and timeless goal of being good human beings.         
	The speech done, the 28-year-old mingled with the crowd, chatting, joking, and greeting old friends, ordinary people and tourists.        
	He is very gracious and he has amazing charisma, said 36-year-old Patty Wu from San Francisco, after the king stopped to jokingly ask if her friends were wearing sun cream, and to talk about California.        
	We felt like we were the only people in the stadium, added 37-year-old photographer Jay Hu at her side.        
	A few steps on, Khesar Namgyel, nicknamed peoples king, picked out a 70-year-old man from several rows back in the crowd. Phuentsho had spent most of his life working for the royal household.        
	He joked that I had never made the pilgrimage I had promised to, but told me I had worked very hard, said the laughing old man, dressed in a Bhutanese gho, the national knee-length gown, and a woolly Nike hat.        
	With his slicked-back black hair, sideburns and winning smile, he has the kind of star quality royal families dream of, looking a bit like a cross between a Hong Kong movie star and a young Elvis Presley.        
	After a series of parades and other martial drills by the armed forces of Bhutan, it was time for an Indian offering. Choreographer Astad Deboo gave a performance titled Rhythm Divine, exemplifying the balance between tradition and modernity.         
	His troupe of 30 Manipuri dancers  the only non-Bhutanese group  performed to the beats of Pungcholam drums, a traditional instrument of the northeastern state.         
	The performance is an offering to the king from India, Deboo said.         
	As the entertainment continued, Khesar Namgyel moved through the crowd dressed in a red and gold gho with the bright yellow scarf of the highest office worn across his left shoulder, stooping to talk and pick up or kiss young children.        
	Deboos troupe will perform again tomorrow at a banquet to celebrate 100 years of the Wangchuk dynasty.

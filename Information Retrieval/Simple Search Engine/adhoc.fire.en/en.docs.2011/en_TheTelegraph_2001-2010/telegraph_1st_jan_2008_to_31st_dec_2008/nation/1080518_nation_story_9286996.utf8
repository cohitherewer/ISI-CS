          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jaipur, May 17: Ten cycles were purchased by as many people in Jaipur, it was confirmed after a late-night meeting today of police officers from at least five states.         
	Sleuths probing the Jaipur serial blasts today confirmed that the explosions were carried out in modular mode  that is, 10 persons bought the cycles, each unaware of the actions of the other.         
	Ten cycles, 10 persons, that is it. We have released one more sketch today, a senior police officer said after the co-ordination meeting.         
	The police came to this conclusion after conversations with cycle shop owners in the Kishanpole area from where the vehicles of death were bought.         
	Six sketches have been released. Four people need to be visualised now and two shops need to be traced from where two cycles need to be traced, a source added.         
	Over 60 people were killed in the serial explosions last Tuesday that have left security agencies puzzled.         
	Police forces from Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are working together on the case.         
	As forensic reports are yet to come in, the focus now is on other areas of investigation.         
	Two cyber-experts have been called in to analyse a massive amount of data on mobile phone calls in six different areas of Jaipur.

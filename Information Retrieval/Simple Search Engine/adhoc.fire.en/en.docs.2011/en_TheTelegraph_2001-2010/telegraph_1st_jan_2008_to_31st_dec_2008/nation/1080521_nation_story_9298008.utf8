	Bhubaneswar, May 20: After a long drawn legal battle, Chenchu alias Sudarshan Hansdah, one of the accused in Graham Staines murder case, was set free.         
	He was acquitted by the Angul chief judicial magistrate today from the charges of abetting escape from the reformatory hostel, his lawyer, Bana Bihari Mohanty told The Telegraph here today. Chenchu was 13 when a mob burnt the Australian missionary and his two sons on January 22, 1999, at Manoharpur in Keonjhar district.         
	He was arrested and lodged in Angul reformatory hostel after being tried by a juvenile court.         
	Though 11 other accused were acquitted in the Staines murder case by Orissa High Court in May 2005, Chenchu, languished in the hostel as his case needed to be heard by the Juvenile Justice Board. Later, he was acquitted in the Staines murder case, but continued to be lodged in reformatory hostel on the charge of abetting escape from the hostel, which was pending in the Angul court. Finally, he was acquitted by the court, after his lawyer drew the attention of the judge recently.         
	According to the provisions of Orissa Juvenile Justice Act, authorities of reformatory hostel will escort him back to his home at Manoharpur in Keonjhar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The Buzz in Big Cities
                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Residents army to battle rallies    
	Shivaji Park Warriors will do what police havent  stop the central Mumbai enclave from being held to ransom by the army of flag-waving political footsoldiers.    
	If the authorities cant maintain law and order, they shouldnt allow rallies. Our unity, through the association, will ensure politicians dont make our lives miserable, said Smita Samant, who lives near the ground.    
	The 60-year-old is one of those whose lives have taken a turn for the worse since the February 3 attack by Raj Thackerays supporters on a Samajwadi Party rally.    
	Now, the patience has worn thin. The park warriors say they will demand information from the police about all planned rallies and security arrangements.    
	Members of the forum, formed by 81 families last month, said more would have joined had it not been for the near-siege that the area had witnessed in the days when trouble erupted over Rajs remarks against north Indians. It was a curfew-like situation during those days. We couldnt meet other residents. But they have said they will join, said Amita Gaekwad, another resident.        
	Court steps in to save caves    
	There appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel for four neglected caves in Mumbai.    
	A Bombay High Court committee will survey the encroachments around the caves and suggest preservation methods.    
	The Mahakali (Andheri), Mandapeshwar, Kanheri (Borivli) and Jogeshwari caves are on Archaeological Survey of Indias list of protected monuments.    
	But a public interest plea by heritage activist Bhagvanji Rayani alleged that slums had come up next to the caves. ASI rules ban construction and other structures near such monuments.    
	The judges have asked the panel to suggest the minimum interference necessary for the preservation.    
	Shiraz Rustomji, who heads the committee, had earlier told the court that the situation in Jogeshwari was precarious with slums sprouting on top of the cave.    
	Crusader fire at billboards    
	Traffic Ramaswamy is on the prowl again, this time slamming the brakes on larger-than-life unauthorised street billboards.    
	Ramaswamy  known for his unflagging zeal to improve the way the city moves  had rushed to Madras High Court to have the hundreds of digital banners removed.    
	He claimed they were not only a big source of distraction and a traffic hazard for motorists, with all their glitz, colour and pretty women, but also potential killers if they ever came crashing down on pedestrians.     
	In response to his petition, a division bench of the court set up a panel, headed by a senior lawyer, to examine whether the billboards were, indeed, the threat they were made out to be.    
	The panel recommended removal of all unauthorised digital banners.    
	The court win, one of the many that the diminutive former mill worker has won in his cases over the years, showed the 80-year-old could be a traffic stopper even at this age.        
	Water tussle    
	Summer is close, and so is a water war.    
	The Delhi government has threatened to move court against Haryanas alleged refusal to release water to the capital.    
	We will first approach the Centre to intervene in the matter. Even after that, if Haryana doesnt release water, we will have no option but to take legal recourse, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said recently.    
	Haryana and Punjab meet much of the capitals potable water needs. While Punjab is releasing its share of water, Dikshit said Haryana wasnt doing its bit.    
	Delhi: Alliance Francaise is serving up Indian classical dance with a French flavour this Monday. Six Bharatnatyam and Kathakali artistes will perform in Enfer et Illuminations (Hell and Illuminations), a play penned by poet Arthur Rimbaud. The venue is the Alliance auditorium. Time: 7pm.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 24: Joginder Jaswant Singh, who retired as army chief last year, will take over as Arunachal Pradesh governor.
    
	Official sources said Singhs appointment received the Presidents assent today.
    
	Singh will take charge from K. Sankaranarayanan who, as acting governor, also oversees Nagaland.
    
	Sources in the government said Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna might leave for Karnataka, where elections are scheduled by the end of May.
    
	Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh is tipped to replace him at Mumbais Raj Bhavan.
    
	For Arunachal, Singhs appointment is significant for two reasons. One, his stint in the state while in the army and, two, the ongoing controversy over the states boundary with China.
    
	While in service, Singh had contributed articles to regimental and professional journals on the Sino-Indian border dispute.
    
	Singh had served in Arunachal during his stint with the 7th and 9th Maratha Light Infantry.
    
	He was awarded the Vishisht Seva Medal during his tenure with the 9th regiment.
    
	The general also has knowledge of the nuances of the border issue.
    
	As additional director-general of military operations at army headquarters, he helped evolve the policy on the border dispute.
    
	Singh also visited Beijing as part of the joint working group on the issue. 
    
	The appointment assumes greater significance when viewed against the backdrop of Manmohan Singhs visit to Beijing last week.
    
	The Prime Minister will tour Arunachal next week.

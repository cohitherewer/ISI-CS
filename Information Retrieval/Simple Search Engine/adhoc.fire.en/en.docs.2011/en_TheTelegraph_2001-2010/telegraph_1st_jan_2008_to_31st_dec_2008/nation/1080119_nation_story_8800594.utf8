     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 18: Two persons were injured when police fired at demonstrators protesting against the electricity shortage at Colgong in Bhagalpur this evening. 
    
	The incident took place around 4.30pm when 500-odd people were protesting near production unit of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The protestors demanded that the NTPC provide electricity to Cologong, which has been reeling under power shortage, despite having a NTPC power plant nearby. 
    
	The NTPC management, however, clearly told protestors that the firm would provide electricity directly to the Bihar State Electricity Board, which distributes power across Bihar including Colgong. The injured have not been identified. 
    
	Bhagalpur deputy superintendent of police V.N. Jha has been injured in the clash with protestors, too. The protests started from the morning when shopkeepers observed a bandh to protest the shortage. After the NTPC refusal, protestors tried to get into the plant premises when the police first used tear-shells to disperse the crowd. But when the situation got worse the police opened fire. Though Bhagalpur police claimed to have opened fire in air, it failed to explain how the two men were injured. The police did not rule out the involvement of some criminals out to make trouble. 
    
	Opposition RJD wasted no time in lambasting the state government for its failure to both provide electricity as well as controlling the police. 
    
	RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak said: The state government has been confounding the power crisis rather than finding out ways to resolve it. He also criticised the police brutality. 
    
	Over 300 policemen including those from Special Auxiliary Police have been deployed at Colgong. Senior police officers have rushed to the spot.

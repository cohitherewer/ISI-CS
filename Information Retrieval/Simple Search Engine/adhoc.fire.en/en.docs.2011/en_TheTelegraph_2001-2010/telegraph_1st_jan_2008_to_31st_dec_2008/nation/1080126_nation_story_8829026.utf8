                                                                                                                                   Board, any problem?

                     
	Now that he owns the IPL Calcutta team, Shah Rukh Khan has taken a leaf out of his likely captain Sourav Gangulys book. He has thumbed his nose at an unofficial ban by some in Indian crickets power corridors.
    
	No one should have (any) objection if I watch a match now, the actor said last night after winning the bid for Calcutta and announcing I hope Ganguly leads my team.
    
	Last November, Board of Control for Cricket in India official Ratnakar Shetty had suggested that actors were using matches to promote films. It was a hint that SRKs presence at games, including the ICC World Twenty20 final, was an attempt to plug Om Shanti Om.
    
	The one thing I hope that does not happen is that people think I am watching a cricket match to promote my film. I will be supporting my team, SRK said.
    
	He had earlier said he would not attend matches if the board didnt want it, prompting BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, a personal friend, to deny there was any ban.
    
	Shah Rukh, tongue in cheek, hinted on Thursday that his films would be powering his cricket team and not the other way round. 
    
	I guess I would have to make more films to ensure we can run the team, he said.

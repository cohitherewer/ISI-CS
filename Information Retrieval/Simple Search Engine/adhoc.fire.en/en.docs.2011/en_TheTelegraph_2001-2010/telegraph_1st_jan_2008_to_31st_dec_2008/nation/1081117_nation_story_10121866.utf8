                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Father of 3 held for Indian CEO murder
                            
	Santa Clara, Nov. 16 (Agencies): A laid-off employee who allegedly shot dead an Indian American CEO of a semiconductor company and two other executives has been arrested in northern California, police said.        
	Jing Hua Wu, 47, was yesterday arrested on suspicion of fatally shooting Sid Agrawal, 57, the CEO and co-founder of SiPort Inc, in its office in Santa Clara, west of San Jose, on Friday.         
	The companys vice-president of operations Brian Pugh, 47, and head of human resources Marilyn Lewis, 67, also died in the shooting.        
	A manhunt ended at an intersection in Jings home city of Mountain View, and he will be booked into jail on three counts of murder, said Santa Clara police lieutenant Mike Sellers.        
	Jing had worked at the Silicon Valley semiconductor firm SiPort Inc.  a four-year-old company which develops digital radio semiconductors  as a product test engineer until he was laid off on Friday morning. The police said he returned in the afternoon.         
	He requested a meeting with several company officials, said Santa Clara police chief Stephen Lodge. It was during this meeting that Jing Wu took out a 9mm handgun and shot and killed all three officials.        
	Jing, who is married with three sons, was not armed when he was arrested, and officers did not find a gun in his vehicle, the police said.        
	His neighbours were still trying to comprehend what happened to the man they referred to fondly as Jerry. They described Jing as a happily married father of 6-year-old twin boys and another boy, under age three.        
	Its shocking and emotionally jarring, said Jim Pollart, 47, a neighbour who met Jing and his wife, who friends call Jane, when the couple moved into the area a decade ago.        
	Wu is a nice, smart guy who is quiet by nature, Pollart said, adding that his children regularly played with Jings kids. He also recalled how joyous Jing and his wife were when their parents made annual visits from China.        
	Now, Pollart said, his otherwise quiet neighbourhood was shaken a day after the police swarmed the area.        
	Police officer Sellers said the victims were innocent and just trying to do their jobs. He said that capturing a suspect within hours was very, very important to our department.        
	Student shot at         
	An Indian student from Warangal was shot at in Tennessee on Sunday, barely a fortnight after a techie from Andhra Pradesh was shot dead in the US.         
	Pulluri Shashank, 22, an MBA student at the University of Middle Tennessee, was shot at near his apartment in the varsity campus.         
	He is in hospital and out of danger, his father Pulluri Sudhakar, a resident of Hanamkonda in Warangal, said.        
	As he was taking out his bag from the car, Shashank, who was with friends, was shot at by a man suspected to be an African American, Sudhakar said quoting the friends.        
	Arpana Jenega, a Hyderabadi software professional, was found murdered in her Seattle apartment earlier this month.

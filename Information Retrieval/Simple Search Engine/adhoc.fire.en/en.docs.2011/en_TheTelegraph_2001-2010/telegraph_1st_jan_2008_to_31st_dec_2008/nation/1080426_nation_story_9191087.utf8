          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, April 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today paved the way for the smooth return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley.        
	Singh, who arrived in Jammu today on a two-day visit, also promised to revive routes between the two Kashmirs that have been closed since Partition.         
	The Prime Minister gifted the Pandits a Rs 1,600-crore package, expected to benefit around 50,000 families. Each family will get a grant of several lakhs to build or buy homes.        
	Singh said the Kashmir government has proposed to provide 6,000 jobs to migrant youths. Delhi is also considering waiving off interest on loans taken before migration.        
	The package also has incentives for refugees from the former West Pakistan and migrants from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) living in Jammu.         
	The government has proposed assistance for the children and grandchildren of refugees seeking admission in technical institutions across the country. The Centre has set aside about Rs 50 crore to help PoK migrants buy land.        
	The Prime Minister said talks were on with Pakistan to launch two bus services across the Line of Control  between Kargil and Skardu, and Jammu and Sialkot.         
	The Prime Minister said his government also plans to liberalise the entry permit system for visiting PoK. Applications for entry permit can be deposited at every district. These measures will expand travel across the LoC and also enable wider cultural, academic and other exchanges.         
	Singh said Delhi expects to iron out all problems with the new government in Islamabad. I hope that we will be able to put the past behind us, and that we can move forward with a sense of urgency, not inhibited by false fears or narrow agendas.         
	While the Prime Minister applied balm on Pandits and Pakistan, cries of protests rang out in Srinagar.        
	Hurriyat Conference chief Mirwaiz Umer Farooq led a procession to demand a probe into the nameless graves discovered in north Kashmir, prompting police to detain him.         
	Fearing protests during Singhs visit, police put many Hurriyat leaders, including former chief Moulana Abbaas Ansari, under house arrest.

	Cuttack, May 26: In a bid to avoid further controversy, Orissa Board of Secondary Education president A.K. Samantaray preferred to be silent on the allegation that he bent rules to accommodate his son in the language proficiency test at the eleventh hour.         
	The test is conducted by the board every year to appraise the proficiency of Oriya candidates, who have studied in English- medium schools. Its essential for men and women while seeking a government post in the state.        
	The last date for the submission of applications for the language test was April 30, while the examination was scheduled for May 18.         
	The board presidents son, Anjan Samantaray, had allegedly submitted his application on May 17. Though the board staff rejected his application, he was allowed to take the test following orders from the examination committee, it has been alleged.         
	Some candidates who had submitted their applications before the closing date were even disallowed to sit for the tests, it has been further alleged.        
	The controversy sparked off following a report published in a vernacular daily on May 24.         
	Official sources said Anjan had secured 61 out of 100, the highest among the 69 students who had taken the test from the Cuttack zone this year.         
	Meanwhile, the board had apparently washed its hands off the controversy by referring it to the government for an inquiry to be conducted by the crime branch.         
	We have sought an order for a crime branch probe into the matter and punishment to those found guilty, the controller of examinations, A.S. Bhoi, told the reporters today.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Supreme Court has asked the government to take a fresh look at the doctrine of adverse possession that gives ownership rights to a squatter if a plots real owner doesnt reclaim it within 12 years.        
	We fail to comprehend why the law should place a premium on dishonesty by legitimising possession of a rank trespasser and compelling the owner to lose possession only because of his inaction in taking back possession within limitation (of 12 years), the court said.        
	The observation came as the court disposed of a petition filed by a person called Hemaji Waghaji Jat, who had challenged lower court orders that said he had no right over a six-acre plot he had been in possession of for 26 years.        
	Jat  alleged to have forcibly occupied the land from 1960 to 1986 when a suit was filed challenging his ownership rights  claimed to have bought the plot from one Gama Bhai Gale Bhai Harijan for Rs 75 in 1925.        
	After a trial court upheld Jats claim in April 1986, saying his continuous possession had been proved by the register of cultivation, the legal heirs of Harijan appealed before the district judge in Palanpur, Gujarat, and won the case.        
	The district judge said Jat had failed to prove that he had bought the land. The high court also upheld the district judges views.        
	 The apex court dismissed Jats claims, saying he had failed to establish his title over the property.        
	The law as it exists is extremely harsh for the true owner and a windfall for a dishonest person who had illegally taken possession of the property of the true owner. The law ought not to benefit a person who in a clandestine manner takes possession of the property of the owner in contravention of law, the court said.        
	It said the law of adverse possession, which ousts an owner on the basis of inaction within limitation, was irrational and illogical.        
	This in substance would mean that the law gives seal of approval to the illegal action or activities of a rank trespasser or who had wrongfully taken possession of the property of the true owner.        
	The court asked the government to take an urgent look at the law on adverse possession and make suitable changes.

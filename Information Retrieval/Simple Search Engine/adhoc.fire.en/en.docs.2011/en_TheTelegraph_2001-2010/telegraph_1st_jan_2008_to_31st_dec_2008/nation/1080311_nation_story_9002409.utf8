The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Post politics plagues   MU officers
                                                                                                               Post politics plagues   MU officers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Gaya, March 10: A debate has ensued over the posts of officer-on-special-duty (OSD) at the Magadh University (MU). A section of observers find the position powerful, while another believes the men on the chair are mere sacrificial lambs.         
	Though non-statutory in nature (as university statutes or Bihar Universities Act, 1976, does not recognise the posts), grapevines allege that OSDs are special people for vice-chancellors, and they induct confidantes in such positions.         
	OSDs are also supposed to be the eyes and ears of the vice-chancellors and hold power over the VCs. However, activist S.B. Bhaskar, takes a contrary view, and prefers to call the officials sacrificial lambs.        
	One wag even compared the university OSD with a guinea pig in the field of higher education. He went on to add that a section of less-academically inclined teachers love to be called officers, even if it means performing a semi-clerical job.        
	The craze for the post, he added, skyrocketed following the promotion of Raj Bhavan OSD Krishna Kumar to a position that commands authority, next to only the governor-cum-chancellor, R.S. Gavai.         
	The MU vice-chancellor, B.N. Pandey, was more than generous in appointing OSDs. Nearly six officers jostled with each other, and more often than not add to the woes of the VC.         
	But the period of glory of at least three of the six officers was short-lived. The first to fall victim was Deepak Kumar (OSD exams). His problem: he called too many shots before being bundled out of the university headquarters to land in a lesser-known botany department of AM College, Gaya.         
	The next victim was Neelima Sinha, who scripted her exit by publicly criticising the vice-chancellor and by calling the university a slaughter house of talent.         
	The latest victim is K.K. Narain. He was in trouble for allegedly leaking a confidential document to the media despite strict instructions to retain its confidentiality. The alleged leak has caused much embarrassment to the officer, who is said to be on his way out.        
	A senior university teacher commented that the problem with the officers was that eventually they get too big for their boots.

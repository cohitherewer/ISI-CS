          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 29: Three-year-old Mukesh Prasad probably has no clue what a goonda is but he has been booked under the Goonda Act in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Sultanpur police, on an overdrive to crack down on hardened criminals, issued a warrant against the child last Friday on the suspicion that he was a thug and asked him to surrender before them.        
	A stunned Chandrika Prasad, father of Mukesh, received the warrant at his Pure Grammarje home in Kapa Haliapur block, 160km from Lucknow. A chowkidar (watchman) from the local police station handed it to him.        
	The goof-up came to light on Saturday when Chandrika, 32, reached the officer of the Kapa Haliapur sub-divisional officer with his little son in his arms. Can this boy be a goonda? he asked the SDO, fishing out the warrant.        
	The SDO was left fumbling for words. He immediately called up the Sultanpur superintendent of police, D.C. Mishra, who had the warrant withdrawn. A probe was also ordered.        
	Under the Goonda Act, the police are empowered to issue warrants against persons with criminal records. If they suspect a person has got back to his old ways, they can serve a warrant asking him to surrender and get bail.        
	From then on, the person has to report to the police station every week. In police parlance, this process is called bounding suspects down.        
	Police sources said the mistake might have happened because the Haliapur officers did not bother to carry out the mandatory identity checks. So, the warrant meant for a history-sheeter by the name of Mukesh Prasad was served on the child.        
	It appears to be a case of mistaken identity. But the police officers should have verified the name before sending the warrant, an officer probing the mix-up said.        
	A constable, Afzal Khan, and the Haliapur station house officer, Jaishankar Pandey, have been suspended.        
	Prima facie, it has been found that the two officers sent the warrants without verifying the criminal history of the person, the SP said.

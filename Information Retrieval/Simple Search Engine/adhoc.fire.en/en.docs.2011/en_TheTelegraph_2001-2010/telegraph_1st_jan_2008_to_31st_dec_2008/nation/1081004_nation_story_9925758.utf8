The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM set to extract best out of worst
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CPM set to extract best out of worst
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: CPM leaders today rued losing the chance to grow in strength on the back of the Nano, but hoped Mamata Banerjees destructive politics would misfire in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	We would have gained more strength had the project come up. The people had given us a mandate for industrialisation and most supported the Nano project. So its completion would have been seen as an accomplishment of our task, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said.        
	The statement was in keeping with the partys desperate bid to prevent the Tatas from quitting Singur, although some leaders, including Konar, had felt a pullout would finish Mamata politically and allow the government to begin its industrialisation drive afresh.        
	The CPM, however, geared up to get the best out of the worst ahead of the elections. It is planning an intense anti-Mamata campaign after the festive season is over.        
	The Tata pullout will definitely be a major issue in the coming elections. Now Mamata will pay the price for her negative politics, Konar said.        
	Some farmers may have made mistakes by trusting her. We believe they will rectify (them) and shun these forces of destruction now, he added, taking a swipe at Trinamuls panchayat poll gains that had egged Mamata on to renew her fight for unwilling landlosers.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose hit out at Trinamul for marring a project of international standards and depriving unemployed youths of job opportunities.        
	People of the state will now have to consider who wants the destruction of the state and who wants its well being, Bose said.        
	Konar dared Mamata to visit Singur now, saying many farmers and suppliers to the Nano plant were furious. Implicit was the hope that the CPM would now be able to wrest Singur.         
	Now the people of Singur will give her a befitting reception. We have asked our cadres no to attack the unwilling farmers, Konar said.

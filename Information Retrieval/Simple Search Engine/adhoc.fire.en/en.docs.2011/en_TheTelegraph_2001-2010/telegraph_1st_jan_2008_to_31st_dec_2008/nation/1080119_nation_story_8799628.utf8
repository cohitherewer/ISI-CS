     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 18: A former Orissa minister has allegedly accepted bribes amounting to Rs 5 lakh during the implementation of a World Bank-funded Orissa Health System Development Project  an official of the health department revealed today, quoting a probe report.
    
	Reports of project corruption came to the fore after an internal review was conducted of the Rs 305-crore project by a team, after the World Bank found lapses indicating graft and defalcation of funds.
    
	The project, one of the five being funded by a World Bank loan amounting to $569 million, was singled out by the detailed implementation review undertaken by the banks department of institutional integrity for its misuse of funds and endemic corruption. 
    
	However, the minister has not been named. Neither has the time period when the incident occurred, been mentioned, said the health official, on conditions of anonymity.
    
	The government is in a quandary over the issue, as during the eight-year project-period six ministers held the health portfolio. 
    
	While two Congress leaders had served as ministers during 1998-99, four BJD ministers, including present finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei, headed the department from 2000 to 2006.
    
	There is, however, no finding against any particular bureaucrat in the bank report. But there is mention of some chief district medical officers furnishing completion certificates for certain incomplete projects, said the official. 
    
	The report also points out to certain cases where mistakes occurred and were overlooked.
    
	The World Bank report also questions the process of entrusting works to government agencies such as Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation and Orissa Construction Corporation on the ground that they were not financially sound.

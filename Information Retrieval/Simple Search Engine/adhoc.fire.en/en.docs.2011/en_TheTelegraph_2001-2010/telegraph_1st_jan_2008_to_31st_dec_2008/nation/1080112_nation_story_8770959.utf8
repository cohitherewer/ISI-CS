     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 11: Enter a caf, log in and lodge an FIR police in Tirhut range wish to make law as simple as sipping tea or surfing the net. 
    
	Thirty-six districts in Bihar are divided in to nine police ranges. Six districts, which include Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, Sheohar, East and West Champaran, fall under the Tirhut range. In December 2007 the police in this range introduced a unique on-line FIR system  which has received a lukewarm response from the public. 
    
	So far, the district police have received dozen-odd cases, including some lodged by non-resident Bihar people. Most cases were about extortion and threats. 
    
	Talking to The Telegraph, deputy inspector-general of police (Tirhut range) Arvind Pandey said: Sub-section 3 of Section 154 of the CrPC states that a letter of complaint addressed to superintendent of police or senior officers can be converted into an FIR, if the offence is cognisable. 
    
	His argument was that with e-mail addresses being legal, complaints received as mails were as good as hand-written FIRs. Thus Pandey, who took over as the DIG last November, circulated the official e-mail addresses of all the senior officers of six districts under his range in newspapers  inviting complaints. 
    
	The response has been slow. But, as computers reach more rural pockets, e-complaints would grow, said the DIG. Once an officer receives a complaint, he generally forwards it to the station concerned. The officer-in-charge of that station registers the complaints in a proper format in the register allotting a number. And a case follow up is supposed to be sent to the concerned complainant.
    
	If an e-mail FIR is not registered, the matter can be taken up with officers. The e-FIR would bring in more transparency and better documentation, said Pandey. 
    
	Sushil Verma, a local reporter, disagreed: Though the public are enthused, they doubt if the officers would actually respond. 
    
	e-FIR was recently introduced in Himachal Pradesh. In Bihar, eight police ranges remain that are yet to follow Tirhut example.

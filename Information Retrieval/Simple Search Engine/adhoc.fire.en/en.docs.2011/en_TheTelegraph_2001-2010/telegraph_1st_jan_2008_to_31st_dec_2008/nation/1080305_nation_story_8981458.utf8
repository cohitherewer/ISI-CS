The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US clears Hyde air
                                                                                                               US clears Hyde air
                            
	New Delhi, March 4: India and the US can move forward with both the Hyde Act and the 123 Agreement, US assistant secretary for South Asia Richard Boucher said today.        
	His remarks come a day after foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Hyde Act was not binding on India.        
	I dont want to go into technicalities. The Hyde Act is a domestic legislation (and) the 123 Agreement is an international agreement. I think we can move forward with both in a consistent manner, Boucher, on a two-day trip to Delhi, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama tried to call: PM
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Obama tried to call: PM
                            
	On board PMs Special Aircraft, Nov. 10 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight said President-elect Barack Obama had tried to speak to him but contact could not be established because of paucity of time and his travel.        
	No, this is not true, Singh said, asked if the newly elected President had ignored India by not calling him.        
	President Obama wanted to talk to me day before yesterday (Saturday) (but) we could not establish contact because the time that was suggested was too short for me (to establish contact). Since then, I have been travelling... as soon as I go back (we will try to establish contact), Singh said on his way back from the Gulf.        
	Obama had phoned leaders of nine countries till Friday evening and six more later.        
	Singh said Obama had written a very warm letter to him even before he was elected President. I had myself written a warm letter to him.        
	Singh was hopeful that Indo-US ties under Obama would be strengthened further.        
	I got a very warm letter from him, a detailed letter spelling out his approach to India, his approach to international affairs and, therefore, I have every reason to believe that Indias relations with the US under President Obama will become stronger than ever before, he said.        
	The Prime Minister said he had received immediate acknowledgement of the condolence message he had sent to Obama on the death of his grandmother.        
	I also condoled his grandmothers death and he immediately acknowledged that letter, Singh added.        
	The Prime Minister said the government would wait till oil companies stop making losses on fuel sales before considering cutting petrol and diesel prices.

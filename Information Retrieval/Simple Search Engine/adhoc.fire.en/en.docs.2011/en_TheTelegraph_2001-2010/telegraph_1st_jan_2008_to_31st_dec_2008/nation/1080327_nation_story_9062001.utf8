                                                                                                               Dalmiya held for Cup fraud, freed on bail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dalmiya comes out of the court on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, March 26: Jagmohan Dalmiya was today arrested on charges of misappropriating Rs 2.9 crore of Indian cricket board funds but walked free on bail soon after.        
	The former BCCI chief was taken to the economic offences wing where he was released on a bail bond of Rs 25,000. He had been granted anticipatory bail by Bombay High Court two years ago.        
	Two of his associates, Kishen Choudhary and Gautam Dutta, were similarly arrested and released. The three were later produced before a metropolitan magistrate after Mumbai police filed a 5,500-page chargesheet.         
	The court has directed Dalmiya  charged with cheating, criminal breach of trust, falsification of accounts, forgery and conspiracy  to be present at the next hearing on April 11 and seek exemption from personal appearance till the trial begins.        
	According to the chargesheet, Dalmiya and his two aides connived to dishonestly cheat the cricket board by Rs 2,90,04,214 to foot telephone, travel and hotel bills and buy foreign currency, putting the BCCI into wrongful loss and thereby cheated the BCCI.        
	Giving a break-up, the chargesheet said Rs 85.54 lakh was used to pay phone bills, Rs 24.56 lakh for hotel bills and Rs 53.41 lakh for travel expenses. About Rs 47.15 lakh was used to buy foreign currency.        
	Another Rs 38.82 lakh was paid to his associate Dutta of M/s SG Traders for supplying stationery and cars on rent to the cricket board. But investigations found he did not own any cars and raised bills using numbers of vehicles belonging to his friends and family.        
	Payments for nine phone lines  in the names of ML Dalmiya and Co, Rukmini Dalmiya, Jagmohan Dalmiya, Cricket Association of Bengal and Madhusudhan Incorporation  were made from BCCIs account no. 1223 in Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipore branch in Calcutta.        
	The account, called INDCOM, was to be used to pay fees of lawyers fighting income-tax cases pertaining to the 1996 World Cup hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.        
	According to the chargesheet, Dalmiya alone was authorised by the BCCI finance committee to operate the account. But his associate Choudhary  not a BCCI employee  also operated it for payment of Dalmiyas bills and to buy foreign currency.        
	The said expenses were not related to the purpose for which the INDCOM account was continued, the chargesheet said.        
	Dalmiya bought foreign currency worth Rs 47.15 lakh  30,528, $25,322, 12,000 euros, Sing. $4617 and 2,970 French francs  between November 1997 and October 2005 for which Choudhary was the authorised signatory.        
	According to the cricket boards AGM and finance committee resolutions, he was not authorised to buy foreign currency. Nor were the phone bill payments ratified.        
	The chargesheet said Dalmiya was ICC president from July 1997 to July 2000 and Asian Cricket Council chief from July 2004 to January 2006. These bodies should have picked up the tab for his travel and foreign exchange.        
	Dalmiyas lawyer Satish Maneshinde said the case reeked of political vendetta. Even the late Madhavrao Scindias bills were paid in this manner when he was heading the BCCI, he said.        
	Bengal sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said: I am not defending him, neither am I saying a conspiracy was hatched against him. But it is true that whatever allegations have been brought against him are unacceptable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Heat on IVF parents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Heat on IVF parents
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, May 29: An Indian husband of 72 and his 59-year-old wife, who could not get IVF treatment in the UK because of their advanced age, went to India where doctors helped the woman conceive before the couple returned to Britain to have twins.         
	But when the babies turned out to be girls, the couple wanted to dump the twins, it is alleged.        
	Today, the hunt was on to name and shame the couple who are British nationals from Birmingham.         
	As the traditional Indian preference for baby boys was questioned, the hostile mood was summed up by one reader, Dawn from Nottingham, who wrote to a tabloid newspaper: Will someone please name and shame these vile sub-humans, why should they be exempt from being exposed?         
	The Sun newspaper, which broke the story today, urged its readers: Do you know who the couple are? Or do you work at the hospital? Call the newsdesk on .         
	Part of the story is certainly true though the initial report that the babies had been abandoned is not borne out, even though the parents might well have expressed disappointment that they were girls. Whatever the truth the parents will now have to endure trial by tabloids.         
	A spokesman for NHS West Midlands confirmed today: Twin girls were born at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, earlier this month by Caesarean section. Shortly after birth, the babies were transferred to a unit in Birmingham closer to where their parents live.         
	The spokesman said: The parents are visiting their daughters whilst they are being cared for in hospital and are attentive to their needs. For patient confidentiality reasons, the identities of the family and the babies are not being disclosed. The identity of the hospital is not being disclosed. We are not aware of a referral to social services.         
	Birmingham City Council also confirmed today there had been no referral to social services  meaning the parents had done nothing for which they could be punished.         
	However, there remains the moral question of whether a man and a woman, aged 72 and 59, should have sought In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), the technique where fertilisation of the egg and sperm takes place outside the body.         
	IVF treatment on the NHS is subject to guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which recommend a mother judged eligible should be offered up to three cycles of IVF if she is between 23 and 39 years old at the time of treatment.         
	The cost of an IVF cycle, if sought privately, varies from 2,000 to 7,000 depending on the clinic.         
	According to The Sun, the Indian couple told horrified medics they did not want the wrong sex babies immediately after the Caesarean section in Wolverhampton. The husband then asked how soon it would be before his wife was fit enough to fly out again for further IVF in the hope of getting a boy to continue the family name.         
	An NHS insider apparently told The Sun: Everyone is utterly appalled. How could any parent do this? This is Britain in the 21st century.         
	The paper explained to its English readers: Female babies are often abandoned in India for being the wrong sex  but it is the first time here. It will send shock waves of revulsion through multi-cultural Britain.         
	In its editorial, The Sun said: The story of the abandoned IVF twins is deeply disturbing. Baby girls dumped in an NHS maternity ward by their Indian-born parents  simply because they are not boys. It is incredible this has happened in modern Britain.         
	It went on: A Birmingham woman of 59 has IVF treatment in her Indian homeland because she is too old for it here. She returns for the births, then dumps the babies as if throwing out rubbish. Her 72-year-old husband cares only about returning to India for more IVF. Such callousness, such pitiless selfishness, tears at the heart of our most human instincts.         
	It concluded: These parents, if they can be called that, are British citizens. But all of Britain should be disgusted by their behaviour. Abandoning children is a crime.         
	Meanwhile, the Daily Mail told its readers: In certain Asian cultures, sons are more highly prized than daughters because it is believed they will work from a younger age and carry on the family name. In India, girls are considered an economic burden as their parents traditionally need to provide a dowry payment for them when they get married  often resulting in financial ruin or extreme hardship for many families when the women marry.         
	The paper said that, according to research, between 1990 and 2005, about 1,500 fewer girls were born to Indian mothers living in England and Wales than would have been statistically probable for this group.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Narayanan                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Indian mission in Colombo today admitted to a serious lapse in national security adviser M.K. Narayanans security during the weekend Saarc summit.        
	The attention of this high commission has been drawn to media reports regarding the cover to the national security adviser. The high commission wishes to state that there was a serious lapse in that. Some of the arrangements discussed and agreed to in advance did not get implemented on the ground, a statement released in Colombo said today.        
	Sri Lankan media reports had quoted sources as saying that Narayanans guards, car and escort vehicles did not turn up at the Saarc conference hall on August 2, forcing him to take a cab to his hotel and expose himself to risks.        
	Lankan security authorities have apologised to Narayanan and the matter is now considered closed, the statement said, adding it is not the practice of the high commission to comment on security issues in detail.         
	Narayanan had accompanied Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the summit.         
	The mission said the security lapse was discussed immediately with Lankan authorities and remedial measures taken jointly.         
	Narayanans security breach had come with the scare of a Sri Lankan police officer running with a gun after the Prime Ministers convoy as it was leaving President Mahinda Rajapaksas palace on August 2.         
	The officer had been assigned to Singh. It turned out that he had been missing when the Prime Minister got into the car and came running later to catch up with the convoy.

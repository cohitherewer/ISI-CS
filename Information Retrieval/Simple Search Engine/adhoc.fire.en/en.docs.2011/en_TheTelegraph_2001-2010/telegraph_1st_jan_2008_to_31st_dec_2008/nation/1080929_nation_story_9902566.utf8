                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Meet on terror, pinch on pocket
  - Infiltrators invade Advani rally          RASHEED KIDWAI                                                  
	Bhopal, Sept. 28: While L.K. Advani was thundering against terror here last week, infiltrators at his rally reached out to his flock in a way his oratory could not.        
	The BJP councillor from Neemach, Yashwant Jain, was feeling a tug at his heartstrings every time Advani sounded off about the security of the motherland  so the little tug at his hip escaped him.        
	As the shadow Prime Minister demanded the return of terror law Pota, Jain, getting goose pimples by now, slid his hand into his kurta pocket.        
	Seconds later he had completely lost track of what Advani was saying. Jains wallet was gone, along with Rs 3,000 in cash and three ATM cards.        
	What Jain or Advani call election time, Bhopals pickpockets call season. The citys famed finger artists have been second to none in their eager participation in the electioneering that kicked off last week in the run-up to the November Assembly polls.        
	Their attention didnt flag when Rajnath Singh toyed with the idea of shooting anyone waving the Pakistani flag in Kashmir. And by the time Advani had finished counting the 2.38 lakh rallyists at Jamboree Park on Thursday, they were counting the money from a dozen wallets equally happily.        
	When Jain went to a nearby police station, he was told he was lucky to still have his fancy cellphone.        
	Soon after Advani left, Sriniwas Pandey, who had come from Barkheda Pathani, was heard cursing loudly  but not the terrorists. Pandey had been cleaned out of Rs 11,200 and three bank cards.        
	Unconfirmed reports said Bhopal boasted a pickpockets academy where ustads trained youngsters, mostly drug peddlers. Its easier to pick pockets in crowded places, so election rallies are ideal, said Pawan Mishra, former officer-in-charge of Jahangirabad police station.        
	With more rallies slated from next week, sources said, the ustads were recruiting fresh batches of trainees.        
	The season had a brisk start on Monday, when Uma Bharti stunned the Congress and the BJP with a mammoth show of strength. The police said 10 people were left equally stunned when they reached into their pockets.        
	Mishra suggested the numbers could be higher, saying many political activists were too embarrassed or resigned to lodge complaints.        
	A senior officer estimated pickpockets business at rallies could be worth at least Rs 20 lakh in cash and an equal amount in mobile phones till November.        
	He added that pickpockets were the pampered princes among Bhopals thieves. That many are drug addicts serves as a blessing. Officers dont want to detain or beat them, fearing their poor health could lead to death.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian art in Sothebys summer of records
          AMIT ROY                           The untitled sculpture by Anish Kapoor that sold for around Rs 16.5 crore at Sothebys on Tuesday, a new auction record for the artist                                   
	London, July 2: The scene: the auction room at Sothebys. The room is packed with well-heeled buyers, mostly middle-aged and elderly men who have been dealing in art all their lives.         
	Lining the walls beneath some of the paintings on sale are men and women, the latter invariably very young and very pretty, hanging on to receivers as rich collectors somewhere in the world make their bids by telephone. Everyone is dressed in their best. The bottled water, courtesy of Sothebys, is free.         
	Lot number 15 is under the hammer: Subodh Guptas untitled painting of good old-fashioned Indian cooking utensils.         
	On the previous day at Christies, three of his works, including Curry 2, a piece of installation art featuring cooking utensils neatly stacked on a metal rack, had fetched a total of 951,750 (around Rs 8 crore).         
	On an electronic board, the prices were displayed in pounds, dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars. By and by, the prices may be displayed in Indian rupees as well.         
	At Sothebys last night, Gupta, whose home state is Bihar, was playing in the big league.         
	A Damien Hirst painting had sold before him for 1.2 million (excluding extras), followed by the star of the evening  Francis Bacons Study for Head of George Dyer which sold for 13,761,250, well in excess of the pre-sale guide estimate in excess of 8 million, the auctioneers said.         
	Also before him, an untitled sculpture from 2003 by Anish Kapoor had gone for 1,945,250 (around Rs 16.5 crore) after being hotly contested by three bidders on the telephone, according to Sothebys.         
	This price represents a new auction record for the Mumbai-born artist. The stunning piece  which soared above its pre-sale estimate of 1,000,000-1,500,000  embodies the pioneering manipulation of space and material that characterises the very best output of this world-renowned sculptor. Untitled is one of the largest of Kapoors alabaster works and the first double-concave piece to come to auction.         
	The auctioneer starts the bidding for Gupta at 300  thats 300,000, by the way. Then it climbs rapidly for the auctioneer has 75 lots to get through within a couple of hours: 300 350 400 420 450 480 500.         
	He bangs the table at 500,000. This is not the sale price, though. With various taxes and commissions, the buyer has to pay another 100,000.         
	Subodh Guptas untitled from 2005 soared above its pre-sale estimate of 200,000-300,000, selling for 601,250 (Rs 5.11 crore), said Sothebys.         
	The untitled canvas, depicting a vessel stall glistening in the pink dawn of sunrise, is one of Guptas most important and powerful photo-realist paintings to ever come to the market.         
	His wifes work of a horrible looking hyena, apparently inspired by Hirst, fetched 75,650 (around Rs 64.3 lakh) against an estimate of 40,000-60,000.         
	It was Bharti Khers first appearance in a Sothebys Evening Sale of Contemporary Art and her sculpture Misdemeanours, which is executed in fibreglass, wood and fur, saw bidding from six bidders, said Sothebys.                   Francis Bacon rsquo;s Study for Head of George Dyer, the star of the Sotheby rsquo;s auction on Tuesday    
	At the end of the evening, the auction house said: Sothebys evening sale of Contemporary Art realised a phenomenal 94,701,550  making it the most successful summer sale of Contemporary Art ever held in Europe.         
	In a room filled to capacity, many of the works offered soared beyond expectations, with over 66.2 per cent of the works sold achieving prices in excess of high estimate.         
	It also said: Andy Warhols Portrait of John McEnroe and Tatum Neal sold for 241,250. The work was consigned to the sale by John McEnroe, who will be donating proceeds to Habitat for Humanity.         
	Cheyenne Westphal, chairman of contemporary art, Sothebys Europe, and Oliver Barker, senior international specialist, Sothebys contemporary art department, issued a statement: We are elated with the results of the sale, the highest ever summer sale of Contemporary Art in Europe.         
	We saw 11 records tumble, including ones for Antony Gormley, Bridget Riley, Richard Prince and Anish Kapoor, in front of a hugely energetic and packed saleroom.        
	We are also extremely happy with the result achieved for the group of 12 works from the Lauffs Collection, which achieved a total of 18.9 million, almost triple its pre-sale low estimate of 6.4 million, they added.         
	Once again, we are witnesses to a market that is driven by art lovers. Buyers have confidence in the artworks they are competing for, and have shown unprecedented determination to win the lots which they desire.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 20: A day after his minister commanded the judiciary to stay within its Laxman rekha (limit), Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today asked his cabinet colleagues to desist from making such comments on courts verdicts.        
	He pointed out that there was no need for his cabinet colleagues to draw the Laxman rekha (limit) on the courts behalf. Patna high court recently had declared the Bihar capital as a urban slum, while hearing a PIL and had lashed out at the government for its alleged failure to curb waterlogging in the city.        
	Peeved at the courts remark, urban development minister Bhola Prasad Singh said: The judiciary should not cross it limits, when commenting on the governments performance. It should not cross the Laxman rekha. The minister added that the court should have first made a not of the governments efforts before commenting on its performance.        
	However, disassociating himself from his ministers remark, Nitish Kumar said: The minister spoke in his personal capacity and the government does not approve of what the minister said.        
	The chief minister suggested that his cabinet colleagues desist from making similar comments on courts observations. Nitish kumar admitted: Patna is struggling with waterlogging. There is a population pressure on us. And there are resource constraints. The court only expressed an opinion.  
	Back-to-back  
	Patna High Court:							 Govt to blame  
	 Urban development   minister Bhola Prasad Singh to court:   Please stay in your limits  
	Nitish to Singh: Desist from such comments

  - Tribal school demands govt recognition        PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Students beg at Bhubaneswar railway station on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 11: Naveen babu amdo okarey (Naveen Patnaik where are you)? cried out hundreds of tribal students while begging for alms at railway station here this morning.        
	The 300-odd students, who have hit the streets to press for their demands of recognition of their school at Mayurbhanj, have run out of food now. With nowhere to go, the students have started begging at several places, including temples, to manage funds for their stay here till the chief minister calls them for a discussion.        
	We are begging now to collect money at least enough for lunch. We will be begging again for dinner, said Rani Kisku, a Class X student of Sarbasakha Jagakalia Residential School. She added that the collection has reached Rs 263, certainly not enough to give proper lunch to all.        
	The Scheduled Caste (SC) nd Scheduled Tribe (ST) students from Mayurbhanj  about 300km from here  have been camping here since the past week. We have run out of food and dont have enough money for return bus fare, said Tarini Munda, another student.        
	The students of the school at Sanparas village in Mayurbhanj districts Raruan block have been demanding of taking over of the school by the SC amp;ST welfare department. The students and their guardians accompanying them are determined not to budge till the government listens to their plea. We are prepared to face the tough situation and beg everyday till Naveen babu listens and accords recognition to our school, says Bichitrananda Mishra, a guardian.        
	Several enquires have been conducted and correspondences were made with the government since 1998 for taking over of the management of the residential school  set up in 1995  run by donation from villagers at present.        
	The institution, which is under the tribal sub-plan block area, has classes from I to X with hostel facilities for both boys and girls.        
	However, now the school management is not being able to provide quality food to the 600-odd students because of paucity of funds and on the other hand not being able to close the school as a number of students are dependent on it. A recognition from the SC amp; ST welfare department will solve the problems and we have been demanding it for years, said Rosalin Mishra, a teacher. But we are still in dark why the department is hesitant to look into our genuine demands. Either way, our students will beg; so why not beg here, she rued.        
	Its strange that the chief minister has no time for us but we are also determined to make our voices heard, said Jemma Nayak, another student, saying that they have plans to beg at Ram Mandir this evening.

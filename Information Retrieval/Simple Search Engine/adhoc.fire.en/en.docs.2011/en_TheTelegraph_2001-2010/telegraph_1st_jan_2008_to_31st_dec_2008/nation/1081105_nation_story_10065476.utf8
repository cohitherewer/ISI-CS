	Taste of Nizams in cutlery show    
	Tongues still wag at stories about their food 200 years ago. Now the Nizams cutlery seems set to whet appetites.    
	The cups, saucers, bowls and plates have been dug out of Nazri Bagh in King Kothi, where they had been dumped, to be dusted and polished before peoples eyes feast on them.    
	The sixth Nizam, Mir Mahboob Ali Pasha, and his successor Mir Osman Ali Khan had acquired crockery from Germany, Turkey, London and Australia. A hall, large enough for 50 to eat together, is being done up at the Chowmahalla Palace. This is to be let out for social events where guests can marvel at the cutlery over Hyderabadi biryani.    
	The display is being worked out and will be thrown open soon, said Chowmahalla Palace director Kishan Rao.     
	The Nizams were well known for their parties, many held at the picturesque Chowmahalla and Falaknuma palaces for nobles and foreign guests. One Falaknuma mansion had a dining table to seat 100, embellished with gold and crystal tableware.        
	From tarmac to talks table    
	Step off the plane and rush into the power-point representation.    
	The Karnataka government has lined up an international convention centre near the new Bengaluru airport, a facility that could be a big draw with jet-setting barons who dont have the time to be driven to a venue in the city, more than 50km away.    
	Such visitors are not exactly a rarity in Bangalore, touted as Indias Silicon Valley whose clients are largely based abroad and high-stakes negotiations are frequent.    
	Tourism minister G. Janardhana Reddy said recently that 35 acres had been identified for the project.    
	The convention centre with a state-of-the-art auditorium, a five-star hotel and other facilities is expected to be ready in about three years, he said. The project is estimated to cost Rs 300 crore. (PTI)    
	Speed scan on BEST drivers    
	Mumbais driving crackdown is shifting gears, from cars to buses.    
	The traffic police turned to BEST drivers following a sharp rise in accidents  20 deaths since April  involving these buses.     
	After complaints from citizens, the police recently sent a notice to the corporation, warning them that stringent action would be taken against their drivers if they werent disciplined.     
	The letter was widely seen as an attempt to tighten the screws on the drivers, with the officers mincing no words that the drivers licences would be cancelled permanently if they were caught speeding more than twice.    
	The focus on BEST follows a years drive against drink driving, triggered by a spate of accidents caused by tipsy drivers in 2006. During the campaign, flying squads had swooped down on arterial roads, especially on weekends, to put passing motorists to breath-analyser tests.     
	Around 22,000 cases were registered, with 8,000 motorists sent behind bars and over 8,200 lost licences. The result has been a decline in the pernicious trend this year.        
	Metro model     
	Delhi Metro is being looked up to for traffic tips elsewhere.    
	The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is set to prepare a detailed project report for mass-rapid transit systems in Lucknow and Kanpur to solve the transport problems in the two Uttar Pradesh cities, an official said.    
	It will take six months to draw up the blueprint, after which the Uttar Pradesh government will require another six months to mop up financial resources for the projects. (PTI)

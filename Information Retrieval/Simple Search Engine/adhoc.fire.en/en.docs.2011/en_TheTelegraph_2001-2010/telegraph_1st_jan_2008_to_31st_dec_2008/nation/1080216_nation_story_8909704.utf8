The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Film fest with difference
                                                                                                               Film fest with difference
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: Welcome to the platform for the new-age filmmakers. There is no jury and no hierarchy here.         
	Bring Your Own Film Festival (Byoff), an event set to start in Puri from February 21 to 25, is far from formal. The festival started in 2004 by a bunch of young filmmakers is a unique event. It welcomes all filmmakers to screen their work without the selection process, jury or award.        
	The five-day event, being hosted in association with the Bhubaneswar-based Inscreen Film Society, is slated to screen over 140 films of several genres and from 20 countries, said festival co-ordinator and independent filmmaker Kapilas Bhuyan.        
	About 500 delegates comprising filmmakers, film buffs, critics, artists and journalists from India and abroad would be in the temple town for the show this year.        
	To call Byoff to call it just a film festival is to limit it. Like America, which has its Sundance Film Festival, in India a bunch of filmmakers and enthusiasts felt the need for free space where independent filmmakers could gather, show their work, exchange thoughts, ideas, information and experiences.         
	Bhuyan adds: While digital technology has made film making accessible to many people, once a film is made there are not enough platforms where films, some of them really wonderful, can be screened.We believe that our attempts would go a long way in giving a boost to the cause of independent, documentary, short-fiction and feature filmmakers. We would especially like to encourage younger people who find it difficult to promote themselves, said Bhuyan.        
	The main idea of the fest is to have a festival away from the oppressive bureaucratic red tape present in the bigger cities. Byoff encourages not just filmmakers but artistes from a variety of fields, including music, theatre, painting, sculpture, dance, literature and photography, to showcase their work.        
	Screenings go for most part of the day in makeshift tents and in open-air after sunset.         
	For filmmakers, it has been an alternative platform ever since its first edition in the year 2004.

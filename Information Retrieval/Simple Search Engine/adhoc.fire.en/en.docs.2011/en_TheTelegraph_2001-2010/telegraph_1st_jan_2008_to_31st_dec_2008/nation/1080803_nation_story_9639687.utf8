          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chhindwara, Aug. 2: Madhya Pradesh police today said they suspected that the two boys found dead at Asaram Bapus ashram in Chhindwara had been murdered by an insider.        
	All evidence collected from the scene of crime is in our custody. In the coming 48 hours, we will produce the culprits before the media and the people, inspector-general of Jabalpur zone, M.R. Krishna, told a news conference.         
	Senior police officials on the case said they had reached two conclusions: that Ram Krishna Yadav, 4, and Vedant Manmodhe, 5, had died of suffocation and that the suspected murders were inside jobs, suggesting that either a senior student or a staff member could be involved. However, the police were not sure of the motive, sources said.        
	Doctors who conducted Vedants post-mortem termed his death unnatural. Police sources said several marks were found on his body.        
	About 200 people have been interrogated, the police said.         
	The police today sealed Asaram Bapus Induwati Vidyaniketan ashram and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan ordered a high-level probe.         
	Schoolteacher Manohar Jaiswal and hostel warden Om Prakash Prajapati have been detained.         
	On July 29, Ram Krishna was found unconscious in the ashrams bathroom. He died before he could reach hospital. On July 31, Vedant, 5, was found dead with his head submerged in a bucket of water. Both boys were students of the ashram school.         
	Asaram Bapu is the spiritual guru of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and BJP leader L.K. Advani.

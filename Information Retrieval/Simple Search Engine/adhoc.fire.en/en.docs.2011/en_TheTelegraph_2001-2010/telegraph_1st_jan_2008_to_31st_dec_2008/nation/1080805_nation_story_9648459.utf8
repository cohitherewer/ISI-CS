  - Manmohan pledges $450m aid, war against terror         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karzai with Singh and President Pratibha Patil at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: India today announced a fresh aid of $450 million to Afghanistan for development projects as the two countries vowed to launch a joint attack on terror.        
	The announcement came weeks after a deadly attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul, which Manmohan Singh termed an attack on the friendship of India and Afghanistan at a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.        
	We have agreed that we will not allow terrorism to stand in our way. We will fight it unitedly and with full determination, the Prime Minister said in his statement.        
	We will fulfil all our commitments to Afghanistan... we will allocate an additional amount of $450 million over and above the existing $750 million to meet the requirements of our ongoing and forthcoming projects.        
	With this announcement, Indias total financial commitment to Afghanistan stands at $1.2 billion, equal to that of Germany. The US, UK and the European Union are Afghanistans three biggest donors.        
	Singh told Karzai, who arrived last night on a two-day visit, that a key infrastructure project India had undertaken in west Afghanistan  the highway from Zaranj to Delaram  was complete and would be handed over to that country soon.        
	Terming the highway a symbol of Indias co-operation with Afghanistan and a tribute to the precious Indian and Afghan lives that were lost in making this project a reality, Singh said the road had brought the peoples of the two countries closer.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to travel to Afghanistan soon to hand over the 218km highway built by the Border Roads Organisation.        
	Karzai, too, called for a joint fight against terror. He thanked India and the Indian people profusely for the assistance at a very critical juncture in the history of Afghanistan.        
	India has proved to be a valuable ally and is in the forefront of rebuilding Afghanistan, he said.        
	The Afghan President also alluded to a wide range of activities  building roads and schools to constructing dams, power transmission lines and the parliament building  in which nearly 3,000 Indian workers are involved.        
	The two leaders reviewed the security of the Indian mission in Kabul and the consulates in Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharief, and agreed to upgrade it in view of the threat perception from a resurgent Taliban.        
	The two countries and the world at large have no option but to fight the menace of terrorism. Afghanistan stands resolutely with our allies in the war against terrorism, Karzai said.        
	He said the task of eliminating terrorism was a moral responsibility of all concerned countries in the region and the world. Together, India and Afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism, of cold-blooded, brutal, murderous activity in our two countries.        
	At the Saarc summit in Colombo on Saturday, Karzai had portrayed Pakistan as a country in the grip of sanctuaries of terror and spoken of institutional nurturing of extremists in the region.        
	In Pakistan, terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto, he had said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: The BJP almost appeared crestfallen as finance minister P. Chidambaram announced the sops for farmers.        
	Its leaders tried to put up some fight by crying that it was too little too late, but the tax relief to the middle class left them speechless.        
	Later, the partys official reaction harped on the too-little-too-late theme. L.K. Advani almost reluctantly asked Chidambaram why he had not helped farmers and the common man to this extent during the past four years.        
	Instead of evaluating todays budget proposals, Advani recalled how the aam aadmi and aam aurat had suffered in the past four years.        
	Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said in a statement that the loan waiver for the farmers was on expected lines.        
	He acknowledged that the waiver was the single most important highlight of this budget but said it had come too late, after hundreds of farmers had committed suicide.        
	Like the Left, he mentioned that the farmers who had taken loans from private moneylenders had received no relief. He was disappointed that the government had not met the demand to reduce the interest on farm loan to 4 per cent.        
	Sinha doubted if the waiver could be implemented by the June 30 deadline. He argued that the countrys revenue records were in a shambles and the Centre would have to depend on the states to prepare the list of beneficiaries, which would take a long time.        
	The BJP felt the finance minister had abandoned the reforms agenda and done nothing on inflation, exchange-rate management and infrastructure.         
	Sinha said the economic survey had indicated a slowdown but the government had chosen to ignore the signals. He said the budget did not suggest that the government was prepared for the bigger challenges the economy faced, or that it had the potential to push growth.        
	Advani, who issued a separate statement, also raised the issue of communal budgeting.        
	I am surprised at the heavy communal overtones of the budget, he said.

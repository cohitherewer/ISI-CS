	New Delhi, Jan. 21: India and the UK today said they would collaborate to implement security measures on mass transport systems in their countries and promote cooperation in civil nuclear energy. 
    
	Both countries have been victims of terror attacks on their public transport systems  the London Underground was attacked on July 7, 2005, and seven Mumbai local trains were hit by blasts in July 2006.
    
	The decision to cooperate on protection of national infrastructure is part of the joint statement signed by the two Prime Ministers, Gordon Brown and Manmohan Singh. The statement stresses the importance of international counter-terrorism efforts.
    
	Brown said Britain would support Indias claim for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, a stand the UK had announced in the past but deemed fit to emphasise during its Prime Ministers visit. 
    
	The joint statement, along with a joint news conference, was one of the loudest proclamations of friendship that Britain and India have made. Brown even used the news conference to congratulate the Indian cricket team on its victory over Australia in Perth and suggest Sachin Tendulkars name for knighthood. 
    
	He said he would not decide whether the prolific batsman would be called Sir Sachin but that there was a case for Britain to honour sportsmen. If Donald Bradman could be awarded the honour, there was a strong case for Tendulkar, too.
    
	I believe it was a good tradition to celebrate the achievements of the great Commonwealth cricketers. It shows we are good sports and I would like to see some of the great players of the modern era, like Sachin Tendulkar, proposed for honorary awards so that the British nation can salute their achievements in one of our national sports, Brown said.
    
	On reforming the UN, the British Prime Minister said: We have agreed that it is in the interest of both our countries and the world that international institutions should be reformed for the modern era. 
    
	He added: They need to be equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century and ensure that there are more representatives of the new global order. 
    
	Brown has also called for reforming the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
    
	The joint statement said the UK supported the India-US civil nuclear cooperation initiative and an India-specific exemption in the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines.
    
	The Prime Ministers had a lengthy discussion on the security situation in South Asia. Both hoped that the February 18 elections in Pakistan would be fair. On Myanmar, they agreed that political reform should be inclusive and broad-based. India and the UK want Iran to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and address concerns about its nuclear programme.
    
	The joint statement said India and the UK shared a strategic partnership that they were committed to deepening and strengthening.

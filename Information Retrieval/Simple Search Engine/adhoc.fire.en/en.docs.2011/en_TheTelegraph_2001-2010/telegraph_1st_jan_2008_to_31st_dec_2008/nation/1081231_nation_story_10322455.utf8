The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Robbed BJP fingerprints all

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: A missing Rs 2.6 crore hardly compares with a fodder scam or a Tehelka. But for once, a political party seems to have accepted that one of its own could be a suspect.        
	All staff at the BJP headquarters, and the party workers and officials who frequent it, are being fingerprinted after the sum vanished from a safe in the locked accounts office at 11 Ashoka Road over Christmas.        
	The party has hired private detectives instead of Sheila Dikshits police, probably to avoid publicity and embarrassment, especially since a few senior functionaries are among the suspects.        
	A leader close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh brought in an astrologer today to try and figure out who the thief was. The party had earlier got Vaastu experts to remodel the office after the 2004 election rout.        
	The detectives have dusted the safe and the door of the room to get fingerprints, and grilled all the 60-odd junior staff members.        
	How can we have access to the safe? grumbled a junior employee waiting his turn to be fingerprinted. Only a select few had the keys. Its not easy to open the lock, it needs more than one key. Only a top guy could have taken the money.        
	Neither the safe nor the lock on the door of the room right next to party chief Rajnath Singhs office  are damaged. Deputy accounts officer Nalin Tandon, who discovered the theft on Friday, has not resumed his role in the accounts office though he has come to work every day, sources said.        
	The money was left over from the sum sanctioned for the Delhi elections, and had been deposited by a general secretary on Wednesday, the sources added. One puzzle is, the thieves apparently left behind more than they took.        
	Embarrassed party leaders tried the plea that it could all just be a failure to match accounts. Whatever has appeared in the media is exaggerated. BJP treasurer and MP Ramdas Aggarwal is back in Delhi and will conduct a reconciliation of all accounts to verify if there was any theft, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

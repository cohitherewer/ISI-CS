	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: Panic and discomfort were writ large on the face of Sania Jani, as she was waiting in a serpentine queue for collecting ration in the violence-hit Phulbani town today.        
	For Sania, 52, the three-hour breather  from 3pm to 6pm  was a freedom that villagers like him have been looking forward to since Sunday when curfew was clamped following the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on Saturday night.        
	We have no rice or vegetables left in the house, as all shops are closed since Sunday. I am afraid whether I will be able to reach the counter before curfew being reimposed, he said. Or else, I will have to face lathis and return home empty-handed.        
	Ranjan Sahu, another villager, said the prices of vegetables and other food stuff had skyrocketed with the town being cut off from the rest of the state for the past four days. Potato, which was priced at Rs 7 a kg last week, is now sold at Rs 15 a kg. The price of onion has soared to Rs 20 from Rs 12 per kg. Beans are being sold at Rs 25 instead of Rs 8 per kg, he added.        
	Fish is not available in the market, as the import from Andhra Pradesh has stopped due to curfew, said a fish trader. Mutton has been dearer with the price soaring up to Rs 300 per kg from Rs 160 last week, said Jivan Mohanty, a local resident. As the petrol pumps were also closed, petrol is sold in black market at Rs 70-80 per litre.         
	A senior official of the district administration said steps were taken to ensure availability of food materials to the residents during relaxation of curfew and actions would be taken against hoarders.        
	On the other hand, Christian families in the town are living under constant fear and panic. The church in Phulbani and several houses of minority communities had been ransacked, said a person belonging to minority community on condition of anonymity. Even the motorcycle of a minority was set ablaze by a mob.        
	Several Christian families  out of 47 residing in the district headquarters since decades  have been attacked.        
	According to official records, more than 500 houses, 15 vehicles and 25 prayer houses have been burnt or damaged in the district in the communal violence. At Sankarakhole, a church was set on fire by a mob, said Father Alexander. The church inmates and villagers fled to nearby forest, he said. Churches at Tikabali and Tenganapathar have also borne the brunt of mob fury.         
	Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahu said 48 platoons of police force, including two platoons of Rapid Action Force, were deployed in the district to prevent any further violence.

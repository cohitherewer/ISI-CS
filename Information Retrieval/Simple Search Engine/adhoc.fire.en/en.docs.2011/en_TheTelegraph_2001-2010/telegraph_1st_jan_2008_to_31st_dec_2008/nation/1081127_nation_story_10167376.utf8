          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 26: The government is yet to consider the demands of the agitating shiksha sahayaks, even as their hunger strike entered the sixth day today.        
	Squatting on the busy Mahatma Gandhi Marg leading to the Assembly, thousands of para-teachers on mass leave under the banner of the Odisha Siksha Sahayak Sangh, have been pressing for regularisation of their jobs.         
	Minaketan Das, the association president, rued that the government had all along adopted apathetic attitude towards their problems and demands.         
	We have started hunger strike and decided to intensify stir until our major demands are met, said its secretary Bibhuprasad Mohanty.

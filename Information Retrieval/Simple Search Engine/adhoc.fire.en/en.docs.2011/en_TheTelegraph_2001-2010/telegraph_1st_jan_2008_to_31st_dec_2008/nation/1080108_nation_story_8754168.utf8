	Jamua (Giridih), Jan. 7: The Jharkhand Mukhti Morcha chief Shibu Soren said today he would not seek votes from the people of Jharkhand any more.
    
	The chairperson of the state United Progressive Alliance, addressing a chetna (awakening) rally of the party here, declared that he would not ask vote from people any more as in the first Assembly election of the state people did not listen to him, who fought and spent his life for the separate state.
    
	After 40 years when the election was held for the first time, you did not give vote to us and our party, who has been your ancestral one. Therefore, I would not ask vote from you anymore, said the JMM chief at the circus ground in Jamua, 35km from the headquarters.
    
	An emotional Soren further said: But I have fought for you people and if again anything happens to you, I will receive the first bullet.
    
	In the first Assembly elections of Jharkhand the JMM could only get 17 seats despite having alliance with the Congress. The BJP bagged 30 seats.
    
	The JMM has been considering itself as the ancestral party of Jharkhand and it was like a huge setback for them. 
    
	In his 40-minute speech Soren laid stress on awakening people and his contributions to the state rather than criticising the opposition parties. 
    
	After 40 years of fight I have given you a separate state and now it is up to you to build it. There are thousands of youths here, they should know that they have got more responsibility on their shoulders, said the Dumka MP. Soren also reminded people that he had a clear idea about entire Jamua as he had ventured into all the areas of the block during the Jharkhand agitation. 
    
	Today, Soren treated himself more as a native of Jharkhand than a political leader. 
    
	When the reporters asked Soren after the rally if his pledge for not seeking vote meant he would not take any ministerial post in the state or at the Centre, he said, What I had to say, I have said.
    
	Earlier, the JMM chief made people wait for more than four hours as he arrived at the venue at 3.30pm instead of the scheduled 11 am.
    
	After the rally, in an administration programme he distributed compensatory appointment letters to four of the 20 killed in the Chilkhari carnage in October 2007. Besides the four kin of the Chilkhari carnage victims, eight others were also given appointment letters.

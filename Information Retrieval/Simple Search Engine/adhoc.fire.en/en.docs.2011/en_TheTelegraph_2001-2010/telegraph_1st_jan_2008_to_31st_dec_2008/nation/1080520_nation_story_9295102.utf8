	Anti-puffs new ambassador    
	Guess who is anti-smoking crusader Anbumani Ramadosss ambassador for the cause  Rajnikant!    
	The Union health minister is very pleased that the Tamil superstar was not seen puffing in his last two movies.    
	Ramadoss got flak from Bollywood for telling stars to avoid smoking and drinking scenes in movies.     
	In Rajnikants no-smoking acts now, Ramadoss has found the right campaign. When Rajnikant can do movies without smoking, why cant anybody else follow?he asked.     
	Rajnikants latest movies  Sivaji-The Boss and Chandramukhi  had no scene showing him lighting up and these were the biggest blockbusters in recent times, Ramadoss pointed out.      
	Dhoom gang behind bars    
	They had thought of pulling off a bike-and-robbery stunt like John Abraham in Dhoom.     
	So, on October 21, 2004, when Bhimrao Prajapati and his colleague withdrew Rs 35 lakh from a bank in south Mumbai and boarded a taxi, they were surrounded by two bikes.They pointed a revolver at Prajapati and took away his gold wristwatch and the bag of cash.     
	But in November the same year, the case was transferred to the CID after frequent robberies by the same gang.     
	Their luck ran out this month when additional sessions judge S.R. Trivedi sentenced two of the seven accused  Harun Mahidaa and Suresh Nayar  to seven years imprisonment with a fine of Rs 3,000 and the third accused, Shahid Asadi, to five years imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000. The three were convicted for conspiracy and robbery.    
	The ending, of course, did not go by the script.      
	Zoo panel shy of jumbos    
	The Central Zoo Authority does not want to look after elephants in circuses.    
	It is too heavy a responsibility considering the frequent instances of violation of norms by the circus owners, it has said. So, the task should be entrusted with the animal welfare board.    
	he zoo authority, in a letter to the environment ministry, said: With the best will in the world, circuses do not have the facilities to keep the animals in the kind of environment that could be considered anywhere acceptable.    
	Circuses, besides zoos in the country, are recognised by the zoo authority, an autonomous body of the environment ministry. There are 21 recognised circuses in the country with 85 jumbos.    
	The circuses should be monitored under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and any violation should be taken seriously, said zoo authority member secretary B.R. Sharma.

	CPMs request    
	The CPM wants the government to seriously consider a matter. No, its got nothing to do with the nuclear deal, but with the possible name for the new airport in Bangalore. The CPM wants to name the airport after Tipu Sultan.     
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, party leader Sitaram Yechury said the new airport was coming up in Devanahalli, which happens to be the birthplace of Tipu Sultan. May I request you to seriously consider naming this airport after Tipu Sultan. This would be a befitting gesture to a person who valiantly fought the British in the 18th century, Yechury said and expressed hope for a favourable response from the government.

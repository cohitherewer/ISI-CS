	Singur, Oct. 7: About 15 members of syndicates that supplied building material to the Nano factory planted placards at gate 5 when news came that Tata Motors was setting up shop in Gujarat.        
	I have just heard that the Nano plant will be set up in Gujarat, said one of the members. This is the worst news.         
	It is a devastating news for Bengal. We are doomed, said Sohrab Ali, a syndicate member from Joymollah.        
	The news came at a time when about 500 people, mostly syndicate members and willing landlosers, were planning to intensify their protest at the Nano project site and were planning to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday. They wanted to tell him that the Tatas should stay in Singur.        
	Now we dont know whether meeting the chief minister is going to be of much help, said Mausam Sahana, a syndicate member.         
	Residents feel todays development will add to the already bitter relations between the willing and unwilling landlosers. It is because of their stubbornness that this is our sorry fate today, said Ashok, who had given 15 cottahs. His brother and cousin were trained and got jobs in the mother plant seven months ago.

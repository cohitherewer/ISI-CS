The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena is voice of Marathis: Thackeray 
                                                                                                            Sena is voice of Marathis: Thackeray 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 8: Bal Thackeray today asserted that the Shiv Sena was the sole representative and the true voice of Marathi aspirations.        
	Lampooning nephew Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena as chicken suffering from the bird flu of depression, without taking names, he said the Shiv Sena had no intention of disengaging Maharashtrian voters despite its inclusiveness towards north Indians.        
	Criticising the attacks of Raj and his supporters on north Indians, particularly Amitabh Bachchan, he said: In trying to portray themselves as crusaders for Mumbai, these boys have behaved in a way that is nothing but a desperate attempt to get free publicity.        
	Without naming the MNS, he said chicken in state politics are suffering from the bird flu of depression and were of no market value.         
	He agreed with Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar that the best way to react to such gimmicks was to ignore them.        
	This is the first time since Sundays violence by MNS workers against north Indian immigrants that Sena chief Thackeray has unambiguously spelt out his partys line.        
	He said the relationship between the party and Maharashtrians had transformed from a political alliance into that of a family over the last 40 years.        
	It is laughable that some people who have quit this family should speak of the welfare of Maharashtrians, he said.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Cuttack, Jan. 13: Silver citys trade people have heaved a sigh of relief with the installation of the state-of-the-art magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) technology, at the Cuttack clearinghouse. 
    
	This technology would, they hope, ensure a quicker payment and settlement system for cheques and demand drafts. Against the couple of days required to clear city cheques and more (five-seven days) for outstation ones, the system hereafter promises to be instant with the new system in place. The facility was previously available only at the SBI clearinghouse in Bhubaneswar.
    
	At present, Cuttack uses manual clearing of cheques. Representatives from banks assemble at the SBI clearinghouse and exchange cheques and arrive at settlement figures. 
    
	The SBI clearinghouse handles (on an average) 5,000-8,000-odd cheques in a day and demand draft to the tune of Rs 15 to 20 crore. Its zone covered all Cuttack and suburb banks.
    
	Speaking at the inaugural function on Saturday, the chief general manager of SBIs Bhubaneswar circle, M.N. Rao, said the new transaction equipment would expedite realisation of cheques, drafts, current accounts and other payments and thus would improve customer service. 
    
	State higher education minister Samir Dey inaugurated the facility.
    
	Cheques or draft clearance is a mind-boggling exercise for bank officials involving many statements and reconciliation data and statistics. The MICR, on the other hand, simplifies every procedure involved.
    
	Rao added the Cuttack system has been designed and developed by Unicis  an USA concern  and would sort out 600 documents per minute.
    
	Reserve Bank of Indias regional director G. Jagamohan Rao said banks in adjoining towns auch as Tangi, Choudwar, Charbatia, Salipur, Mahanga, Chatia and Chandikhole could avail the process.

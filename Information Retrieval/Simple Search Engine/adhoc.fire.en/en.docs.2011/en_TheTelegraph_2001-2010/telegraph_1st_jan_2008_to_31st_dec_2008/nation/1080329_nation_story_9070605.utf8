          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bachchan in Mumbai. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, March 28: Amitabh Bachchan today again responded to Raj Thackerays charge that he had done more for Uttar Pradesh than for Maharashtra, citing Indias Constitution and his own conscience.        
	The Indian Constitution has given me the right to live anywhere in the country. It is my fundamental right, he said on the sidelines of the India International Film Awards function, reaffirming what he had said earlier this week.        
	Everybody has a right to freedom of speech and I only follow the law of the land, the Indian Constitution and my conscience.        
	Bachchans first public reaction to Rajs criticism, levelled at meetings in February, had come in an interview to a city tabloid. The actor had dismissed the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leaders remarks as random and cited his constitutional freedoms.        
	Bachchan, however, refused to comment on a hoarding put up by Rajs supporters in Mumbai that lampooned him as a superstar farmer. and sneered at his withdrawal of a land donation to people displaced by a dam.        
	The actor said he couldnt comment on why he withdrew the donation of the plot in Maval, Pune, since the case was sub judice.        
	The actor had bought the land, open only to farmers under state laws, by getting himself certified a farmer in Uttar Pradesh  a claim a court later rejected.        
	Aamir, SRK good        
	Bachchan said he admired both Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan but refused to say whom he preferred of the two, PTI reported. Aamir and Shah Rukh, both are very good actors and human beings. They are talented and are doing well, Bachchan said when asked about the controversy between the two Khans about who was number one.         
	Asked if he felt he was the number one, Bachchan said he did not figure anywhere.

     NISHIT DHOLABHAI 
             Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Dorjee Khandu at a rally in Itanagar in January 
                 
	New Delhi, March 3: The Centre today assured Parliament that China had been told clearly that Arunachal Pradesh was an integral part of India, trying to silence those questioning the seriousness of its response to Beijings claim to the northeastern state.
    
	Honourable members are aware that Chinese officials have expressed regret at the Prime Ministers visit to Arunachal Pradesh in end-January. The fact that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India has been clearly conveyed to the Chinese side by the government, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a voluntary statement in the Lok Sabha. 
    
	The content of the statement was not very different from the ministers reply to a question in the House last week. But the tone today was more assertive, possibly in response to criticism that the government was handling China with kid gloves.
    
	The Opposition has been haranguing the government for reacting only to media reports on the informal Chinese protest that followed Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh.
    
	Even in 2006, the general impression was that the government had made a statement under pressure from the Opposition against Chinas claim to parts of Arunachal Pradesh. 
    
	BJP president Rajnath Singh conceded that the tone and tenor of the governments statements had changed, but said this is not enough.
    
	He was even less appreciative of the governments response when the topic came up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha earlier in the day.
    
	The BJP chief said not only did the Prime Minister not cancel his visit to Beijing in January, the government did not bother to say that it was unfriendly of China to eye parts of Arunachal Pradesh.
    
	The MP from Arunachal Pradesh (East), Tapir Gao, said it took visits to China by the Prime Minister, the external affairs minister and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi for the government to realise how serious the Chinese were about Arunachal Pradesh. They had not taken it so seriously earlier. 
    
	Mukherjees eight-page statement today began by describing Delhis relationship with Beijing. He said the Prime Minister visited Arunachal Pradesh to assure residents that the government was aware of their needs and ready to assist them through a series of projects. Gao said the Prime Minister should make a statement in Parliament. 
    
	Mukherjee is scheduled to visit China later this year and his Chinese counterpart is expected to make a trip to Delhi.

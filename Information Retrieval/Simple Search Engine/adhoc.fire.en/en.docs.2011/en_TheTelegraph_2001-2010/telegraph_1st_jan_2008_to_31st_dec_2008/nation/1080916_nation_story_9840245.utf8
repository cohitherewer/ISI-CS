          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Supreme Court today threw out a petition by the Deendar Anjuman challenging the legality of a ban imposed on it under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.         
	The outfit, founded in 1924, was allegedly involved in church blasts across south India in the year 2000.        
	A tribunal headed by a high court judge had on February 28 upheld the home ministrys fourth notification extending the ban. The Hyderabad-based Deendar, which advocates mass conversion to Islam, was first banned in 2001.         
	Its lawyer, Mushtaque Ahmed, claimed that the tribunals decision was based on old evidence brought against Deendar in 2001.        
	But the apex court said it was enough that 20 witnesses  mostly intelligence officials  from four states had deposed against the organisation.         
	The first three bans have attained finality, how can you challenge the fourth? the judges asked. You are an undesirable organisation.        
	The counsel argued: There is no documentary evidence against us.        
	The court said: You are associated with the Andhra, Goa, Karnataka blasts with militancy and jihad.

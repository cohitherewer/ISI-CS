                                                                                                            Patient sent off to morgue
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Jan. 28: A doctor of a Samastipur government hospital, who declared a 12-year-old patient dead and sent him for post-mortem on January 26, might face suspension.         
	Samastipur administration has issued a showcause to the doctor in question asking him to reply by this evening.         
	B.P. Roy, a deputy superintendent of Sadar hospital, allegedly declared Aslam (12) dead at 3.40pm on January 26 and sent him for a post-mortem after completing hospital paperwork, which is done before an autopsy.         
	Aslam had fallen off a train on the Samastipur-Barauni line near Gumti number 49 at Belari village under Ujiyarpur block on the morning of January 22. Villagers admitted an unconscious Aslam to the hospital on January 22 afternoon.         
	Roy, who was attending to him, reportedly found no movement and could not feel his pulse on January 26 afternoon. He then prepared for his outpatient department slip and sent the body for post-mortem.         
	Fortunately some reporters, on a routine trip to the hospital, found the boys eyelids moving. District magistrate N. Srawan Kumar was informed about the gross negligence before Aslam could be taken to the post-mortem table.         
	The patient was then rushed to the emergency ward and was provided life-support. He regained consciousness today for a brief time and could tell a doctor his name. He, however, has been unable to provide his full address. Roy was not available for comments today. He, however, admitted to some reporters on January 26 that he had got it all wrong with Aslam.        
	The hospitals civil surgeon Bhairav Prasad said: Its a gross case of negligence by a medical practitioner. But, its not up to me to recommend his suspension.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Lucknow, Jan. 7: The honeymoon is almost over, and the hoardings say it all.
    
	From street corners, at major crossings, the huge cardboard canvases had one refrain in a backdrop of blue  the colour of Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party.
    
	If you cannot check infiltration of terrorists through the border in the state, you cannot blame the state government for the growth of terrorism, one hoarding said.
    
	It summed up the rift between the Congress, which leads the coalition at the Centre, and the Mayavati-led Uttar Pradesh government, barely months since the two tried to forge a working relationship in the volatile heartland.
    
	Analysts said the hoardings, which have sprung up days before the Congresss mega anti-Mayavati campaign in her bastion Bundelkhand, was aimed at countering its friend-turned-rivals battle for political space in the state.
    
	The ruling BSP has also accused the Congress of not providing adequate financial help to tide over the crisis in drought-hit Bundelkhand.
    
	The Congress is not sitting idle either, said state party chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi.
    
	A spokesman said party leaders would, on January 15, march through poverty-stricken areas of Bundelkhand where farmers are committing suicide.
    
	That would be followed by rallies Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi would address on January 17 in Jhansi, a key city in the region.
    
	Sources said the party was unnerved to see the way Mayavati was drawing upper-caste leaders to her organisation.
    
	Congress sources said there was a reason behind the partys decision to change its flawed stand of cutting a grand political deal with the BSP and go on the warpath. Because if it didnt, the 2009 general elections might prove to be another political disaster like 2004, when the Congress won only nine of the states 80 Lok Sabha seats.
    
	So it was time, the sources said, the party salvaged some of the ground it had lost since the eighties, when it was the dominant force in the state.

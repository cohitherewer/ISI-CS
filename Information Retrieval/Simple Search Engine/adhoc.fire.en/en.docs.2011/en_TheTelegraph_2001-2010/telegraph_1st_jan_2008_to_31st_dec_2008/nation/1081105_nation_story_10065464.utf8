The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT quota pot boils again: call for sports seats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     IIT quota pot boils again: call for sports seats
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Arjun: SC date                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Indian Institutes of Technology are facing a new demand for quotas based on candidates sporting talents, after reservations for deprived castes, communities and the physically challenged.        
	A hassled human resource development ministry is busy firming up arguments to counter the demand for a sports quota at Indias premier engineering schools, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The IITs are known more for their students skills at calculus than at cricket, with the stress of studies and exams allowing them little time for sport.        
	However, the Supreme Court has sent a notice on a petition demanding the quota at the IITs, and Arjun Singhs HRD ministry must appear at a hearing on November 7, sources said.        
	Most undergraduate colleges run by the Centre reserve seats for budding sportsmen. The IITs never had a formal sports quota but till the early 1970s admitted a handful of students weighing in their aptitude for sport, veteran institute officials said. The practice was stopped after some students allegedly used fake certificates to grab seats under the quota.        
	Sports quotas allow students with lower scores to gain admission. Delhi University, for instance, offers a 5 per cent quota to students talented in sports or activities such as music, dance or theatre. In return, these students strengthen their institutions sports teams, improving their chances at inter-varsity events.        
	The petitioner has asked why the IITs, which reserve seats for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the physically challenged, dont also enforce sports quotas, ministry sources said.        
	IIT officials argued that the sports quota would be pointless. Each of the seven older IITs offers high-quality sports facilities to all students but these facilities are largely underused, an institute director said.        
	He added: Students go to coaching classes for two years before joining the IITs. Any sporting ability they may have is unlikely to survive the rigour of these coaching classes.        
	The ministry too will unequivocally oppose the petitioner, an official said. It will argue that unlike ordinary undergraduate colleges, the IITs offer highly specialised courses, and that only those interested in these streams should apply.        
	At the undergraduate level, our universities are expected to help students sporting and extra-curricular abilities to flourish so that they can serve the nation in these fields. That is not the case with the IITs, a ministry official said.        
	The petitioner had earlier approached Delhi High Court but has now withdrawn that case and appealed to the apex court, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian shot dead in US shop 
                                                                                                            Indian shot dead in US shop 
                            
	Silicon Valley, Feb. 10 (PTI): An Indian-American clerk at a chain store was shot dead by unidentified gunmen during a suspected robbery attempt in Californias Vallejo City.         
	Surinder Kumar, a 55-year-old clerk at a 7-Eleven store in Vallejo City, was believed to have been shot during a robbery because investigators found an undisclosed amount of cash missing from the register, police said.         
	Kumar died early on Friday after a customer found him with gunshot wounds behind the counter, the police said.         
	They described the suspects as two black males, but said no further details were immediately available. The police were also seeking the publics help to find the killers.         
	The customer contacted the police in the small hours, saying he found Kumar behind the counter, bleeding and unconscious.         
	He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving, the coroners office reported.        
	Kumar, who moved to the US from Ludhiana in 2000 along with his family, had been working night shifts at the store for about six years, Sergeant Vic Massenkoff said.         
	Margaret Chabris, a spokesperson for 7-Eleven, said Kumar was a good employee and well liked in the community. This is a real senseless act of violence and there is no justifying what happened, she said.         
	Solano county coroners office deputy, Adrian Garcia, said Kumar had been shot twice - once in the leg and a fatal wound in the left side of his chest.         
	The police are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact them and urging anyone wishing to leave an anonymous tip to call Solano county crime stoppers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 29: The Bihar administration today deployed hundreds of policemen at Saharsa, after clashes erupted on Sunday between Indian Army personnel and people seeking permanent relief from floods.        
	Volunteers of the Chennai-based Churches Auxiliary Social Action (CASA), who were carrying out relief operations in camps at Banmankhi in Purnea, left for their state allegedly after being manhandled by volunteers of a right-wing Hindu body.         
	A CASA member, who is also a Chennai police officer, Dinesh Suna, has complained to the Purnea district magistrate, Shridhar Singh, that VHP workers, who were engaged in relief operations in nearby camps, accused the church body of converting relief seekers and manhandled our volunteers.         
	Suna added that the CASA members were not working with the intention of converting the people to another faith. Ours is a charitable organisation, he said, adding: Our volunteers found it unsafe to work and thus left. The district administration, when they heard the reports, assured of all security to the relief workers. Thousands of relief seekers yesterday hit the streets at Saharsa demanding food and shelter on a permanent basis and pelted stones on the army jawans.        
	Police said that the army men were forced to fire 40 rounds in the air and used force to quell the mob. Today, the police headquarters deployed police force around the relief camps to maintain order in Saharsa.         
	Two breaches in an embankment on the Kosi in Kusaha (Nepal) on August 18 led to the turbulent river change its course causing the worst-ever flood in Saharsa, Madhepura, Purnea, Araria and Katihar. The floods displaced 35,000 people, who have now sought shelter in over 300 relief camps set up in the five flood-hit districts.

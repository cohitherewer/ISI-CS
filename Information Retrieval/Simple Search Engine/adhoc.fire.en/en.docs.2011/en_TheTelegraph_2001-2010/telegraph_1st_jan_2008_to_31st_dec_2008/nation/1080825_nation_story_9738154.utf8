The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | High alert after seer murder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     High alert after seer murder
          OUR CORRESPNDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 24: High alert has been sounded across Orissa and prohibitory orders have been clamped at the communally-sensitive Khandhamal today following the death of prominent VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda and his five associates.        
	The issue sparked protests in parts of the state with supporters of the seer resorting to roadblocks and torching vehicles. Supporters of the seer in saffron outfits stopped trains at several places, while shut downs were observed at various places including Anugul, Muniguda and Boudh to protest the killing of the 82-year-old VHP leader.         
	An indefinite curfew was imposed on Phulbani area from the evening.        
	The situation is tense but under control. Two inspector generals and two DIGs have been deputed in the district and Section 144 has been promulgated in the district, said director-general of police Gopal Nanda.        
	Meanwhile, combing operation has begun in the area and all roads from Khandhamal have been sealed.         
	Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the cremation of the seer with adequate deployment of police forces in neighbouring districts.         
	The body will be cremated at his ashram in the same district tomorrow.         
	The last rites are likely to be attended by prominent VHP leader, including Praveen Bhai Togadia and Shankaracharya.         
	Six companies of CRPF and 20 platoons of SAP have been deployed, said Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahoo who is camping in the district to review the law and order situation.        
	The officer in charge of the Tumudibandha police station, Madusudhan Jena Samal, has been placed under suspension for dereliction of duty. Two vehicles were set ablaze at G-Udaigiri and a prayer house was torched.         
	Police suspect the involvement of Naxalites, especially after the seizure of a letter and arms from the crime site.         
	The letter, from a Naxalite outfit, claimed their indulgence in the incident. At Jalespeta in Tumudibandh block, the preliminary investigation and eyewitnesses account revealed that 50 unidentified men were hiding inside the ashram and launched an attack suddenly at 930pm.         
	The swami was in the bathroom and the rebels reportedly broke open the wooden door using sharp weapons and then shot at him.         
	The seers body was taken out in a procession to neighbouring villages. The Hindu outfits have given a call for 12-hour Orissa bandh tomorrow.        
	Naveen flayed        
	The main Opposition party Congress has demanded the dismissal of the BJD-BJP government in the state for its failure to protect life of people, while Hindu Jagaran Samukhya and Bajrang Dal have asked the BJP ministers to resign from the government immediately.         
	Even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik ordered a judicial probe into the incident and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the family members of the last nights attack, it has not assuaged the angry feelings of the Sangh Parivar.         
	The matter is an emotive issue for VHP and RSS as Swamiji was an icon for them, working for the welfare of tribals and Dalits and fighting against illegal conversion. BJPs rise in Orissa is said to be the outcome of the ground work of the Sangh Parivar in the tribal belt of the state.         
	Bajrang Dal national co-convenor Subas Chouhan alleged that the government had failed to protect Swamijis life.              
	The BJP ministers should, therefore, resign from the government in protest, he demanded.         
	Hindu Jagaran Samukhya state convenor Ashok Sahu also echoed the demand.        
	Both Chouhan and Sahu dismissed the official theory of the Naxalite link.        
	Describing the incident as purely a conspiracy, Chouhan alleged that the conspiracy was hatched at a meeting held by minorities at Tumudibandh on August 9, which was attended by a prominent church leader from New Delhi and Bhubaneswar.        
	Subsequently, a threat letter was despatched to Swamiji on August 13 that was received by Madhu Baba of Jalespeta ashram, following which an FIR was lodged at Tumudibandh police station on August 21, but no action was taken. If the police had taken precautionary measures taken, the incident could have been prevented, he said.         
	It was a well-calculated plan to eliminate the biggest obstacle against proselytisation of Kondh tribes and Dalits in Khandhamal, said Hindu Jagaran Samukhya convenor Sahu.         
	The government has squarely failed in its constitutional duty in protecting the life of Swamiji, said Sahu, rejecting the judicial inquiry ordered by the chief minister and demanding a CBI probe into the incident.         
	Christian organizations have also condemned the incident.         
	It was a tragic incident, said the president of the Orissa Minority Forum, Swarupananda Patra. Bishop Alphonso also condemned the incident.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik while condemning the incident, appealed to the people to maintain peace and communal harmony.         
	Samajvadi Party has also demanded imposition of president rule in the State.

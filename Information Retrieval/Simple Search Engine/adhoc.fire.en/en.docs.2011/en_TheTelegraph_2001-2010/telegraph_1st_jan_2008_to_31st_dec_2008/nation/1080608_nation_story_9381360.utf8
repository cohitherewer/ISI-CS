          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, June 7: The Uttar Pradesh government today slashed sales tax to lessen the burden of soaring petroleum prices on the common man.         
	While announcing the rate cut, chief minister Mayavati said the prices of oil and essential commodities were rising because of wrong policies of the UPA government at the Centre.         
	The cut will come into effect immediately.         
	After the tax slash, petrol price in Uttar Pradesh will come down by Re 1 a litre to Rs 56.16, LPG will be cheaper by Rs 11.35 a cylinder and diesel will cost Rs 1.5 less a litre at Rs 35.23.         
	The chief minister said sales tax in the state is already low compared to others. Yet, I am taking this decision in the interest of the masses, she said. Uttar Pradesh is the sixth state since yesterday that has slashed tax to bring down fuel prices.

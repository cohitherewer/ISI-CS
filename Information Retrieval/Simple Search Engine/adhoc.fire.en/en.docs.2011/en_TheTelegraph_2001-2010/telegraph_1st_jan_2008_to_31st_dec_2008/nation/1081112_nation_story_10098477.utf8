	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Spacecraft engineers hope to guide Chandrayaan-1 into its final orbit 100km above the moon tomorrow evening, engineers said today after two quick orbit-lowering operations over the past 24 hours.         
	The spacecraft, launched from Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, on October 22, is now going around the moon in a slightly elliptical orbit with its nearest point at 187km, and its farthest point at 255km, Mylswamy Annadurai, Chandrayaan-1 project director, said.         
	We hope to place it in its final orbit by tomorrow night, he said.        
	Weve been concentrating only on orbital operations and have not yet turned on onboard cameras for pictures of the moon. Therell be time for that later, Annadurai added.         
	After a day or two in the spacecrafts target orbit, engineers will activate the release of a moon impact probe, a 29kg payload that will be hurled towards the moon for a hard and destructive fall.

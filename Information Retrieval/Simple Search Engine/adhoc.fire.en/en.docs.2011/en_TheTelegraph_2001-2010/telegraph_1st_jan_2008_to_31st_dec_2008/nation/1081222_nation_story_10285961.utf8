The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Befitting reply on Sonia lips
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Befitting reply on Sonia lips
          OUR BUREAU                            Zardari, Sonia                                
	Dec. 21: Delhi today asked Islamabad not to sit on evidence India had supplied 10 times over but to hand over terrorists hiding in its territory.        
	A day after hinting that the Pakistani establishment provided support to the Mumbai attackers, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee asked Pakistan to act, not merely talk.        
	Not once, twice or thrice but as many as 10 times we have given Pakistan such evidence. Please pursue that evidence and take action as per your law, he advised Pakistan, speaking at a Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry seminar in Calcutta.        
	We have the evidence, including intercepts of satellite phone conversations. In his statement, the lone terrorist taken alive (Mohammed Ajmal Kasab) gave a chilling account of how they (the gunmen) were guided by a control room on the other side (of the border) which had access to Indian television signals.        
	Pakistan must arrest the fugitives sheltering in that country, Mukherjee said. If they are Indian citizens, hand them over to us. If they are Pakistani citizens needed for investigation here, then too hand them to us for a while.        
	India is not a soft state, Mukherjee said, almost echoing Sonia Gandhi who today warned Pakistan against taking Indias wish for peace and friendship as a sign of weakness, according to PTI.        
	We are capable of giving a befitting reply to those who are using their soil for promotion and abetment of terrorism against our country, the UPA chairperson was quoted by the news agency as telling an election rally in Dablehr, 3km from the India-Pakistan border in RS Pura, Jammu.        
	In Calcutta, Mukherjee said Islamabad should honour its commitment  made by former President Pervez Musharraf and then by current President Asif Ali Zardari  not to allow terrorists to operate from its soil. We can only deal with the government of the day but we cannot chase so-called non-state actors in another country. Pakistan will have to take action against them, he said.        
	The minister cited the contradictory statements from Pakistan about the presence of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar in that country.        
	First, we heard from the Pakistan defence minister (Chowdhury Mukthar Ahmed) that Masood Azhar was under house arrest. Then we heard (from the Pakistani envoy in Delhi) that he is not, he said. Sometimes it is said that he (Azhar) has not been seen for a while. Sometimes it is said he is not available in Pakistan. Then again they say in the UN Security Council that action will be taken against him.        
	At a Calcutta Chamber of Commerce event later, Mukherjee mentioned a letter the late Benazir Bhutto had written to the then President, Musharraf. There seem to be cycles within cycles when we act against terrorism in this country. If we deal with this problem rather in a straight line, we will be able to solve this, she had written, he said.         
	He also warned of a sinister ploy to link Islam, a religion of love and compassion, with terrorism.        
	PM meeting        
	Last evening, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the apex body on security strategy to review the military machinery and get an assessment from the armed forces and intelligence services about threat perceptions, a senior government source in Delhi said.         
	The meeting, practically the first by a national command authority since the November 26-28 Mumbai attack, sign-posted the road the political leadership had travelled in less than three weeks.        
	Mukherjee had said on December 2 that nobody is talking about military action, and defence minister A.K. Antony said on December 16 that India was not planning a military strike on Pakistan. But on Friday, Mukherjee spoke of considering a range of options and now Singh has begun consulting the armed forces. In between, the accent has been on homeland security.        
	A senior army officer said the state of alert sounded since the last week of November was being maintained. No orders have been passed to cancel leave but commanders in mobile formations, such as the armoured and mechanised corps, have been asked to ensure enough manpower was available for emergencies in the Christmas-New Year season.        
	Signs of a full-scale mobilisation of the kind ordered after the Parliament attack are not evident. Delhi wants to play out its diplomatic options unless a game-changing event brings political pressure to act militarily.

	Patna, Aug. 10: There are indications of LJP chief and Union chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan gravitating towards an alliance with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav in the Hindi heartland.        
	The LJP chief has been at loggerheads with the RJD boss ever since 2004 when the Manmohan Singh government was formed and Lalu Prasad bagged the coveted railway portfolio  to Paswans shock.         
	For a long time, repeated intervention of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi failed to cut the ice between the two biggest mass leaders of Bihar who stayed locked in a bitter battles during the 2005 Assembly poll. In the process, the 15-year-old Lalu-Rabri regime paved way to Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in the end of 2005.         
	The first sign of Paswan veering towards the idea of working in tandem with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav became visible at the joint news conference at New Delhi last week. The Hindi heartlands triumvirate took the opportunity to lambaste the BJP over the cash for vote allegation.        
	What may have created the reunion was the Manmohan Singh-sponsored trust vote in which Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati emerged as a pivot of the Left-led forces opposing the motion, with the BJP-led NDA. Mayawatis emergence does not suit any of the triumvirate, said a close aid of Paswan, a Dalit leader in his own capacity.        
	Recently, while addressing railway functions in Chapra Lok Sabha constituency, Lalu was all praise for Paswan and Mulayam Singh Yadav. They are intelligent leaders. They will not allow communal forces to gain ground, Lalu stressed.        
	Interestingly, Paswan in his Patna party rally had announced that his LJP would enter the Lok Sabha fray and would contest 16 seats in the state, some days before the Left withdrew support to the UPA.        
	But, the minister refrained from speaking a word against Lalu Prasad and RJD in course of his visits last week.        
	LJP sources revealed that Lalu Prasad would offer more than eight Lok Sabha seats to the LJP in an effort to woo Paswan before the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. Though Paswan has only four MPs in the Lok Sabha, he has potential to tilt the electoral balance. LJP strategists believe that it is politically correct for Paswan to stay in the company of Lalu and Mulayam in the event of another Dalit leader, Mayawati, emerging stronger.

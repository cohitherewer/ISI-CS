                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Warnes Royals take it easy in Goa
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                           Warne: Lazy day                                  
	May 14: A late breakfast, a lazy swim and sessions at the spa  this has been the routine for Shane Warne and his ruling Rajasthan Royals as they take a mid-tournament break in Goa.        
	Today, the top IPL team locked itself inside Fort Aguada Beach Resort as the media waited outside, hoping to get a reaction to last nights blasts in Jaipur.        
	If Warne, Graeme Smith and Shane Watson dont want to play at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Saturday  the buzz is that foreign players are apprehensive after the violence that killed up to 60 people last evening  they are not telling.        
	Together with youngsters Ravindra Jadeja, Taruvar Kohli, N. Patel and BCCI secretary Niranjan Shahs cricketer-son Jaydev, they made the most of the facilities at the resort.         
	Around afternoon, some players tried out various therapies at the heritage Taj Spa. They also checked out the restuarants in the adjoining Taj Holiday Village, a hotel source said. Fort Aguada and the Taj Holiday Village are connected internally and guests can use facilities in both properties.         
	Local boys Swapnil Asnodkar and Aditya Angle slipped out unnoticed and returned to the hotel in the evening.        
	Warne, Watson and Smith have been allotted private sea-facing villas by the team management while the younger players are in the main building. Darren Berry, team director of coaching, and Fraser Castellino, CEO of Emerging Media, which owns the team, are with the players.         
	Players from other teams are also worried about security, IPL sources said, especially after a new travel advisory was issued by the Australian government.         
	The advisory, which asks Australians travelling to India to exercise a high degree of caution, says: Recent credible information indicates that Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta may be the targets of terrorist attacks and, more specifically, that terrorists are planning to conduct suicide attacks in Mumbai or New Delhi.         
	Jaipur match on        
	An IPL press release issued today said: After discussions between Lalit Modi, chairman and commissioner, DLF Indian Premier League, and Mr V.S. Singh, secretary home department, Rajasthan government, it has been decided the match in Jaipur on Saturday, May 17, 2008, between Rajasthan Royals and Bangalore Royal Challengers will go ahead as scheduled.         
	As a mark of respect to the blast victims, both teams will wear black armbands, it added.         
	The state government has said it would provide adequate security to ensure that holding Saturdays match is not a problem and we are assured that all security concerns will be taken care of, IPL governing committee member I.S. Bindra said.         
	Earlier, the Royal Challengers had offered to hold the match in Bangalore. I have not heard about this yet. Nothing has been decided on this till now, Castellino had said, when asked about the Bangalore offer.

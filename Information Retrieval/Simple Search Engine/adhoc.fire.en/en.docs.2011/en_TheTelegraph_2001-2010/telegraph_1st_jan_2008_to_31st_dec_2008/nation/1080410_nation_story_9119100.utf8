          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 9: A spurned lover trailed a college girl home during lunch break today and slashed her throat with a knife, making a deep gash that has left her fighting for life.        
	Sandeep, a final-year student of KLC Engineering College of Vijayawada, then tried to slit his wrist in college but was saved by his friends, police said.        
	The 27-year-old had yesterday gone to Meena Kumaris house in Vijayawada, about 240km from Hyderabad, and proposed marriage to her. But she snubbed him and her mother said he would have to get his parents over if he wanted to marry her.        
	Humiliated and angry, Sandeep left Meenas house threatening to take revenge on her. He had been pursuing the 21-year-old third-year student of his college for the past year.        
	I will not let you breathe without me, he is believed to have yelled today, not giving Meena a chance to speak. Then he whipped out a knife and went for her throat, inflicting an 8cm by 4cm gash.        
	The girl was bleeding when her mother rushed into the room of their Krishna Lanka home. She is on the ventilator and we can say nothing till the next 24 hours are over, said Dr K. Ramakrishna Rao at the government hospital.        
	Sandeep then ran back to his college. Meena cheated me. I will not allow her to live and I will also not live without her, he told friends who found him trying to kill himself.        
	The police said Sandeep had confessed to attacking Meena and trying to cut his wrist. He has been arrested but is in hospital.        
	Meenas mother Saraswati, 41, told the police Sandeep had asked her for Meenas hand yesterday. Sandeeps mother told me to accept the proposal because her son would go to any lengths to win his love, she said.        
	There was a public outcry as the news spread. It is time something is done or a time may come when Vijayawada will have another name  Rape-wada or Women Atrocity-wada, said actress Roja, also the Desam womens wing chief. This is the ninth such incident in four years.

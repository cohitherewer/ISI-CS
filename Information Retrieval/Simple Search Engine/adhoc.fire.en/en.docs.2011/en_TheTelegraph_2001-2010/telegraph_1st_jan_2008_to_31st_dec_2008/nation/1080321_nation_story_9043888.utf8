          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Asma in Delhi. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, March 20: Asma Jahangir, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, thinks religious intolerance is rising in India and voiced her distress over Gujarat in a report to the Centre.        
	Jahangir, a noted lawyer in Pakistan, had been invited by the Centre on a mission concerning religious freedom that took her to Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, Kerala, Orissa and Delhi in over two weeks.        
	Gujarat, even six years after the riots, was still a cause for concern, she said.         
	Jahangir, who met chief minister Narendra Modi, was not impressed with the claim that development itself will heal the wounds.        
	The assertion doesnt seem realistic. It is crucial to recognise that development without a policy of inclusiveness of all communities will only add to aggravate resentments, she said.         
	The state of Gujarat, she added, distressed her. I am not hopeful that justice will be done for the people. It has been a huge struggle for them to get each case to the court.        
	In her three-page report, Jahangir spelt out what social activists have been claiming  that religious intolerance has been on the rise in the last 10 years. All individuals I met recognised that a comprehensive legal framework to protect their rights exists, she said. Yet many of them, especially religious minorities, remained dissatisfied with its implementation.

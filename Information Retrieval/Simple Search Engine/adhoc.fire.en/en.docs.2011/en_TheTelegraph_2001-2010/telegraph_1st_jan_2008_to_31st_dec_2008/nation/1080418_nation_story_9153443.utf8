          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 17: Burglars broke the holy hundi in the sanctum sanctorum of Chennais ancient Kapaleeswarar temple and decamped with cash and jewellery.        
	When temple priest Subramanya Gurukkal came to the famous shrine this morning, he found the door to the sanctum sanctorum of the pre-Christian era Shiva temple open and the hundi inside broken.         
	Gurukkal immediately informed temple authorities, who called police.        
	It is not clear how much money and jewellery was in the urn as these had not been counted.         
	The police, who found all closed-circuit television cameras out of order, are not ruling out the involvement of an insider. The temple authorities said the cameras had not been functioning for some time. The police are also wondering how the thieves broke open the door and scaled the high walls of the complex to escape.        
	The burglars apparently entered the main shrine last night, just before the doors shut at 9.30pm. The suspicion is that they stayed put in the complex through the night and decamped with the valuables in the early hours today, before 5.30am when the temple opens.         
	The Kapaleeswarar temple, which is a tourist attraction, gets at least a lakh visitors on auspicious days. The offerings, too, increase accordingly. Today is the holy day of Pradosham when special pujas are performed for Lord Shiva.         
	Forensic experts have taken fingerprints from the cameras and the hundi.         
	City police commissioner Nanjil Kumaran was confident of nabbing the thieves soon.         
	The temple is located in Mylapore, which was a well-known port and trade centre for over 2,000 years. The second-century Greek geographer, Ptolemy, had referred to the place as Mylarpha. St Thomas, one of the apostles of Jesus Christ, is also believed to have visited Mylapore in 2 AD.         
	Originally a shore temple, the shrine suffered damages when the Portuguese captured Mylapore in 1566 AD. The temple was shifted inland in the 16th century and rebuilt in the Vijayanagara style.

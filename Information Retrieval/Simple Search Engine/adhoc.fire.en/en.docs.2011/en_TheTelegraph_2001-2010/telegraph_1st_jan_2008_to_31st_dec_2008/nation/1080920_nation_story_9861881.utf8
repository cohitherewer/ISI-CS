  - Centre warns Karnataka and Orissa under Article 355 for violence, BJP bristles        OUR BUREAU                          A church vandalised in Mangalore on Monday. (AP)                                        
	Sept. 19: The Centre has warned Orissa and Karnataka for the spate of attacks on Christians, invoking a constitutional provision which is a step away from Article 356, used to dismiss state governments.         
	Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta said the governments had been asked to take effective measures to bring the situation under control.         
	Over 20 people have died and dozens of churches and prayer halls have been ransacked by suspected Sangh parivar activists in the two states over the last few weeks. The BJP is in power in Karnataka and is the junior partner of the ruling BJP in Orissa.        
	A home ministry release said the governments had been directed to take immediate steps to ensure that peace, normalcy and an environment of confidence and security are restored. Neither Gupta nor the release said Article 355 had been invoked, but a top government source confirmed that the provision was used.        
	Advisories have been sent to Karnataka and Orissa under Article 355, the source said.        
	Article 355 states: It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every state against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the government of every state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.         
	Together with 352 and 356, this is one of the three controversial emergency provisions in the Constitution.         
	The warning  or advisory in polite bureaucratic jargon  came after Congress leaders from the two states and elsewhere pressured the Centre to act. They stressed that if Union home minister Shivraj Patil could be blasted for his inaction against terrorism, he should not be passive against communalism either.        
	Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik described the move as politically motivated. The Centre has targeted two non-Congress-ruled states, when there are disturbances going on in other parts of the country, he said.        
	But Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa quickly announced a judicial probe by a retired high court judge as vandals ransacked yet another church in the state today.         
	Late tonight, Bajrang Dal state convener Mahendra Kumar was arrested.        
	The BJP, which has pilloried the Centre for being soft on terror, described the move as politically motivated, prejudicial, patently discriminatory and an attempt by the UPA to divert the attention from terrorism.         
	Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: The action is not only an abuse of constitutional provisions but shows rank double standards.        
	He pointed out that the Centre had kept mum when people from Bihar were being assaulted and killed in Maharashtra and Assam, and Bengal, then ruled by a friendly Left Front, had unleashed state-sponsored terrorism in Nandigram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maneka move to ban sacrifice 
                                                                                                               Maneka move to ban sacrifice 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           Maneka Gandhi    
	Bhubaneswar, April 3: An organisation founded by Maneka Gandhi, People for Animals (PFA), today threatened to launch an agitation to stop animal sacrifice in the Rakhyakali Temple in Bhadrak on April 5.         
	On March 25, the organisation had sought the governments intervention to stop ritualistic, mass animal sacrifice at the temple on April 5.         
	We had written to the chief secretary, the animal welfare board, Bharak collector and the superintendent of Bhadrak to take steps to stop the sacrifice. But, no action was taken till date, said Jiban Das, secretary of the Orissa unit of the panel.         
	If the authorities do not impose prohibitory orders, we will stage protests and demonstrations at the temple on Saturday, Das told The Telegraph today.         
	The PFA has also claimed that they have the support of a sizeable number of local residents who allegedly had approached them seeking to stop the malpractice  something that they (residents) were afraid to do fearing retaliation of powerful people in the pro-sacrifice panel.        
	Orissa High Court, while disposing a PIL filed by the PFA in April 2005, had ordered the petitioner make appropriate representation before competent government authorities. Later, the high court had ordered district collectors to educate people to stop animal sacrifice in the name of religious rite.         
	The district administration had since then stopped sacrifices at Sirlo and Vatarika temples in Cuttack. The Bolangir district administration, too, had prevented similar rituals at Sulia and Podapada.         
	If the district administrations at Bolangir and Cuttack can do it, what is preventing the Bhadrak administration from taking a similar measure? asked the secretary.

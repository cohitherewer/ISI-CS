          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The Supreme Court today stayed perjury proceedings against former BCCI president Sharad Pawar and five other officials of the Indian cricket board.        
	Calcutta High Court had on November 12 directed that a perjury case be instituted against the six for making false statements under oath.         
	The apex court order, given by a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, came after a battery of lawyers, including solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, argued in favour of the officials.         
	Apart from Pawar, the other accused officials are BCCI president Shashank Manohar, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, secretary N. Srinivasan, vice-president Chirayu Amin and former secretary Niranjan Shah.        
	Senior lawyer K.K. Venugopal represented Jagmohan Dalmiya, the former BCCI secretary who had filed the perjury case accusing the six of filing a false affidavit to justify his expulsion from the cricket board in 2006.        
	Vahanvati argued that the high court had erred in passing the order without hearing any of the accused officials.         
	In reply, Venugopal contended that the officials could defend themselves during a hearing by a trial court, he said.         
	But the chief justice did not find merit in his plea.

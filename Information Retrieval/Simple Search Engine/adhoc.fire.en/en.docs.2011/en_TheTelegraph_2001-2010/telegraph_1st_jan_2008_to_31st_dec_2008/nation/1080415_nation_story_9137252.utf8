          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 14: The hunger strike of the slum dwellers here in protest against what they call eviction without rehabilitation by the government entered the 23rd day today.         
	Earlier, the authorities were forced to hospitalise Brundaban Das Azad, the president of the All Orissa Jhopadpati Confederation, and activist Ram Chandra Patnaik after their condition deteriorated on the 14th day of the agitation. Authorities resorted to force to hospitalise them.        
	Thereafter, the strike baton was passed on to activist Sudarshan Nayak. The indefinite hunger strike was launched on March 24 along with a sit-in relay dharna by slum dwellers in front of the office of the revenue divisional commissioner (central).         
	The association spearheaded the agitation demanding rehabilitation before eviction. Nearly 3,000 families who have been living along the first 2km stretch of Taladanda canal from Jobra are facing eviction. These families have stayed along the canal embankment for years. Now they have been served notices to leave the place by the district administration and Cuttack Municipal Corporation without providing any alternative, said the association president, Brundaban Das Azad. Our agitation will continue till our grievance is addressed by the commissioners office, Azad said today.        
	Meanwhile, the commissioners office has expressed its inability to redress the demands of the agitating squatters. Officials in the district administration have also shied away from commenting on the move pleading that the matter was sub-judice.         
	The authorities launched the eviction operation along Taladanda canal on February 25. Little headway, however, could be made due to stiff opposition from the squatters under the banner of the CPM-backed Cuttack Basti Unnayana Mahasangh.         
	On February 27, Orissa High Court issued a stay on the eviction operation for two months and advised the government to take up rehabilitation first. The order was issued on a petition filed by the Mahasangh.        
	The eviction was launched to facilitate restoration work of the 130-year-old canal that originates from the Mahanadi at Jobra, meanders through the city and stretches up to Paradip.        
	We are not opposed to the restoration work. But they cannot be evicted without alternative rehabilitation, said Subash Singh, the Mahasangh president.

          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, May 29: The government seems to have been swayed by the Left in keeping away from the 60th birth anniversary celebrations of Israel, attended by US President George W. Bush.         
	Industrialist Ratan Tata and spiritual leaders from both the Hindu and Muslim communities, however, responded to the invite, sources said.        
	Israel President Shimon Peres had sent out personal invitations to world leaders and individuals. None from India attended as a government nominee, said a source.        
	Instead, there will be cricket diplomacy on display with the country that is Indias second biggest source of arms, the sources said.        
	The Left allies of the government have been criticising the Congress-led Centre for its pro-Israel tilt in foreign policy that they say undermines Indias traditional sympathy and support for Palestines cause.         
	The Left parties, led by the CPM, had flayed Indias bilateral initiatives, including defence co-operation and the Indian Space Research Organisations launch of a spy satellite for that country.         
	Sources said Tata, spiritual leaders Swami Avdheshanand Giri, Swami Paramatmananda Saraswati and Muslim community leaders Ahmed Iftikhar Khwaja and Umair Ahmad Ilyasi had attended a conference to discuss the invite..         
	Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had a problem with dates, the sources said.

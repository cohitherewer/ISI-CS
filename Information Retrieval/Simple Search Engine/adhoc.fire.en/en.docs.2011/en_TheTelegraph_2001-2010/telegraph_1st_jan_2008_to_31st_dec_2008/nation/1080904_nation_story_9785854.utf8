  - Seats for public in new Kendriya Vidyalayas          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: Indias largest chain of public-funded schools may open up half its seats to the general public at its schools built in the future after four decades of catering almost exclusively to children of government employees.         
	Government officials said students from the general public may be considered for admission on equal terms with students whose parents are government employees for 50 per cent seats at new Kendriya Vidyalayas.         
	India has 981 such schools spread across most districts in the country. This July, the number of students crossed a million.         
	The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) was launched in 1965 to cater primarily to central government employees with transferable jobs.         
	The KVS admission guidelines lay down a rigid, seven-stage priority chart that must be followed in deciding who to admit to the centrally funded schools. (See chart)        
	The current guidelines allow seats for the general public only after children whose parents are central or state government employees are admitted.         
	But the human resource development ministry plans to alter the admission guidelines for 500 new vidyalayas the UPA government has promised to build during the eleventh five-year plan.         
	The new KVs will continue to admit 50 per cent of students based on existing guidelines of a seven-stage priority chart under our plan for these schools. But for the remaining 50 per cent seats, all students will be considered on a par. Seats will be filled on a first-come-first-serve basis, an HRD ministry official said.         
	In its blueprint for the 500 vidyalayas, the HRD ministry has mentioned that the new schools must be more inclusive than the admission guidelines now allow.         
	The 500 vidyalayas are to be built as model schools and the government wants them to broaden their student base.         
	Model schools cannot cater to only a category of students. If we want the KVs to emerge as models for the entire country, we must attract students from varied backgrounds, a ministry source said.         
	Apart from the 500 vidyalayas, the HRD ministry has also promised to open 5,500 other model schools during the eleventh five-year plan.         
	These will include 500 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, 2,500 schools built jointly by the central and state governments and 2,500 constructed in a public-private-partnership mode.         
	All these schools are to be modelled on the vidyalayas.

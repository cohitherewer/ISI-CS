          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Modi: At receiving end                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Congress, emboldened by Fridays encounter, has asked the BJP and the Sangh parivar to introspect how they have contributed to the rise of terror over the past 15 years.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to convene an all-party meeting after his return from abroad to evolve a consensus on fighting terror and urge the BJP to stop playing politics over the issue in Parliament and outside.         
	Today, the Congress began its offensive by trying to nail Narendra Modis claim on the Delhi blasts. A little after the September 13 explosions, the Gujarat chief minister was on TV saying he had warned Singh and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan about the attacks.        
	The Congress has released the summary of a 25-page statement of Safdar Nagori, the president of banned outfit Simis ideological wing, recorded by Madhya Pradesh police on March 27, shortly after he was picked up in Indore.         
	Among its revelations was a meeting on July 5-6, 2006, in a farmhouse near Ujjain owned by Kamaruddin Nagori. At the meeting, Safdar and Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer, Simis techie brain, were said to have discussed the Babri Masjid demolition and the Gujarat riots of 2002.        
	They allegedly gathered again in Hubli, Karnataka, on April 25 and were said to have spoken about making bombs with hydrogen peroxide. The statement contained mobile numbers of Kamaruddin and Safdar.         
	Had Gujarat police investigated on the basis of their phone numbers, they might have unearthed their game plan then. Why was Modi sitting on this report for so many months? Congress spokesman Manish Tewari asked.        
	A statement by another Simi activist, Amir Perwez, also to Madhya Pradesh police, on March 27 said the organisation had held a recruitment camp at a guesthouse of the Gujarat tourism department in Mount Abu in 1999.         
	Although the hill resort is in Rajasthan, its proximity to Gujarat makes it popular with Gujaratis. The BJP was in power in Gujarat in 1999. Perwezs statement mentioned other meetings in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, where the Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts were allegedly plotted.

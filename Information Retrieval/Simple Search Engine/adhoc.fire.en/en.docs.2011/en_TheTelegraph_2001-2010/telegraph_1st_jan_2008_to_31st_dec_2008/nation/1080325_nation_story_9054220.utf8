The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Manmohan pitches for nuclear energy
                                                                                                               Manmohan pitches for nuclear energy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, March 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has tried to keep alive the governments hopes of seeing through the nuclear deal by linking it to Indias energy needs.        
	Steering clear of both the US, where foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee is holding talks now, and the Left, Singh pitched for nuclear energy while inaugurating a gas-based power project in the capital.        
	He said gas-based projects would enlarge Indias energy basket, but they were not enough. At the same time, we must also further develop our nuclear energy potential, he said.        
	Singh added that his government was committed to further development of nuclear energy, both as an environment-friendly source of power and as a means of widening the energy basket available to us.         
	The Prime Minister unequivocally advocated nuclear power as the answer to a clean, green India despite the demands of urbanisation.         
	With our economy growing at 8 or 9 per cent per annum, with growing urbanisation and rising prosperity, the demand for electricity is outpacing existing sources of supply. India is blessed with vast reserves of coal. Our government has taken many steps to increase coal production. We are also trying to develop hydro-electricity, he said.        
	Singh mentioned the problem of displacement caused by hydro-electric projects and referred to environmental concerns while building a case for nuclear power.         
	We also have to keep in mind environmental concerns and concerns about people displaced by mining and dams. We are blessed with ample solar energy but it will be some time before we can tap this source in a large quantity, he said.        
	He explained why India had to broadbase its energy sources. Our strategy for energy security is a multi-pronged strategy. We do not have the luxury of depending on only one or two sources.        
	He sought to answer criticism that nuclear energy is unaffordable. While some sources of energy may be cheap today, we have to think for the future. We have to think for future generations, he said.

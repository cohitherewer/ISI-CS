          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 30: At least five day labourers who had taken shelter below a flyovers under-construction ramp here to escape rain were crushed to death when it caved in this evening.        
	Over 50 people had huddled under the new link road being built between Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow and business hub Hazratganj.        
	The unofficial toll was eight. Uttar Pradesh director-general of police Vikram Singh said five bodies had been retrieved and more could be buried under the debris.         
	The National Highways Authority of India is building the ramp, branching off the flyover on the Lucknow-Faizabad road. The 12ft stretch that collapsed was being covered with concrete.        
	Roshan Lal, 40, a labourer admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital with fractures in his hands and legs, said: We ran from a place where concrete was being mixed and were waiting for the rain to stop. Suddenly it crashed on us. Most of the workers were from an area on the citys outskirts.

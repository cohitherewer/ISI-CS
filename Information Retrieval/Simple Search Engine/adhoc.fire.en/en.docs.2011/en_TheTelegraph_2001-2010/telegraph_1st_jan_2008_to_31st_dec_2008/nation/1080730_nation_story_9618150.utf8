	Bhubaneswar, July 29: Good news for future managers aspiring for a stint at Orissas top B-school.         
	The Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, has been awarded a South Asian Quality Assurance Systems (SAQS) accreditation by the Association of Management Development Institutions in south Asia.         
	The accreditation was awarded on July 25 making it the third B-school in India to be granted the prestigious recognition.        
	The SAQS was evolved as a system to provide a quality assurance and accreditation framework for business and management schools in south Asia. It uses a set of criteria developed from business and management schools of high national and international standing.         
	The recognition will be valid for a period of five years. XIMB is expected to submit an institutional development report at the end of two years.         
	The institute has to re-apply for re-accreditation after the five-year period is up.         
	This recognition will help XIMB showcase its qualifications in a format that will be acceptable to the top institutes and corporates in south Asia. It will pave the way for XIMB to apply for other prestigious accreditation like EQUIS and AACSB, in the future.         
	College atmosphere and a learning environment in XIMB will get a further boost with such recognition, in line with leading global schools, said dean (academics), W.S. William.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP unleashes blitz on a blood drop
          SANJAY K. JHA                          LK Advani: Campaign lift                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The BJP has not been able to resist the temptation to extract poll mileage from the Mumbai strikes, with its leaders saying the attacks had suddenly lifted their campaign for tomorrows Delhi elections.        
	Party workers launched an aggressive propaganda today on the governments complete failure in tackling terror, even as senior leaders at the BJP headquarters here talked of unity and restraint in this hour of crisis.        
	The Mumbai incidents have suddenly lifted our campaign. We dont know how much benefit they will bring us ultimately but the scene has changed overnight, a prominent Delhi leader said.        
	High-profile candidates like Vijay Jolly, pitted against chief minister Sheila Dikshit, burnt the effigies of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh today.        
	The fireworks on streets were accompanied by a media blitz against the Centre.         
	Written on a drop of blood against a black background, a newspaper ad reads: Brutal terror strikes at will. Weak government unwilling and incapable. Fight terror. Vote BJP.        
	L.K. Advani stepped up the heat yesterday, saying intelligence agencies energies were being diverted to nail so-called Hindu terror.         
	It now appears a mobile phone with a terrorist is of Pakistani origin. This reinforces the fact that intelligence agencies energy is being diverted to nail so-called Hindu terror which evidently enabled the Mumbai attackers plot go undetected.        
	Officially, though, the stress appeared to be on restraint and the need to focus on ending the siege in Mumbai.         
	Advani urged the Prime Minister to convene a conference of chief ministers of states on the west coast to deal with the new threat of sea-borne terror.         
	The governments non-serious approach is reinforced by reports that the Mumbai attackers arrived in the city by the sea route, he added.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi echoed the demand for such a meeting, and dubbed the Prime Ministers address to the nation on the attacks disappointing.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The cabinet today cleared the extension of two stretches of a multi-nation highway plan that will connect India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.         
	Both are part of the Asian Highway network, a 140,000km project being executed by a division of the United Nations to connect Asia with Europe. India has signed up to the plan.        
	In the first extension, the Asian Highway 2, running through Banglabandha (Bangladesh), Siliguri and Kakarbhitta (just across the north Bengal border in Nepal), will now touch Phulbari.         
	In the second extension, the AH 48 link proposed from Thimphu to Phuentsholing will be extended to Jaigaon (Jalpaiguri) - the border in India - and linked to AH 2 at Phulbari.         
	Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the minister who briefed the media after the cabinet meeting, said the extensions would help increase trade and tourism with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.         
	A proposal will be sent to the UNs Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific to include the extensions in the Asian highway network, Das Munshi said.        
	The Union surface transport ministry will send the proposal requesting the UN body to make the necessary amendments in its route maps and include the two extensions in the Asian highway.        
	The highway project will criss-cross Asia to reach Europe. About 12,000km, out of the total length of 140,000km, will run through India. For this, agreements have been signed among 32 countries to pave the way for the project.

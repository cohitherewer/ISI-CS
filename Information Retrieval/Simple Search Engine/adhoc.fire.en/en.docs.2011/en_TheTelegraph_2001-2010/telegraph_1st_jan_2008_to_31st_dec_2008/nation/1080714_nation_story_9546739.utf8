	Green glare turns on metro project     
	A green shadow hangs over the Hyderabad metro project.    
	A group of NGOs has demanded the plan be put on hold for six months and all documents be made public for a debate. The voices of dissent came even as technical bids for the Rs 10,000-crore project were opened.    
	The Citizens for a Better Public Transport in Hyderabad, an umbrella group of 14 NGOs, threatened to move court if the documents were not revealed. The forum has accused the Andhra government of pushing the plan despite the apprehensions of different sections.    
	The NGOs pointed out that the project hadnt received environmental clearance and stressed the need for wider public debate before taking up such a massive project that could change the citys skyline forever.    
	They alleged that copies of the law clearing the metro, the AP Municipal Tramways (construction, operation and maintenance) Ordinance, werent given to the public.     
	One of the forums representatives, C. Ramachandraiah, warned they would drag the government as well as the bidders to court if the project went ahead. (PTI)        
	Makeover blessings for Shirdi    
	Trips to Shirdi could be a smoother affair than they are now.    
	Maharashtra recently announced the formation of a special body, the Shirdi Development Authority, to develop the infrastructure in the pilgrim town near Nashik. The authority has been tasked with its development.    
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said the infrastructure needed to be developed since Shirdi drew Sai Baba devotees from across the country and abroad. The towns makeover plan envisages better roads, skywalks, multi-level car parking and better healthcare facilities.     
	Deshmukh also lauded those who had given up land for Shirdi Knowledge City and promised all possible government help for the project. The state had recently announced plans to set up an airport 25km from Shirdi. At present, fliers have to get to the town from Mumbai and Pune. (PTI)    
	Fuel squeeze after price hit    
	First, they turned so expensive that they burnt a hole in budgets. Now, petrol and diesel could be out of reach.    
	A fuel shortage stalked Bangalore and, indeed, the rest of Karnataka over the past week amid predictions that the city wasnt too far off from the dark days of rationing.    
	There is fuel shortage and the situation might get worse in another week or 15 days, said Bhushan Narang, president of the Bangalore Dealers Association and Akhila Karnataka Petroleum Dealers Association.    
	Apparently, petroleum companies are unable to supply sufficient quantities of fuel, with the squeeze being reported from the time prices were hiked last month.    
	Several consumers have reported problems. Complaints about pumps turning them away, because they didnt have stocks, have poured in.    
	Many have been forced to buy higher-priced branded fuel such as Speed, XtraPremium and XtraMile Diesel.     
	There is a shortage of regular petrol/diesel now but we might run out of premium items, too, Narang said.        
	School van watch    
	Delhis traffic guardians are slamming the brakes on school vans that have turned their business into childs play.    
	The registration of 101 such vehicles was revoked last week after they were found to have lax safety systems. Another 17 owners whose vans were ferrying children illegally were booked and prosecuted, an official said.    
	he drive will continue till all such vehicles are registered and compliant with the safety standards.

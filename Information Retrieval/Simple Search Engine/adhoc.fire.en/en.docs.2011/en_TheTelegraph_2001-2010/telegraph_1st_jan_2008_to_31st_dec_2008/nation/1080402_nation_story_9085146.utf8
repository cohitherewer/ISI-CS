The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plea to Muslims: Forget Advani past
                                                                                                               Plea to Muslims: Forget Advani past
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Advani, Shahnawaz: New chapter				                                 
	New Delhi, April 1: BJP Minority Morcha president Shahnawaz Hussain today appealed to Muslims to forget their misgivings about L.K. Advani and begin a new chapter with him.        
	This immediately raised many eyebrows in the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, with critics interpreting it as an admission of guilt and questioning the wisdom of the move.        
	Shahnawaz, who was announcing the schedule for the April 4-6 Morcha conclave in Hyderabad, said: Now that we are going to fight the general election under Advanis leadership, we would appeal to the Muslims to ignore whatever happened in the past. Whatever misgivings they had should be forgotten and a new chapter should begin.        
	Advanis tenure as Union home minister had been good for the Muslims, Shahnawaz argued, and they should now vote for the BJP to make him Prime Minister.        
	Shahnawaz did not explain what the misgivings were but his appeal indicated that the party had launched a desperate mission to improve Advanis image among Muslims.        
	Advani has for some time been working to dilute his hardline image. His efforts, however, have often resulted in ideological confusion, leading him to swing between extremes like calling Jinnah secular and giving a clean chit to Narendra Modi.        
	The partys latest plan to hold a Muslim conference in Hyderabad with an appeal to review Advani could set off another controversy.        
	Such projects to woo Muslims have flopped in the past. Immediately before the 2004 general election, a group of Muslims had formed a Vajpayee Himayat Committee to air the message that their community should back a liberal leader like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The group was hyperactive during the polls and angered hardcore BJP supporters. The result was dismal.        
	Some BJP leaders feel that if such a plan did not work for Vajpayee, its even less likely to succeed in Advanis case.        
	Advani has in the recent past been speaking the language of a statesman, and his autobiography has tried to present him as a believer in pluralism and justice for all.        
	But many in the party feel that such overt appeals to Muslims to forget the past reflect a lack of political acuity.

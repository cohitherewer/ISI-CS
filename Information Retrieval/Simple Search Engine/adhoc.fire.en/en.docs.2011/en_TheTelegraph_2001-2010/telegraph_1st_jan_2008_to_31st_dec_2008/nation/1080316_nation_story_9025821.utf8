	Bhopal, March 15 (PTI): Madhya Pradesh forest minister Vijay Shah has ordered the removal of director J.S. Chauhan and a probe into the death of a white tigress at the Van Vihar National Park where a number of animals have recently died.        
	The three-year-old tigress, Rashmi, had been ailing for two years. On Sunday, she fought with another tigress and suffered injuries for which she was being treated, official sources said.        
	Rashmis condition deteriorated last afternoon and she succumbed to injuries, the sources said, adding that her last rites were performed after a post-mortem. The tigress was brought here from Mumbais Borivli National Park in 2006.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
                  
	Srinagar, Jan. 7: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today said his party would resist those who mislead people by raising false slogans, a week after finance minister Tariq Hameed Qarra spoke about a separate currency for the state.
    
	Any such attempt needs to be frustrated and our party will resist those who try to divert peoples attention from development to hollow promises, Azad said in an apparent dig at his finance minister, who belongs to the Peoples Democratic Party, a Congress ally.
    
	Qarra had last week said self-rule would pave the way for a separate currency for Kashmir. The comment triggered a political storm in the Valley with several Opposition leaders gunning for his head. 
    
	The state BJP unit said the minister should be sacked while some groups burnt his effigy and took out protests in Jammu. 
    
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed have not come forward to clear the air over the remark. But deputy chief minister and party member Muzaffar Hussain Baig said on Saturday that there was no question of making such a proposal.
    
	Jammu and Kashmir is a part of the Indian Union and there is no question of floating a proposal that would undermine the federal relationship of the state with the Union, Baig said. 
    
	He, however, admitted the party had suggested that both parts of Kashmir, on the Indian and Pakistani sides, be declared free trade zones in which currencies of both the countries could become the legal tender. 
    
	Facing flak, the finance minister has modified his statement. He said South Asian countries should have a common currency on the pattern of the European Union and Kashmir could lead the way.
    
	The chief minister, who had been quiet on the controversy so far, today said his government would not allow empty sloganeering to disturb the atmosphere of progress in the Valley.

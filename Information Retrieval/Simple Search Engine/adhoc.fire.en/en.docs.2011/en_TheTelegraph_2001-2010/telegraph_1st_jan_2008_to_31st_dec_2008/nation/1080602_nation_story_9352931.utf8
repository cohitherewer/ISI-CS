The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tax raid cloud on Chauhan minister
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tax raid cloud on Chauhan minister
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, June 1: Income-tax officials have raided the ancestral home of Madhya Pradesh health minister Ajay Vishnoi and his brother, with just about six months to go before Assembly elections.         
	The ruling BJP government of Shivraj Singh Chauhan is in a bind as all eyes are on the findings of Fridays tax raid that could be declared tomorrow.        
	Chauhan has already ruled out Vishnois exit from his cabinet.         
	The health minister has already explained his position with regard to income tax raids, he said. But the raid has come at a time when Vishnois health department is under the scanner for allegations of financial scams running into hundreds of crores.         
	The raid notice was against Vishnois brother. The minister said he could not be held responsible for his siblings actions, but his line of defence would have few takers as the Vishnois are a joint family.         
	Chauhan avoided attributing political motive to the raids.        
	Sources close to him said any action against Vishnoi would be interpreted as an admission of guilt and provide an issue to the Opposition Congress just before the elections.        
	A raid was also conducted at state home secretary Rajesh Rajoras home. He sent his resignation following the raid. Rajora, a former health commissioner, insisted the tax officials had found no more than Rs 27,000 in cash and jewellery worth Rs 6 lakh.         
	His resignation would be forwarded to the Centres department of personnel.        
	Oddly, the state Congress has kept mum on the matter.         
	Some observers said this was because of raids being conducted at a local media groups establishments. The media group is seen as close to a Congress Union minister, a fact that may have made state party chief Suresh Pachauri keep silent.        
	It was unclear if the raids on the media group were linked to the raids at the health ministers home and also that of Rajora.        
	Reacting to the raids, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh today accused the Chauhan regime of being involved in looting the state.         
	Madhya Pradesh, under the BJP, is being continuously looted by corrupt leaders, officers, suppliers and contractors. As I have said earlier, the primary objective of the BJP is to collect money, donations and confuse people through false data, Digvijay said.

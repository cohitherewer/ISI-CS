	Bangalore, May 2: The Hawk crash at Bidar air force station on Wednesday has grounded Hindustan Aeronautics Limiteds ceremony to showcase its first licence-built Hawk aircraft.        
	HAL, which has already started production of the Hawk, an advanced jet trainer, was set to unveil the first of the 42 aircraft to be manufactured at its Bangalore complex.        
	The induction ceremony, which was to have been held in the first week of May, has been postponed to the third week. The new dates depend on the guests, including defence minister A.K. Antony and the chief of air staff, who are yet to confirm the dates. We will announce them shortly, HAL chief spokesperson Ananth Krishnan said.        
	The spokesperson, however, declined to reveal whether the crash of the jet, manufactured by BAE Systems of the UK, would have any bearing on HALs programme.         
	The Hawk-132 built by HAL is ready to fly anytime now. As soon as we get a clearance from the ministry, we will announce the induction ceremony date, he said.         
	HAL sources said the guest list includes the minister of state for defence, the defence ministrys secretary, the Indian Air Forces training command chief and other senior IAF officers.         
	Senior UK officials nominated by Prime Minister Gordon Browns office and senior BAE officials would also be present.        
	Last year, HAL assembled a team to lead the Hawk programme. BAE has also sent technical teams to handle licence production.

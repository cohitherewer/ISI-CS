                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Left seeks nuke deal details
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 17: The Left has sent the Centre a note seeking clarifications on the text agreed upon with the International Atomic Energy Agency, as both sides continue to buy time on the nuclear deal.        
	Sources today said the next meeting of the UPA-Left committee on the deal could be held in the first week of May, although CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had suggested an April session at the panels last meeting on March 18.        
	The next meeting can be held after the CPMs new politburo meets in Calcutta at the end of April, the sources said. CPM leaders, however, said the meeting could still be held in April if the Centre wanted.        
	The sources said the note to the government asked for more information so that the Left could check out the achievements at the IAEA against the governments promises before the Vienna talks.        
	The Centre had only briefed the Left about the negotiations, and it wants more information to firm up its position on the IAEA safeguards.        
	For example, there has been talk of the IAEA taking care of the fuel supply assurance. But how can a monitoring agency assure us fuel in case supply is disrupted under the weight of the Hyde Act or otherwise? a source said.        
	Safety report        
	Delhi today presented its first report on the safety of its civil nuclear power plants at the Convention of Nuclear Safety in Vienna, says PTI.         
	India has complied with all its obligations under each relevant article of the convention, the 206-page report presented by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board said.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: Delhi High Court today dismissed a plea by the Union Public Service Commission seeking immunity from an order to disclose key details of civil service examinations that have so far been kept under wraps.         
	The 2006 Central Information Commission (CIC) decision upheld by the high court today ordered the UPSC to disclose students marks and cut-offs for the preliminary stages of its examinations.         
	The Right to Information Act watchdog had also ordered the UPSC to reveal the scaling procedure used to normalise scores between different subjects chosen by students  some subjects are more scoring than others.         
	Over four lakh students appear annually for the preliminary civil service exams that are marred by allegations of inaccurate marking or scoring of answer scripts that are never revealed to students.         
	This is a major victory for students across India. The UPSC has been ordered to make its heavily guarded system of examinations transparent. This will affect all students who sit for civil service exams in future, Aman Lekhi, the senior advocate for students challenging the UPSC petition, said.         
	But UPSC sources said the commission may appeal against the high court verdict in the Supreme Court.         
	Our argument remains that the disclosure of this information would hurt the exam process and expose it to manipulation, a senior UPSC official said.

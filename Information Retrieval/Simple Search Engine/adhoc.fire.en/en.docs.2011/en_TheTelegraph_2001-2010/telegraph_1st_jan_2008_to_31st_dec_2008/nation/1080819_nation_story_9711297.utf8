The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Srinagar cop to get medal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Srinagar cop to get medal
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The CRPF officer taken off an Independence Day honours list at the last minute will get the award, with the Centre blaming his exclusion on a communication gap.        
	He will get the award. There was a communication gap, Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta said today referring to S.K. Jain, the forces inspector-general in Srinagar.        
	Till August 14 evening, Jains name had figured on the list of those to be given the Presidents medal for distinguished service. But the ministry then removed it, setting off speculation that the move was prompted by Jammu and Kashmir Governor N.N. Vohras call to remove Jain over alleged excesses by his force.        
	The exclusion from the list was probably aimed at sparing the Centre the embarrassment of having to remove an officer who had been feted for exemplary service.        
	It now seems those who took Jains name off were unaware it had been cleared by the Presidents office.        
	The about-turn is being seen as the result of pressure from the IPS lobby, disenchanted after apparently getting a raw deal from the Sixth Pay Commission compared with the other services.        
	Home secretary Guptas statement today appeared to have mollified sections within the CRPF that had reacted strongly against the treatment handed out to Jain. The President had already issued the orders, so how could the ministry remove his name? an officer asked.        
	Gupta sought to settle another contentious matter when he said Jains transfer was being discussed for a long time as differences of opinion (with the state administration) were consistently coming up.        
	Last week, when his name was taken off the list, ministry officials had said Jain had only been summoned to the capital. This was done to quell speculation he had been transferred.        
	The official line remained unchanged today, with CRPF officials insisting Jain had only been called to Delhi for deliberations, not moved out of Srinagar.

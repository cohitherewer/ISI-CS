	Cuttack, July 1: Six towns in the state will soon have digital       maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) database of their areas to check disorderly growth and help in better urban planning.        
	The facility will be provided through the ministry of urban developments recently launched National Urban Information System (NUIS) scheme aimed at achieving better planning and management of urban settlements.        
	The scheme with an outlay of Rs 66.68 crore would cover Cuttack, Rourkela, Balasore, Baripada, Berhampur and Sambalpur among the 137 cities and towns across the country. The information system would consist of urban land use, soil, groundwater, surface water, vacant zones, green zones, transport system and satellite towns/villages in the neighbourhood.        
	Isro had assigned Orissa Remote Sensing Application Centre (Orsac) to generate the information for the six towns by using high-resolution Indian Cartosat satellite data and aerial pictures. The satellite-generated digital maps and GIS data will be helpful for speedy preparation of master plans, zonal plans, utility plans and town planning schemes in the six towns, said Orsac chief executive officer Debajit Mishra. The information will also be useful for infrastructure development, disaster management and environment monitoring.        
	Mishra said the urban information system to be developed by Orsac would be adopted by the Union governments town and country planning organisation in collaboration with the state directorate of town planning.

	Chennai, Feb. 27: A treasure trove of artefacts that throw light on the only Danish colony in India 400 years ago has been dug up from a moat around an ancient fort in Nagapattinam.        
	The moat itself was a discovery at the 17th-century structure, which had weathered the fury of the 2004 tsunami.        
	The discovery could help historians piece together the life and times of the colony from 1620, when it was built, to 1845, when it was said to have been sold to the British.        
	We collected some 1,000 finds, including ceramic bowls, Chinese porcelain ware, English stone-ware, local Indian pot-sherds and other items from the moat, said Nils Engberg of the National Museum of Denmark, who led a team of archaeologists, some from India, on the project.        
	What has fascinated Nils and his colleagues the most, however, is an assortment of white clay smoking pipes with the inscriptions In God in the Dutch language.         
	Nils believed East India Company officers and employees used these pipes  a piece of evidence to show that smoking was popular among the Europeans for long.         
	The 20-day excavation that ended on February 23 at the fort, which is on the Archaeological Survey of India list of protected structures, drew a lot of interest with curious local residents swarming the place as long as the work went on.        
	The exercise followed an agreement between the ASI , the state archaeology department and the Danish museum. What prompted the effort were drawings of the moat, with a drop bridge, found in archives in Denmark. A Danish bank had lent Rs 8 lakh for the project.        
	The unique history of the place as the headquarters of the Danish colonies in India is the reason for our interest in Tranquebar or Tarangambadi, as it is known in Tamil, Nils said.         
	Without the fort, too, Tarangambadi is rich in history. The coastal town was believed to be a port city from the days of the classical Sangam period in Tamil literature.         
	With the governors building, a church, warehouses and quarters inside, the excavators said they would have been surprised if the fort did not have a moat  which were often built to keep invaders out.                    Some of the artefacts from the fort. A Telegraph picture		    
	Nils said the moat, 20 metres wide and 2 metres deep, was filled in 1775, possibly to support the walls that might have become weak. Well-formed parts of a bridge, shown in the archive drawing, have also been found.         
	The pillars and the foundation (of the bridge) are there. We also found the brick walls of the moat. These will help us understand the history of that period, said Nils, considering himself lucky to have made the discovery.         
	The variety of Indian items found will help historians understand the influence of other societies on the Danish colony. The excavators, including the ASI, will prepare a joint report on the excavation and the finds.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Mohammad Ali                                  
	Bhopal, Sept. 20: A terror suspect, said to be a Simi fund-raiser, has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh amid conflicting reports about exactly where he was nabbed.        
	Police officers had claimed last night that Mohammad Ali, a suspect in the Jaipur and Ahmedabad blasts, was arrested at Kareli railway station in Narsinghpur district, about 100km from Bhopal.        
	However, the head of the states newly created anti-terrorist squad (ATS) today insisted that Ali had been arrested near Bhopal. Deputy inspector-general Pawan Srivastava said his men had intercepted a car bringing Ali from Narsinghpur to Bhopal.        
	Srivastava attributed the success of the ATS to a joint operation  named Zimma (responsibility)  by the police of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh.        
	ATS officers said efforts were on to nab Irfan, another activist of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, in Narsinghpur with the help of Delhi and Gujarat police.        
	Madhya Pradesh police have also arrested Khalid alias Vikram Nai from Narsinghpur. Sources said he had links with the Chhota Rajan gang.        
	Several top-ranking Simi activists were arrested in Indore and some other places in western Madhya Pradesh earlier this year. Many of them, including former Simi president Safdar Nagori, are in the custody of Gujarat police.        
	Simi is said to have a strong base in Madhya Pradesh. Officers said that before the 2001 ban, 33 cases had been registered against its activists for spreading religious discord. After the ban, 49 cases were registered.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, Nov. 1: Anup Bhuyans family is finally at peace  they cremated him this evening.        
	Bipul Naths body, too, was taken for cremation. The bomb killed him, but couldnt rob him of his identity.        
	Confusion over the identity of a badly charred body at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital ended this afternoon with Anups family withdrawing their claim over it.        
	The dead lawyers family had yesterday staked claim to the body, but so did friends and relatives of his colleague Bipul, who too died when one of the bombs that ravaged Assam on Thursday exploded at the chief judicial magistrates court.        
	K.J. Hillaly, sub-divisional officer, Kamrup metropolitan district, told The Telegraph that Anups family had given a written undertaking that they were withdrawing claim over the charred body.        
	He said the family had identified another body to be that of Anups on the basis of the size of the skull, height, teeth and facial structure.        
	The family members of Bipul arrived at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital and again staked claim to the same body as yesterday. Finally, we decided to hand over the body to Bipuls family.        
	A third body at the hospital morgue has also been identified as that of Domestang S., a Khasi youth, who was studying in Guwahati. All three bodies were handed over to their families by evening, Hillaly said.        
	Anups younger sibling Pranjit Kumar, a college lecturer, said his brother was cremated this evening.        
	It was the only consolation for the family, he added. At least, we will now be able to carry out the religious rituals and pray so that my brother gets peace.        
	Bipuls body has been taken to his native village for cremation.        
	Bipul, a practising lawyer at the CJMs court for the past three years, stayed at a rented house in the city.

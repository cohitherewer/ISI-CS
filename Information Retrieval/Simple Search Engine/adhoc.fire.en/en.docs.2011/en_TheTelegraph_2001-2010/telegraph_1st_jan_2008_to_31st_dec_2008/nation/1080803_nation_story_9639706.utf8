          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The nations open schools are to tailor their syllabus because a student in a Bengal village may need to learn different skills from one in the national capital.        
	The Centre plans to launch a State Institute of Open Schooling, along the lines of the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), in each state, government officials said. These institutes will offer dozens of new courses so that students can pick up the professional skills best suited to their regional markets.        
	The NIOS, the nodal agency in charge of open schooling, offers courses that are too metro-specific, a human resource development ministry official say.        
	These courses are largely aimed at helping students improve their English-speaking skills and ability to use computers, and training them for the hospitality sector. But these courses are no good for the local industry in the states, the official said.        
	The handicrafts industry, for instance, is dying in many parts of the country because it is not being developed as a skill. By teaching these skills, we can meet the students demand for jobs and the local markets demand for trained hands.        
	The plan to launch the State Institutes of Open Schooling has been cleared by the Planning Commission, and the ministry has drafted a note for the cabinet to start these centres by the end of this year.The vocational courses offered through the open schooling system are aimed mainly at school dropouts. The Centre has ensured almost 95 per cent school enrolment through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, but the initiative suffers from a high dropout rate.        
	Some 60 per cent of Indias secondary school students drop out. Roughly 50 per cent of students drop out annually at the elementary school stage.        
	The plan to broaden the number and type of courses offered by the open schooling system is aimed at dropouts who, we believe, can be enticed to study courses that can get them a job, the ministry official said.

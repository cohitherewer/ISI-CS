The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Migrants win Britain court battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Migrants win Britain court battle
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, April 8: The British government behaved illegally in moving the goal posts and making it harder for immigrants, including a substantial number of Indians, who had been admitted under the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme, to settle in Britain, a court has ruled.         
	This is a setback to Gordon Browns government, which is lagging in the polls behind David Camerons Conservative Party and wants to be seen as acting tough on immigration in a bid to catch up.         
	The government also wants to respond to a popular mood in the country that it has not been able to control immigration, especially of Muslims, some of who have later become involved in terrorism.         
	The Indians who have entered under the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme (HSMP) have nothing to do with terrorism but are suffering as a result of the general backlash against foreigners.         
	But where the government went wrong, high court judge Sir George Newman ruled today, is letting in highly qualified doctors, engineers and other professionals under one set of rules and then changing them to make it much harder for them to remain in Britain.         
	Many had sold property or incurred heavy loans to try and make a fresh start in Britain. For the government, which is now considering an appeal, this is a humiliating climbdown.         
	Legal action against the home office was taken by the HSMP Forum, whose executive director, Amit Kapadia, said: quot;Thousands of highly skilled immigrants and their families have been eagerly awaiting this review. People left their careers, uprooted their families to come to the UK to settle down. quot;         
	The forum said up to 90 per cent of the 49,000 migrants who came to work in the UK under the scheme faced being forced to leave because they would have to reapply under a stricter new points-based system.         
	Michael Fordham, QC, appearing for the forum, also stressed that the changes had been made without warning and described them as quot;unlawful, unreasonable and unfair by a considerable margin quot;. He told the judge: quot;The conspicuous unfairness leaps from the page. quot;         
	He said the programme was originally introduced in 2002 to attract highly skilled persons to the UK and encouraged them to settle here with their families.         
	The entry criteria were exacting and applicants had to achieve a satisfactory score based on their qualifications, work experience in their country of origin, past earnings and achievement in their chosen field.         
	Skilled migrants would originally be given entry for a year, then be able to apply for a two-year extension and then a further three years before seeking final settlement.         
	But in November 2006, the home secretary made restrictive changes, said Fordham. New entry criteria were based only on qualifications and past earnings. Those already on the programme faced a new English language pre-condition and their level of earnings achieved in the UK was also taken into account when applying for an extension.         
	Fordham commented: quot;The goal posts have been moved for those previously admitted. quot;         
	He said it was quot;a grossly unfair, massive change to the nature of the programme quot; visited on highly skilled individuals who had left their homes, relatives, friends and jobs and committed themselves to living in the UK.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The sportspersons of the state who represented the country in international meets would henceforth get land as gift.
    
	The plots would be a gift from the government and its area would be of 2,400sqft if located in the capital. On its outskirts, the players would be entitled to get 6,000sqft of land.
    
	Any player who has participated in international meets such as the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, Asiad or South Asian Federation (SAF) games, Tests and ODIs would be entitled for the plot, said P.K. Mohanty, the states director of estates. 
    
	The issue of honouring sportspersons was discussed at a meeting convened recently by development commissioner R.N. Bohidar. The norms and modalities for the same were also discussed. 
    
	The sports department has been asked to prepare a list of eligible players. 
    
	Its a great news for many in the fraternity. They should have taken the step earlier. This would encourage players to do better, said Nanda Pattnaik, the coach of the womens football team. 
    
	Announcement hardly makes any difference. They should implement it, he added. Most of the players apply for a plot of land as soon as they retire from the international arena. The number of applicants is already almost 50. As of now only former Indian hockey team captain Dilip Tirkey and footballer Shradhanjali Samantray have been provided a plot. 
    
	While Samantray has been gifted 2,400sqft of land in Chandrashekharpur, Tirkey has been given a 4,800-sqft plot on the same campus. 
    
	CMs directive
    
	While the government decided to help players out, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today directed officials to take action against those enjoying benefits meant for Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste members by furnishing false information. The directive was issued at a meeting chaired by the chief minister at the Secretariat today. 
    
	The tribals in Khandhamal and Bolangir have been agitating against the alleged move by non-tribals to get ST certificate issued in their favour. Yesterday, the tribals had organised a massive rally at Bolangir demanding stern action against the officials and the recipients of ST certificates through fraudulent means.

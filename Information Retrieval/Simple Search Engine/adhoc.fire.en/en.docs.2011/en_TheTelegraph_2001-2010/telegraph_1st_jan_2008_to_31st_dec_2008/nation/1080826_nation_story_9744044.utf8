          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 25: BJDs ruling coalition partner, BJP, today stalled House proceedings demanding immediate arrest of culprits involved in the firing that killed VHP leader Laxmanananda Saraswati on Saturday night.        
	BJP members lambasted the state administration for its failure in protecting the life of the swamiji and threatened to stall the Assembly indefinitely till the arrest.         
	An angry BJP member, Mahesh Sahu, alleged that the state administration was blaming the Naxalite to cover up its failure to get the real people.         
	Sahu added that the state made no moves to protect the life of the swamiji, who had received a threat letter on August 21, following which an FIR was lodged at Tumudibandh police station.        
	The swamiji who left for Khandhamal from Bhubaneswar on August 22, could have been restrained by the police from going there, said the BJP legislator.         
	The protests were witnessed by a mum chief minister who was present at the House while the BJP members were on their protest path.        
	As soon as the House condoled the death of 76 persons, including former Rajya Sabha member and MLA Jagdish Jani and 37 police personnel and 36 Greyhound Commandos (Andhra Pradesh) who were killed by Naxalites at in this year, BJP members trooped into the well.         
	Simultaneously, the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, demanded immediate discussion on an adjournment motion on the law and order problems in the state by suspending the question hour.         
	Congress members, who were on their feet, raised slogans demanding the chief ministers resignation.         
	However, Speaker Kishore Mohanty said he would allow the discussion after the question hour and appealed to the members to maintain decorum.         
	As his repeated pleas went unheeded, Mohanty adjourned the House for an hour. When the House reassembled, agitated members continued their dharna and uproar in the well. Deputy leader of Congress Narasingha Mishra pressed for discussion on the Opposition-sponsored adjournment motion on law and order and dared the BJP to withdraw support from the coalition government.         
	As the pandemonium continued, Speaker Mohanty adjourned the House for the day.         
	Talking to the reporters from his Assembly chamber, the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, later said the Opposition had submitted a notice to the Speaker today expressing its intention to move a no confidence motion against the BJD-BJP government. The BJP members, he suggested, had deliberately stalled the Assembly proceedings to pre-empt the Opposition move.         
	J.B. Patnaik, however, said the Opposition would definitely move a no-trust motion tomorrow, as and when the House meets.         
	The BJD-BJP government has failed on all fronts including protecting the life and property of the citizens, he summed up.

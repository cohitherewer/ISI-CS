	New Delhi, Feb. 11: A 13-year-old stabbed an older boy at his school with a pocket-knife here today after a fight over the teasing of a girl.        
	Class XI student Ratans injuries arent too deep and the 16-year-old is unconscious but stable, hospital doctors said.        
	Attacker Srinath (all students names changed), who studies in Class VIII, has been suspended and is being questioned by police.        
	The incident occurred around 12.20pm at Kendriya Vidyalaya I in Delhi Cantonment, a few kilometres from the Gurgaon institution that witnessed Indias first school shooting two months ago.        
	Srinaths classmates said he was attacked by three Class XI students and had snatched the knife - the sort students use to sharpen pencils - from one of the bigger boys.        
	Ratan and his friend Deepak had accosted Srinath just after the students of the first shift had trooped out.        
	Deepak accused the younger boy of misbehaving with his sister, a student of the same school, authorities said. After an angry exchange, things went out of hand as the two 16-year-olds tried to rough up the Class VIII boy.        
	Deepak and Ratan started bashing up Srinath. His sweater was torn in the fight, said a classmate of Srinath who was present at the spot.        
	Srinath tried to defend himself and then managed to snatch the knife from another of Deepaks friends who had joined the fight.        
	Srinath apparently intended to attack Deepak but Ratan, who was in the way, was the one who got hurt.        
	Doctors at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital, where the school rushed Ratan, said the boy had suffered two wounds - one in the upper part of his left arm and the other in the torso just below his heart.        
	The injuries are only as deep as the muscles, a doctor said.        
	The school authorities have formed a three-member committee to investigate.        
	We will decide whether we need to expel Srinath once we get a better picture of what really happened, said the assistant commissioner of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Sashikant.        
	He said the principals of all KVs would be instructed to hold regular meetings with class monitors to nip in the bud any simmering tension between children.        
	Srinaths classmates described him as intelligent and said he had fought back after being cornered. He didnt come first in class but always received good grades, a friend said.        
	Last December, a 14-year-old boy shot dead a classmate at a Gurgaon school, allegedly to avenge bullying. In January this year, a Class X boy shot a Class VIII student dead at a rural school in Madhya Pradesh because he suspected the victim of wooing his sister.

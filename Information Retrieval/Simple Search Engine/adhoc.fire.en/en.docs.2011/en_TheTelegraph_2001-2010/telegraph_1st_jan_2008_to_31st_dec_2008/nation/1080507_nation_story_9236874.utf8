          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 6: The Centre and the Left bought more time on the nuclear deal at their eighth meeting on the issue today, deciding to meet again on May 28.        
	Sources said the Left parties did not say an outright no to a suggestion to take the safeguards text to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board for finalising the agreement.         
	The allies said they would give an answer at the next meeting, which thus gains importance.        
	Left leaders, however, said this was just a time-buying tactic and that their opposition to the deal had not changed.         
	They added that the Centre was beginning to understand that the deal could not be signed with the Bush administration, since the meetings with the Left were sure to upset the July deadline.        
	At the two-hour meeting today, the Centre repeated its argument that the safeguards agreement should not be seen only in the context of the US  the agreement was necessary for nuclear co-operation with any country.        
	The Left sought further clarifications on fuel supply assurance, the right to take corrective measures and the deals impact on the indigenous nuclear programme and the additional protocol.        
	The government said that since a lot of clarifications had already been made, India should now go to the IAEA board for its approval.        
	In-depth discussions were held on the India-specific safeguards agreement. The Left parties have sought further clarifications, which will be provided in the next few days. Further discussions will be held in the next meeting on May 28, a statement from foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	Other than Mukherjee, Union science and technology minister Kapil Sibal and finance minister P. Chidambaram explained the governments position to the Left.

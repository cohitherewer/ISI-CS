          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Patna, April 10: Around 25 Naxalites gunned down six persons reportedly belonging to a splinter rebel group early this morning at Taradih forests of Rohtas (Sasaram).        
	Police said the CPI (Maoist) activists opened fire at the six activists of the breakaway Shashastra Peoples Morcha while they were going to attend a meeting after invitation from the Naxalites to iron out differences.         
	The victims  aged between 20 and 35 years  have been identified as Mahendra, Kuldip, Bablu, Shiv Kumar, Shambu and U. Punjabi. They were residents of Barachatti and Mohanpur under Gaya.        
	The shocking incident took place around 4.30am today when members of the CPI (Maoist) had invited Shashastra Peoples Morcha activists for a talk to sort out differences. Though the six Shashastra Peoples Morcha members were carrying weapons to the meeting venue at Taradih jungle, about 60 km from the district headquarters at Sasaram and 225 km from here, they were caught unawares by sudden barrage of bullets by CPI (Maoist) guerrilla wing. All the six died on the spot.         
	Dehri-on-Son deputy superintendent of police Mithilest Kumar said there was panic in the area in the morning as there were initial reports of civilians getting killed. But the police soon learnt that six rebels were killed.         
	Shashastra Peoples Morcha had broken ranks with CPI (Maoist) about a year ago. Both groups had been fighting with each other over possession of territory and areas of operations ever since, said the police officer.        
	The additional inspector-general of police (operations), S.K. Bhardwaj, said those killed were not police informers, as was being claimed by local residents.         
	Residents of Rohtas believed that the police had raised Shashastra Peoples Morcha to neutralise Naxalite attacks.        
	Shashastra Peoples Morchas area of operation includes Rohtas and Kaimur in Bihar and some districts in Jharkhand.        
	Maoist killed        
	A suspected CPI (Maoist) activist was today killed in an encounter with the police in Gaya district. He was killed in an encounter with a joint team of the CRPF and the states special task force at Dhangai village of the district, additional inspector-general of police (operations) S.K. Bharadwaj said.

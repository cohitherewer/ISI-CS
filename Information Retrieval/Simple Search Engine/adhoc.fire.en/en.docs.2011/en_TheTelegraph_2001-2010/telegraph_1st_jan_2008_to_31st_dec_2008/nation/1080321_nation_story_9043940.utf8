	 New Delhi, March 20 (PTI): A court has criticised the defence in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case for its attempt to tarnish the Indian Express journalists image.          
	Perhaps, we have not come out of this illusive superiority of male chauvinism. Why a lonely girl is taken as an easy prey, irrespective of her own whims and response, additional sessions judge Rajender Kumar Shastri said.          
	The defence counsel, during the trial in the case in which IPS officer R.K. Sharma has been found guilty, had alleged that the victim was crazy for professional achievement. The defence also claimed that her marriage with another journalist was an attempt to spur her career prospects.                   
	 Mumbai (PTI): Kangana Ranauts driver has lodged a complaint that he was abused and assaulted by the actress and her sister. Rajesh Kumar Shah has complained that he was abused and assaulted by the sisters on March 9 when they were going for a shoot. Kanganas sister Rangoli had allegedly slapped him.                   
	Mumbai (PTI): Women employees in the Maharashtra government-run organisations and offices can no more be asked to stay beyond 6.30pm. Also, no woman employee should be asked to report for duty on public holidays and on her weekly off, the general administration wing said in a directive.                  
	Allahabad (PTI): Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha, whose decision as the Allahabad High Court judge to set aside the election of Indira Gandhi had set off a chain of events leading to the Emergency in 1975, died on Thursday after prolonged illness.

	Mumbai, Jan. 29: Millat High authorities today banned all private pool cars without clearance certificates from the regional transport office as the tragedy-hit school tried to shut out chances of a repeat of yesterdays blaze that killed five home-bound kids.
    
	The school management, which declared a holiday in memory of the kids burnt alive in their private Maruti Omni, also decided to deny admission to students whose guardians refuse the services of RTO-approved buses hired by the institute.
    
	We cannot let an incident like this to happen again. We have decided to speak to the parents. We will also counsel the children, who have been deeply affected by the deaths of their friends, said head teacher Arif Qasim.
    
	Many parents, however, said private pool cars  as many as 25 ferry students compared to the 28 buses the school runs  were a necessary evil.
    
	Its not unusual to send kids to school in autorickshaws or small vans. The school charges Rs 250 for every kid and the fare goes up as the distance increases. I would have, perhaps, done the same had we lived as far away as some of the others, said Attaur Rehman.
    
	Sources said in Mumbai alone, some 8,000 private vehicles ferried children to school every day. Many school buses dont pick up kids who live far away and cant enter small lanes, added Rehman. 
    
	But for parents of the burnt kids, bus fares and distance do not matter any more.
    
	Umar Merchant, father of seven-year-old Arif who suffered 87 per cent burns after a short circuit triggered a fire in the Maruti van carrying him and 10 others, kept cursing himself for hiring the car. 
    
	We dont know how we can go home without him, he sobbed outside the intensive care unit of Masina Hospital.
    
	Head teacher Qasim said four of the six injured children had been shifted to general wards but Arif and Soumiya, another seven-year-old with 70 per cent burns, were still critical.
    
	While Qasim met some of the injured kids, the 3,500-odd students of Millat, in suburban Jogeshwari, stayed at home today  praying for their friends.

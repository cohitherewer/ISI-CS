	New Delhi, Aug. 27: Union home minister Shivraj Patils first remarks on the sudden escalation in Jammu and Kashmir are perhaps symptomatic of how the Centre has consistently misread the situation and blundered on to create an intractable crisis.         
	The day a surcharged crowd in excess of 60,000 mounted an aborted bid to breach the LoC beyond Uri in north Kashmir, Patil described the marchers as minuscule in number. As if that wasnt shocking enough as an understatement, he went on to blithely ridicule suggestions of a storm building. I have spoken to the governor, he said, the situation in Kashmir is fine.         
	Even as he spoke, security forces were having to open fire upon the Muzaffarabad marchers. Five, including Hurriyat leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz, were shot dead and the azaadi call was resurrected Valley-wide from two decades in hibernation.         
	Since then, Jammu and the Valley have fed incendiary fodder to each other and burned to contrary purposes. And, as became apparent this morning, terror from across the border has found enough room in the chaos to sneak through and stage a disquieting sub-plot of its own.         
	Six weeks into an unprecedented and burgeoning mess, the Centre remains clueless on how to come to grips. Worse, it betrays little evidence it even genuinely wants to. Elaborated to its limits, New Delhis strategy still hinges on passive expectations rather than active measures. The meditative month of Ramazan, which begins next Wednesday, it hopes, will calm the Valley. And, consequently, Jammu too.         
	History is proof Ramazan is a quiet month in Kashmir, a senior official said expansively today. People fast and lie low, and they dont indulge in violence. That will bring tempers down. And then the winter will set in.        
	He gave no indication of a fresh initiative other than state in the most general terms that talks with all concerned to sort matters out will continue. One of the lesser problems both New Delhi and governor N.N. Vohra face today is that not many are interested in talking, in Jammu or in Kashmir.         
	This could have been totally avoided, a sidelined member of the Vohra regime said today. Strong political messages could have been sent both to Jammu and the Valley, the march to Muzaffarabad and its tragic consequences could have been prevented. But nobody seemed in control, or even interested in assuming control.         
	It would perhaps be instructive to rewind to the Centres priorities at the time the crisis over Amarnath was breaking in Jammu and finding violent echoes from the Valley. Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs attentions at the time were wholly obsessed with winning the trust vote. Immediately after came the serial blasts of Bangalore and Ahmedabad. Jammu and Kashmir was allowed to burn on the backburner.         
	Kashmir, by dint of history, by dint of its special constitutional status and, most decidedly, by dint of the Pakistan factor, has traditionally had attention from the very top in New Delhi. Prime Ministers, from Jawaharlal Nehru down to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have personally intervened in moments of crisis, recognising the singular nature of the place in Indias scheme of things.         
	Manmohan Singhs voice, not to speak of his intervention, has been sorely missed and remarked upon in Kashmir. A retired chief secretary of the state said last week, Whether it is true or perceived, the Valley was agog with the economic blockade imposed on it. The Prime Minister could have undone most apprehensions among Kashmiris by making a simple statement that he wouldnt allow the Valley to starve. He not only did not make that assurance, he has not made any.         
	The sudden abdication of the Congress  which ruled the state till the middle of June  from the scene is, in fact, puzzling. The party has a state unit chief  Saifuddin Soz  who belongs to the Valley but he has been altogether missing. The party has betrayed no signs it has a role or responsibilities, or even a stake in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Suddenly, in fact, all the mainstream parties, including the National Conference and the PDP and Congress, are behaving as if they have packed up their bags and run away, leaving the stage to the separatists, said a senior Kashmiri journalist. This is unheard of, even in the throes of the militancy of 1990. It is a very disturbing sign.         
	Its a little irrelevant to ask now whether Patil merely spoke out of smugness on the aborted Muzaffarabad march or had been tragically misinformed by his operatives in the Valley. Whats relevant, and beyond question, is that the firing, which re-ignited the azaadi aspiration vociferously, resulted from basic and absolute failure of intelligence.         
	In the days following the violent outburst, top Kashmiri officials conceded privately that the administration had no clue so many thousands were going to erupt on the road to Muzaffarabad. We would have  and should have  imposed a stringent pre-emptive curfew, said one of them, had we only known. But actually, you dont have to have concrete information in such situations, what was coming was palpable in the air, but nobody acted.         
	In the fortnight that followed, New Delhi and Vohras administration were to compound their derelictions. Perhaps shaken by the Sheikh Aziz killing, the administration gave free rein to the azaadi protests. They became larger and more strident with each passing day. The security forces were instructed to stand by and watch, the pro-Pakistan cry rang louder in the middle of Srinagar. On Independence Day, rallyists cheering such outfits as Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul Mujahideen hoisted not one but half-a-dozen Pakistani flags atop the clock tower in Lal Chowk, Srinagars symbolic hub.         
	It took a visit by national security adviser M.K. Narayanan to Srinagar for Vohra to understand he couldnt allow such unrestrained sedition in the streets of the state capital, especially when the cause celebre of the rallyists was engaging, and killing, Indian troops in violations across the LoC each day. He has now frozen the Valley under curfew, but seems to have no roadmap beyond it other than the miracles of Ramazan.

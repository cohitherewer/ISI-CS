  - PM confidant tipped for berth        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rangarajan                                        
	New Delhi, Aug 8: C. Rangarajan, Manmohan Singhs close confidant and former RBI governor, is tipped to join the Union council of ministers after resigning as chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council.        
	However, sources discounted the possibility of Rangarajan taking over finance minister P. Chidambarams job.        
	Rangarajan is also likely to be nominated to the Upper House in place of Nirmala Deshpande, the eminent Gandhian who expired a few months ago.        
	I have resigned, Rangarajan told PTI, but refused to go into the reasons for his resignation.        
	Rangarajan has also served as governor of Andhra Pradesh and chairman of the Twelfth Finance Commission before taking over at the advisory council.        
	Rangarajan has been known to be part of a circle of Manmohans trusted friends who have helped him manage economic growth through difficult times.         
	He has advised the government on various contentious issues such as special economic zones, oil prices, futures trading, prices of farm commodities and measures to check the economy from overheating.        
	Although the economy has been recording an average of 9 per cent growth in the past four years, it has been grappling with high inflation and a slowdown in manufacturing and export growth.         
	Rangarajan himself had forecast that growth would moderate to 7.5 to 8 per cent this financial year.        
	Suresh Tendulkar, an economist and member of the advisory council, will take over as the new chairman. Tendulkar has in the past taught at the Delhi School of Economics, where Manmohan, too, was a teacher.        
	Tendulkar was also a member of the National Statistical Commission, the first disinvestment commission and the Fifth Pay Commission.

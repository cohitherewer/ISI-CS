	Bhubaneswar, April 7: The Fifth All-India Conference of Indian Association for Social Sciences and Health on Millennium development goals and health organised by the Centre for Healthcare Management started today in the state capital.        
	This year, three themes have been identified for the symposia and 11 titles for technical sessions during the three-day meet. Renowned experts from the fields of health and development would be speaking at the meet.        
	There are eight millennium development goals in all, which were adopted at a series of United Nations conferences held during the 1990s.They represent commitment to poverty and hunger alleviation, tackle ill-health, gender inequality, illiteracy, hygiene issues and environmental degradation.         
	Death and ill health are matters of concern economically, said Nesim Tumkaya, an United Nations Fund for Population Activities representative and the chief guest for the inaugural session. Family health matters because it affects the living standards of households, he added. His views were echoed by P.K.B. Nayar, the president of Indian Association for Social Sciences and Health.         
	The Orissa representative of Unicef, Shadrack Omol, pointed out that sick children were less likely to be in school and they learn less when they are in school. As a result, they are less productive later in life. These are just some of the devastating effects of illnesses, he added.         
	Discussions during the three-day session would vary from goals for health development, reforms and managerial challenges.         
	Sessions would include papers from experts covering demographic transition and ageing in India, managerial challenges in reproductive health and millennium development goals to create health infrastructure.

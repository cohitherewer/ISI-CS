          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati in Lucknow on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 16: Mayavati today swept the five bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, humbling closest rival Samajwadi Party and ensuring that the Congress and the BJP remain on the margins.        
	Her Bahujan Samaj Party added two Lok Sabha seats and three Assembly seats to its kitty, proving rivals wrong.        
	The Congress  under siege at the Centre over price rise and caught in the Rahul Gandhi or Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister debate  competed for third and fourth place with the BJP.         
	Our performance hasnt been that bad, insisted Akhilesh Pratap Singh, the state Congress spokesperson. Barring Azamgarh, where we were pipped to third place by the BJP, everywhere else we beat the BJP.        
	But the news from the heartland was bleak. In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress lost the Betul seat to the BJP. Party sources had hoped that after winning the Khargone Lok Sabha and Samver Assembly seats in December, they could score a hat-trick with Betul and keep up the workers morale before the November Assembly elections.        
	The consolation prize for the Congress came from the east: it retained the Kharba and Laxmipur Assembly seats in Bengal and Orissa respectively by narrow margins.         
	The win prompted a cabinet minister to remark: The sun always rises in the east. Besides, our PM is an advocate of the Look East policy.        
	However, few were amused. The BSP remains our main worry. Had even the Samajwadi Party picked up a couple of seats, it would have served our purpose, a source said.        
	Mayavatis opponents had thought her sarva samaj project of co-opting the Brahmins in a Dalit-centred coalition was unravelling because the Dalits felt the Brahmins had cornered plum positions in her dispensation. The Congress spotted an opening and worked hard to woo the community, with Rahul Gandhi touring several Dalit areas over the past few months.        
	When Rahuls visits drew a sharp response from Mayavati, the Congress took her reaction as a sign of a gradual Dalit shift away from the BSP.        
	The reality was something else. Yes, we did our share of Brahmin appeasement or empowerment. But not at the expense of the Dalits. They handle the levers of power, that much Mayavati has ensured, a BSP MP said.

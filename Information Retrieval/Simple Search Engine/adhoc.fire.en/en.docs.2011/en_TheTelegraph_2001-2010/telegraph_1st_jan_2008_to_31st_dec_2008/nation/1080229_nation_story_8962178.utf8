	Calcutta, Feb. 28: (PTI) The much-awaited CBI report on the mysterious death of computer graphics teacher Rizwanur Rahman today said that he had committed suicide and recommended action aga- inst senior police officers, including the then Calcu- tta police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee in that connection.        
	The main points of the report were today made public by Justice Dipankar Dutta of Calcutta High Court, which had ordered the central agency to investigate the cause of the death of the computer teacher who had married Priyanka Todi, daughter of an industrialist and thus put to rest the controversy as to whether it was a murder or a suicide.        
	The report recommended departmental action against the former police commissioner, who is at present the additional director-general (telecom) with the Bengal police, while asking for major disciplinary action against the then deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh and some officers of Karaya police station.        
	The CBI also sought permission to file chargesheet against the then deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar and two officers of his department along with Priyankas father Ashok Todi, uncle Pradip and maternal uncle Anil Saraogi and Mohiuddin, alias Pappu, 0 for abetment to suicide, criminal intimidation and conspiracy.        
	Rizwanur, whose body was found beside railway tracks a month after his marriage to Priyanka, had allegedly been intimidated by senior police officers of Calcutta police at its Lalbazar headquarters a few days before his death at the behest of her relatives.        
	The death of the youth from a modest background following his marriage to the daughter of a rich industrialist had snowballed into a public outcry and resulted in the shunting out of the three IPS officers, Prasun Mukherjee, Gyanwant Singh and Ajoy Kumar.

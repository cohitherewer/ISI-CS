          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, May 29: A select set of government-run schools is outclassing their private counterparts affiliated to Indias most popular school education board.        
	The Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) and the Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs), funded by the Centre, have recorded significantly higher pass percentages than private schools in the 2008 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examinations for Classes X and XII.        
	The centrally run schools had bested private schools last year, too. In this years Class XII exams, even the other, much maligned, government schools have outstripped private schools, leaving officials at the human resource development (HRD) ministry with broad smiles and quiet celebration.        
	Crucially, government schools have on the whole improved their performance since last year, while the pass percentage has dropped in private schools in both the Class X and Class XII exams. (See chart)        
	This is a vindication of the governments efforts. It is also the best response the government could give to those who would like school education to be privatised, an official in the HRD ministrys school education department said.        
	A Planning Commission panel headed by member Anwar-ul Huda had in April recommended greater privatisation of school education.        
	Results of the Class X board exam, released today, show that while 96 of every 100 students at the KVs passed, the figure dips to below 92 for private schools. The JNVs top the list, with a pass percentage of over 97.        
	The Class XII results, released last week, reveal an even wider gap: the JNVs and KVs show pass percentages of 92 and 91, respectively, while the private schools have recorded a little over 81.         
	The other government schools  run by municipalities and state governments  have just pipped the private schools with nearly 82 per cent.        
	CBSE officials blamed the declining performance of private schools on lack of enough regulation.        
	There are so many private schools that have mushroomed across the country; we are yet to develop an effective mechanism to monitor them. But the results clearly show that privatisation is not the panacea to improve quality, a top CBSE official said.        
	India has 551 JNVs and 850 KVs. The HRD ministry plans to double these numbers during the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-12).

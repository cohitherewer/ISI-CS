The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM turns to music as polls near
                                                                                                               CM turns to music as polls near
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, March 23: Music, especially of the patriotic kind, could well be Shivraj Singh Chauhans arsenal for the November Assembly elections.         
	The Madhya Pradesh chief minister has applied for a licence for an FM channel that will be called Azad Hind Radio, after the radio service started by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1942 to encourage Indians to fight for freedom. On air will be over 250 patriotic songs, state culture minister Laxmi Kant Sharma has promised.        
	Azad Hind Radio will be on air the moment we get the licence. We want to instil patriotism in people, Chauhan said.        
	We have a huge collection of folk music and songs. These songs and folk music sung by Tantya Bheel and dozens of other tribal warriors during our struggle for Independence forms part of a rich and proud heritage. We want to bring it to peoples attention, Sharma said.        
	The cost of setting up Azad Hind Radio, including equipment and installation charges, is estimated at Rs 8 lakh.         
	Sharma said his ministry also proposed to name a festival in memory of the legendary singer Baiju Bawra, a contemporary of Tansen who hailed from Chanderi in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh.         
	Baijus original name was Baijnath Mishra but he reportedly earned the sobriquet bawra (crazy) after he fell in love with a dancer in Chanderi.         
	Regarded a master of Dhrupad, Bawras music is said to have kindled oil lamps when he sang Raag Deepak, and produced rain when he sang Raag Megh. Flowers bloomed when he sang Raag Bahar.        
	Some state bureaucrats believe that this sudden love for Baiju Bawra could be a way of compensating for the Chauhan regimes lack of success in getting Jodhaa Akbar banned. The government had banned the film, but Madhya Pradesh High Court lifted it in February.        
	Now, under Sangh parivars pressure, the Bawra legacy is being resurrected to demonstrate Indian supremacy over the Mughal emperors durbar, the bureaucrats said. History has it that Bawra stunned Tansen, Akbars court singer, in a musical duel. One account claims Tansen fell at Bawras feet seeking pardon after the defeat.        
	Sharma denied that the spotlight on Baiju Bawra had anything to do with the Jodhaa Akbar row.         
	He said the BJP government had been constantly encouraging all artistes hailing from the state. We have so many festivals and awards like Kishore Samman, Tansen Samman, Bhojpur festival and the Narmada festival, he said.         
	There are also plans for a TV channel  to be called Deshbhakti TV  in the air. Sharma told Assembly that Madhya Pradesh will be the first Indian state to run a channel exuding deshbhakti. We have channels on faith, entertainment, news, sports, markets, lifestyle, fashion, etc. I say why not a channel exclusively for patriotism? Sharma asked.

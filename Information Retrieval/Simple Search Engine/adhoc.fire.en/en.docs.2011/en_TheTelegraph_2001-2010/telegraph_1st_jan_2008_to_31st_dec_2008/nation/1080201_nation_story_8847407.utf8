	Cuttack, Jan. 31: Three years and eight months after taking over Swaraj Ashram, Orissa government has reshaped it into a memorial museum for the states Gandhian leaders.
    
	Swaraj Ashram in Cuttack was once the hub of the freedom struggle and the Indian National Congress. Mahatma Gandhi had stayed at the ashram on his first visit to Orissa. Later, Gandhi had sent Mira Behn to the ashram and she stayed there for over a year.
    
	Now, the government has made it a monument in memory of the lives and times of the leaders and their contribution to the freedom movement.
    
	The initiative is to present the ashram as an active, socio-cultural hub of Gandhian ideals and ideas throbbing with life for the city and tourists, said Surya Narayan Patro, the minister for culture, inaugurating the museum on Wednesday.
    
	The museum has been designed to present visual accounts  mostly photographs connected with the freedom movement and the role of Swaraj Ashram  which was in the thick of the non-cooperation movement in the 1920s.
    
	For history buffs, Gandhi had practically inaugurated the movement in Orissa. Gandhiji first visited Cuttack in March 1921 and stayed at the ashram for two days. He addressed a public meeting on the banks of Kathajodi River on March 24, 1921 to set up for Orissa a target of Rs 3 lakh for the Tilak Swaraj Fund.

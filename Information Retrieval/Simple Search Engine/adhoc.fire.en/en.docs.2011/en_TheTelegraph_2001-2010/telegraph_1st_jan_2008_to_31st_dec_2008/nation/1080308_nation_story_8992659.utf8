          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 7: Union minister of state for railways R. Velu flagged off the Bhubaneswar-Ranchi Garib Rath here today in presence of law minister Biswabhushan Harichandan and MP Pyarimohan Mahapatra.         
	The air-conditioned superfast express comprising eight AC coaches and two power-cum-guard coaches would run thrice a week. Each coach in the train consists of 78 berths.        
	On its inaugural run the special train will reach Ranchi at 9:10pm on the same day. The train will start its regular run from Ranchi on March 8 and from Bhubaneswar on March 9.         
	The 2832 Bhubaneswar-Ranchi Garib Rath is scheduled to leave Bhubaneswar at 8pm every Sunday, Tuesday and Friday and reach Ranchi at 7:15am the next day.         
	Similarly, 2831 Ranchi-Bhubaneswar Garib Rath will leave Ranchi at 9:05pm every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and is scheduled to arrive here at 8:15am the next day.         
	The train will stop at Cuttack, Dhenkenal, Talcher, Angul, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Rourkela and Hatia.         
	A reserved ticket to Ranchi will cost Rs 469 and to Rourkela Rs 365.         
	Similarly, the fare from Bhubaneswar to Talcher Road will be Rs 209 and to Sambalpur Rs 290.         
	Its a great news for people like us, who can hardly afford high AC fare. Also as summers are here, the ride will definitely be an enjoyable one, said Bijay Meher, a passenger.

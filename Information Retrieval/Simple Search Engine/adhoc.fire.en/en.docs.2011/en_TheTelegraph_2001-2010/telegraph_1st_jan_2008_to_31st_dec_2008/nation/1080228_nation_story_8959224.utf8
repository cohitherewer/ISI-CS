          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sonia Gandhi meets farmers at her home on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The government today confronted the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party on their track record in agriculture as they stalled both Houses of Parliament in protest against agrarian distress.        
	The Congress-led UPA accused the Opposition parties of being desperate to snatch credit from the government by showing that their cries had forced it to present a pro-farmer general budget.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said parties should know that the budget is not prepared in a day or two. The policy framework and the political direction of the budget were decided months ago and the nation knows this, he told reporters after the Houses were adjourned for the day.        
	Many expect the government to come up with a loan-waiver package for farmers in its budget tomorrow.        
	As soon as the Lok Sabha session started at 11 this morning, Opposition members began shouting slogans about the farmers crisis and rushed to the well, demanding suspension of question hour.         
	Das Munshi said the government had told the leaders in advance that they would be given time to discuss any issue they wanted but there was no point in disrupting question hour.        
	BJP leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra accused the government of shying away from discussing the plight of farmers as it had failed to do anything for them.        
	Dubbing the concern shown by the BJP a sham, the minister reeled off the minimum support prices for agricultural commodities fixed by governments since 1993. The UPAs record was far better than the NDAs, he said.

	Cuttack, June 30: Surgeons of a private hospital here yesterday removed a tumour weighing 32.5kg from a 30-year-old womans abdomen, probably the largest one ever seen in the state.         
	The surgeon who removed the tumour said that it had been growing inside the abdomen of the patient for nearly three years.        
	Ramasingh Munda of Baduan village in Joda area of Keonjhar district noticed her wife Basantis stomach swelling over the past three years but in the initial one year he assumed that the increase in the abdomens size was due to pregnancy.         
	But when the stomach became even bigger, Ramasingh took Basanti to a doctor at Keonjhar, who referred her to Cuttack for operation as she had a growing tumour. Eventually he admitted his wife to Gems Hospital in Cuttack and the surgery was performed on Sunday.         
	After a four-hour operation when we removed the tumour we were absolutely amazed at its size. It weighed 32.5kg. It is the biggest we have ever seen and we believe its the biggest in the Orissas medical history, Dr Ranjan Tripathy, the surgeon who led the nine-member team that performed the operation, told reporters today.         
	Its amazing that how she carried on with such a big tumour in her body. The growth was 60-inch long and 50-inch wide. But the tumour was not cancerous and Basanti is in a stable condition, the surgeon said. She would be discharged from the hospital after 10 days.        
	In 2006, surgeons of SCB Medical College Hospital here had removed tumour weighing 18kg from the belly of a patient.

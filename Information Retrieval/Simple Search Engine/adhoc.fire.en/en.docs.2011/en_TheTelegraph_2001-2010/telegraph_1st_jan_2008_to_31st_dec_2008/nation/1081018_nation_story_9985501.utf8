          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: The BJP has demanded rescheduling of the Parliament session that began today, arguing that back-to-back holidays for upcoming festivals made the exercise meaningless.         
	BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said the government had almost made Parliament redundant and irrelevant by delaying the normal monsoon session fixed for August 11.         
	The government chose Friday knowing that no business would be transacted on a day only private members bills can be moved but the session will appear longer by three days, she said.        
	The current session will continue till November 21. But there will hardly be any business from October 26 to November 4 because of Dhanteras, Diwali, Bhai Dooj and Chhat, Sushma said.         
	After that, the campaign for Assembly elections will be at its peak as the first phase in Chhattisgarh is on November 14. What is the meaning of this session? she asked.        
	Sushma claimed the government, which has not clarified whether this was the monsoon or the winter session, was only completing formalities.         
	They called a two-day special session to move the vote of confidence and cleverly didnt prorogue it. This is being treated as an extension of that session. They did this to ensure no fresh no-confidence motion is moved, she claimed.         
	No-Confidence motions can be moved only once in a session.         
	Sushma said the BJP would not be party to the governments plan of making Parliament redundant. L.K. Advani has demanded rescheduling of the session at an all-party meeting called by the Speaker today.         
	The government is unlikely to pay heed to the demand of the BJP, which appears to be trying to score brownie points. With more at stake for the BJP in the Assembly polls than other parties  it is in power in three of the four states going to vote  most of its leaders are likely to be outside Parliament, campaigning.        
	Also, the party has moved ahead with proceedings under the existing schedule, having demanded discussions on internal security and the impact of the global financial crisis on the Indian economy.        
	It has tried to resist a debate on the violence against Christians in Orissa and Karnataka, hoping there would be a general debate on communal and ethnic clashes instead. It may also seek to highlight the attacks on Hindi-speaking people in Congress-ruled Assam and Maharashtra.

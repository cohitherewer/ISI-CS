          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mittal: Steady progress                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 27: ArcelorMittal, worlds largest steel producer, is ready with the detailed project report for its proposed 12MTPA greenfield plant to be set up in the state.        
	Revealing this to the media on the sidelines of an international conference on iron and steel making here today, ArcelorMittal country head for greenfield projects Sanak Mishra said the report was expected to be submitted to the state government soon.        
	Mishra said there had been a satisfactory progress both in respect of Orissa and Jharkhand projects. Both are moving on good speed and on schedule, he said.        
	ArcelorMittal had signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government in October 2005 for setting up of 12MTPA greenfield plant along with a 1,500MW captive power plant. A year later, it signed another MoU with Orissa in December 2006 for a greenfield steel plant of the same capacity and investment.        
	The Orissa plant would be located in Patna tehsil of mineral-rich Keonjhar district and the Jharkhand one would come up at Torpa Kamdara area. A target has been set to commission the first phase of both the plants (with 6MTPA each) by 2011-12, company sources said.        
	Presenting the progress report of the Orissa project, Mishra said the railway and transport clearances had been obtained and the National Highways Authority of India had been requested to provide road to the plant. The state government has also been requested to conduct gram sabha meetings for land acquisition, Mishra said.        
	He added that they had submitted application for allotment of captive iron ore mines and grant prospecting licence for exploration and mining. We hope the government will recommend for grant of prospecting licence, he said.         
	The feasibility report has been submitted and the socio-economic survey of the project is complete, he said.

	Bhubaneswar, April 28: The state, after fighting the summer sun for the past few days, is likely to experience some dip in temperature from tomorrow.         
	The Bhubaneswar meteorological centre today confirmed that yesterdays deep depression over the Bay of Bengal had intensified into a cyclonic storm that would hit the states coast in the next 48 hours.        
	Strong surface winds from south-westerly direction, reaching up to 45 to 55 kilometres per hour, is likely to blow along and off the Orissa coast.         
	According to satellite images, yesterdays depression over south east and adjoining south west of Bay of Bengal moved north-westwards and intensified into a cyclonic storm and lay centred over south west, adjoining south east and west central of Bay of Bengal at about 700km south of Gopalpur in the morning today.        
	By afternoon the storm called Nargis had remained practically stationary and lay centred at the same spot.        
	Inputs by the Met department stated that the system was likely to intensify further and move in a north-westerly direction for some more time. Thereafter, it was likely to recurve and move north-east.         
	The Met office has also forecast rain and thundershowers at a few places over south Orissa and isolated places over north Orissa. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea, as its condition will remain moderate to rough.         
	Distant cautionary signal number-2 was hoisted at Paradip and Gopalpur ports.         
	Meanwhile, due to the low pressure, the temperature in coastal Orissa has subsided already.         
	While temperature in Bhubaneswar was recorded at 36.8 degrees Celsius, Cuttack recorded 34.6 degrees Celsius. Moreover, a marginal dip in day temperature was reported in some parts of western Orissa.         
	At towns of Puri, Gopalpur, Paradip, Chandbali and Balasore, highest temperature remained between 30 and 40 degrees Celsius.

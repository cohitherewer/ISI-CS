          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                          The Madiwala area after the blast. (AP)                                  
	Bangalore, July 25: TGIF  Thank God its Friday  is not something Bangaloreans were telling each other today.        
	After the bad news of the serial blasts, many negotiated hours of chaotic, snail-like traffic, steady rain and waterlogged streets to go home.        
	Many BPOs scrapped the afternoon shift because of the blasts and the shortage of diesel that affected their fleet of cabs. But calling it a day early did not help the employees.        
	Ranjitha P.R., an IT employee in Electronics City, took over three hours to cross the Hosur Road stretch where five low-intensity bombs had gone off.         
	Our office minibus crawled through the entire 15km stretch to Richmond Road. We could see all the locations where the blasts had happened. Its very scary as Bangalore is supposed to be very safe.         
	Electronics City on Hosur Road and Sarjapur Road, off Madiwala, are areas where Infosys, Wipro and a host of IT-enabled service companies are located. Over 2 lakh people work in these areas.         
	Sandeep Shivanandan, a senior project manager at an outsourcing firm on Outer Ring Road near Bellandur, where Intel has its office, said his company decided to call off the afternoon shift for two reasons. One was news of the serial blasts. Second, as there is a diesel shortage, we had only a third of the cabs at our disposal, he said.        
	With the traffic jams, there was the problem of jammed cellphone networks, too.        
	Educational institutions, too, closed an hour early and thousands of children were seen waiting to be picked up by their families.         
	Some like Ramya, Vidya and Shilpa had to wade through waterlogged streets to catch buses. As their Richmond Road school fell between two blast sites, all traffic in that area was diverted.

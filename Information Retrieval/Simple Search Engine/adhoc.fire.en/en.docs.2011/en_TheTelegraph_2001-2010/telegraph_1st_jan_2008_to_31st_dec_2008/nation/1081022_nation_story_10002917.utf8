          OUR BUREAU                              
	Udalguri/ Kokrajhar, Oct. 21: Medical tests on two women who alleged they were assaulted by CRPF jawans in a riot-hit central Assam district on Sunday have found no evidence of rape, but that does not clear the accused yet.        
	Monideep Rai Deka, the medical and health officer at the Mangaldoi Civil Hospital who conducted the tests, said the physical examination had revealed no injury marks in any part of the bodies of the two victims and (lab) tests were also negative.        
	Deka, who is trained in forensic medicine, said the report was submitted to the investigating officer this morning.        
	Sources said this would not immediately clear the accused CRPF men because the report also mentioned that the two women had told him they had bathed and cleaned themselves after they were raped. This would have destroyed any evidence. The women also said they had washed the clothes they were wearing at the time.         
	There was need to examine the clothes for traces of spermatazoa, if any, Deka said. But as far as we are concerned, there is no evidence of any recent sexual act.        
	It was now up to the police to ascertain whether rape had been committed, he said.        
	Udalguri superintendent of police A.K. Tiwari said the police would examine circumstantial evidence to ascertain if the allegation of rape was true.         
	An Assamese woman and a Bodo woman in an Udalguri village, about 95km from Guwahati, had yesterday accused jawans of the central force patrolling the district of rape.         
	The CRPF had agreed to an identification parade of the patrol party of eight, which was detained yesterday. But Tiwari said the parade could not be held today as magisterial permission was still awaited.         
	Rowta unit president of All-Bodo Students Union, Hithasa Boro, said that irrespective of the findings of the medical report, there was no doubt that the CRPF jawans had molested the two women. It is an attempt to rape. The guilty jawans should be punished, he said.        
	The village falls under Rowta police outpost.        
	A villager, Montu Daimari, said: The recent riots did not have much of an impact in our village but Sundays incidents have totally shattered the peace.         
	CRPF sources said the allegations have been brought to malign the force and to get its men to leave.

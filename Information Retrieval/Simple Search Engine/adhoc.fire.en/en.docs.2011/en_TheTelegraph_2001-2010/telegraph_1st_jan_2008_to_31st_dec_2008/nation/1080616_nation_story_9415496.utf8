	Bhubaneswar, June 15: Former UN under secretary-general Shashi Tharoor last night gave away the coveted Sarala Award, instituted by Impact (Indian Metals Public Charitable Trust) for the promotion of Oriya literature, to writer Haraprasad Das.         
	Das was awarded for his anthology of poems Harmonium Re Todi. The 29-year-old award carries a citation, a shawl and a cash award of Rs 1.5 lakh. Other awardees included writer Binod Pasayat, music director Prafulla Kar and social worker Abhay Charan Chalan, who were felicitated by trust chairman B.D. Panda. Acclaimed artist Sudarshan Pattnaik, who is in Berlin now, could not attend the function to receive the felicitation.        
	Shashi Tharoor defended the new breed of Indian authors writing in English. They may be writing in a foreign language, but the culture is their own, said Tharoor.

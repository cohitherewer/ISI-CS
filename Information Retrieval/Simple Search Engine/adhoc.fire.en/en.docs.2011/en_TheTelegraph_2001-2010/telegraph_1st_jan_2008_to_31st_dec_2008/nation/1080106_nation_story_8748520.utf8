The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Transfer looms on commander
                                                                                                            Transfer looms on commander
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 5 (PTI): Lieutenant General Harcharanjit Singh Panag today met defence minister A.K. Antony to stop his transfer from the Northern Command but apparently had to return empty-handed.        
	Army chief General Deepak Kapoor had proposed to shift Panag from the active Northern Command to the much quieter Central Command in Lucknow after he ordered inquiries into several army procurements.        
	One of the cases  a tent scam  had taken place when the army chief was in charge of the Northern Command.        
	Defence ministry officials refused to reveal the details of todays meeting but the officer is believed to have apprised Antony about the cases in which he wants inquiries to be completed under him.        
	Sources said Panag furnished the findings of the court of inquiry on the tent scam and details of 22 other cases.        
	The minister promised Panag that the tent scam probe would be taken to its logical conclusion but gave no assurance on putting his transfer on hold, the sources said.         
	Panag, who is due to retire in 2008, has been reportedly asked to move to Lucknow after taking the salute at the Army Day parade on January 15.

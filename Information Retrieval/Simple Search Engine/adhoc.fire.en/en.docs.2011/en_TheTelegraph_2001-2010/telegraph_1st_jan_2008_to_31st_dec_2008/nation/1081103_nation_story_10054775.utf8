          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 2: A wildcat strike by employees has cast a shadow over the functioning of the 120-bed JPM Eye Hospital amp; Research Institute of Rotary Club in Cuttack.        
	Though treatment is still being extended to more than 200 persons with eye-related problems at its OPD everyday, technical examinations and operations have not been possible because of the strike since October 21. Over a hundred patients, who need surgical attention, are already on the waiting list because of the deadlock.        
	Hospital managing committee president P.K. Mishra described the strike spearheaded by Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh-backed employees union as pressure tactics for irrational demands.        
	Employees union president Basant Kumar Sahu, however, claimed: The management was aware of our demands for a long time but nothing was done to ameliorate the working conditions of the employees.        
	The union has been demanding bonus for the staff and inclusion of contractual employees in the regular cadre. Mishra claimed: Since we have no provision of bonus, we pay ex-gratia during the Puja every year. In fact, the ex-gratia amount was raised last year.        
	According to records, the hospital has staff strength of 98, including 16 doctors. All the 82 employees, excluding the doctors, are on strike. Of them, 17 are in contractual category, while the rest are regular cadre, said Paritosh Das, the CEO of the hospital.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Feb. 4: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today openly vented his ire against Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray for the latters adverse comments on the people of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. 
    
	Thackerays outfit should be banned with immediate effect. People and political parties from across the country should boycott it, said an angry Nitish, adding: Mumbai ujar jayega agar Bihar aur UP ke logon ko wahan se nikalagaya (Mumbai will lose its existence if the people of Bihar and UP are driven out from there). 
    
	In the same vein, the chief minister reminded reporters that Mumbai roads would be dead without the taxi drivers from Bihar. 
    
	Nitish said the people of the state would not take Thackerays and Senas behaviour lying down. Bihar people dont believe in picking up fights. But by instinct they will not tolerate injustice. They should not be driven to desperation by unruly Thackerays men. 
    
	He said people have their right to travel to the financial capital of the country and pointed out to Delhi example where thousands of students, businessmen and families from outside stay peacefully. 
    
	Nitish also demanded the Maharashtra government to deal with Thackeray and his Sena men with iron hands for fomenting regional sentiment and threatening Indias unity. 
    
	Speaking against a particular festival is tantamount to hurting the religious sentiments of the people, he said referring to a comment where Chhath was described as a nautanki (drama).
    
	Senior BJP leader, R.K. Sinha said: Raj Thackeray is trying to gain popularity through cheap methods by attacking Chhath Puja. He does not understand that in the process of gaining Marathi goodwill, he is losing out north Indias support. Maharashtra government must teach him a lesson for resorting to anti-national rhetoric.

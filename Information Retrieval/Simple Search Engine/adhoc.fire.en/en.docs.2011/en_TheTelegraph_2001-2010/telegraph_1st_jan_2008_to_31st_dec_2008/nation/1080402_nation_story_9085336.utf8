The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land lottery for one, let-down for other   Crore amp; half an acre off Mohali
                                                                                                               Crore amp; half an acre off Mohali
  - Land lottery for one, let-down for other           GAJINDER SINGH                      Chhota Singh whose land in Mohali sold for Rs 75 lakh, (Gajinder Singh)                                            
	Jhurjheri, April 1: Darshan Singh, 58, sounds worried  not what you would expect from a man about to get richer by Rs 10.5 crore.        
	Chhota Singh, 50, will get Rs 75 lakh, which he hopes will help his daughter get a better education.         
	The Punjab government on March 20 announced it would pay Rs 1.5 crore an acre for land it is acquiring for the Mohali international airport. Darshan owns seven acres and Chhota half-an-acre.         
	Yes, it is a windfall. It is a kind of lottery for the villagers. But where do we go from here? Land that has been ours for ages has now been acquired. We will now have to scout for land elsewhere, where it is cheap. That is our biggest worry, Darshan says before taking a call from a bank seeking an appointment to sell him its services.        
	Darshan earlier spent his day overseeing labourers cultivate his fields  in a good year, the yield can be Rs 1 lakh an acre. Spare time would be spent with friends he has known all his life, growing up in Jhurjheri village 10km from Mohali.         
	Now, between warding off over-eager bankers and property dealers, he is trying to figure out what the mind-boggling land sale will mean for his familys future.        
	Most of the 306 acres to be acquired for the airport is fertile and farmers also supplement their income by selling milk.         
	Proper tilling can fetch anything between Rs 80,000 and Rs1 lakh per acre as the soil is very fertile and underground water not too deep. We have been growing wheat, rice, onions, potatoes and carrots. The market for the produce too is nearby, in Mohali and Chandigarh, and with negligible transport costs, farming fetches good returns here, says Darshan.        
	A market that, Darshan fears, will not be accessible as easily from a village that he might now have to buy land in. The villagers will scout for land in Ropar, Sangrur, Hoshiarpur and Patiala but are afraid the prices might be steep, and access to water and even good hospitals and schools not as easy.        
	The government has announced that the villagers will not have to pay registration fee and stamp duty on the land they buy in the state in the next two years using the compensation money. They would also be entitled to a priority power tubewell connection where they buy the land.        
	Chhota owns only a fraction of the land that Darshan does and lives in a 1,000-sqft, two-room house with his wife, son and daughter. I have never seen such money, only heard of it, he says, of the Rs 75 lakh that he stands to gain. What will I do? Perhaps I will spend more money to educate my daughter. But before that, I will have to look for an alternative means of livelihood or buy land elsewhere if I can afford it.        
	His daughter, 22, is pursuing a diploma in engineering at a Dera Bassi college, 20km away on the road to Ambala. Chhota, whose 25-year-old son helps him till the land and tend to the three buffaloes the family owns, wants her to study further.        
	Not everyone in the village is thinking about the future, though.                The fertile land to be acquired for the Mohali international airport. Picture by   Gajinder Singh        
	Amarinder Singh wants a BMW, now. The student of Class VIII is the youngest of Prem Singhs three children  two sons and a daughter. Daddy will get Rs 21 crore. A BMW costs just Rs 35 lakh. It is not expensive, the teenager shrugs.         
	Sarpanch Prem Singh  not Amarinders father  said the compensation was okay and would have been lower had the villagers not negotiated the price with the government. There have been deals of Rs 2 crore an acre here in the recent past.        
	Of the 161 families in the village, 45 will have their farmland acquired by the government.         
	When land was acquired for building the airport in 1950, it fetched between Rs 450 and Rs 500 an acre. In 1965, when the airport was extended, it fetched between Rs 5,500 and Rs 6,000. The jump is enormous and mind-boggling, says Darshan, who drives a Maruti 800 but now has the option to upgrade without spending a penny. Banks are making all sorts of offers to get the farmers to deposit the cheques with them  one is offering expensive cars to anyone who will do so.         
	The village lies adjacent to Chandigarh airport, which will be limited to defence use once the new airport comes up in about three years. More land in the neighbourhood might be acquired at a later stage for the Mohali airport.        
	Barnala farmers        
	Farmers in Barnala, whose 376 acres of fertile land was acquired by the previous government for a private businessman at Rs 8-13 lakh per acre, will now get 70 per cent extra. The Badal government has persuaded the private group to pay the extra money following protests from the villagers.

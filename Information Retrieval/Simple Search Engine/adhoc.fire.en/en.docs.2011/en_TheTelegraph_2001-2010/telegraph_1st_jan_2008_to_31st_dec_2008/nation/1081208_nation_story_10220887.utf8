	Adhoosa (LoC), Dec. 7: The horrors of past Indo-Pak wars revisited the 50-odd families in Kashmirs last village on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road as alleged gunfire from across the border raged last night.        
	This morning, the villagers of Adhoosa suppressed their fear and braved the cold to vote, with a silent prayer for peace in their hearts.        
	The border belt of Uri, including Adhoosa, some 3km from the Kaman post which connects the two Kashmirs, saw 70 per cent voting in the fourth phase of the Assembly polls, on a day the state government faced its first major challenge from anti-poll protesters elsewhere.        
	Last nights firing came from Pakistani pickets on the Kamalkote Madia mountain adjoining the village but there were no casualties, said Muhammad Sidiq Khan, a state co-operative department employee.        
	The region has smelt trouble with the war cries getting louder in the subcontinent, and wants an end to the rising tension.        
	This is the first time we have heard firing in the past five years or so, said Khan, whose uncle Mohammad Sharif, a resident of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is visiting him.        
	My uncle came in the peace bus and will leave for Muzaffarabad in a few days. He was terribly shaken by the firing. God knows what will happen to this place again. But we are voting with the hope that this will convince the Centre to think of us before going to war.        
	There can be no development here if there is no peace, said Zeenat Parveen, an anganwadi worker from Adhoosa, whose family didnt sleep after hearing the gunfire.        
	The villagers claim about cross-LoC firing could not be confirmed with army officers in Srinagar.        
	I am outside the state and do not know about any such thing, army spokesperson Colonel D.K. Kachari said. If the villagers account is true, this would be the first ceasefire violation in Kashmir since the Mumbai attacks.        
	To Adhoosa, the ceasefire means a lot. The village had suffered terribly in the 1947-48 Indo-Pak clashes and, during the 1965 conflict, residents were displaced to another village where they stayed for seven years.        
	After the outbreak of militancy, there were again a lot of restrictions. No civilian vehicle was allowed ahead of the Red Bridge, some 3km from here. Cross-border shelling was routine before the 2003 ceasefire and if we have seen any peace, it is only during the past five years, said Mohammad Khan of nearby Chakri village.        
	Some 55 per cent of voters cast their ballots today in 18 constituencies, spread across four districts, with the turnout low in the separatist strongholds of Sopore and Baramulla. Sopore, hometown of Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani, saw just 14 per cent polling.        
	Elsewhere, there was good polling with long queues at the booths. A large number of women voted.        
	Sporadic anti-election protests rocked Sopore, with several journalists bearing the brunt of the police crackdown. Two journalists were among those injured.        
	We have lodged a case against the security personnel. We regret the assault on the media and we assure you a fair investigation would be conducted, said B. Srinivas, inspector-general of police, Kashmir.

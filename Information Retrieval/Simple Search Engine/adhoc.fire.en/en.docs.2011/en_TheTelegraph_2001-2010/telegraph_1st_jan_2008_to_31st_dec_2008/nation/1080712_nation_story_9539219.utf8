	New Delhi, July 11: The Centre has abandoned plans to allow private-sector nuclear power plants in the backdrop of the political controversy over the 123 Agreement.        
	Major private companies that were keen to enter the lucrative sector have been informally told by top government officials that they must wait at least five years.        
	The government has dropped a clause from a draft amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, that would have allowed private investment in nuclear power. The amendments may soon come up before the cabinet for discussion, officials said.        
	Domestic majors such as the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Energy, the Tatas, GMR and Essar were believed to be keen to enter the sector. The Planning Commission had even advocated allowing foreign direct investment.        
	Plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had hinted as early as 2005 that India could allow FDI in the sector if the nuclear powers agreed to sell nuclear fuel.        
	Several multinationals, including Electricite de France and the US-based Westinghouse, were believed to be interested in picking up equity in private nuclear-power plants if and when they came up.        
	Officials estimate that the private players would have invested about Rs 60,000 crore. But they argue that it is necessary to have only state-run monopolies in the fray for now to ensure smooth and secure functioning of the civil nuclear deal.        
	The countrys laws now allow only the state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) to set up and run power plants.        
	The corporation plans to set up four nuclear plants, one each in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bengal. The giant utility wants to buy the AP1000 series of reactors from Westinghouse, the ABWR series from General Electric, 1,000MW reactors from Frances Areva and the VVR1000 reactors from Russia.        
	Officials said the amendments would be tweaked, however, to allow other state-run utilities, such as the NTPC, to join the fray.        
	The state-run listed utility, which is into thermal power generation, has plans to diversify into nuclear energy and generate 2,000MW by 2012. It is believed to be scouting sites in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh.        
	It has been also holding preliminary talks with several global nuclear technology leaders, but indications are that it may team up with the Russians given their lower costs.        
	Top officials said the government was considering the amendments since India wants 20,000MW of nuclear power against the current 3,300MW from its antiquated state-run nuclear plants.        
	They said the amendments would empower the government to take over custody as well as ownership of spent fuel if organisations dealing with it are unable to take satisfactory steps for its safe management.        
	Under the 123 Agreement, imported nuclear spent fuel is expected to be reprocessed in a new reprocessing facility that India has offered to set up. Although this is supposed to be under international supervision, the amendment suggests that the government can, if it feels necessary, take over control and ownership.        
	The amendments also provide for an Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority to be set up. Normally, a tariff regulator is established when a sector is opened up to private players to ensure a level playing field and protect consumer interests.        
	The AERA and the existing Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, which controls radio-active material and its use within the country, are to be headed by the same person.        
	Under the amendments, all nuclear plants and establishments earmarked by the Centre as strategic are kept out of the regulatory authoritys ambit.

	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Delhis rice of friendship for Dhaka is stewing in a bureaucratic pot.
    
	India had sent 20,000 tonnes of rice to Bangladesh in the wake of Cyclone Sidr that ravaged the neighbours coastline in November. 
    
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee had promised another consignment of five lakh tonnes despite the ban Delhi had imposed on export of non-Basmati rice to ensure enough supply of the grain in the domestic market.
    
	Mukherjee, who reached Bangladesh on December 1, said the decision to waive the ban had been taken in the context of the magnitude of the natural calamity.
    
	The minister also said Delhi was willing to adopt 10 severely affected coastal villages for rehabilitation.
    
	But even after several rounds of consultations  and a visit by a delegation from Dhaka last month  the additional five lakh tonnes havent left India.
    
	Sources said the agencies involved in the export were yet to synchronise the effort to send the consignment to the cyclone-hit neighbour which says Sidr, coupled with floods in July and September, had destroyed two million tonnes of rice.
    
	Modalities were yet to be worked out at the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation, from where the bulk of the amount has to be procured.
    
	The sources said discussions were on among agencies like the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India, the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation and the Bengal supply corporation.
    
	Sources in South Block, the seat of Indias foreign ministry, said even Bangladesh had to make certain arrangements like opening the letters of credit and making the advance payment.
    
	We hope all these issues will be thrashed out as early as possible, a source said.
    
	Dhaka, which has knocked on countries like Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan to meet its rice deficit, had also requested Delhi to reduce the export price of rice to domestic levels in Bangladesh.
    
	India had hiked the export rate by $75 a tonne in the last week of December to $500.
    
	The sources, however, pointed out that the price hike might not be applicable to the five lakh tonnes as the announcement had been made earlier.
    
	A delegation led by Bangladesh food secretary Ayub Milan to India recently had taken up the issue. But, the sources said, some grey areas still remained.

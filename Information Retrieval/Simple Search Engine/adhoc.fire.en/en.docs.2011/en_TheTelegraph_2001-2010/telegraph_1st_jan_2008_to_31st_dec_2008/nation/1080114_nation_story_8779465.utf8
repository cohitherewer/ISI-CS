	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Deep divisions between different arms of the government over punishing men who visit brothels are likely to push proposed amendments to tighten Indias anti-trafficking laws into cold storage.
    
	Government officials involved with the controversial amendments to the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act have told The Telegraph they are fast losing hope that a consensus can be obtained. 
    
	In the absence of a consensus, or at least a clear majority view within the government, the planned changes may be put on hold indefinitely, the officials said. 
    
	A crucial meeting of a Group of Ministers on the amendments is scheduled for January 21, where the future of the proposals may be decided. 
    
	In the run-up to the GoM meeting, those in favour of the changes and those against are frantically trying to drum up support for their views. The GoM was virtually split down the middle at its last meeting in October 2007. 
    
	On Tuesday, women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury is meeting Congress colleague Kapil Sibal to try and convince him that the amendments will help curb trafficking. 
    
	Sibal, the science and technology minister, and health minister Anbumani Ramadoss are learnt to have raised objections to the proposed amendments at the last GoM meeting. 
    
	If the changes are made, clients will be put behind bars for up to three months for a first offence and may also be fined Rs 20,000. The jail term will increase to six months and the fine to Rs 50,000 for subsequent instances. 
    
	Both Sibal and Ramadoss have argued that punishing clients would only drive prostitution underground, making it harder for the government to reach its largest target group for HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment.
    
	Sibal is also learnt to have argued that the amendments would only hurt the poorer clients who go to brothels, leaving covertly run rackets that cater to the rich unpunished.
    
	The health ministry, with the help of the National AIDS Control Organisation, is preparing figures to shore up its argument that AIDS control measures will be hit by the amendments.
    
	The GoM also has social justice minister Meira Kumar, who is supporting Chowdhurys initiative. 
    
	Chowdhury has argued that punishing clients would reduce the demand for prostitution. The amendment is based on the principle that once the demand goes, the supply (of trafficked women) will take care of itself, a senior official in her ministry said.

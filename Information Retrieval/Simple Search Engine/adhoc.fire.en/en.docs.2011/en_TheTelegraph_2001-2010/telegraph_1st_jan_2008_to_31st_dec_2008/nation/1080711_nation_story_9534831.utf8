          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Manmohan with a Kabul blast victim at AIIMS in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 10: As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh unveils a more assertive self in the last lap of his term, his office is betraying signs that he is eager to push and claim credit for recent key pro-people initiatives.        
	The latest example is the claim by government sources that it was Manmohan who forced railway minister Lalu Prasad to roll back the freight hike he had announced.         
	The railways, through a circular, had hiked the freight for essential commodities like foodgrain, pulses, ores, minerals, petro products, coke, coal and fertilisers by 5 to 7 per cent by levying a special supplementary charge.        
	The hike came into effect from July 1, but Lalu Prasad was forced to withdraw it after the Prime Minister personally intervened and said it would contribute to the inflation, the sources added.        
	The finance ministry had time and again taken up with the railway minister the issue of similar backdoor freight hikes but to no avail.        
	This time, Manmohan decided to take matters in his own hands.        
	The market was already volatile and elections were not far away, and he didnt want Lalu Prasad to add to the problems.        
	On July 3, the railways issued a circular withdrawing the hike.        
	Senior bureaucrats interpret this as Manmohans way of responding to criticism from within and outside his party that his has been a weak and faceless prime ministership.        
	Also, as one senior bureaucrat put it, the Prime Minister was not so caught up with the nuclear deal as to have forgotten the other flagship schemes of the UPA government.         
	Sources said Singh had dispatched all senior Planning Commission officials to their assigned states to see and report how the rural job guarantee and Bharat Nirman schemes were progressing.        
	Singh may have been busy with the nuclear deal but he also had other things of governance and administration on his mind, said a senior government official.         
	The Prime Minister had also got cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar  the senior-most bureaucrat in the country  to visit Naxalite-hit states and see for himself how the administration of the states could be improved.         
	Manmohan had repeatedly said Left-wing extremism was the biggest threat to the country. Making it clear that he was serious about tackling the issue, he set up a task force under the cabinet secretary to handle the problem by promoting development in rebel-infested areas.         
	Chandrasekhar was also asked to report on the status of the UPA government schemes, including the job scheme, the urban renewal mission and Bharat Nirman.        
	Another scheme in which Manmohan had taken personal interest was the nutrition and mid-day meal schemes.        
	According to the sources, the Prime Minister felt that the nutrition programme, managed by women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury, had failed to deliver.        
	Despite the special allocation of Rs 5,000 crore for the Supplementary Nutrition Scheme, 40 million children under the age of three were malnourished.        
	He feels very strongly about the scheme and wants to head a commission to oversee the Supplementary Nutrition Scheme, an official said.        
	The Prime Minister was apparently irritated at the mindless controversy over whether to serve hot cooked meals or packaged food.

  Full house at caf in strike zone				       CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                        A tilted notice board next to a hole made by a bullet on a Leopold wall. (PTI)				                                       
	Mumbai, Nov. 30: Don Ilanthiraiyan doesnt want to recall the gunshots he heard on Wednesday night  the memories trigger a chain of fear he says he would rather not confront at the moment.         
	I am scared... very scared. It could just as easily have been us, and not Leopold, as the target, said the manager of Caf Mondegar, located barely 20 metres down the road from Leopold Caf, one of the first targets of the terrorists who struck Mumbai.         
	The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is less than a kilometre away.         
	Like Leopold, Mondegar is a popular pub frequented by foreign tourists.        
	But just three days after the firing at Leopold, Mondegar was today full to capacity, and Ilanthiraiyan had to ask guests to wait till seating could be arranged.         
	Couples snuggled next to each other, professionals surfed the Net on laptops and friends shared a jug of chilled beer in the November afternoon.         
	Ilanthiraiyan had kept the caf closed the past two days, as a mark of respect.                   A crowded Caf eacute; Mondegar after it reopened on Sunday. Picture by Charu Sudan Kasturi      
	It took two days, more than ever before after a terror attack, but Mumbai is getting back on its feet, said Raj Thevar, a college student sitting in the pub.        
	His words carried conviction, but not enough, he admitted, for him to inform his mother of his decision to visit a pub next to one of the spots that witnessed terror first-hand.         
	Ilanthiraiyan plans to prevent any customers with heavy rucksacks or big bags from entering Caf Mondegar, but said he cannot introduce a metal detector or bring in gun-toting securitymen.         
	People come here to enjoy, and I cannot afford to scare them away. See, just six hours after the attack, people are back here, he said.        
	Taxi driver Shankar Hegde said he could not help looking under the seats each time a passenger left his vehicle. Fear of explosions similar to those in two taxis on November 26 gnaws at him.         
	I was working even through the gun battles between the terrorists and security forces. For the past two days, there have hardly been any customers, Hegde said. But today, Mumbai has begun to crawl back to her feet.        
	At the Taj, holiday crowds gather to sneak a peek at the iconic hotel that was under siege a day back.        
	I brought my family to see the Gateway of India. You wont let us go there. At least let my children see the Taj clearly, a man, with two children in tow, argued with security officials blocking any one from stepping into 200 metres from the Taj.         
	Till yesterday, most of the terror tourists comprised local residents, especially those who live nearby in Colaba.         
	And Mumbais lifeline  the suburban train system  was pulsating again.         
	Even though today is a Sunday, we have had more people buying tickets than in the past two days combined, said R. Seetha, a ticket attendant at the Churchgate railway station.  
	CHILLING FACTS EMERGE FROM THE ASHES            
	The brutality      On Wednesday night, a married couple  in their 70s went to third-floor window after  hearing gunfire. Shot by attackers						   At Nariman House on Wednesday, passers-by  who mistook initial shots for firecrackers in  celebration of India rsquo;s imminent cricket victory  over England greeted by spray of bullets from  two attackers. 22-year-old call centre worker  killed   Tailor locking store near Taj on Wednesday  night spotted by gunman and killed   At Taj, gunmen searching room-to-room pick  and choose occupants to shoot at point-blank  range. Some shot in the back, Gestapo style   At Oberoi, one gunman chased diners up  stairwell and at one point turned around and  shot dead an elderly man standing behind him   At Oberoi on Wednesday,Yes Bank chairman  Ashok Kapur and wife pursued by gunman up  a staircase. She managed to escape; but he  was shot, once in the chest, once on the hand               
	The myths				     What was believed: Gunmen held  hostages right through 
  What rsquo;s emerging: Gunmen killed  victims early on and left the bodies,  to fool security forces into thinking  they still had hostages  What was believed: Westerners  were main targets
  What rsquo;s emerging: They killed  whomever they could. Of the 172  dead, 21 are confirmed foreigners   What was believed: Attackers  singled out only holders of American  and British passports 
  What rsquo;s emerging: Not only US and  British citizens, range of nationalities  among foreigners killed. 6 Americans  confirmed dead and 1 Briton   What was believed: Gunmen  meant to blow up Taj 
  What rsquo;s emerging: NSG chief says  they didn't have enough explosives  for that               
	The home truths				     Commandos slowed by  old, bulky bulletproof jackets  and had no technology to  determine where firepower  was coming from   Sharpshooters had neither  protective gear, nor  high-powered telescopes  western agencies use  during standoff with terrorists   Gunmen firing from so many  different parts of hotel that  security forces did not know  where to strike without  inflicting civilian casualties   On Saturday afternoon, a  sharpshooter who spent  over 60 hours perched  outside Taj said neither he  nor his partner had fired a  shot because they were not  sure how to distinguish gunmen  from trapped civilians

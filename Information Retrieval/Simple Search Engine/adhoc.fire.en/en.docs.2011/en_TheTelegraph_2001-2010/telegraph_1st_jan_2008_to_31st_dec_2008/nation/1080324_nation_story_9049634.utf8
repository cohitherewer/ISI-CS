          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai/Panaji, March 23: Fiona Mackeown is likely to move Bombay High Court next week demanding security for herself and a CBI investigation into the drug mafias involvement in the rape and murder of her 15-year-old daughter, Scarlett Keeling.         
	Yes, she is considering moving the Panaji bench with a writ petition. She fears a threat to her life from the drug mafia, but has lost faith in Goa police and the state after they repeatedly tried to portray Scarletts murder as a simple case of drowning, Mackeowns lawyer Vikram Verma said.        
	Yesterday, the forensic department of Goa Medical College had submitted a fresh report to the police saying Scarlett did not die of drug overdose, but possibly after her assailant held her head in water to suffocate her. However, the police have dismissed the report on the ground that it may not be medically valid.         
	The British teenager was found dead on Anjuna beach on February 18.        
	Prepared by Dr Silvano Sapeco, the report said Scarletts killer had probably submerged her head in the sea for five to 10 minutes. The level of ethyl alcohol detected in her body was not enough to cause coma and death, it added.         
	Sapeco had conducted the first autopsy as well, which certified that Scarlett had drowned. The doctor has now claimed that he had indicated the possibility of the drowning being homicidal, but the investigating officers interpreted the report their way.         
	Goa police had initially registered a drowning case but changed it to murder after a second autopsy cited 22 injury marks on the teenagers body.        
	They said Scarlett had been plied with drugs like LSD, cocaine, and ecstasy in Luis Caf hours before her death. The cafs bartender, Samson Dsouza, and drug peddler Placido Carvalho were arrested on the charges of drugging a minor, and raping and murdering her.        
	But Scarletts mother alleged that the police were protecting the drug mafia and politicians.        
	Mackeown had accused Goa home minister Ravi Naik and director-general of police B.S. Brar of being part of a nexus with the drug mafia after both repeatedly claimed that Scarlett had drowned.        
	The viscera report sent by the Mumbai forensic laboratory last week confirmed that Scarlett had been heavily drugged.

  - Singh cites Constitution to bypass calls for Orissa central rule and outfit ban        OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: The Prime Minister today appeared to reject calls for a ban on the Bajrang Dal and dismissal of the Orissa government by citing the framework of the Constitution.        
	Todays National Integration Council witnessed both demands, arising out of the continuing anti-Christian violence that even the Pope denounced yesterday.        
	A democracy has a special onus in that it has to ensure protection of civil liberties even as it seeks to enforce law and order, Manmohan Singh told the council. It has also to be done in a manner that respects the constitutional bounds of a federal polity.        
	Terrorism and communalism dominated the talks, although the word terrorism was replaced with the omnibus extremism on the agenda, apparently to equate the militant Islamic outfits with the Bajrang Dal.         
	Singh, however, referred specifically to terrorism and terror acts. But while he said there can be no compromise in dealing with the danger, he added that counter-terrorism must reject wrong methods.        
	Any impression that any community, or sections amongst them, are being targeted, or that some kind of profiling is being attempted should be avoided. The means are as important as the ends. Otherwise, it could lead to a major polarisation, he said.        
	Singh did not place the remarks in a clear context, but Congress ears may be happy reading in them an assurance to Muslims of Delhis Jamianagar and Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh, alleging police harassment since the recent blasts.        
	As for the outfits targeting Christians, Singh said that while they deserved very deterrent punishment, the government would be bound by the framework of our Constitution and the political democratic process that enables us to reconcile differences through dialogue.        
	Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik left the meeting cock-a-hoop, parrying questions on why the violence was continuing. Visit my state and you will know how complex the truth is. Ta ta, he said.        
	The meeting turned into an anodyne talking shop with the NDA, its opponents admitted, standing its ground. Narendra Modi spelt out his strategy against terror by educated youth: National consensus is required to isolate such people... and the so-called intellectuals supporting these elements in the name of human rights. Deterrent punishment is necessary.   
	HARD LABOUR  
	What the NIC meet achieved   
	 A sub-committee to review communal and ethnic conflicts and advise the government on action   
	 Cabinet to consider resolutions of the sub-committee   
	The unlawful activities (prevention) act may be amended  
	 No commitment on banning the Bajrang Dal

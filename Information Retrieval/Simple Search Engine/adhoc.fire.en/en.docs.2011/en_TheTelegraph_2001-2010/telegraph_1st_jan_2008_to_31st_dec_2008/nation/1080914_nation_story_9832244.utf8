          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 13: Bangaru must have heard the farmers wife say chicken curry. It egged her on.        
	When she finally stopped, she had laid 115, in almost as many days.        
	Time to change the adage golden goose?        
	Cluck, cluck, Bangaru would say, but what a close shave!         
	A couple of days more and she would have been on a dining table.        
	Farmer Shankar Gowd had almost made up his mind to kill the limping hen he had bought cheap sometime in late April when Bangaru decided to cock a snook at fate.        
	Around mid-May, about 15-20 days after her owner had bought her for Rs 150  nearly half the price of a healthy hen  Bangaru started laying eggs. She lay over 30  one every day  without a break.        
	We thought it belonged to a quality egg-laying strain and bred chicks, almost 30 of them, says Shankars wife Padma.        
	After a break, Bangaru started again. She finally stopped on September 7  after 115. Normally, a hen lays about 50 eggs over two months and then stops for some time.        
	As news of Bangarus record spree spread, the bird became famous not only in Pagidyala, Shankars village in Kurnool district, about 255km from Hyderabad, but in the entire block. Every day, we had hundreds of visitors who came to our home to see the wonder hen and offer grains, Shankar says.        
	Her feat also got her the name Bangaru  or gold.        
	Although Bangaru has stopped laying eggs, the rich farmer has built a special nest for the hen.        
	But wasnt he planning to kill it?        
	Thank God, I didnt, Shankar smiles. But who knew it would start laying eggs like that.        
	An egg in the local market fetches around Rs 2. As Bangaru is a country hen, each egg she lays should fetch between Rs 2.50 and Rs 3.        
	Shankar, who has some 20 hens in his small backyard poultry, has been spending over Rs 1,000 a month on food for his birds.        
	But despite their efforts, the hen is yet to start laying eggs again.         
	Time to think of chicken curry?         
	Cluck, cluck how about egg roll?

	Chennai, Jan. 21: Indias space agency today launched an advanced Israeli reconnaissance satellite capable of taking images through cloud cover or at night, but without the tom-toming that usually heralds such events.
    
	Our hands were tied. Our customer (Israel) wanted no publicity until the launch was over, Indian Space Research Organisation chairman G. Madhavan Nair told a crowded news conference this evening.
    
	The 300kg Tecsar satellite, also known as Polaris, is Isros second foreign commercial launch after the Italian Agile was put into orbit last April, the agency said in a statement.
    
	Today is really a red-letter day for Antrix Corporation (the space departments commercial arm), beamed Nair, relieved that a contract for a tough customer had been perfectly executed.
    
	He said the satellite, developed by Israeli Aerospace Industries, had been placed at an orbital inclination of 41 degrees after a very difficult mission manoeuvre and the orbit we achieved will be any launchers envy.
    
	The Isro chairman waved away suggestions that Tecsar was a spy satellite that Israel had wanted launched hush-hush to enable it to keep tabs on its enemy, Iran.
    
	I do not subscribe to the view that there is a spy-class satellite, he said, insisting a satellite was only a tool that could be used for various purposes. 
    
	There have, however, been global whispers that Israel intends to use the satellite to monitor Irans alleged nuclear weapons programme. Some defence experts said as much today after the launch.
    
	This launch significantly improves Israels intelligence coverage, Reuters quoted Alon Ben-David, Israel analyst for Janes Defence Weekly, as saying.
    
	Israel already has three satellites, but this one can see in all weather as well as at night. True, its relatively small and experimental but at a time when Israel feels it is facing Iran alone, the ability to bolster the independent satellite network is seen as important.
    
	Speaking in Le Royal Meridiens Washington suite, Nair said Israel had not shared details about the satellite with Isro in line with international practice. Nor would there be any information sharing in the future, he said.
    
	Once the satellite is placed in the required orbit, our contract is over. I have seen the satellite only from the outside, he said.
    
	Broadly, Tecsar had an advanced imaging system with synthetic aperture radar technology that could see through clouds and carry out night and all-weather imaging, he said.
    
	Nair said India had bagged the contract amid tough global competition, particularly from Russia. He shot down suggestions that the launch, initially scheduled for last September, had been held up under pressure from the US and West Asian countries.
    
	We needed to sort out some technical issues with the customer. After that, there was a prolonged monsoon period, even till January first week in this part of the country. So, the next earliest opportunity was chosen, he said.
    
	Tecsar was placed in orbit by PSLV C-10, 20 minutes after it blasted off at 9.15am from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. This was PSLVs eleventh straight launch.
    
	The success of the commercial launch has come as a shot in the arm for Antrix. We got a much better rate for this launch, charging more than the international going rate of about $20,000 per kg of satellite launched, MD K.R. Sridhara Murthy said.
    
	He said he expected revenue to touch Rs 750 crore by March 2008 against Rs 660 crore in the corresponding period last year.

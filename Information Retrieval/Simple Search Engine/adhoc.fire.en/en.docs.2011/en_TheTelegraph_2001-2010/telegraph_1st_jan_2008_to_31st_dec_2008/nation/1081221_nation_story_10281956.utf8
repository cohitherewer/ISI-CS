The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Reopen order to diamond hub
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Reopen order to diamond hub
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, Dec. 20: The Gujarat government has ordered all diamond units that had shut shop in the wake of the global meltdown to reopen after suicides among laid-off workers and their families sparked fears of an explosive situation.        
	Units that do not comply with the labour departments order by Monday would face stern legal action, the administration warned today.        
	A monitoring panel with representatives of the government, industry and workers has been set up to ensure that all retrenched staff are taken back, even if as part-time workers.        
	Sources said the government swung into action after five suicides in the past five days in Surat, where more than 50 per cent cutting and polishing units that closed for Diwali have not reopened.        
	The move came as former home minister Gordhan Zadaphia, who broke away from the ruling BJP to form his own party, said the industry was facing its worst crisis and predicted an explosive situation if the government did not announce a stimulus package for the industry.        
	C.P. Vanani, president of the diamond association in Surat, where around 92 per cent of the worlds rough diamonds are cut and polished, said workers were the worst affected. We are concerned about them. Of the 10 lakh diamond workers in the state, seven lakh are jobless. It is a serious situation, he said.        
	This is why we have asked the unit owners to reopen even if they do not have full-time jobs to offer, which is understandable in the current global market scenario.        
	The US credit crisis has led to a 70 per cent fall in Surats exports that touched around Rs 50,000 crore till Christmas last year.        
	Sales this year from the diamond hub have barely crossed Rs 15,000 as the US and European markets cancelled orders, forcing Surats diamond units to declare a forced holiday.        
	Yesterday, two jobless diamond polishers killed themselves. While Chhotu Patel, 40, set himself on fire, 42-year-old Ravji Parmar hanged himself.        
	On Wednesday, Sonal Bhartiya, 24, whose husband had not been getting his salary for the past two months, committed suicide after strangling her four-year-old daughter.         
	Hansa Mandavi ended her life on Tuesday. The 54-year-olds husband and son, both workers in a diamond firm, had lost their job.        
	Surat police chief R.M.S. Brar blamed the suicides on depression stalking the diamond industry.        
	A meeting called by state labour commissioner Vatsala Vasudevan took the decision to reopen the units. Apart from Vanani, others present at the meeting included Chandrakant Sanghavi, regional chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, Babubhai Jariwala, president,         
	Diamond Workers Association, and M.V. Jadeja, the deputy labour commissioner.        
	All those who attended todays meeting are members of the monitoring committee. Jariwala said the panel would ensure that when the units reopen, no worker is retrenched.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 5: The government is planning to set up an independent regulatory body for distance education, including online lectures, that might pave the way for top institutes to offer coveted courses beyond the classroom.         
	The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) dont offer their most sought-after courses online or through video-conferencing for fear of dilution in student quality.         
	Replying to a question in Parliament yesterday, human resource development minister Arjun Singh said a proposal to set up an independent regulator for distance education was at an advanced stage of consideration.         
	The regulatory body would also keep tabs on the quality of unverified courses offered by universities and colleges across India, sources in the ministry said.         
	The regulator will work as the University Grants Commission of distance education, a senior official said. The UGC regulates all universities in India.         
	The IITs and IIMs have been demanding that the government frame a mechanism that would ensure minimum standards are maintained through online testing, similar to the manner in which the GRE and GMAT are conducted.         
	Although they do offer several long-distance courses, mostly for working professionals, the IITs give their famed undergraduate engineering degrees only to the select few who clear a rigorous entrance exam.         
	The IIMs offer mid-career courses for executives via distance learning, but limit their sought-after Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) courses to those who clear the tough Common Admission Test.         
	Faculty in charge of distance education programmes at the IITs and the IIMs have, several times in the past, said the institutes have the potential to offer top courses beyond the classroom.         
	The only concern has always been the quality at the receiving end. If the government has decided to set up a regulator, it is great news, said a senior faculty member working with the distance education programme at IIM Calcutta.         
	When the government recently suggested that the IITs and IIMs raise their student intake three-fold, the institutes had responded by asking the Centre to focus on distance education. Their infrastructure, they said, was too stretched to physically accommodate more students. But they were open to reaching out to more students through the Internet or video-conferencing.

	Bhopal, July 1: Railway minister Lalu Prasad recently predicted that L.K. Advani will not be Prime Minister  Advaniji ke naseeb mein PM banna nahin likha hai  but he could, if he likes, grant the BJP leader a minor wish.        
	In Bhopal yesterday, Advani was treated to dinner at Shan-e-Bhopal, a rail coach restaurant. The BJPs shadow Prime Minister, his wife Kamla and daughter Pratibha relished the kurkuri bhindi, Sindhi karhi, kamal karki ki sabzi, raita and ras malai on the table.        
	Advani also enjoyed the ambience. A condemned 2nd class broad gauge rail coach, procured from West Central Railways, has been converted into the restaurant. A platform, with benches, a clock, lanterns, paan-cum-book shop and a steam engine model have also been created.        
	The restaurant has 80 covers  32 in the coach and the rest on the platform. A railway signal has been installed to indicate whether it is open or closed. The logo of the Great India Peninsular Railway proudly adorns the coach and its various accessories.        
	Advani complimented the Madhya Pradesh tourism corporation for the innovative concept  Shan-e-Bhopal is part of the state-run Hotel Lake View Ashoka and was inaugurated when Yashodhara Raje was tourism minister.        
	The BJP leader then said that if the restaurant were to vibrate, it would make the train experience complete.        
	Ashwani Lohani, the tourism corporation managing director who is a railway engineer, today said: We are going to explore all possibilities to see if it is technically possible. If so, we will have such an arrangement.        
	State tourism minister Tukajirao Puar echoed him. My department will ascertain if it is feasible or not, he told The Telegraph.        
	It will be up to Lalu Prasads ministry to offer the knowhow.         
	Advani, who was in Bhopal to launch the Hindi edition of his autobiography My Country, My Life, had been taken to the restaurant by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. Before the dinner, the family went on a 40-minute Lake Princess cruise around the Bada Talab.

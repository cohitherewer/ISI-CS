  - Raj follows law, fire rages in Bihar        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raj at his residence on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Oct. 23: Raj Thackeray, who faces a gag order and more than 50 cases across the state for provoking violence, started his day with a visit to a police station to mark his attendance.        
	He was at Kherwadi police station at 10.30am. The Bandra court, which granted him bail on Tuesday, released Raj on the condition that he would report to the police station every day for a week between 7am and 12 noon, would not issue threats to witnesses, and would not make provocative statements that could trigger violence.        
	The next stop was Kalyan railway police station. Again, the purpose was to mark attendance. In this case, the bail condition was that he would report to the police till the inquiry was complete.         
	Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers had attacked north Indian candidates appearing for a railway recruitment exam on Sunday.         
	He spent 38 hours in custody after his midnight arrest from Konkan and might still have been behind bars had he not secured anticipatory bail from the Kalyan sessions court. This prevented the Government Railway Police from taking him into custody over offences lodged with Kalyan and Thane railway police stations.         
	Raj skipped a date with a Vikroli court, which had sent a notice asking him to show cause why bail granted in February, on condition that he would not make any provocative statements, should not be cancelled.         
	His lawyer Sameer Nagare asked for time to file a reply, saying Raj was freed only last evening and could not attend court today. The hearing was adjourned to November 7.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Left in lurch		    
	Bhubaneswar, July 14: The members of Orissa Association of the Blind learnt a tough lesson recently when their IT expert from Australia abandoned courses half way and left, unable to cope with the country or its lack of infrastructure.         
	The experience taught us a few lessons. We understand now that unless we can afford expertise, we should not hire or aim for it, said Sanyas Behera, the general secretary of the Orissa Association of Blind, who had co-ordinated the programme.         
	Problems began when Australian citizen Merlin Castor (61) reached the state offering her services and began demanding basic infrastructure. The association found that they could barely afford what Merlin saw as basic.         
	Merlin reached Bhubaneswar on April 25 deputed by the association through Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), an international development organisation.         
	She was supposed to share her expertise with the visually impaired students at the centre and teach there for a year. We had held several talks with the VSO explaining our facilities. Their team had visited us twice. If they had a problem we should have been told, said Behera.         
	Merlins first demand was safe food and water. The institute shelled out precious cash to get food from star hotels. The woman also wanted a spacious apartment. We showed her our best places but she did not like any. Merlin also wanted 10 computers in her room and we had three, said the general secretary.         
	Besides, the teacher hoped to receive some of the latest software installed that came at staggering prices.        
	The association had expected their foreign volunteer to train at least 100 special teachers, who would, in turn teach.        
	We failed to provide her the kind of infrastructure she was looking for, said Premabandhu Nayak, an employee.         
	Merlin finally left on June 20. Though we were short of funds to meet her requirements, we had agreed for an honorarium of Rs 8,000 and Rs 5,000 for accommodation, said the general secretary of the association, Behera.

	London, Nov. 22: A womans call to 999 led to the rescue of her Indian-origin husband and his Belgian friend, stuck on a life raft in the Mediterranean Sea for four days.        
	Jayesh Patel, 43, an experienced yachtsman with a commercial captains licence, and his friend spent four days adrift on the inflatable raft after his motorboat capsized in the rough seas off Spain.         
	The duo had left the holiday island of Majorca for the port of Tarragona on the Spanish mainland on November 12. But within hours of setting off, Patels 44ft motorboat, Umbalika, capsized and sank before the sailors could make a mayday call.        
	The two were rescued after Patels wife Louise raised the alarm from their home in Barnet, north London, because she had not heard from him in 24 hours although he was to have gone on a 22-hour trip.        
	She dialled the toll-free 999 and was put through to the Thames Coastguard, where staff alerted the International Coastguard Liaison Station at Falmouth, Cornwall, and a message was relayed to Spanish coastguards.        
	No one was aware of the problem until the sailors wife dialled 999, said a spokesperson from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).        
	The two men were experienced sailors and the woman provided a lot of information about them, their boat and their plans.        
	An air and sea search was launched and the two were eventually picked up after spending four days and three nights in the life raft. A rescue ship found them floating four-and-a-half miles from the island of Sa Dragonera, off the west coast of Majorca last Saturday.        
	They survived on emergency rations of biscuits and water.         
	Patel recalled the ordeal before heading home to his two children. It was a terrifying experience. We were hit by a giant wave and sank in two minutes. We didnt even have time to put in a rescue call over the radio.        
	His wife Louise is happy the nightmare is over. It was a huge relief to have him back. The children and me had decided that we would give him the biggest hug and kiss ever on his coming, she said.                    
	The MCA spokesperson praised Louise for her presence of mind. One of the lessons is that if you have any concerns about anyone anywhere at sea, then tell the authorities and something can be done no matter where you are, the spokesperson said, adding that the sailors been given the all-clear by doctors after their return.        
	Miguel Chicon, director of the Maritime Rescue Centre in Palma, Majorca, told Spanish reporters: Its a miracle they have been found. I called the captains wife with the news he was OK. She was overcome  she could not speak.

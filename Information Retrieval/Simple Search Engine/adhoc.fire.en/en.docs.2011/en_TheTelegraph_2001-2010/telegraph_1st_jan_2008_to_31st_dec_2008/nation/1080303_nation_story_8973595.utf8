	New Delhi, March 2: Smaller farmers owning two hectares or less can expect to have their entire loans written off by the June 2008 deadline, but the rest may struggle to get even their partial waiver, bankers say.        
	Indebted farmers owning more than two hectares are already unhappy at being denied a full waiver by P. Chidambarams budget. But they face a double blow: they get the promised 25 per cent write-off only if they are ready to pay the remaining 75 per cent by themselves.        
	We dont expect to make much headway in this. A similar scheme already exists but most farmers are unable to take advantage of this since they dont have the money to pay up, the director of a Delhi-based, state-run bank said.        
	Many cotton farmers owning more than two hectares in suicide belt Vidarbha have told The Telegraph they dont have the money to repay any fraction of their loans.        
	The bankers, however, say that meeting the June deadline for the three crore small and marginal farmers, granted full waiver, will not be a problem because the banks have full records of these transactions.        
	All that is required are letters to these farmers telling them their loans are forgiven, a banker said.        
	The Rs 60,000-crore waiver scheme applies only to overdue loans, where payment is due but the borrower is unable to pay. After some time, an overdue loan becomes a non-performing asset (NPA).        
	After being relieved of their debt burden, the farmers will be eligible to get fresh loans.        
	With the banks to be reimbursed over a three-year period, the plan does not hurt them. Officials said the government was likely to come up with a combination of bonds and other market instruments to pay the banks part of the money that would be written off.        
	But bankers fear that the waivers would send out the wrong signal to the borrowers.        
	Many of the borrowers will now be under the impression that they can afford to default even on fresh loans, said U.S. Bhargava, former executive director, Punjab National Bank. He added that the waiver scheme went against the nature of financial discipline.        
	The bankers, however, also feel that the complete waiver granted to the smaller farmers will give the banks a chance to clean up their books.        
	Commercial banks have non-performing agricultural loans of more than Rs 7,500 crore. Cooperative banks and regional rural banks, major dispensers of farm loans, have larger NPAs relating to agriculture, and industry estimates put overall NPAs in the sector at Rs 31,000 crore.        
	The total value of agricultural loans could be around Rs 362,000 crore, including the loans taken from cooperative banks and regional rural banks.

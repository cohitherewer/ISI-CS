          OUR BUREAU                          Bush                                  
	May 6: Former foreign secretary Shyam Saran today came to George Bushs rescue over his apparent faulting of India for the global food crisis, on a day Washington linked India also to the surging oil prices.        
	Saran, the Prime Ministers special envoy on the nuclear deal, said the US Presidents comments had a positive side, too. They were a recognition of the distance India has travelled as a result of its successful economic development, he said in Delhi.        
	Last week, Bush had argued that rising prosperity had led Indias large middle class to demand better nutrition, pushing global food prices up. Indian parties, who read in the comment a suggestion that Indians shouldnt eat well, pilloried Bush and even defence minister A.K. Antony called his remark a cruel joke.        
	The US today sought to calm tempers saying the higher living standards of Indians was a good thing.         
	But asked about the oil price rise, White House deputy spokesman Scott Stanzel added in the same breath: Many developing nations like India or China are having greatly increased demand, which obviously is having an impact on price.        
	Saran said the food and energy crises had a global dimension and could not be resolved by blaming each other.

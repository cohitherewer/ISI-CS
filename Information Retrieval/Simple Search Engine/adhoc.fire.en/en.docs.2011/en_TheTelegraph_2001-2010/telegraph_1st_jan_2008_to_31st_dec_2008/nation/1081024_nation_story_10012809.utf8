          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The Centre today said that although India and China had agreed to exchange maps delineating their boundaries, the progress was not very bright because of different perceptions on transgressions.        
	China claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh, to which we are not agreeing. Nobody agrees, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha in reply to questions on Chinese incursions across the Line of Actual Control.        
	Mukherjees comments came on a day Prime Minister Manmohan Sigh reached Beijing to attend the seventh Asia-Europe Meeting. This is Singhs second trip to China in 10 months.        
	There is a disputed area of 38,000sqkm that we say China has illegally occupied, Mukherjee said. In addition, there are 5,000sqkm that Pakistan has ceded to China from the part of Kashmir it controls.         
	Delhi and Beijing had decided in 2003 to appoint special representatives to resolve the border dispute. This is going on; this is taking time, the minister said. There are different perceptions about the entire area (border): the middle sector, eastern sector, western sector.        
	In 2000, Mukherjees predecessor, Jaswant Singh, had suggested the exchange of maps delineating our perceptions in the map itself.        
	Mukherjee said some progress had been reported in the middle sector, with maps exchanged and areas of dispute identified. The special representatives had met 12 times in the past five years, he said. Their last meeting was in September.

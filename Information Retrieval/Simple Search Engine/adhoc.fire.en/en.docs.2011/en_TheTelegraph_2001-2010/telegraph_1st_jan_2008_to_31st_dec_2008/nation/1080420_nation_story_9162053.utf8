                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mayavati fires pullout threat
          OUR BUREAU                                    Mayavati, Rahul                                  
	Lucknow/ New Delhi, April 19: Mayavati has threatened to withdraw support to the Congress-led government at the Centre if it does not sanction a Rs 80,000-crore relief package for the state in four months.        
	The threat comes a day after Rahul Gandhi sat on dharna with drought-hit farmers in Jhansi. The MPs first street protest wrapped up his three-day visit to Bundelkhand.        
	I will give my letter of withdrawal of support to the UPA chairperson (Sonia Gandhi) if the central government does not sanction a Rs 80,000-crore relief package for Bundelkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh in four months and this time I mean it, the BSP chief said here.         
	Her party, which has 17 MPs in the Lok Sabha, supports the Manmohan Singh government from outside.         
	Mayavati did not hide her feelings about Rahul, whose visits to Dalit homes appear to have rattled her. I want Rahul Gandhi to stop his theatrics. He is misleading the people of Bundelkhand. If he is so concerned about the plight of farmers, he should first mount pressure on the central government to bring down (food) prices.         
	Loss of support of 17 MPs is not an immediate cause of worry for the government. However, Mayavati joining hands with other allies like the Left on price rise will only add to the coalitions headache.         
	The UPA government can fall any time because of price rise, she said. This is my last warning.        
	The Congress was cool. Chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said: Theres no point getting excited. She (Mayavati) is an important leader of the largest state and we have always taken her seriously. She is a responsible leader and we respect her.        
	Moily said the Congress will assess what prompted her outburst. Rahul Gandhi may be her future challenge. In Uttar Pradesh, he has most effectively taken up peoples issues. Mayavati knows this better than anyone else. The fact that she transferred the district magistrate (of Jhansi, a day after Rahuls visit) shows how effective he was.        
	But another explanation for the mild reaction was coalition politics.         
	Why should we burn our bridges with her? Its not as though we have decided she is a bigger enemy than Mulayam Singh Yadav. Who knows what scenario the next elections will throw up? Mayavati could be a key player, a Congress leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul not keen on torch 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahul not keen on torch 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 9: Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to participate in the Olympic torch relay in the capital on April 17.        
	He had been invited to join P.T. Usha, Sachin Tendulkar, Sania Mirza and other sportspersons on the 3km run by fellow Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi, who heads the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).        
	Congress sources cited security considerations and the utter irrelevance of dragging politicians into an unintended tamasha as the reasons why Rahul would probably turn down the invite.         
	They said he was too preoccupied with revamping the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India, of which he is charge, and planning the next leg of his visit to Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.        
	Rahul has not yet seen the invite, the sources added.        
	Jitin Prasada, Sachin Pilot, Priya Dutt and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Congresss other young MPs requested to carry the torch, have not taken a decision yet and are reportedly waiting for Rahul to take a call.        
	I have been too busy getting a hang of my ministry to think of anything else, said Prasada, who just took over as junior steel minister.         
	Its up in the air, said another MP.        
	The Congress sources said the party was annoyed with Kalmadi for involving the MPs in a show fraught with political and diplomatic implications and then going public with it.        
	With the security rings around Rahul, his mobility gets affected in normal times. Considering the volatile politics surrounding the torch relay, how did Kalmadi assume Rahul would take part like any other person? asked a source.        
	The source also wondered that while the world over, only sports personalities participated in the torch relay, how did Kalmadi get the bright idea of bringing in lawmakers?        
	Kalmadi, who spoke to The Telegraph from Beijing, said he did not want to restrict the relay to only sportspersons.

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: Calcutta High Court has given the green signal for re-development of the Bonhooghly tenement scheme in north Calcutta.        
	In a ruling that could set a precedent for urban renewal projects, the court has dismissed a petition by 50 tenants demanding that the state provide them alternative accommodation till re-development work is over.        
	The proposal is to pull down the run-down buildings on the 17.2-acre Bonhooghly plot and construct new ones. Till such time as the project is complete  a two-year timeframe has been set  the state will pay each displaced tenant Rs 1,000 towards rent.        
	The project was to have begun last year and the tenants were served notices to vacate their flats. But only 125 of the 750 tenants moved out and 50 among the remainder filed the petition.        
	Quoting the maxim that public welfare was the highest law, the court dismissed the petition, saying it found nothing arbitrary, unreasonable or illegal about the governments proposal.        
	It also noted that the new flats would be more than double the size of the existing ill-maintained ones  645sqft super built area in place of 250sqft  and civic amenities would be provided free of cost.        
	The maxim the court cited  salus populi est suprema is based on an implied agreement by every member of society that individual welfare shall, in case of necessity, yield to that of the community.        
	How the government chooses to enforce the court verdict remains to be seen. It is anyones guess whether it will use force to evict the tenants.        
	Legal experts said the ruling could well become the model for similar cases. In case the displacement (of the tenant) is partial and the government takes care of the interim period to an extent (by paying Rs 1000), such projects cannot be stopped, an expert said.        
	The Bonhooghly flats, built between 1960 and 1970 for refugees, have become dangerous to live in as they are not properly maintained.        
	Only six acres of the 17.2-acre plot have been earmarked for the new flats. Each of them will have two bedrooms, a drawing-cum-dining room, two toilets, a kitchen and a verandah and will be priced between Rs 10-22 lakh.         
	The remainder of the land will have 25 buildings, 16 of which will be 16-storey towers.

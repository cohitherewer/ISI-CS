The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress bristles at opportunist politics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Congress bristles at opportunist politics
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kapil Sibal: Crying foul                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Congress today lashed out at L.K. Advani, whose party has turned the attack on Mumbai into an election ad campaign in Delhi.        
	The BJP put out newspaper ads with a slogan on a drop of blood calling the government unwilling and incapable. It ends with a call to vote for the party.        
	Tomorrow is polling day in Delhi.        
	Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, speaking for the Congress, accused Advani and his party of using a human tragedy for political opportunism.        
	Is it the time for blame game? Sibal asked.         
	We stood with the government when Akshardham was attacked, he reminded the BJP.        
	The BJP was in power at the Centre and in Gujarat when the Akshardham temple was attacked by militants.        
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi have made strange and unusual statements that lack not just maturity, but national commitment, Sibal said. Desire for position should not be above national interest.        
	Advani had yesterday criticised the Maharashtra government for failing to gather intelligence to foil the attacks. Modi said today the Prime Ministers address to the nation was disappointing.         
	Unfortunately, this human tragedy has been turned into a political opportunity to attack the government by the Opposition, Sibal said.        
	Admitting that the UPA government had not foreseen such a massive terrorist attack, Sibal repeated this was not the time for a blame game. We never imagined that this sort of infiltration will take place in such a meticulous fashion. There must be accountability at all levels, he said. Who did it? Whose conspiracy? Whether there is a big conspiracy behind it? What is the motive? It will be revealed only after the investigation.        
	The Congress leader added: Im not in a position to say who is behind it. We must deal with it. Security of the people must be the top agenda of all the political parties.        
	Congress leaders also questioned Modis announcement that his government would give Rs 1 crore for the family of slain ATS chief Hemant Karkare, who till the other day was under attack from the BJP, led by Advani, for the Malegaon blast probe.         
	Senior party leader M. Veerappa Moily said Modi had promised Rs 50,000 to two security personnel injured in the Akshardham attack of 2002 and Rs 10 lakh to a commando seriously injured, but had not given them the money even six years later, adds PTI.         
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari added that Modi, who said today he had warned the Centre against the use of the sea route by militants, would have a lot to answer for if reports of the boats used by the Mumbai attackers being hijacked from Porbandar are found true.        
	Tewari claimed that the Centre had earmarked funds for coastal policing but the Gujarat government did not provide the manpower.

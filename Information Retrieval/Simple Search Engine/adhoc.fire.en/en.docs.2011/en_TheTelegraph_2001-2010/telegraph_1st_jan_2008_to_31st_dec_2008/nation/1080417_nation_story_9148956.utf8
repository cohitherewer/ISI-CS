          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, April 16: Pakistani authorities and rights groups have stepped up efforts to secure the release of two boys who strayed across the border into Rajasthan last week.         
	Azhar Ansari, 16, and his cousin Zoaib, 10, crossed into India from interior Sindh on Saturday after an argument with their parents.         
	Former minister and rights activist Ansar Burney today contacted senior officials in the Indian home and external affairs ministries for early release of the two boys.         
	We are in touch with Indian authorities to secure the safe release of the two boys, Burney said here.         
	Burney had last month secured the release of Kashmir Singh, an Indian who had languished in Pakistani jails for 35 years after being convicted of spying for his country. Singh was arrested in 1973 from Rawalpindi and sentenced to death by a military court in Lahore. He is now reunited with his family.        
	Rajasthan police have confirmed that nothing incriminating was found against the two boys during interrogation by personnel of the Border Security Force, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), CID and the local police, Burney said.         
	Their only wrongdoing was that they crossed the border into India illegally by digging the ground under the barbed wire fence which divides India and Pakistan at the Munnabao border; and sneaked into Barmer (India), said Burney, who is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights Councils Advisory Committee in Geneva.         
	Indian authorities had assured him the boys, now in the custody of Barmer police, would be repatriated to Pakistan soon after completion of certain formalities.         
	Burney, who returned yesterday after a 15-day visit to India, claimed that he had succeeded in negotiating the release of over 150 Pakistani prisoners lodged in various Indian jails.         
	He said he had brought back with him details, including pictures of these prisoners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Guv remarks strengthen OSDs status
                                                                                                               Guv remarks strengthen OSDs status

	Gaya, Feb. 25: Months ago a Bihar university vice-chancellor (VC) had cribbed that the Raj Bhavan had reduced them to mere bara babus (head clerks) and bandhua mazdoors (bonded labourers).         
	The statement seems significant after Governor R.S. Gavais public reprimand of the VCs on the concluding day of Tarang, the Magadh Universitys cultural festival.         
	The chancellor-cum-governors advice to the VCs was to take cue from Magadh Universitys officer on special duty (OSD) Krishna Kumars result delivery technique.         
	Gavais assertion that the universities would get a facelift provided VCs showed even 50 per cent of the zeal shown by the OSD has led many to believe that Kumars role would get more dominant post-Tarang.         
	Tarang has proved once more that Krishna Kumar enjoys public support  a fact reiterated by the governor-cum-chancellors statements. And Gavais comments added strength to Kumars position.        
	Even the VCs dont have the courage to speak out against Kumar. That shows the latters command over the higher education system, says activist S.B. Bhaskar.        
	One may not see eye to eye regarding the importance of a programme like Tarang in Bihars education system, especially when basic infrastructure such as classrooms, laboratories and black boards are missing in institutions.         
	But the fact that a five-day-long cultural event passed off without any untoward incident speaks volumes about the managerial capacity of the man.        
	Krishna Kumar took command at a time when the administration and university officials were waging a war over arrangements made for President Pratibha Patils Gaya visit.        
	Kumar also put a lid on the simmering discontent that started with the selection of Baban Singh as the president of the organising committee. Baban has been a controversial figure in the university ever since his student leader days.         
	If the office-bearers of the organising committee accepted Baban as the president, it was because the OSD did not wish past controversies to be raked up in the last hour.         
	Finally, by making vice-chancellors participate in the road show on the concluding day, the OSD firmly demonstrated his grip over the system managers. Some of the VCs, including Magadh Universitys B.N. Pandey, joined dancing students and teachers on the Gaya roads.

	New Delhi, May 22: Sonia Gandhi has again scotched any speculation over the leadership of the UPA government with her unqualified praise for the Prime Minister.        
	The PMs nature is such that he would rather let his deeds speak for themselves than say things himself. It takes time to appreciate the quality of his leadership but time has proved that it is effective, the Congress president said at the governments fourth anniversary celebrations.        
	He has given a direction and character to the government, he has put the country on the path of social and economic progress. I congratulate him.        
	Arjun Singh, the HRD minister who has often insinuated that Manmohan Singh has not been the best of leaders, sat impassively on the dais.        
	This celebration is not a ritual, Sonia said in a Hindi speech. This is an occasion for us to renew our pledge to the country to give a strong and meaningful government.        
	Our allies have their own objectives and agenda. But we have come together because we know there are certain challenges before us and those must be answered together.        
	Stressing that the governments last year would be the most decisive, she said not only would it have to redeem the unfulfilled promises in the common minimum programme, its achievements would have to be propagated.        
	Sonia also hoped that the UPA would hold out as strong as ever in its last year in office.        
	The Prime Minister, in his address, said: The steep rise in global petroleum and foodgrain prices pose difficult challenges. We must tighten our belts, manage our resources and finances more prudently and work together to steer the ship of this great country through turbulent waters.

	Patna, July 15: At least 20 persons, including nine children and 10 women, died today after a jeep carrying them veered off a flooded road and fell into an overflowing drain in Agamkuwan area on the eastern outskirts of Bihar capital.         
	Those killed were on their way to Janibpur under Phulwari Sharief police station on Patnas western outskirts after attending a wedding. The deceased were related to the brides family, said Arvind Kumar, a relative of one of the victims.         
	Officer in charge of Alamganj police station K.K. Singh told The Telegraph: The road was inundated and the driver might have failed to notice the drain by its side. He might have lost the control over the vehicle and it plunged into the drain.         
	The driver, however, is missing. Tragedy struck at 2am.         
	The eye-witnesses of the incident were divided over who to blame for the accident. It is hard for a new driver to notice the drain adjacent to the road, said one. Another said the driver might have been drunk.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the deceaseds kin. The state government, besides ordering a though probe into the mishap, has taken up the responsibility of the final rites.         
	Patna district magistrate J. K. Sinha said additional district magistrate Upendra Kumar would conduct the probe, as ordered by the government. Sinha said the bodies had been sent to Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) for post-mortem.         
	Though the official death count stands at 20, victims relatives said 25 people were in the ill-fated jeep. Sources said a search was on to find more bodies.

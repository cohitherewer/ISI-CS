The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu retreats in Chhath war, into the ocean
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lalu retreats in Chhath war, into the ocean
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          Lalu Prasad at the first IPL semi-final on Friday. Picture by Gajanan Dudhalkar                                  
	Mumbai, May 31: It isnt often that Lalu Prasad shrinks from the ring, bellicose after his own fashion, smacking his loins at the prospect of a good fight. But then, it isnt often that his own hold him back.        
	The workmanlike bhaiyyas  Mumbais derogatory label on the thousands of cabbies and milkmen and liftmen and watchmen from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh that keep this metropolis going  have had a good and recent feel of Raj Thackerays stick-end; they want no more of it.        
	Their message to Lalu Prasad on the eve of his arrival here two days ago was laconic: sit Shah Rukhs test but leave us to face our own, dont litter Mumbai with a flaming statement that will leave us singed all over again. Lalu Prasad appears to have got it loud and clear.        
	So while New Delhi may have been a safe enough stage for the railway minister to bluster on about performing Chhath puja in Mumbai, in Mumbai itself that resolve lay diminished under the demands of his own constituency.        
	Lalu Prasad arrived here on the blazoned hype of a duel with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief; he returned tamely pronouncing Raj Thackeray not worth battling with.        
	Who is he, this Raj Thackeray? he asked, emerging from the Paanchvi Pass shoot in Filmcity the other day. The truth is his men had told him he is a big deal, in Mumbai and around anyhow. Dont mess with him. If he says no Chhath for you in Mumbai, theres going to be no Chhath for you in Mumbai.        
	No wonder he couldnt carry off that rhetorically dismissive tone on Thackeray for too long. In perhaps an unguarded admission of his real sense of the rebel Thackeray scions clout, Lalu Prasad said: Well, if he has objections to me performing Chhath in his Shivaji Park neighbourhood, I wont do it there, Ill do it in the middle of the ocean.        
	Thats how far the Sena-wary bhaiyyas of Mumbai have made Lalu Prasad retreat with his dare  into the Arabian Sea.        
	The odds are hell be waved even farther away by the white flag Mumbais bhaiyyas have raised. Hes already indicated as much. Bite-hungry microphones were snatching at his lips for a feed as he came out post-shoot, but he was in no mood to boost TRPs at the cost of busting his brethren. What message are you sending to Raj Thackeray, Laluji? When are you coming for Chhath? Where are you going to do it, Laluji?        
	The battery of cameras was all laced and dripping with fuel. But the railway minister, uncharacteristically restrained, wasnt offering fire. Whats this fuss about? Dont try to drag me into this, I never even said I have to do Chhath in Mumbai, I merely said India is a free country and nobody can prevent me from performing it in Mumbai or anywhere else, that is all there is to it, off now.        
	No gloves on show, only his long kurta sleeve, raised and blurring the lenses. No bout today, my hands are tied and my lips are sealed.        
	It is not as if we dont respect Laluji, dont get us wrong, said a member of his own puny party, but he cant be exhorting us into a battle he isnt going to lead. We have to make a life here, he doesnt. Paani mein rehkar magarmachh se bair lena kahan ki samajhdaari hai (If you must live in the water, how wise is it to be picking a quarrel with crocodiles)?        
	One look at the bench strength of the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Mumbai and youd understand where this man is coming from. They are better provided when it comes to the entire bhaiyya population, but then not all of them are prepared to do and die in Lalu Prasads wake.        
	As cabbie Badri Pande from Gorakhpur put it: Mumbai mein Lalu-waalu kaahe naak maarta hai? Usko chaar vote bhi nahin milega aur humko milega dus lappad. Kahe ko (Why do the likes of Lalu want to poke their noses into Mumbai, they wont get four votes and well end up getting 10 slaps. What for)?

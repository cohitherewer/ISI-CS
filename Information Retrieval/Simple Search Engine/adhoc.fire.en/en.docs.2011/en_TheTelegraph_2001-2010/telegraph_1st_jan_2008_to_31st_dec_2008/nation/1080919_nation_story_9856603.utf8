	Patna, Sept. 18: An advocate and four others were found guilty today for murdering Papia Ghosh, a professor of history in Patna University, in 2006.        
	The court will pronounce the quantum of punishment tomorrow.         
	The 53-year-old unmarried professor, a well-known name in the states academia, was stabbed to death along with her maid Malti Devi at her house here on December 3, 2006.        
	The next day, an FIR was lodged in the case which had sent shock waves through the states academic circles and the police quickly embarked on the exercise to pick up offenders who had perpetrated the twin murders.        
	The fast-track court judge, Omprakash, held advocate Ramchandra Mahto guilty under Section 414 of the Indian Penal Code while Shankar Sahu, Manohar Kumar, Asish Kumar Roy and Anil Oraon under Sections 396 and 412 of the IPC. While Section 414 deals with the recovery of the stolen goods and conspiracy, Sections 396 and 412 deal with dacoity and murder and concealment of stolen goods.        
	The police had recovered a computer, TV and several other material stolen from Papias home from the possession of advocate Mahto.

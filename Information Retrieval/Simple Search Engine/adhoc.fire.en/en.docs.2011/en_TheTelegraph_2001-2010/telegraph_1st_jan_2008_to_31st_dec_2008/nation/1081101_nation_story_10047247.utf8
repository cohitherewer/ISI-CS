The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mail threat to Sonia, target girlfriend
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mail threat to Sonia, target girlfriend

	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 31: Alls fair in love and war, but sending a death threat to one of the countrys most powerful women might be taking things a bit too far.        
	Arun Surya landed in handcuffs for sending an email to Rashtrapati Bhavan warning of an attack on Sonia Gandhis life to teach his former girlfriend a lesson.         
	The 23-year-old engineering student from Kochi had sent the mail from an ID he had created in the name of Manisha Manohar, hoping to get her into trouble. He gave the senders name as Rahmathuulah Barkath.        
	The mail, which reached Rashtrapati Bhavan last week, also warned of four blasts in Delhi and Kochi on November 14.         
	Surya had sent the same mail to the chiefs of the Intelligence Bureau, the Research and Analysis Wing and the CBI.         
	Kochi police commissioner Manoj Abraham said the Presidents office informed the state police yesterday. We cracked the case in 12 hours. Rashtrapati Bhavan has lauded the investigation team.         
	On October 24, Surya, the son of a bank officer, created the ID in Manishas name at an Internet caf on MG Road, soon after she broke up with him.         
	To cover up his tracks, he went to another caf a few kilometres away to send the mail at 2.52pm.         
	Abraham said a webcam at the caf had recorded Suryas image.        
	After verifying the time of the mail, we zeroed in on five youths. The face of one of them, carrying a bag, wasnt quite clear. But he had left enough clues in the mail  it had the girls address, he said.         
	Although the student does not have any criminal background and had probably sent the mail casually without thinking of its consequences, the police have slapped serious charges on him, the commissioner said.         
	Cases under Section 66 of the IT act (hacking) and sections of the IPC, including impersonation, have been filed.         
	It should be a lesson for all who tease the system. We are flooded with such fake mails and calls. Because of them, many serious calls go unattended. The message should go down well this time.        
	Kochi police had cracked a similar case during the Presidents visit a few months back. Ambar Raj had spent one-and-a-half months in prison for sending a mail threatening to kill Pratibha Patil.        
	Psychologist Justin Padamadan said such immature, vendetta-driven behaviour was caused by severe stress when ones judgement and rational powers are eclipsed or distorted by the combination of failure, self-pity, frustration and aggression.         
	The Congress demanded a through probe into the case.         
	Threatening the life of any individual is an offence under the IPC. When the person being threatened is a leader with a pre-eminent national stature, the matter assumes a different level of gravitas. Let the security agencies conduct an appropriate investigation and come to the relevant conclusions, party spokesperson Manish Tewari said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP attacks price spiral plot
                                                                                                               BJP attacks price spiral plot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Advani: No gain?                                  
	New Delhi, April 4: The BJP today tore into the Manmohan Singh government on rising prices, which it described as a conspiracy against the common man.         
	The party accused the government of failing to take timely measures to check prices and said the panic reaction now was not helping as the situation had spun out of control.         
	Arun Jaitley, one of the partys most articulate leaders, was fielded for the attack. Jaitley said the wholesale price index hitting 7 per cent meant the consumer prices were even higher.         
	This has become a conspiracy against the common man. This is almost like an unlegislated UPA tax on the consumer. And the irony is that such mismanagement of economy is taking place when an economist is the Prime Minister of the country, Jaitley said.         
	The BJP general secretary said the government had shown complete lack of foresight. The reduction in import duties (on edible oils) and ban on exports (of non-basmati rice) have come too late, he argued.         
	Jaitley warned that the Congress, which came to power on the aam-aadmi plank, and its allies would have to pay a heavy political price for what he described as a food economy bungle.         
	The aam aadmi felt betrayed as the UPA government had ended up hurting them the most by not controlling the prices of basic food items, he said.         
	The BJP expects to benefit from the price spiral, which has come as a political windfall for the party after the please-all budget generated unexpected cheer among the middle class and the farmers.         
	The middle class, thrilled with the tax relief granted in the budget, is now worked up over the price rise and the BJP is confident of regaining its support.         
	The farmers, granted a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver, are facing bureaucratic hassles in accessing it. The BJP feels any step to discourage private traders from buying their produce  in an attempt to check price rise  will annoy farmers as selling to the government is not as lucrative.         
	The government is in a vicious cycle. It is not easy to wriggle out of this situation, a BJP leader said. The party is going all out to exploit this situation by launching a weeklong protest in all state capitals.

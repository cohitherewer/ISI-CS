                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lady dead in locked flat in Calcutta 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 7: The decomposed body of a 60-year-old woman was found today in a bedroom of her flat in Alipore Road with the main door locked from outside.        
	Sipra Banerjee lived in the flat in the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) quarters with her son Dipankar. Her husband Kashinath Banerjee, who died in 2001, was an employee in the state irrigation department.        
	Around 7pm today, neighbours alerted police after foul smell emanated from the house. A police team broke open the door and found Sipras body, swollen and partially decomposed, on the bed.        
	The police said preliminary investigations did not reveal marks of external injury.        
	The main door of the flat was clamped from the outside with three locks, and Dipankar, 30, had not been seen in the locality for the past couple of days.        
	We are awaiting the post-mortem report to ascertain the cause of her death and action will be taken accordingly, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner (south).         
	An officer said that after Kashinaths death, Sipra used to stay in either her mothers house at Kadamtala in Howrah or with the unemployed Dipankar. Often, while going out, Dipankar used to lock Sipra inside the flat.        
	Sipras 36-year old daughter Anjana, a lawyer, is unmarried and stays at her maternal uncles house at Kadamtala.        
	A neighbour said the relationship between the mother and the son had soured after Sipras mother handed over a portion of the Kadamtala house to Anjana. This had led to problems between the mother and son and they argued on the issue several times. We got to know about it from Sipra herself. She sometimes visited us, said Gour Adhikar, the next-door neighbour of the Banerjees.         
	The police said they had traced Dipankar and he would be quizzed.         
	Just before Dipankar disappeared, we heard that he had got his fathers job, said Asish Nath, another neighbour.

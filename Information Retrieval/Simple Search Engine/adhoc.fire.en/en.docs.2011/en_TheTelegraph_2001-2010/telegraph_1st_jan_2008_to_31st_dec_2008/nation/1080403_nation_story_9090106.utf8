                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Dutch flight late by a day    
	A KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight from Amsterdam, which was supposed to land at new Rajiv Gandhi International airport in Shamshabad on Sunday, ultimately touched down the next day.    
	The flight went to Mumbai because the pilot failed to follow the air traffic controls directions. The airline, however, said it was diverted because of bad weather.    
	There was a further complication in Mumbai. On reaching there, the pilot did not go to Hyderabad immediately as he was not supposed to fly beyond the stipulated hours and all the passengers had already been put up in hotels.    
	After a mandatory rest period for the KLM crew, the flight arrived in Hyderabad at 12.47am on Monday.    
	TN tops road mishap chart    
	Tamil Nadu is now the countrys road mishap capital.    
	According to the latest figures of the National Crime Records Bureau, the state accounts for as much as 14 per cent of the road accidents in India.     
	In 2006, for which the figures are available, there were 55,145 mishaps. Maharashtra came a close second.     
	The two states together accounted for a fourth of the road accidents reported in India.     
	In Tamil Nadu, trucks were the worst offenders, being responsible for 22 per cent of the incidents. Two-wheelers accounted for 18 per cent and buses 12 per cent.     
	What should ring the alarm bells further is the 15 per cent annual jump in the number of vehicles plying the roads in the state.    
	With its many car-making units, Chennai and its suburbs may be emerging as the Detroit of Asia, but have been paying a price.    
	Coke in water campaign    
	Coca-Cola may have had to shut its tap in Kerala for alleged misuse of water, but in the capital, the soft drink giant is busy projecting itself as a water-conservation messiah.     
	The company joined hands with the Delhi government for week-long celebrations to mark World Water Day on March 22.    
	Jal Tarang was ostensibly a cultural extravaganza, but Coca-Cola did not miss the opportunity to announce its plan to install 80 rainwater-harvesting structures across the country.     
	The multinational has already set up 320 such plants in 17 states.     
	The festival ended on March 28.    
	In 2004, Coca-Cola had to close down its water processing plant in Keralas Plachimada after protests and a legal case. A local panchayat cancelled its licence, accusing the company of depleting the water table, leading to dry wells. The panchayat also alleged that Coca-Cola was polluting the Plachimadas water.        
	Green mourning    
	The garden city is fast losing its green but neither its administrators nor citizens appear bothered.     
	To shock people into action, an NGO brought professional mourners from Rajasthan. The rudaalis, clad in black, garlanded a tree stump and sat around it wailing.     
	The tree had been chopped to widen an arterial road.     
	As their wails rent the air, attracting passersby, volunteers from the Karnataka Environment Trust handed out leaflets reminding people about the virtues of trees and the need to transplant them if they stand in the way of a development project.    
	Delhi: Photographer Dileep Prakash presents his tribute to the Anglo-Indian community through a unique exhibition on Friday. Catch the show at Photoink Gallery on 1 Faiz Road Jhandewalan. The paintings are on display from 11am to 7pm.

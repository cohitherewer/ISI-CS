The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Experts raise child X-ray overdose alarm 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Experts raise child X-ray overdose alarm 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 2: An unknown proportion of children and adults undergoing CT scans in India might be receiving overdoses of X-ray radiation, a government-funded, unpublished study has indicated.         
	The study was confined to Tamil Nadu and covered only 71 CT scan centres. But radiation safety experts believe its findings might be relevant to other states because a decade-old proposal to establish a nationwide, decentralised system for inspecting X-ray machines has failed to take off.         
	The level of current used to generate X-rays needs to be reduced during CT scans on children to lower radiation exposure, taking into account differences in the physical size between adults and children.         
	But 32 out of the 71 CT scan centres studied were not following the paediatric protocol, said K.S. Parathasarathy, the former secretary with the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Mumbai, which is the government agency monitoring radiation safety across India in nuclear plants and medical centres.         
	A few CT scan centres were also observed to be overdosing adults undergoing scans of the abdomen, according to the study conducted by medical physicists at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.         
	This should not be happening, Parathasarthy said. The goal should be to use a dose as low as reasonably achievable for adults and children, he said.         
	The risk of radiation exposure during a scan is still very small compared to the benefits that accurate diagnosis and treatment a scan can provide. But experts warn that unnecessary exposure should be avoided.         
	The risks of radiation exposure are relatively higher for children than adults because children have more rapidly dividing cells than adults and have longer life expectancy.         
	Parents should ask their CT scan providers whether they are following a paediatric protocol, Parathasarathy said. We need more people (to be) aware about this issue.         
	But radiation safety experts concede that awareness also needs to flow into personnel managing medical diagnostic centres.         
	We see patients waiting in line for diagnosis inside the X-ray room. They get exposed while waiting for their turn, and again when the beam is turned on them, said Roshan Livingstone, a medical physicist at Christian Medical College, Vellore, who has been monitoring X-ray centres for several years.         
	During the mid-1990s, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board had initiated a nationwide effort to regulate X-ray machines, specifying rules for the functioning of diagnostic centres that would provide X-ray imaging services.         
	There are breaches (of rules) occurring, said N. Kulasekaran, the president of the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association. Diagnostic centres have mushroomed, but theres not enough monitoring and inspection, he said.         
	The regulatory board has been urging state governments to set up directorates to help inspect diagnostic centres with X-ray machines, but only two states  Kerala and Madhya Pradesh  have set up inspection directorates.         
	Only a decentralised inspection system will work, but a nationwide system isnt anywhere in sight yet, Parathasarathy said. However, he said the situation in India is not unique. Radiation exposure from CT scans is also causing concern in other countries, including the US, he said.         
	A report in the New England Journal of Medicine last November suggested that about one-third of CT scans in the US may not be justified by medical need.         
	The National Cancer Institute and the Society for Paediatric Radiology in the US have issued a guide for health care providers titled Radiation Risks and Pediatric Computed Tomography (CT).         
	Livingstone is currently trying to assess the increased risk of cancer to children and adults in India who are exposed to unusually high doses of X-rays.

	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 2: Within a week after terrorists laid siege to several places in Mumbai, security arrangements in luxury hotels and railway stations in Orissa are being stepped up.        
	All baggage of guests would now be subject to security scan and personal identification of all guests would be taken along with residential address and phone number during check-in, said J.K. Mohanty, the chairman of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Orissa. Closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) would be installed at all strategic points of hotels to keep a tab on the movement of tourists and hotel staff, he added.        
	Entries and exits of hotel staff would be checked and no staff other than the managers would be allowed to carry cellphones on hotel premises, said Mohanty. Vendors and suppliers of the hotels would be issued identity cards, he added.        
	East Coast Railway stepped up security measures at stations pressing sniffer dogs into service. CCTV cameras and luggage scanner machines have also been installed.

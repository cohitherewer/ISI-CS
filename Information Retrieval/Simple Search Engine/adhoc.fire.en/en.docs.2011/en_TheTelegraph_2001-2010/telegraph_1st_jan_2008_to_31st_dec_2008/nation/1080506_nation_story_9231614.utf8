	New Delhi, May 5 (PTI): A revised pay package for armed forces personnel, including enhanced military service pay for those below officer rank, will be finalised at a meeting to be chaired by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar tomorrow.        
	Besides the cabinet secretary, the meeting will be attended by navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta, Air Chief Marshal F.H. Major and army chief General Deepak Kapoor.        
	The meeting will also be attended by other secretaries in the empowered group set up by the government to probe anomalies in the pay packages of armed forces personnel.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony today said there was no large-scale departure from the services despite the sixth pay commission recommendations not coming up to the expectations of the armed forces personnel.        
	He put the number of officers who were permitted to leave services during the last five years at 3,474.

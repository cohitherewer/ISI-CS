The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Special kids onus to shift   to schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Special kids onus to shift   to schools
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                    
	New Delhi, June 10: India is set to upgrade its commitment to high school education for the disabled from merely integrating them into an existing mainstream to making the environment inclusive.        
	A new scheme drafted by the human resource development ministry has for the first time placed the onus of ensuring a dignified environment for education on institutions rather than on students, top officials said.        
	Although Indian law and the education policy forbids institutions from discriminating against disabled children, a student once admitted is responsible for fitting into the existing school environment.        
	The Centre now plans to replace the Integrated Education for Disabled Children programme, launched in 1974, with the Inclusive Education for Disabled Children at the Secondary Stage scheme.        
	As the name suggests, the new scheme will target only secondary education, unlike the existing one that covers all school education. A similar scheme for primary education is in the pipeline.        
	The government keeps no record of the number of disabled students in schools but activists say the number of children of school-going age who suffer from disabilities may be more than 20 million.        
	The new scheme envisages a change in curriculum to include course content aimed at sensitising students to the needs of the disabled.        
	Schools  either run or partly aided by the government  will also have to ensure barrier-free access to facilities like libraries, canteens and computer centres, sources said.        
	The ministry, the sources added, has sent the inclusive education scheme to the Planning Commission for its approval. The commission has agreed to allocate Rs 500 crore for the scheme in the 11th Five Year Plan, but the ministry is seeking Rs 800 crore.        
	Unlike the integrated education programme, which was implemented by states with some central support, the new scheme will be run exclusively by the Centre.        
	In February 1996, India had enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, banning educational institutions and employers from discriminating against the disabled.         
	Activists say the number of disabled children being denied admission to schools or colleges has declined over the past decade since the law was enacted.        
	Today, most schools and colleges admit disabled children. But the battle now is to ensure that education is imparted to them in a dignified environment, activist Javed Abidi said. Activists have been asking HRD minister Arjun Singh to shift from integrated to inclusive education for the past three years at least. This (shift) is a very positive step, he added.        
	Most colleges under Delhi University, Indias largest varsity, still do not have ramps connecting floors. Many Delhi schools, Abidi said , also do not pay attention to the needs of the disabled.        
	Students with wheelchairs are often lifted by friends or teachers while going from one floor to another. But having to be lifted is an affront to the students dignity, Abidi said.

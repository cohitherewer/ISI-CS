	Patna, Oct. 15: An alleged criminal went on the rampage killing two persons and injuring a Railway Protection Force jawan at Jogbani railway station today.        
	The assailant, Basant Choudhary, was arrested later. Basant, wanted in a number of cases, snatched Indian and Nepalese currencies from one Manoj Mandal, a currency exchanger near the ticket counter at the station in the East Central Railway on the Nepal border, about 400km from here.        
	Mandal chased him after Basant tried to flee with the money. Soon, Basant fired on Mandal killing him on the spot. Basant also fired on a beggar, Majroom Mia, who joined Mandal in chasing the criminal. Majroom too died on the spot.        
	Hearing the gunshots, RPF jawans rushed towards Basant who fired 14 rounds from his revolver injuring a jawan. But the RPF jawans, the railway police said, eventually overpowered Basant and arrested him with revolver and cartridges in his hands. Cases against Basant were lodged under the Arms Act.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Budget muse: PCs and Chennais
                                                                                                               Budget muse: PCs and Chennais
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Chennai, March 2: When P. Chidambaram presents a budget, his muse Tiruvalluvar must figure in it.        
	Kodai ali sengol kudi ombal nangum, udaiyanam vendharkku oli (Generous grants, compassion, righteous rule and succour to the downtrodden are the hallmarks of good governance), the finance minister said on Friday, ending his budget speech with a couplet by the Tamil saint-poet who, he said, had laid down the yardstick for good governance 2,000 years ago.        
	But it is not Chidambaram alone who turns to Tirukkural  a text hailed as the universal Veda of the Dravidians minus the caste system  for inspiration.         
	Every budget speech in the Tamil Nadu Assembly begins with a Tiruvalluvar couplet. So does every day in the House when it is in session  its the Speakers job to recite one of his couplets and explain its meaning to members.        
	Since M. Karunanidhi came to power, all state-run buses have been carrying a kural (couplet). There are 1,330 of them in Tirukkural, which is divided into 133 adhikarams (chapters).        
	The text -- catholic, secular and ideologically neutral -- is divided into three parts: Aram (the way of dharma), Porul (wealth creation and distribution) and Inbam (joy).        
	The first 20 chapters in Porul are devoted to kings and their duties, the next 32 deal with other matters concerning the state and good governance and the last 13 with sundry concerns. Porul makes up almost half the text, signifying the pivotal role the poet assigned to matters of politics and welfare.        
	It is said that there is a kural for every occasion  as Chidambaram never fails to point out. The universal message is that love, brotherhood, diligence, patience and compassion are the only means to cure all human ills.        
	There is no agreement among scholars about the saint-poets faith, his identity and even his period. Some say he was a low-caste Hindu from the weavers community who lived in Mylapore, once a fishing village but now the heart of upscale Chennai, more than 2,000 years ago.        
	Others believe that there is sufficient evidence in Tirukkural  particularly in its strong ethical emphasis  that he was Jainisms finest flower who simultaneously manifested the Tamil genius.        
	In the mid-seventies, Karunanidhi had a monument erected in the heart of Chennai on which all 1,330 couplets are inscribed. Days before he was to inaugurate it in 1976, Indira Gandhi dismissed the DMK regime during the Emergency.        
	Karunanidhi then vowed he would return to the monument only as chief minister. He was sworn in at the site in 1989.        
	Karunanidhi later had a 133-foot-tall statue of Tiruvalluvar, by sculptor Ganapathy Sthapathy, installed at Kanyakumari. It was unveiled at the dawn of the new millennium.        
	In his current term, the chief minister has lent legal force to a new Tamil calendar in the name of Tiruvalluvar. A large group of Tamil scholars, led by Maraimalai Adigalar, had determined his year of birth as 31BC.

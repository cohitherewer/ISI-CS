	Karachi, Feb. 8 (PTI): Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik added a new twist to his alleged nikaah with an Indian girl, saying her family had demanded Rs 15 lakh to shop for the wedding.        
	Malik said he became suspicious when Ayesha Siddiquis family demanded such a hefty amount.        
	They kept on pressuring me into having a nikaah with her over the phone, he said on Pakistans Geo TV today.        
	Malik said he would now consult his mother and sisters before taking legal action against the Siddiquis, who live in Hyderabad.        
	Replying to a caller on the show, the cricketer swore that he had not married Ayesha.         
	The girls father claims Malik had performed nikaah with his daughter in 2002 after a love affair that was mostly conducted on the Internet and telephone.

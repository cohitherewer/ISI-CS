          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Nitish Kumar: Security sought		      
	Patna, March 4: The Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to ensure relief, safety and security to Hindi-speaking people living in Maharashtra.         
	I would urge you to look into the incidents in Mumbai and in Maharashtra, see that the relief is given to people who have suffered, safety to the persons and their property and ensure that the future of the people earning their living in Maharashtra is not jeopardised, pleaded Nitishs letter to Manmohan Singh today.         
	The letter added that hooliganism and violence unleashed in Mumbai and in parts of Maharastra by elements targeting Hindi-speaking people from east and north India, especially those coming from Bihar, was disappointing.         
	With the PMs letter, Nitish Kumar has also attached his written plea to his Maharashtra counterpart. Nitishs move comes after there was a uproar in the Bihar Assembly regarding the issue and legislators, cutting across party lines, expressed their anguish and urged the chief minister to take up the matter with the Prime Minister.         
	Hundreds of people are coming back to Bihar from Maharashtra in terror. Media carries stories everyday, the letter added.         
	Nitish Kumar has also asked Manmohan Singh to act fast. Its time that the Union government advises the state of Maharashtra to take appropriate measures.         
	Resentment is brewing across Bihar against the attacks (verbal and physical) on the Hindi-speaking people in the western city.        
	Various organisations and parties have been holding dharnas and demonstrations in districts of Bihar demanding that the government save the people, particularly those from Bihar, living in Mumbai.        
	The developments also echoed in the two Houses of the states bicameral legislature, which is in session now.         
	The agitated members took up the issue with Governor R.S. Gavai, who hails from Maharashtra. The matter was taken up on the first day of the budget session, when the governor addressed the joint session of the two Houses.         
	While asking for security cover for the Bihar people, the chief minister has also appealed to the people of the state to be respectful, co-operative and affectionate towards people from other states, who are living in Bihar.

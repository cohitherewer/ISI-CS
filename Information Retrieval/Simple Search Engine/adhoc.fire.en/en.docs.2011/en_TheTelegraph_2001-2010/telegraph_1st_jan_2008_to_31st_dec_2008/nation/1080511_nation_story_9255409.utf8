	Hubli, May 10 (PTI): A bomb exploded today in a motorcycle parked outside a closed courthouse where a magistrate has been trying seven terror suspects, Karnataka police said.          
	The explosion damaged furniture but there were no casualties since the judicial first class magistrates court was closed because of a holiday. The police later cordoned off the area and sent for explosives experts and sniffer dogs.                   
	Panchkula (PTI): Cricketer Yuvraj Singhs father Yograj Singh has been booked on charges of cheating and fraud, police said today. Yograj, a former Test cricketer, has not been arrested. The case was slapped on him in connection with a property transaction in which the complainant had alleged he was cheated by Yograj, the police said.                  
	Rampur (PTI): Eight suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba militants have been chargesheeted for their alleged involvement in the New Year attack on a CRPF camp in Uttar Pradesh this year, officials said. The attack had killed seven jawans and a rickshawpuller.                   
	London (PTI): An Indian-origin man, who was secretly filmed trying to hire a hitman to kill his estranged wife and her lover, has been jailed for five-and-a-half years by a British court. Birmingham-based Jasbinder Heer did not realise that the man he was hiring was an undercover journalist.                  
	Ramanathapuram (PTI): A 21-year-old from Tamil Nadu has created a new Guinness record by blowing out 151 candles in a single breath. V. Sankaranarayanan performed the feat last January. He has broken the record held by David Lamy of France, who blew out 117 candles in 2001. Breath-control exercises apparently helped Sankaranarayanan achieve the feat.                  
	 Srinagar (PTI): Four persons were killed and 12 injured when a minibus fell into the Jhelum in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday morning. The driver lost control of the bus, which skidded off the road.

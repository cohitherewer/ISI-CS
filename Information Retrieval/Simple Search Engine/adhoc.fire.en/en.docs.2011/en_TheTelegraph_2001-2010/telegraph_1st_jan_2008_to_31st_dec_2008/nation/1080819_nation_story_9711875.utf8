                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Govt hands off, Valley slides towards anarchy

	Srinagar, Aug. 18: The Hurriyat separatists today betrayed embarrassing signs of a personality rift but India stood confronted by a greater challenge as hundreds of thousands swooped unhindered on uptown Srinagar, staging a chaotic siege and demanding a UN-monitored plebiscite in Kashmir.        
	The azaadi protests have been unfurling across the Valley for more than a week now, each rally larger and more strident than the previous one. Governor N.N. Vohras administration has shown no signs it has a strategy to counter or contain the upsurge other than to stand aside and let it mushroom; the ploy has plunged top civilian and police ranks in consternation and anxiety.         
	The government is in absolute paralysis here, or is being perceived as such, said a top official, agitated at the refusal of the administration to take the protests in hand. It is being argued that the absence of security restrictions is preventing violence, he said, but equally, and dangerously, it is bolstering the separatists and demoralising the forces. This way, things will get more out of hand each day and leave the government with no option but to eventually come down with a heavy and bloody hand.         
	Many of the vehicles that brought the azaadi protesters to the UN offices today had been commandeered from government departments.         
	There is nobody to stop them, the officer said. Senior government servants were among the crowd, such is the state of things.         
	Also troubling to many who are helplessly watching the drift into anarchy is the utter absence of any political initiative from the Centre or from state-level leaders.         
	I cant believe we are back to a 1990-like emergency and nobody in New Delhi or Srinagar has shown any apparent concern, said a retired Kashmiri bureaucrat. Separatists seem to have the run of the field and it is moving nobody, nothing.        
	But the separatists, too, are contending with a prickly set of worries. They are not united on objectives, they are being dragged under by factional one-upmanship, and, most of all, they appear lost on where to direct this mass uprising.         
	A senior moderate Hurriyat leader conceded to The Telegraph: The people on the street are no longer content with hartals or being directed from this place to that, they want to breach the LoC at the very least, we are riding a tiger and it has become perilous to dismount it. They have turned up in huge numbers on our call, now they expect us to do something concrete. God forbid, if the leadership slips away from us into unknown hands, this is a very fluid situation.        
	He would not specify it, but was hinting quite pointedly at a militant takeover of the current movement. Thus far, militant influence has not been visible, but observers suggest it could be lurking in the background to grab its chance.         
	Dont forget, Kashmir is not rid of militancy or militants, cautioned a senior police officer. They are around, watching, it takes very little for them to create a flashpoint and give a more radical turn to this. A leaderless movement is a dangerous one.        
	Todays rally offered enough evidence of a rising, indeed uncontrollable, fervour, especially among the youth who have emerged as spearheads. This is a new generation of Kashmiri boys, born mostly after the 1990 uprising and fed on tales of a failed insurrection.         
	We have been frustrated in the past, but not now, screamed Javaid Dar, a university student from downtown Srinagar. This movement was dead, we have resurrected it and now we are going to take it all the way, Hurriyat or no Hurriyat.        
	An illustration of just how they are dominating proceedings: After submitting their memo at the UN offices, lawyers of the bar association wanted to walk back peacefully to the rally grounds. But in time, a group of black-shirted, masked youth had taken over the lead and turned the tempers up, provoking the policemen on duty and screaming belligerent pro-Pakistan slogans.         
	We are not pro-Pakistan, we are for independence, whispered a lawyer in the throng. But these boys are running away with the agenda, they cant be controlled.        
	Such differences are emerging among top separatists, too. Addressing the rallyists from atop an open and overloaded SUV parked close to the offices of the United Nations International Military Observer Group (UNIMOG), Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq demanded immediate self-determination for Kashmiris.         
	We have lived under Indian excesses too long, the people of Kashmir have now risen and expressed their will, it is high time we are allowed to decide our own future.         
	Mirwaiz did not formally present his memorandum to the UN in protest against the governments decision to allow only small groups through, but his call for self-determination was unambiguous.        
	His hardline counterpart, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, peddled a radically different demand, claiming the people wanted merger with Pakistan, nothing less. Hum Pakistani hain, Pakistan hamara hai, Geelani said, to rapturous applause from a crowd whose lead chant was pro-Pakistan.         
	The UN should send its peacekeeping forces to Kashmir immediately and hold a plebiscite, the Kashmiris will declare their will to join Pakistan, Geelani said.        
	Yasin Malik, a third Hurriyat frontrunner, rose to categorically contradict Geelani. We are for complete independence, he told the crowd, not for this country or that. Is paar bhi azaadi, us paar bhi azaadi, he exclaimed. Independence this side (of the LoC) and independence that side.        
	The government would be hoping that such differences, and fatigue, will bear this movement down and eventually pull the wind out of it. It is still hands off and refusing to engage.         
	Perhaps symbolically, its only real presence at todays protest existed not on the ground but in the air  an army helicopter scurrying in the skies, reporting to the powers of the massive build-up.

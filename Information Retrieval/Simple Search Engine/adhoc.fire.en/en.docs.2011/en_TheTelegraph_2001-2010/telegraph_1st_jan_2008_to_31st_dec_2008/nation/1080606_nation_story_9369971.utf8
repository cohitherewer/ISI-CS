          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Protest Path    
	Raipur, June 5: Chhattisgarhs Gujjars are mobilising their community to follow their Rajasthan counterparts and launch a stir in the state to support their demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.         
	The tribal dominated state of Chhattisgarh has about 10,000 Gujjars mostly residing in Ambikapur, Sarguja, Jashpur and Korba.         
	A delegation of the Gujjar Samaj has met chief minister Raman Singh and handed over a memorandum demanding ST status for the members staying in Chhattisgarh, said Balikaran Gujjar, the state president of Chhattisgarh Gujjar Samaj.        
	He was addressing the media today at a conference. Balikaran Gujjar assured that the chief minister has assured to look into the matter.         
	According to Balikaran, members would wait for a response from the chief minister before launching a state-wide agitation in support of their demand. We will take to the streets for our rights, as the members of our community here, too, are equally backward, he added.         
	The state president of the samaj, who retired as a government teacher, said their younger generations are left to struggle for government jobs at the present moment. The young Gujjars only get contractual jobs in the state, he added.         
	He clarified that there was no alliance between the state unit and the violent Rajasthan agitation. The Gujjars here, however, support the Rajasthan agitation and will follow the model in Chhattisgarh to press their demands if need be, he added. The community members have started preparing a stir layout in the state once they receive some sort of indication from the state government regarding their demands.

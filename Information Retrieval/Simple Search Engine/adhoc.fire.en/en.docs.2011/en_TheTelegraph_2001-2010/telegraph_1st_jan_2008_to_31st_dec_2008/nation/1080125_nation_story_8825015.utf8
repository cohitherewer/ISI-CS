	New Delhi, Jan. 24 (PTI): France has decided to invite Taslima Nasreen to Paris to receive its prestigious Simone de Beauvoir award after Delhi stalled its plans to confer the honour on her here during the visit of President Nicolas Sarkozy.
    
	Sarkozy has directed that the controversial Bangladeshi author be invited to France so that the award may be given to her officially, the French embassy said.
    
	French economy minister Christine Lagarde will not accompany Sarkozy to India.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 7: Its made for students, by the students and now its on air.        
	Adding to the concept of good schooling amenities, city-based SAI International School is ready with the first school campus radio in Orissa  Radio Orange 99.9.        
	The virtual radio station, with its studio in Tansen Gallery, the music lab of the school, would broadcast a colourful blend of edu-infotainment programmes designed by the students.         
	Radio Orange would air programmes, including news, views, current affairs, dos and donts, common social issues, teachers counsels, live chat shows among others.        
	Highlights of the programmes would include the 30-minute lunchtime broadcast featuring news bulletins and other programmes.         
	Remaining exclusive to the community on the school campus, Radio Orange would be operated by the students themselves under the guidance of trained professionals from Big FM.        
	The programmes would be sporadic initially and gradually regularised as the students get familiarised with the operative part, said SAI International chairman Bijoy Sahoo, adding that the station would soon be equipped with state-of-the-art digital equipment and studio desk for quality production.        
	Apart from engaging students in the world of performing arts, music, social awareness issues and counselling, it can also become a grooming ground for students who wished to pursue a career in broadcasting, said Sahoo.        
	These would not just give them a wider perspective on evolving new concept but also boost their creative talent which they could use in coming up with new ideas, he said. As of now, 350 students would participate in the programme and work in a team of four by rotation with an experienced RJ.         
	The school management is committed to meet the global standards by doing such activities and we believe the efforts will encourage teamwork, commitment and promote participation, principal Arun Prakash said.

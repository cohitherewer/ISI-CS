	Srinagar, Jan. 25: Security forces gunned down the alleged mastermind of the Uttar Pradesh court blasts at a Jammu and Kashmir village late last night.
    
	Bashir Ahmad Mir, the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami operational chief for the Valley, was shot at Chatroo village in Kishtwar district, 200km from Jammu, in a joint operation by police and troops of the 11 Rashtriya Rifles.
    
	Manohar Singh, the Doda senior superintendent of police, described the breakthrough on the eve of Republic Day as a major success for the force. He was the mastermind of the three court blasts in Uttar Pradesh and the most wanted militant in the region. This is a major success for the police, Singh said. 
    
	The joint operation team had to walk several kilometres to reach Mirs hideout in the snow-wrapped village as a long stretch of the road is not motorable. As the militant flitted from one hideout to another, the forces challenged him to surrender but he began firing at them. 
    
	After a fierce gun battle raging for almost three hours, Mir was killed around 1am.
    
	A police officer in Kishtwar said three other militants accompanying Mir, alias Sahba, escaped during the operation. 
    
	An AK-47 rifle, a satellite phone and some ammunition were found on the militant. 
    
	Last month, the police had arrested two Doda youths  Sajjad and Tariq Kashmir  for their alleged role in the November blasts in Varanasi, Lucknow and Faizabad courts, which left 13 persons dead. 
    
	The Doda police chief, however, said they did not provide any tip-off on Mir. We had separate information about him. 
    
	A resident of Kachar in Kishtwar, Mir stepped into militancy in 1992 when he crossed the Line of Control to receive arms training. He specialised in handling arms and making improvised explosive devices, the police said. He has been with the Huji since the beginning and rose to the rank of chief commander, Singh said. 
    
	An army officer said Mir was in charge of the Jungle Mangal and Mansera camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for three years before being sent back to the Valley in 1998. In 2000, he was appointed head of Hujis Kashmir operations but soon fell into the police net. 
    
	He rejoined militancy when he was released in 2002 and later carried out a string of operations against forces in the Jammu province. His role in the Uttar Pradesh blasts is certain but we are probing his involvement in the Hyderabad blasts, too, the officer said.

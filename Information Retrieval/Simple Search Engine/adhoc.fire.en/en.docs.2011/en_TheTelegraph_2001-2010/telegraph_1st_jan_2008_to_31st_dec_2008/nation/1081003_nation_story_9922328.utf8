The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chuck bad deal: CPM
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chuck bad deal: CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Karat in New Delhi on Thursday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The CPM today asked the government not to sign the Indo-US nuclear deal, saying it would betray Indias vital interests as the act passed by the US Congress included harmful conditions in addition to provisions of the Hyde Act.         
	It is a Hyde Act-plus law as it includes not only all key provisions of the Hyde Act but also additional measures. If the Congress-led government signs the 123 Agreement, it will be a complete surrender to the United States and a betrayal of Indias vital interests. It is a bad deal and an unequal treaty, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.         
	The Manmohan Singh government has been claiming that the Hyde Act will be overridden by the last act passed by the US Congress as per US jurisprudence. Now the last act contains all the Hyde Act restrictions and they have been made more explicit, Karat said.        
	The act, he added, does not give any assurance of fuel supply or of building a strategic lifetime fuel reserve. The US will also work to prevent other countries from providing nuclear supplies to India if the US terminates the 123 Agreement.        
	Quoting the Prime Ministers June 30 statement that the government would come to Parliament after completing negotiations at the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, he said the US Congress had adopted the law but the Indian Parliament is nowhere in sight.        
	Karat said even before the US Congress had passed the deal, India had committed itself to buying equipment to produce a minimum of 10,000MW of power from the American nuclear industry, which has not received any new order for the last 30 years. The CPM leader said the order was estimated to be worth $70 billion or Rs 280,000 crore.         
	He circulated copies of a letter purportedly written by foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon to US undersecretary of state William Burns, which mentions the order.

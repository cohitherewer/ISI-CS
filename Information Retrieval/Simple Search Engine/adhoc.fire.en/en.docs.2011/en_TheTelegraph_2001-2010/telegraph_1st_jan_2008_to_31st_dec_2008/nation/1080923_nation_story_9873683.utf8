  - bones shed light on neanderthals          G.S. MUDUR                         The Neanderthal caves on the coast of Gibraltar and (below) a marine bone found in a cave				                                             
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Neanderthals hunted, captured and cooked monk seals, fish and dolphins from the sea over 32,000 years ago, a study of bones from caves on the eastern coast of Gibraltar has indicated.         
	The findings announced today by scientists from Great Britain and Spain challenge traditional notions of the Neanderthals, an early human species long believed to have been less intelligent than modern humans.         
	Excavations in two caves that face the Mediterranean Sea provide the best evidence so far that the Neanderthals actively looked for and consumed marine creatures in a style remarkably similar to that displayed by prehistoric stone-age humans a few thousand years later.         
	The prevalent view has been that Neanderthals were fairly dumb hominids (early humans), who stumbled along until modern humans arrived, said Clive Finlayson, the director of Gibraltar Museum.         
	We now have solid evidence that Neanderthals were finding food in the same way as contemporary modern humans, Finlayson told The Telegraph over phone.         
	The Neanderthals were an early human species that existed between 130,000 years and 30,000 years ago, after which they became extinct. Anthropologists say it is still unclear how much interaction the Neanderthals had with modern humans.         
	In excavations in the caves carried out over the past three years, researchers have found remains of red deer, wild boars, bears, birds, as well as juvenile seals, dolphins, fish, molluscs and tortoise.         
	Several bones have cut marks that indicate the meat was stripped with contemporary Neanderthal stone tools. The findings will appear tomorrow in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a US research journal.         
	A shoulder blade of a juvenile monk seal has long thin marks that indicate de-fleshing activity, the researchers said. Some of the bones in the caves also have signs of exposure to fire.         
	These findings question the view that the Neanderthals were incapable of certain hunting behaviour known to be associated with modern humans, he said.         
	There is evidence here that the Neanderthals did not come across the animals only by accident, said Yolanda Fernandez-Jalvo, a team member at the National Museum of Natural Sciences, Madrid.         
	The excavations suggest that the Neanderthals made repetitive, seasonal visits to the seashore. It was as if they knew when the seals would come ashore for breeding, Fernandez-Jalvo said.         
	The researchers believe the Neanderthals might have captured dolphins that had accidentally or seasonally beached on land. The absence of cut marks on dolphin remains suggests that the Neanderthals consumed fat rather than meat.         
	Scientists have believed for decades that in the struggle to survive on the planet, the Neanderthals lost because they lacked intelligence.         
	The new study is the second in less than a month to urge a rethinking of the intellectual capacity of the Neanderthals.         
	In August this year, British and American researchers reported similarities in the efficiency of stone tools of the Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.         
	 quot;It is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why the Neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived, quot; Metin Eren, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter had said.         
	The Neanderthals are believed to have died out around 28,000 years ago, suggesting at least 10,000 years of an overlap and possible interaction between them and the ancestors of modern humans.         
	Three years ago, independent researchers had found evidence of marine seafood consumption by late stone age people at various sites between 20,000 and 28,000 years ago.

  - Academic panel seeks pupil-friendly system          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Worries ahead?                                        
	Cuttack, July 13: The Orissa Secondary School Teachers Association (Ossta) today expressed concern over the delay in release of textbooks for Class VIII, IX and X to the market by board of secondary education for this academic session.         
	The delay is affecting the availability of textbooks in the market and there is shortage of books across the state, said the associations secretary Kishore Chandra Panda at a news conference today.        
	The board is expected to release 12 lakh textbooks for Class VIII, IX and X before the beginning of every academic session in April.        
	Three months into this session, the board has released less than 4.5 lakh text books to the market, the secretary said, blaming the board administration for the situation. The association demanded that optional papers be cut out and a syllabus similar to the CBSE pattern with 500 marks be introduced instead.         
	The board, from last year, had reintroduced optional papers in the HSC syllabus. Some of the optional subjects have practical tests and the aggregate was increased from 750 to 800. The board reintroduced optional papers that were withdrawn a year ago.         
	Previously, students were permitted to write one optional paper, while from last year two optional subjects were made compulsory.         
	The board failed to provide textbooks for optional papers last year, the secretary said, holding the new syllabus responsible for the decline in the pass rate in 2008.        
	The pass percentage had plummeted by 5.95 per cent this year for the first time in four years.         
	The success rate among candidates this year was 53.14 per cent against a record 59.09 per cent last year. The pass rate was 56.4 per cent in 2006 and 55.66 per cent in 2005.

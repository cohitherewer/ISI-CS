The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP scoffs at nuke swagger
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP scoffs at nuke swagger
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Jaitley                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The BJP is not perturbed by the new swagger the Congress leadership has acquired after the Nuclear Suppliers Groups waiver, described by the ruling combine as a historic moment for India.        
	The BJP leadership is convinced that the nuclear deal cannot become an electoral issue in a country like India.         
	If the government feels so strongly about the success of the nuclear deal, why dont they go to the polls on this issue? asked party general secretary Arun Jaitley today, stressing that price rise was the issue that would prove to be the UPAs nemesis.         
	Jaitley was dismissive of suggestions that the deal would impress the urban middle class in a big way.         
	The BJP is not worried at the Congress plan to turn the nuclear-deal row into a debate on nationalism. The main Opposition party has decided to base its poll campaign on its pet themes like terrorism and minority appeasement apart from inflation.         
	Its strategy will be fine-tuned at the partys three-day national executive in Bangalore from Friday.        
	The BJP believes that the Congress leadership does not have the ability to create a nationalist surge on issues like the nuclear deal. Indira Gandhi would have done it; she used to beat us even at the issue of nationalism. But Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh havent risen through the ranks, Jaitley said.        
	The BJP has decided not to fall into the Congress trap by laying too much emphasis on the nuclear deal. Its leadership will respond to questions on the deal by arguing that it imposes restrictions on India.        
	We will say the government has surrendered to US pressure, that our right to conduct further tests has been compromised with, and that the unlimited-power logic is bogus, a spokesperson said.         
	BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the Bangalore meeting would focus on inflation, terrorism and corruption. He, however, added that with several states going to the polls at the end of the year, finalising strategies for them would take up most of the meetings time.        
	The BJP has to combat anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh while Delhi looks an easier battle.         
	Around 200 leaders, including party chief ministers and state unit chiefs, will also discuss strategies for poll-bound Jammu and Kashmir as well as Jharkhand, where an election may not be far away.

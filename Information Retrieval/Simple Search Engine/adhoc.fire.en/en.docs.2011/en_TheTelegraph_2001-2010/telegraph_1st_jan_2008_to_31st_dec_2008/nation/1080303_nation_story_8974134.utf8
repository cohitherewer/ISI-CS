The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Actors want gag off Raj
                                                                                                               Actors want gag off Raj
                            
	Mumbai, March 2 (PTI): Film and theatre personalities, including Sajid Khan and Shreyas Talpade (in pictures), have opposed the police gag order on Raj Thackeray, the Maharashtra Nirman Sena said today.        
	Over five lakh signatures have been collected in Rajs support from across Maharashtra, said Shirish Parkar, MNS spokesperson.        
	Raj had made inflammatory statements against north Indian migrants in Mumbai, provoking violence across the state last month. On February 11, the police had prohibited him from addressing public rallies or news conferences. The order was upheld by Bombay High Court.        
	Among those who joined the signature campaign were actors Nana Patekar and Talpade, producer Sajid Nadiadwala, director Sajid Khan, writer Subhash Bhende and MLA Shalinitai Patil, the MNS said.        
	Marathi theatre personalities such as Ashok Saraf, Bharat Jadhav, Atul Parchure, Sandeep Kulkarni, Prashant Damle, Mohan Joshi and others, too, signed, it added.

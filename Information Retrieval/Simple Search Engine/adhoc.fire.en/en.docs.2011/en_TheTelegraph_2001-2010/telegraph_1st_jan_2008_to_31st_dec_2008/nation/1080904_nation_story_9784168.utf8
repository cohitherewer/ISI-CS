	Bolpur, Sept. 3: A woman was dragged out of home by some villagers who chopped off her hair and left her tied to a lamp post after the 30-year-old resisted a molestation attempt earlier in the night.        
	Her father Kalu Sheikh told police the intruders took off her sari during the August 14 assault in Natungram village in Bolpur, Birbhum, about 210km from Calcutta.        
	The complaint, filed on August 21, named eight villagers. All of them are absconding. The incident came to light only this evening when some villagers opened their mouths.        
	The inspector in charge of Bolpur police station, Sachin Pariya, confirmed a complaint had been registered. But the accused persons are absconding, he said.        
	According to the complaint, the woman, a day labourer, and her 18-year-old cousin who had come to visit her were sleeping when a man sneaked in. The womans husband, also a day labourer, was not in the hut as there wasnt enough room.        
	I was sleeping when a villager entered and tried to drag me out by my feet and molest me. When I raised the alarm, he fled. Later, he returned with a group of villagers and dragged my brother and me out. My children were sleeping inside, she said.        
	They stripped me and tied me to a lamp post. Then they cut off my hair. They tied my cousin to another post and cut his hair, too.        
	They remained tied to the lamp posts and it was only early in the morning that a farmer who heard their cries freed them.

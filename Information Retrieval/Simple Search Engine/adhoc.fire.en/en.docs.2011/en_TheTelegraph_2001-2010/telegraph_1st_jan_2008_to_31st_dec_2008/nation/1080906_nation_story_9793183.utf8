	Cuttack, Sept. 5: A hot meal served with empathy goes a long way, as some relief volunteers feeding families displaced by the riots in Kandhamal in the wake of the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati have found out.        
	After the riots, some hundred people from Kandhamal had taken refuge at a private building in Peyton Sahi.         
	We began the relief operations from Thursday, after the refugees started to arrive from Kandhamal. Some have not had a meal in more than a week, said Rajiv Das, a group member.        
	The group is called Peyton Sahi Relief Committee and it provides meals through efforts of the people of the locality. Dealing with the details involved in conducting relief work is difficult, but it is worth seeing the hope in peoples eyes, said Kamal Chandra Pradhan, the committee head, from a makeshift shelter home.        
	And Priyanka Nayak, a 16-year-old Class X dropout, would vouch for Pradhans conviction. She thanked the volunteers profusely, as he handed her 55-year-old father Suresh Nayak a hot plate of food. Suresh with his wife Catherina (40), three daughters and son are a part of some 15 families who fled from the riot-hit Kandhamal and found accommodation in Cuttack after spending days in the jungles.         
	Their Pirigada home was torched a day after the death of the seer on August 23. Hunger and thirst forced them out of the jungle after three nights. Afraid, the family felt that returning to their village or to a relief camp set up by the Orissa government at Nuagaon headquarters, was not an option and Cuttack, some 300km away, seemed to be the safest option.         
	Attackers had turned up at the camp, too. So, we did not feel secure there. Besides, food turned out to be a problem there, said Simon Nayak (48) and his wife Swarnalata Nayak (44).        
	While 93 people from the same village are lodged at the Cuttack private building, 30 others have taken refuge at their relatives houses in the city, said members of Peyton Sahi Relief Committee.

	Calcutta, Aug. 14 (PTI): Calcutta High Court today slammed the role of former Calcutta police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee in the Rizwanur Rehman death case and directed the CBI to chargesheet all seven accused, including three police officers and industrialist Ashok Todi.        
	Those to be chargesheeted are Ashok Todi, the father-in-law of Rizwanur, his brother Pradip Todi, cousin A. Saraogi, Pappu, a friend of Rizwanurs family.         
	Names also include the then deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Ajay Kumar, assistant commissioner of police Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das (of the anti-dowry unit).        
	A computer graphics teacher, Rizwanur, who was under tremendous pressure to separate from his wife, Priyanka Todi, ever since their wedding, was found dead along a railway track on September 21, 2007.        
	Taking strong exception to Mukherjees role, Justice Dipankar Datta observed that Prasun had not stated in a news conference, called by him, the fact that Todi had met him and that Rizwanur and Priyanka were called at city police headquarters at Lalbazar.         
	It was inferred that the police had favoured the Todis.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 8: A 62-year old businessman jumped in front of a train at Sovabazar Metro station at 3.55 this afternoon and was crushed to death.         
	Bimal Shankar Paul, who dealt in garments, left behind a suicide note saying he was depressed because he could not repay a loan, police said.         
	From the suicide note found in his pocket we learnt that Paul had borrowed money from a friend to invest in his business, said an official of Shyampukur police station. This man was now pressuring him to pay back the amount by selling his house.        
	The note names the friend. Well verify this and, if true, we may start a case of abetment of suicide against him, an official said.         
	Family sources said Paul owned three houses  at Baguiati, Lake Town and Bangur Avenue  but the police are yet to verify this.         
	Pauls son Rupal Shankar, who lived with his parents, came to the police station with another suicide note the businessman had given his grandson before leaving their Baguiati home at 1pm. Paul gave the note to his grandson and asked the child, aged six or seven, to hand it over to Rupal if he did not return, a police official said. This note repeated what the first said.

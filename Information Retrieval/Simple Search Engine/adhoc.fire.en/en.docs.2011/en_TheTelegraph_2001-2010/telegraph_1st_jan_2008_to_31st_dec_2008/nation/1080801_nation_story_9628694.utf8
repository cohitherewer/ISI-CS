	Bhubaneswar, July 31: When 19-year-old John Prabhanjan Garland is asked to speak in Oriya, he utters two words  bhata and bhai (rice and brother).         
	His mother Karo is quick to his rescue and helps him speak a few more. He can count up to five in Oriya, she assures.         
	Not that anyone would blame John. When he left India in 2000, he was just Bhanja, an 11-year-old orphan staying at a Cuttack-based institution, Vasundhara.         
	Karo and Wayne Garland, as a part of an inter-country adoption process, took the 11-year-old Bhanja as their own. The couple, residents of Kingston, USA, soon left with Bhanja and eight years later, the mother returned with Bhanja  now called John.         
	The Garlands, both chemical engineers, have two more adopted children  two daughters  one from Korea and another from South Mexico.         
	John is now a senior student in a local high school. I drop mom to office, he says, proudly showing off his duty as the eldest child. I can speak a little Oriya, but I can understand better, he says with a thick accent.        
	The mother and son duo reached Orissa on July 26 and have been staying at the Vasundhara orphanage.         
	We are so proud to have him. He is a good student and would hopefully get into a good college. We plan to return to the USA by August 5, but I would love to see a little more of Orissa, Karo said. In the meanwhile, the mother-son took a trip to the 11th century Lingaraja Temple before they left for Vasundhara.         
	Society, media and government have always looked upon the issue of adoption, particularly inter-country adoption, with suspicion. Such visits obviously make us feel a little more positive, said Sanjukta Mohanty, the secretary of State Council for Childs Welfare. The Garlands also visited the welfare office as a part of protocol. In 2007, there were 24 instances of inter-country adoptions in Orissa.         
	In Orissa there are two agencies for inter-country adoption. One is Voluntary Co-ordinating Agency that co-ordinates all adoption-related activities and identifies and promotes adoption.         
	The other is State Council for Child Welfare that scrutinises applications.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bank to pay for card refusal
                                                                                                            Bank to pay for card refusal
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 8 (PTI): The Delhi Consumer Commission today imposed a Rs 10-lakh fine on ICICI Bank for refusing a lawyer a credit card for her negative-profile profession.        
	The bank denied the charge that it was not giving credit cards to lawyers and said it would appeal against the order before an appropriate forum.        
	The commission asked the bank to deposit Rs 10 lakh in the state consumer welfare fund and pay Rs 50,000 as compensation to the complainant.        
	The commission, presided over by Justice J.D. Kapoor, also restrained all other financial institutions from rejecting consumer applications on the ground that their occupation fell under a negative profile.        
	Rapping ICICI for not following the guidelines laid down by the Reserve Bank of India on financial credit, the commission said the lender could not be allowed to defame and demean any profession in general and the legal fraternity in particular.        
	Following the order, an ICICI spokesperson said in a statement that the bank had refuted the charge that it was not giving credit cards to lawyers and submitted a list of lawyers holding its credit cards.

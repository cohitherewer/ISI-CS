          G.S. MUDUR                      Waste power                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: A chemical process developed by US scientists to turn waste material from plants into gasoline or diesel has bolstered hopes for an alternate source of fossil fuels.         
	A research team led by chemical engineer James Dumesic at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has shown that sugar from a non-edible plant material called ligno-cellulose can be converted into gasoline, diesel, or even jet fuel.        
	There are large amounts of ligno-cellulose that are (currently) not being used effectively, Dumesic said.         
	Most research as well as commercial projects have been aimed at turning plant material into ethanol or other biofuels. Attempts to expand the role of ethanol and biofuels have triggered a debate in some countries over the diversion of land from food crop cultivation to fuel crop cultivation.         
	The new two-stage process uses only plant wastes such as rice straw or husk, leaves or stalks. A description of the process will appear in the journal Science on Friday. A metal catalyst first breaks down the non-edible plant sugars into alcohol and other compounds. In the second step, these midway chemicals are processed to create gasoline or diesel.         
	If this is economically viable, it would be exciting, said Ramkrishna Sen, assistant professor of biotechnology at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Plants could then become an alternate source of crude oil, said Sen, who is involved in research on the production of ethanol and biofuels.         
	The Wisconsin scientists have said their catalytic approach is sufficiently simple to be achieved through low capital costs, and yet flexible enough to be employed to produce a variety of liquid fuel components.        
	Falling petroleum reserves have fuelled research efforts to seek new sources of fuels, including fossil fuels.         
	Most research has been aimed at conversion of plant material into ethanol or biodiesel, but the concept of direct conversion to fossil fuel has been in existence for some time. No one had shown until now how this can be done in an economically viable way.         
	But scientists caution that while sugars from plant waste could be turned into fossil fuels, the process wont help tackle global warming.         
	Fossil fuels from plant waste are likely to emit carbon dioxide just as fossil fuels from petroleum reserves.

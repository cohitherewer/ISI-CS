          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Jyoti Basu in AMRI Hospitals. Picture by Aranya Sen    Calcutta, Sept. 7: Former chief minister Jyoti Basu was admitted to a private hospital today with a blood clot in the brain caused by a fall at home on Friday night.        
	He is fully conscious, stable and is having normal nutrition. He is presently kept under observation, a medical bulletin issued by AMRI Hospitals, near Dhakuria Bridge, said. A 10-member medical board, headed by neurosurgeon R.N. Bhattacharya, has been set up.        
	There is a blood clot on the left side of the brain surface. But there is no plan for immediate surgery, said a doctor treating him. He takes blood-thinning medicines, so it is not possible to perform a surgery immediately. Those medicines have been stopped in case there is need for surgery.        
	Hospital officials said a number of pathological tests were done and the results were normal. More tests will be done tomorrow and the medical board will once again review the progress on Tuesday, the bulletin said.         
	Basu, 95, was admitted to the hospital at 11.35am and is in a special suite on the second floor of the hospitals new building. Doctors said he was likely to be kept under observation for a week.         
	On Friday night, the CPM leader had bumped against a bathroom wall while trying to locate a light switch. A CT scan revealed a blood clot.         
	Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra visited Basu in hospital. He is perfectly all right and talking normally, Mishra said.

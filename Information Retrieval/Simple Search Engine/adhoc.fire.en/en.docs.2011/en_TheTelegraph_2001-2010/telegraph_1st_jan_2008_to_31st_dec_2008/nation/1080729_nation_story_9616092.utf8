          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The Supreme Court today vetted a bar council proposal to relax a half-century-old rule to allow them to furnish limited information about themselves on the Net.         
	Till now, Rule 36 of Chapter IV of the Bar Council of India Rules had strictly prohibited any form of direct or indirect advertising by lawyers.         
	The rule said advertising in any form by lawyers would amount to professional misconduct and the erring member could be disqualified from praticising if caught.         
	Under the rule, lawyers are not allowed to print business cards, give interviews and newspaper comments, have directory listings and publish photographs in connection with cases they are handling. Even nameplates have to be of a reasonable size.         
	Most of these rules have, however, never been enforced. As a result, huge boards advertising the services of a lawyer are not uncommon. Business cards are also the norm among the legal fraternity.         
	In March this year, the bar council amended the rules to allow lawyers to upload limited information about them, including their area of practice and their contact details.         
	The councils move was first cleared by the Chief Justice. The apex court finally vetted it on Monday.

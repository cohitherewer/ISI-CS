	Bhubaneswar, March 16: The sleepy village of Ijurpa near Lanjigarh on the foothills of Niyamgiri hills is abuzz with activities for the second time this month.         
	On March 7, hundreds of Dangaria Kandha, a primitive tribe that live on the Niyamgiri hills, had congregated to greet AICC leader Rahul Gandhi.         
	This time the tribals have assembled to conduct a mass ceremony to appease Niyam Raja, a name they use for the Niyamgiri hills that has been disturbed by mining.         
	Dangaria Kandha and other tribals from 300-odd villages of Kalahandi and Rayagada have been offering puja to Niyam Raja and Dharani Penu (Mother Earth) since yesterday.         
	Residents, accompanied by janis (priests) and bhejens (priestesses) have been offering rice, chickens, goats, fruits and water to a stone and a wooden pillar that symbolises Niyam Raja and Dharani Penu, respectively.         
	The ritual offering has been followed by all-night dancing to the beats of drums and dhampa, a traditional instrument.         
	Niyam Raja has been angry, as he has been disturbed by the industrial activities (1MT alumina refinery is being set up by Vedanta Alumina in Lanjigarh), said Jilu Majhi, a priest. I have been dreaming of Niyam Raja. He told me that he was irritated and asked us to conduct a ceremony to calm him down, added Gata Majhi, a priestess.         
	Priests and black magicians from 30 villages had sat together recently and fixed March 15-16 as the auspicious dates, conceded Natha Majhi, a priest.         
	The two-day ceremony has a second purpose. Its being held to draw the worlds attention to the threat to tribal culture, beliefs and a place of worship if Vedanta is allowed to start the refinery there.         
	Just as it is unthinkable of shifting Jagannath Temple, sacred sites of Indias indigenous people cannot be moved or replaced. Niyamgiri is an integral part of Kandha religion, said a social activist, who expresses solidarity with the struggle of Dangaria Kandhas to save their sacred hills.         
	Niyamgiri, spread over 670-hectares, is one of Orissas last core areas of unspoilt forest. With a religion rooted in nature, Dangaria Kandhas understand that the mountain is the source of their life.         
	For us its a matter of life or death. Niyam Raja is under threat and with him our land, livelihood and way of life is also under threat, said Phulme Majhi, a tribal.         
	Legal experts feel that the industrial and mining activities in Niyamgiri will undermine the constitutional rights of Dangaria Kandha. They have a constitutional right to territorial integrity, decide on their own path of development and the right to religious practices and beliefs, stressed Prashant Bhushan, an advocate in the Supreme Court and a campaigner for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Review.        
	If mining is permitted on the hills, it will result in irreparable loss to livelihood, culture and religion of Dangaria Kandha, which has a population of 7,952 only, said Siddharth Nayak.        
	Nayak is a lawyer and convenor of Kalahandi Sachetan Nagaraika Manch that had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the tribals.

	New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): A married man who has sex with a woman after leading her believe he is single or on the promise of marriage is guilty of rape, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	Since he was already married, the subsequent marriage, if any, has no sanctity in law and is void ab initio (illegal from inception), it said.        
	The apex court was rejecting the argument of convict Bhupinder Singh that since the victim, Manjit Kaur, had consented to sex with him despite knowing he was married, Section 376 (rape) of the IPC would not apply in his case.        
	A sessions court in Chandigarh had convicted and sentenced Bhupinder to seven years rigorous imprisonment and fined him Rs 10,000 on charges of fathering Manjits child in spite of already being married and having children.        
	Manjit wed Bhupinder, an employee of the State Bank of Patiala, because she believed he was unmarried. Later, however, she came to know about his earlier wife and children.        
	Bhupinder denied having married Manjit, but the sessions court sentenced him on the basis of documents.         
	Bhupinder then appealed in Punjab and Haryana High Court which upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to three years on the ground that Manjit had consented to sex knowing that Bhupinder was married. He then filed an appeal in the apex court.

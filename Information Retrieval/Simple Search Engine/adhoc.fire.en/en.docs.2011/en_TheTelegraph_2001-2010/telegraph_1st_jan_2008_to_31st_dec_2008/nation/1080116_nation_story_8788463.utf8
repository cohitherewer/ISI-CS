     CHARU SUDAN KASTURI
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The IITs today refused to provide complete data on their controversial 2006 admissions under the Right to Information Act, citing an argument that the countrys transparency watchdog has repeatedly called invalid.
    
	The Central Information Commission (CIC) is likely to call a special hearing where the Indian Institutes of Technology may face embarrassing questions and a possible fine, sources said.
    
	On August 6, 2007, The Telegraph had reported the wide mismatch between the highest possible cutoffs calculated using the IITs own formula and the ones actually used in the 2006 Joint Entrance Examination.
    
	The parents of that years applicants had used the act to obtain the formula and had noticed the discrepancy. Statisticians had confirmed the findings for this newspaper.
    
	However, at Calcutta High Court, which some parents approached, the IITs presented a formula different from the one they had disclosed under the act. This formula, too, does not entail the cutoffs used in 2006, the statisticians confirmed.
    
	When the parents asked the IITs to explain the sudden change in formula, the institutes told the CIC they could not reveal any more information since the matter was in court. The new statement came in response to a non-compliance notice from the commission.
    
	The CIC had clarified in 2006 that public authorities could not withhold information using this argument.
    
	Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act says: Information which cannot be denied to Parliament or a state legislature shall not be denied to any person.
    
	A sub judice matter cannot be revealed before legislatures; but the CIC has repeatedly clarified that the RTI Act doesnt lay down the converse. So, information that cannot be disclosed to legislatures is not exempt from disclosure under the act.

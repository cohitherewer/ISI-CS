          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 31: Inflation at an all-time high of nearly 7 per cent? Take heart, says the Congress, because India is better off than China where inflation was 8.7 per cent this February  its highest in more than a decade.         
	The Congresss choice of China as a counterpoint was apparently its way of showing up the CPM which served a 15-day ultimatum from its Coimbatore convention telling the Centre to scale down prices or face the music.        
	Not only is China worse off than India, according to Congress spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily, it is also responsible for Indias price hike in a roundabout way.        
	Moily told a news conference today that the rise in steel and cement rates was one of the factors that sent the price index soaring, and China was to blame for it. The market was tense for the past year because of the hectic construction activity for the Beijing Olympics, the Congress leader said.        
	He maintained this was a temporary phenomenon and the market would stabilise within six months after the infrastructure for the games was in place. But we are not going to wait for the tension to ease because the government will make cement and steel available at controlled prices, he added.        
	That was not the only context for dragging China in.        
	The country figured when Moily quoted a study by a UK consultant, Bidwells Agribusiness, that said water shortage and pressure on agricultural land had put sustained pressure on prices and the situation could worsen.        
	Moily said that in China, eight million hectares of land under cultivation had vanished within a decade. Globally, arable land has stagnated at 1.5 billion hectares and in India, it has levelled off at 183 million hectares. With the global population growing at 1.14 per cent every year, especially with a higher proportion of growth coming from the third world, this stagnation is a cause for worry, he added.        
	As the cabinet committee on prices put its head together to straighten things out under pressure from the Congress and its allies, Moily tried to make the best of a bad situation. He spoke of the measures the Centre had taken so far and called inflation a global phenomenon.        
	Moily pointed out that the government had cut import duties on edible oils and tried to deter exports by raising the minimum export price for non-basmati varieties, withdrawing export incentives on at least 40 items, including steel, cement and non-basmati rice, and suspending the tax refund scheme offered to exporters.        
	While Moily stressed the government should exclude more items from forward-trading and streamline the public distribution system, he did not ask for a ban on rice export.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                      
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The United Progressive Alliance faces a near-impossible race to fulfil several key promises on education before the Lok Sabha elections, the governments analysis of its performance for the Congresss 2009 poll manifesto suggests.        
	The assessment of achievements in education has accepted that many assurances made by the Centre since 2004 are stuck in the bureaucratic pipeline.        
	Some of the unkept promises may now be transformed into commitments in the party manifesto, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The Other Backward Classes quota in higher education tops the list of achievements drawn up by the human resource development (HRD) ministry in response to a party request for performance details.        
	But in the section on commitments for the next five years, the ministry has largely recycled old, unkept promises, sources said.        
	The Right to Education (RTE) Bill, promised in the common minimum programme four-and-a-half years ago, has been cleared by the cabinet and is to be tabled in the Parliament session starting next week.         
	But the government is worried that the bill, which will allow enforcement of a 2001 constitutional amendment making primary education a fundamental right, may not be passed in the current Lok Sabha.        
	Plans to universalise secondary education under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) are yet to be cleared.        
	We are desperately pushing to ensure that at least the RTE and the RMSA are implemented before the Lok Sabha polls, a senior official said.        
	The RMSA will not need Parliament sanction but several other promises  such as 16 world-class universities and regulatory laws for private and foreign universities  will.        
	Similarly, amendments are needed to the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) Act for the degrees of the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER)  whose launch is on the achievement list  to be recognised and for the 10 new promised NITs to be started.        
	Legislation is needed also to start the 20 new promised Indian Institutes of Information Technology.        
	None of these bills is to be tabled in the upcoming Parliament session, which may be the last before the general election.        
	Technically, some of these promises can be introduced through ordinances and later ratified by Parliament. But we cannot bring half-a-dozen ordinances, an official said.        
	The Congress request for the performance analysis came in the form of a letter from party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on December 1.         
	The letter asked education minister Arjun Singh to provide me... the most important points relating to our achievements in your ministry over the last five years and our commitments over the next five years.        
	It specified that these were needed for inclusion in the draft manifesto of the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections. Aiyar is on the partys manifesto drafting panel, and he sent the letter in his capacity as a party MP and not as a minister.        
	Among the achievements, the HRD ministry has listed the components of its higher education expansion plan which have been implemented, such as the six new Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management in Shillong that opened this year.        
	Each state in the Northeast today has a central university. A centrally funded scholarship scheme for economically weaker students is listed, as are a slew of measures taken in minority education.

	Bhubaneswar, April 10: Two persons were today arrested and forwarded to court for gouging out the eyes of a 55-year-old man in Pipili.        
	Puri superintendent of police Asit Panigrahi said raids have been intensified across the district to apprehend the other accused, said the police superintendent.         
	Meanwhile, the victim is said to be in a stable condition. Bharat Swain (55) of Sunamuhin village has been shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital.        
	The incident was an outcome of a rivalry between two families of a village, said the police.         
	The leader of the attackers was allegedly involved in a land dispute with the victim.        
	According to the FIR, Swain was returning home in the night when Dillu Pradhan and gang pounced on him and gouged out both his eyes.         
	They escaped after terrorising passers-by by exploding bombs. Some of the villagers, who reached the spot, rushed a profusely bleeding Swain to Pipili primary health centre. He was then rushed to SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack.        
	There were 14 men in the attack group and Swain was returning home from a folk theatre event, the Puri SP said.         
	The police officer said the families of Swain and Pradhan were at loggerheads for sometime over a piece of land in the village. Pradhans uncle was allegedly killed over the dispute in 1988.         
	Both the families have had a number of clashes in the past, the police said.

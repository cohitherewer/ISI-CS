	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Jairam Ramesh is back in Rahul Gandhis charmed circle from a month in exile, but with a small demotion.
    
	The junior commerce and industries minister is now just a member of the group to look into future challenges and not its convener.
    
	Rahul is a member of the group of 13, headed by M. Veerappa Moily, which also includes Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and Digvijay Singh.
    
	When the group was formed in September 2004, Jairam was appointed its convener partly because of his perceived closeness to the Gandhis. His skill in straddling the jhola-cola ideological space and dressing up economic reforms with a social conscience also helped.
    
	Three months later, Jairam had been dropped from the group for exceeding his brief by calling a meeting without Sonia Gandhis nod. He was also said to have circulated among the members a note containing personal information about Rahul that was not to be shared.
    
	Both moves were considered sacrilege. In the Congress, all high-level meetings need the party presidents sanction, and the Gandhis insist on privacy and the security of information about them.
    
	Jairam was not invited to the two meetings the committee had since September. But he was back today. I was told to attend the meeting and I went, Jairam said and declined to say more.
    
	Moily said the committee was reconstituted for Jairams re-induction. He is back as a member. There will be no convener.
    
	There was speculation that Jairams exit was related to problems he had had with Moily. Both are from Karnataka and are said to disagree on most political and economic issues. But Moily denied this.

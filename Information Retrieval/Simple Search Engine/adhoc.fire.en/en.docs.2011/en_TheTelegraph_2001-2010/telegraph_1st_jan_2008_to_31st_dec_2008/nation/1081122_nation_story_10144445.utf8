          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 21: Be it its alliance with Shiv Sena or other political compulsions at the national level, the BJP stayed relatively mute on Raj Thackeray-led MNS-sponsored assault on Bihar people in Maharashtra.        
	The saffron party MPs from Bihar even did not join the JD-U MPs in quitting their Lok Sabha seats demanding action on fissiparous forces in assaulting the people from Bihar and other parts of the heartland in Maharashtra.        
	But almost all the top BJP leaders from Bihar have been camping in Delhi to woo the Bihar voters to vote for its candidates in the coming Assembly polls in the NCR. We all are camping in Delhi to campaign among Bihar voters here, said state BJP chief Radhamohan Singh.        
	Sources in the party said that at least 25,000 Bihar voters are there in Burari, Badli, Palam, Dwarka, Patparganj, Vikaspuri, Laxmi Nagar and Tilak Nagar areas of the Delhi. The vote of 25,000 Bihar people is enough to tilt the electoral balance, said a senior BJP leader, adding: The party has pressed into service the Bihar leaders in 12 Assembly constituencies.        
	Besides Radhamohan, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, ministers Giriraj Singh and Prem Kumar are also in Delhi.

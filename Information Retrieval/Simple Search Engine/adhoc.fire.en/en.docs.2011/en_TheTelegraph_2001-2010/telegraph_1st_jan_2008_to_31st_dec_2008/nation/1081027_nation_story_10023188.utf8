          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 26: Nearly 15 months after admitting a PIL seeking a ban on feeding pro-biotic food supplement to infants for research purposes, the high court has refused to interfere in the matter, as it lacks expertise to resolve the controversy.         
	The court has further skirted expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, but referred the PIL to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).        
	The government has been embroiled in the controversy for allowing a curd-like pro-biotic food supplement to be fed to newborn at Sundergarh and Khurda under an American agencys research programme. Under the programme, infants of 283 villages in Sundergarh and 284 villages in Khurda were to be fed the pro-biotic food supplement.        
	A section of the states paediatricians expressed reservations regarding the new food on the ground that it would undermine the confidence of lactating mothers.         
	The Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP), a Cuttack-based legal support advocacy outfit, had filed a PIL in July 2007. Bikash Dash, CLAPs executive president, alleged that the supplement also violates the Infant Milk Substitute and Infant Foods Supply Act, 2003.        
	However, the court was apparently left in a quandary when counter affidavits revealed that researcher was administering pro-biotic to newborn suffering from sepsis, but there was no list of children who have been administered pro-biotic food or its result.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 7: Apeejay Shipping, Indias largest private shipping company, and Bharati Shipyard Limited, one of the leading private shipyards, would set up a ship-building project at Dhamra in Orissa.        
	Chairman of Apeejay Surendra Group Karan Paul and managing director of Bharati Shipyard Limited Vijay Kumar met chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today to pursue the proposal.         
	Land acquisition and issues related project clearance were discussed in the meet, sources in the chief ministers office said. During discussions, Naveen emphasised on the need for expediting the project as it promised a strong employment potential.        
	According to the proposal presented by the two companies, the first phase of the ship-building project is expected to start by January, 2009, with an estimated cost of Rs 900 crore and would be commissioned by 2011. The projects second and third phase would be complete by 2012 and 2013, respectively.        
	Around 7,000 persons would get direct employment in the ship plant that would generate indirect employment opportunity for another 40,000 persons. The state exchequer is expected to receive a revenue of Rs 20 crore per annum from the project, official sources said.        
	The project would be situated near the upcoming all-weather port at Dhamra in Bhadrak. Around 1,050 acres along the coast would be required for the project.        
	Officials said the Dhamra area would be an ideal location for the proposed project since an all-weather port was coming up nearby. There would hardly be any hassle in procuring raw material since steel plants were coming up in the state.         
	Skilled labour force would also be available in plenty in the state, officials hoped.         
	On October 11, 2007, a proposal to set up the plant at Chardiha on Dhamra mouth, off the Bay of Bengal, was given by APJ Group chairman Paul during his meeting with the chief minister.         
	The High Level Clearance Authority headed by chief minister cleared the proposal on June 3, 2008.        
	In this regard, a memorandum of understanding would be signed soon and the construction work would begin thereafter.         
	Similarly, an oil rig manufacturing and repair plant would be set up in the state at an estimated cost of Rs 900 crore by Oceanic Shipyard Limited.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ackerman at the Prime Ministers residence. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: The Prime Minister today met influential US Congressman Gary Ackerman but gave him no timetable for the conclusion of the IAEA safeguards agreement, sources said.        
	Manmohan Singh and Ackerman, who had yesterday nudged the Centre to act fast, discussed the nuclear deal as well as broader Indo-US ties. Singh told the US congressional delegation leader about the political process that has begun to ensure the deals survival, the sources said.        
	Ackerman also brought up Irans nuclear ambitions, to which Singh reaffirmed Delhis commitment to the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline as well as Delhis other ties with Tehran, the sources added.        
	On Wednesday, the Prime Ministers Office had issued a statement saying no outside influence or pressure could force India to deviate from its time-honoured and civilisational ties with Iran.        
	Ackerman had yesterday said Americas presidential polls in November would make it difficult for the US Congress to endorse the deal after September. His remarks came after he met foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and Shyam Saran, the Prime Ministers special envoy on the deal.        
	Asked about Ackermans comments that time was running out for the deal, Menon today told reporters he would not like to get into the subject of a timeframe. We will go ahead with it (the nuclear deal) as soon as we can. Once we take a decision to approach the IAEA, we will let you know.        
	Menon said the Prime Minister, during his three-day Japan trip, would meet US President George W. Bush on the sidelines of the G8 summit on July 9.         
	He added that the US was committed to getting India an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group for nuclear commerce under the 2005 civil nuclear co-operation pact.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UK gets state-funded Hindu school 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     UK gets state-funded Hindu school 
          AMIT ROY                           A painting on the Hindu schools literature reflects its philosophy                                  
	London, Sept. 17: The UKs first state-funded Hindu school opened for the new term on Monday with its initial batch of 30 children, a puja and a solemn promise not to turn them into insular human beings in a multicultural society.        
	The irony is that at a time when parents in India still want their sons and daughters to proceed to the UK for higher studies, a section of the orthodox Gujarati community in Britain has managed to get 10 million from the government to offer what it hopes will be an antidote to a secular education.         
	The Krishna-Avanti Primary School began classes in temporary quarters in Edgware, north-west London, on Monday with yoga, meditation, Sanskrit and Hindu teachings on the menu alongside the national syllabus.        
	The school will be run by the I-Foundation, a Hindu charity linked to Iskcon (the International Society for Krishna Consciousness).        
	Next year, the pupils will move to a building in nearby Harrow, which contains a significant proportion of the UKs estimated one million Hindus. By 2014, the school expects to have 236 pupils, including nursery children.        
	The new building will have a meditation garden, an amphitheatre for Santiniketan-style outdoor lessons and an eco-friendly grass roof.        
	The schools principal, Naina Parmar, called the opening a huge step forward for Britains one million Hindus.        
	I want our school to be a haven of peace, she said. Hinduism is a very inclusive faith, which naturally promotes a calm, caring and co-operative learning environment. This will be reflected not only in the curriculum but also in the schools ethos and environment.        
	Hindu groups argued that if the Muslims were given money to set up their schools and Catholics and Jews had their own educational institutions, too, it was not fair to deny similar funding to Hindus.         
	There are 4,646 Church of England and 2,041 Roman Catholic schools in the UK, according to one report. There are also 37 Jewish, two Sikh and nine Muslim schools, some in the process of receiving approval.        
	Terry Sanderson, the president of the National Secular Society, which campaigns against faith schools, admitted: If one religion is allowed to run schools, then it is extremely difficult to refuse the right to others. The latest studies show quite clearly that children from different cultures need to go to school together from an early age if the barriers of suspicion and prejudice are ever to be broken down.        
	Amartya Sen, the economist, has also come down against faith schools in Britain, though he agreed that long-established Christian institutions were less objectionable.         
	Hindu children are certainly at the top of the academic tree in Britain  only the Chinese do slightly better. But Hindu children have performed relatively poorly at one other Hindu school, a fee-paying establishment in London.        
	Lunch at the Krishna-Avanti Primary School will be strictly vegetarian. At one time, the governors had wanted to restrict admission to children from vegetarian backgrounds, arguing only non-meat eaters qualified as proper Hindus, but this rule was dropped after an outcry.         
	Accord, a new coalition of religious and non-religious groups and individuals pressing for reform of the faith schools policy, said it had reservations about the opening of the school.        
	Accord chairman Rabbi Jonathan Romain said: It is vital for the good of both the children and wider society that the Krishna-Avanti teaches appreciation of all traditions, does not opt out of local religious education syllabus, does not discriminate against employing non-Hindu staff, nor bar children of other faiths from having the right to attend.        
	However, a Harrow councillor, Anjana Patel, defended the school. It will definitely not segregate the Hindu community. The Hindu community has been one of those communities who integrated well, whichever country theyve been to.        
	 She said: Harrow is one of the most culturally diverse boroughs, with Hindus forming the second largest religious group. It is, therefore, right that parents of every faith should be given equal opportunity with respect to the education of their children.

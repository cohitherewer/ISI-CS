	New Delhi, July 9: In the four-and-a-half years that the UPA has been in power, Uttar Pradesh has counted for little in Delhi despite the 80 MPs it sent to the Lok Sabha and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and heir apparent Rahul being elected from the state.        
	A section of the ruling establishment, uncomfortable with the politics of Mandal and the religious right, has never stopped crowing about how, under the UPA, the progressive southern and western (Maharashtra) states called the shots while the Bimaru states were rightly kept out of the policy structures. Unlike in the Vajpayee regime when Bimaru  Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh  held the key.        
	The helplessness of the Samajwadi Party, which could not get its little toe in the corridors of power despite having 39 MPs, was a sight the Congress feasted on.        
	The crisis resulting from the Left-UPA split over the Indo-US nuclear deal has transformed the geographical balance of power: Uttar Pradesh has gained its pre-eminence in Delhi.        
	As the political dynamics plays itself out and a denouement is awaited, the movers and shakers are not the Congress or the BJP but the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The deal has redrawn the battlelines in Uttar Pradesh as the Samajwadis and Mayavati are out to claim their share of the political turf and more.        
	Mayavati was the first off the mark. Barely did Mulayam Singh Yadav hint that he was ready to make up with the Congress than the BSP leader hit him where it hurt the most: his Muslim following.        
	Unlike the CPM that distanced itself from M.K. Pandhes warning that Mulayam might pay heavily for his support with his Muslim votes, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister was upfront. She equated the deal with the interests of Muslims and convened a meeting of Lucknows top clerics to reinforce her point.        
	True to her grain, Mayavati did not confine herself to rhetoric. The clerics gave a charter of demands  legal, social and economic. She delivered on two of them and promised time-bound action on the rest. Any government that is responsive to our problems must be welcomed, said the Naib Imam of Lucknows Aishbagh mosque, Maulana Khalid Rasheed.        
	Sources in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said it was still early to say if Mayavatis moves would translate into votes because the Muslims were viewing another possible development with interest: the Congress-Samajwadi-Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) alliance.        
	If the Samajwadi Partys strategy to redeem its support for the deal with a certificate from A.P.J. Abdul Kalam cut little ice with the Muslims, they refused to swallow the deal is anti-Islamic formulation unquestioningly.        
	By the time elections come, Bush (George W. Bush) will be out of the picture and that might blunt the anti-deal campaign because our basic problem is with Bush and not so much the deal, a law board member said.        
	The Samajwadi Partys basic objective in tying up with the Congress is to regroup the Muslim votes. According to data compiled by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Mayavati grabbed her largest share of the Muslim votes (17 per cent) in the 2007 state elections.        
	Mulayam was still the biggest recipient but he lost 2 per cent since 2004 (45 per cent as against 47). The Congresss share remained stagnant at 14 per cent. The Samajwadi-Congress combined support will be 59 per cent if the alliance works credibly and that could impact their overall seat tally.        
	Mulayam is interested for another reason: he believes it is the only way to contain the upper castes from gravitating in bigger numbers towards the BSP than they did in 2007. He has done his sums on how this combination could even disturb Mayavatis Brahmin following by creating a new caste coalition of the upper castes-backward castes-Muslims with the RLDs Jats to boot.        
	Given the historical antipathy the upper castes have for the intermediate land-owning groupings such as the Yadavs and the Jats and their relative comfort level with the Dalits, Mulayams equation may not work on the ground.

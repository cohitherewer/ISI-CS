          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, May 28: Former Samajwadi Party minister Naresh Agarwal joined the BSP along with his son today, four days after quitting his old party.        
	Uttar Pradesh Chief minister Mayavati, who has succeeded in luring away many leaders from rival parties, welcomed Agarwal by making him a general secretary and immediately declared him the BSP candidate from Farrukhabad in the Lok Sabha elections due next year.        
	His son Nitin will be fielded from the Hardoi Assembly seat, vacant since his father resigned as an MLA from there.         
	Agarwal, who has changed loyalties several times, said he had at last found a home in the BSP.         
	I will not go anywhere else. Even my son wont go anywhere. We will work hard for the BSP, said Agarwal.        
	BSP chief Mayavati said Agarwals entry would bring together Vaishya caste members and raise their representation in the party.

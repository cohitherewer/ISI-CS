          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Sept. 19: A 150-year-old cathedral was set ablaze in Jabalpur last night by two unidentified men in yet another attack on a Christian place of worship in a BJP-ruled state.        
	The altar and many statues at the St Peter and St Paul Cathedral in the cantonment area of the town were burnt in the fire, police said. The church was closed at the time.        
	The incident, which comes two weeks after the burning of churches in Ratlam and Indore, angered Christian leaders who urged chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to order a judicial inquiry and arrest those involved. Missionary schools and colleges were closed in protest.        
	Chauhan, in Jabalpur today as part of his Jan Ashirwad Yatra to hardsell the BJP governments achievements ahead of the Assembly polls this year, called the incident unfortunate but didnt promise a probe.         
	Madhya Pradesh Isai Mahasangh spokesperson Father Anand Muttungal accused a local saffron outfit, Dharma Raksha Sena, of being responsible for the torching.        
	Father Muttungal claimed that 110 cases of violence against Christians had occurred in Madhya Pradesh since December 2003, when the BJP came to power.

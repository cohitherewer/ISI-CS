The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strike cloud over IITs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Strike cloud over IITs
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Non-teaching staff from all the IITs have threatened a strike after the Centre withdrew a panel set up to offer them salaries higher than other central government employees.        
	On September 2, the human resource development ministry had issued a notice to the panel members asking them to wind up work, senior government officials said today.        
	There are over 12,000 non-teaching employees at the seven older Indian Institutes of Technology. A strike by them would cripple classes and research, faculty members said.        
	The IIT strike threat comes amid a delay in a pay hike being finalised for teachers across Indias universities. The Centre is now battling growing concern among teachers ahead of a slew of elections.        
	Sources said representatives of IIT staff associations arrived in Delhi today and met some junior officials at the HRD ministry. They are expected to meet higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal tomorrow, when they may officially issue the strike threat.        
	The non-teaching staff at the IITs are more qualified than their counterparts in other central government offices. We help churn out the most employable students in the country. We demand to be paid more, D.D. Karmakar, the representative from IIT Kharagpur, said.        
	For instance, a mechanic in any other central government office only requires an Industrial Training Institute certificate whereas a mechanic at an IIT must hold an engineering diploma.        
	Similarly, technical assistants in other central offices require a diploma in engineering but at the IITs, they need an engineering degree.        
	We work on a 24-hour campus, and are called on to perform our duties well beyond the nine-to-five schedule of other central government employees, Karmakar said.        
	The demand for better pay than other central employees is not new. It was accepted in February this year at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the IIT Council, the institutes highest decision-making body, the sources said.        
	The pay panel was set up before fears of an inadequate budget, especially because of the inflation, led to its withdrawal, HRD ministry sources said.        
	We plan to reconsider about the panel once the government recovers financially, a senior ministry official said.        
	IIT faculty members said the institutes might be forced to cancel classes if the non-teaching staff go on strike.        
	They are the backbone of the institutes and play a critical, though often unrecognised, role in their day-to-day functioning. It is hard to imagine holding regular classes and laboratories without them, a physics professor at IIT Delhi said.

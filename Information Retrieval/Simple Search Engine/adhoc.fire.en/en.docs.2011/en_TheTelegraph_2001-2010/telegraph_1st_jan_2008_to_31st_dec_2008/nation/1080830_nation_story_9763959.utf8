	Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, Aug. 29: Another person was charred to death in the Chakapada area of trouble-torn Khandhamal district even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik claimed that normalcy is returning fast.        
	The deceased, Abhimanyu Nayak, was trapped inside one of the few houses that were set ablaze by an angry mob this morning.        
	The situation is fully under control in the rest of the state, Naveen said while replying to the debate on a no-trust motion in the Assembly this evening. However, sporadic incidents of violence were reported from several areas in Khandhamal. A prayer house was allegedly burnt in Raikia while there were clashes in Tikabali and Saranga. In Phulbani, a group of people reached the district collectors office demanding security.         
	Curfew was relaxed for 10 hours, from 8am, in Khandhamal district today. People, who had fled to the nearby forests following the violence, have also started returning with camps being set up for them at several places.         
	Orissa High Court today issued notices to both the Union and state governments to clarify their stands on the necessity of a CBI probe into the murders of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and his four associates on August 23.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice B.N. Mohapatra issued the notices, returnable within four weeks after a preliminary hearing on a petition filed by the Utkal Christian Council.        
	The council moved the NHRC yesterday seeking its intervention in the investigation into atrocities on women and children during the communal clashes across the state. Orphanages were attacked and children fled to forests to save their lives and now they are deprived of food, shelter and clothes, said council president Samson Das.        
	Naveen govt safe        
	The no-confidence motion moved by the Opposition alleging that the BJD-BJP government had failed on all fronts was lost by voice vote after a marathon debate. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the government had achieved a turnaround in the last eight years. Earlier moving the motion, leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik said even though the government commands a majority in the House, the coalition is not in good health.

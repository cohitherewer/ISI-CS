	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Left and the Telugu Desam Party are trying to persuade BSP president Mayavati to budge from her no pre-poll alliance stand, sources said.        
	The parties are looking at a non-BJP, non-Congress alternative in the next Lok Sabha elections. Mayavati has been against pre-poll alliances. We know that, but we will still make efforts to ensure that the plans for a non-Congress, non-BJP alternative are not affected, a Left leader said.         
	Desam chief Chandrababu Naidu, who has held meetings with Left leaders Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan, had phoned BSP leader Satish Mishra for an appointment with Mayavati. They are expected to meet soon.

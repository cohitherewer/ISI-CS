The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM strong amp; Rahul 100% fit for top job 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     PM strong amp; Rahul 100% fit for top job 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Manmohan Singh arrives in Frankfurt. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Congress has tied itself in knots over who will be its candidate for Prime Minister in 2009, after Rahul Gandhi was quoted as saying the question of his taking the top job was not closed.        
	The Congress denied the statement, allegedly made by Rahul during a session with Punjab University students in Patiala that was not open to the media.         
	Rahul Gandhi categorically stated that he is not focusing on the post and he is focusing at present only on building the Youth Congress and student organisations, chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.        
	But while the Congress was quick to issue the denial, it left open the issue of who will head the government if the UPA returns to power after the next Lok Sabha election.        
	Asked if the logical inference was that Manmohan Singh would be projected as the next Prime Minister, Moily ducked: Our PM is strong and stable and we are proud of him. But a decision will be taken by the Congress president and the MPs after the elections. We are not in the (LK) Advani culture of nominating persons well before an election.        
	Reminded that Sonia Gandhi had virtually announced Singhs candidature when she said on August 15 that he would be back at Red Fort to deliver the Independence Day speech next year, Moily said: It is absolutely her prerogative to say so, but an occasion always throws up a leader. We have to wait for that occasion.        
	Asked why he did not second Sonias endorsement, Moily sung a paean to Rahul: He is the future, he is pure, honest, has integrity. He is the person who will 100 per cent fit the leadership bill.        
	But would he assume the mantle before the 2009 elections? Moily was silent.         
	A section of the media had quoted Rahul as telling Punjab University students in answer to a question on Monday: The question of my elevation to the PMs post is still open and has not been closed as yet.         
	Dismissed as incorrect, the statement has nevertheless given Congress leaders an excuse to crank up the familiar chorus of Rahul lao, desh bachao that had been virtually silenced by Sonia last month.        
	Privately, second- and third-rung leaders said it was time to bring in Rahul and pitch the campaign as an 80-plus Advani versus a 30-something Rahul to woo young voters.               
	The party and not its coalition partners would choose the Prime Minister, Congress spokespersons said, in an apparent snub to Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar. Shortly after the UPA won the trust vote in Parliament, Pawar had declared that the UPA should fight the next election under Singhs leadership.

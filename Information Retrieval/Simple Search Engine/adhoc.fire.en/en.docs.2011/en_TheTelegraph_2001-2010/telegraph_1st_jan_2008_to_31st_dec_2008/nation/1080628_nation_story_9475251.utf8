          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND REUTERS                              
	New Delhi/Chennai, June 27: An earthquake shook the Andaman and Nicobar Islands around 5.10pm today but no tsunami alert was issued and there were no reports of damage.        
	The magnitude is 6.3 and its centred in the Andaman Islands, said Srinivas Kumar, an official at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services.        
	We have not issued any tsunami warning so far and there is no need for widespread evacuation because its 6.3. We are studying the situation.        
	The US Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 6.7 and was centred 114km southwest of Port Blair. It added that an aftershock of 6.1 magnitude struck at 6.37pm.        
	People ran out of their homes in Port Blair and telephone lines were jammed. Everything in my office started to shake and we ran out as fast as possible, said a resident.        
	Police were asking people not to panic and to return to their homes. There is no news of loss of life or property till now, said Casper James, a senior disaster management official on the islands.        
	In Chennai, which too felt the tremors, hundreds of BPO employees and software techies scurried down from their offices in high-rise buildings. No deaths or injuries or damage to buildings were reported till late tonight.        
	It seemed as if someone was pushing me. Computers and chairs began rattling all of a sudden and people in the office began to scream and run downstairs, said Sumitra, who works in a shipping company in central Chennai.        
	Scores of employees of Tamil daily Dinakaran ran out of their three-storey office building in Mylapore in south Chennai, an eyewitness said.        
	The tension eased off only after the Met office said there was no tsunami warning from the Centre.        
	Some people were too busy to notice the quake, though. We were in the middle of our evening puja. We did not feel the earthquake, said C.V. Vishwanatha Iyer of the Nungambakkam Seva Samajam.        
	I havent experienced any tremors, probably because we are on the first floor and our house is still empty without any furniture, said a woman who has just shifted to Chennai from Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kin poke holes in ship-sunk tale
                                                                                                               Kin poke holes in ship-sunk tale
          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, March 15: The families of 25 Indian sailors onboard the MV Rezzak, which reportedly sank with its crew last month, have requested a CBI inquiry into the ships disappearance.         
	In a letter to President Pratibha Patel and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the families have accused Mumbai-based manning company Pelican Marine of hatching a conspiracy to pocket the insurance money. The family members of the crew want the CBI and the Interpol to probe into the case.        
	The vessel was carrying steel billets from Russia to Turkey when it lost contact with tracking centres. The last contact with MV Rezzak was made on February 18, a day after it had left Russias Novorossiysk with an all-Indian crew. Among the missing is marine engineer Alok Kumar (24), a resident of Deo Nagar in Giridih.        
	Relatives of the missing sailors say the ship could not have sunk till February 28 as they had talked to the sailors.        
	Alok Kumars father Rameshwar Mandal said one of the crew was contacted by his relative in Mumbai on March 9. Someone picked up the phone but the network was poor and the audio inaudible, he said.        
	Mandal, who is in touch with relatives of other crew members, said when he tried to contact Alok, he got the recorded this-mobile-is switched-off message.         
	The letter (a copy is with The Telegraph) was sent on March 6 and lists reasons for immediate need of CBI inquiry. Wreckage of the ship or personal effects of crew are yet to be found, the letter states, arguing against the sinking theory. Telephone calls made by relatives on February 24 and March 9 to crew on MV Rezzak were picked up. The Turkish coastguard on February 22 reportedly claimed that they were unaware about any such ship missing.

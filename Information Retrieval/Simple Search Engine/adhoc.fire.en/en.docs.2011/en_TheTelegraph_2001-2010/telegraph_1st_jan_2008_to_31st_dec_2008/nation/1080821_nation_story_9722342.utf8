          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 20: Santosh Nayak cannot fathom why his brother, a 26-year-old techie in Pune, chose to end his life just a week after happily discussing plans for marriage with his family back home in Puri.        
	Saroj Nayak, the youngest of two brothers and one sister, was found hanging from a tree in a forest on a Pune hillock on Monday morning.        
	 I do not understand why he took his life like this, said Santosh, 29, as he headed back home with their father Brahmanand Nayak, 57, after cremating Saroj who had moved to Pune only two months ago.        
	We performed his last rites here because it is not easy to take the body back home. There were so many formalities to be completed and we do not know Marathi. But police and local people, including Sarojs friends, were there to help us, he said.        
	Santosh, who works for a private firm in Puri, and his father, a state government employee, had flown to Pune last night. They left for home by train this evening. The family lives in Vishnupura in Puri district.         
	Only a week ago, Santosh said, Saroj had enthusiastically discussed marriage plans with their mother.         
	The software engineer with ACS Ltd, a sub-contract firm of Tech Mahindra, lived in Pune with a friend in the Chandan Nagar area near Yerawada. He was a loner, Santosh said. The family does not suspect foul play.        
	We have not found any suicide note on him. His body was found on Monday morning by a herdsman who went there looking for his lost buffalo. He had last attended office on August 14, said sub-inspector Pratap Pawar who is investigating the case.         
	Sarojs flat-mate B. Mallik, also from Orissa, has told the police he did not return home on Sunday evening.         
	The police said the engineer was found hanging by a nylon rope from a tree in the forested Wakad area. The post-mortem report said the death was caused by strangulation.        
	His socks and shoes were found neatly kept at the foot of the tree from which he hanged himself and there is no sign of a scuffle. No other wounds were found on his body, Pawar added.         
	Saroj is the second IT engineer in Pune to have committed suicide in the last fortnight. On August 8, Sandeep Shelke, who worked with Persistent Systems, had jumped off his office building.

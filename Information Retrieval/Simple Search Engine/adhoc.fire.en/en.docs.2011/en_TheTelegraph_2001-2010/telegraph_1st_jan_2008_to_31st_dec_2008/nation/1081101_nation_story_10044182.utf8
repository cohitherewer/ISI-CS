          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raising a stink                                  
	Cuttack, Oct. 31: A single-point garbage dumping yard has eluded the state capital despite repeated orders of the high court as the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has skirted it on one plea or the other ever since land was allotted for it on the outskirts of the city more than a year ago.         
	The BMC has been disposing more than 400 tonnes of garbage per day through seven dumping yards located within the city. The high court has been pressing for it since August 2007 while monitoring solid waste disposal in Bhubaneswar as part of a PIL.        
	About 61.41 acres of vacant land at Bhuasuni under Bhubaneswar tehsil had been allotted by the government for a dumping yard in February. Initially, technical constrains  clearance from the Union ministry of environment and forests and permission from Airports Authority of India  were cited before the court. However, the court had set a deadline in April for construction of a boundary wall around it. But in August it was found that work on it had not started at all.         
	We are unable to understand as to why the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has taken the orders of this court so lightly, the high court observed on August 28, while directing for completion of construction of boundary wall within three months.         
	The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is directed to lift all solid waste from the temporary dumping yards to Bhuasuni and complete the process within 15 days, the court said in its order.         
	When the case was taken up for hearing on Thursday, the court found there was no progress in implementation of the order issued over a month ago. Instead, the BMC counsel tried to explain that distance between the temporary dumping yards and Bhuasuni required a larger fleet of garbage carrying vehicles, but it is not possible at this stage. The BMC counsel further took the plea that dumping of garbage at Bhuasuni is being opposed by people of the locality. However, the court has asked for a detailed affidavit on it within seven days.

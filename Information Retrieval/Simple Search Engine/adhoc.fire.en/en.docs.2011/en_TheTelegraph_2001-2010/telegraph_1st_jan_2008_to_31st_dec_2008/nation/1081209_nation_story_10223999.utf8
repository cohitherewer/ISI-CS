          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 8: Villagers in West Midnapore today started removing tree branches from roads they had blocked in the tribal belt.        
	But in Lalgarh, which has stayed cut off from the rest of the district, the obstructions stayed.        
	Yesterday, the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities that was leading the tribal agitation suspended the movement. The outfit said West Midnapore police had been given a week to visit the area and apologise for alleged atrocities on tribals, but the police have not confirmed this.        
	Most roads cleared today are in Jhargram and Belpahari. Roadblocks were removed in Binpur, Betkundri and Dahijuri. Bus services between Kharagpur and Jhargram  that were halted for 10 days  resumed today as did transport between Jhargram and Belpahari, said Tanmoy Mondal, the sub-divisional officer of Jhargram.

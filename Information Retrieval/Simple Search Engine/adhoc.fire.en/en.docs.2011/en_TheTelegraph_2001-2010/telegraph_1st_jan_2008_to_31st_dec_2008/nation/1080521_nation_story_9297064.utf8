	Patna, May 20: A Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) jawan was killed and two others were injured in accidental firing at SSB office here at Danapur this morning.        
	Though it is not clear who fired at who and how the fight started  if it was a fight at all  SSB public relations officer Amitabh Bhattacharya said that so far the force is treating the incident as an accident.        
	Though it looks a case of accidental firing, we are probing into the incident. But as of now, it seems to be a case of weapon mishandling, he said.         
	The incident took place at SSB office at Rukanpura around 8.30am when guard C.P. Singh (50) was watching television in the movie hall of the SSB Danapur camp.        
	Singh, a resident of Hajipur, had recently taken a transfer from Gorakhpur to Patna and to the particular Danapur camp. Jawan Singh, who was on duty, was carrying a multi-fold carbine and was seated right in the front of the hall. While guard Apurva Biswas (26) was seated right behind him.        
	Primary investigations revealed that were sounds of continuous firing from a multi-shot carbine.         
	SSB officials added that Singh was shot in the stomach and chest, while Apurva was shot on his left biceps.        
	S.K. Nath, an orderly of a colonel, rushed to the hall after hearing the gun shots and was hurt on his collar bone. Singh died on the spot.        
	Nath is still being treated at Danapur military hospital for his injuries while guard Apurva was discharged from the hospital today.         
	Danapur police has ruled out a possible suicide angle at this stage. The guard was not suffering from depression and was neither mentally disturbed, said a senior police officer.

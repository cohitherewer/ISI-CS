	An HIV positive driver nearly took his would-be bride for a ride but a mandatory testing rule saved the day.    
	The driver from Theni district, near the temple-town of Madurai, was to tie the knot in a community wedding hall, which has made AIDS tests compulsory for couples.    
	The 21-year-old had gone through an elaborate engagement ceremony in May and was to get married recently at the Chinnamanur Maravar Makkal (community) Mandapam. Under the hall rules, a certificate must be submitted, by the families of the groom and the bride, saying neither of the partners have the disease.    
	The tests were held in July and when the boys parents went to the local government hospital to check the results, they were shocked to find their son had tested positive.    
	The word spread and, in no time, the authorities at the hall refused permission for the wedding. The girls parents called off the wedlock. It was not clear whether the driver had known about his HIV status before the tests were conducted.                      
	No teacher in a Chittoor school is ready to be a headmaster  theyd rather be alive than take the top job.    
	A strange fear of death has been stalking the staff at Kammakandrigas zilla parishad higher secondary school after two headmasters, who had been elevated to the post, passed away within the space of a couple of months.     
	The post has been vacant since July 2007, when Z. Guravaiah, a healthy math teacher, suddenly turned sick and passed away after he was promoted. He had been given charge after the death of the previous headmaster six months back.    
	A lady teacher asked to take the responsibility after Guravaiahs death went on leave, apparently to avoid the job.     
	Educational officials ordered a probe and are considering crash courses to rid the teachers of their fear.                    
	Expect an end to bumpy rides in Delhi by Diwali.    
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit recently promised a plan to fill potholes and carry out repairs on a war-footing.    
	She blamed the poor conditions of some roads on the extraordinary rains that have lashed the capital this season.    
	Dikshit ordered the repairs at a high-level meeting of officials following complaints of pothole-riddled roads.    
	Traffic police have identified 62 stretches in all, which includes the planned bus rapid-transit corridor in south Delhi. Forty-four roads that need to be spruced up are under the MCD, 12 are part of the PWD, two under the NDMC (Lutyens Delhi) and two are national highways.    
	People are facing a lot of difficulties due to unsatisfactory condition of roads, which is resulting in longer traffic jams and waste of travelling time and fuel, Dikshit said.    
	Urban development minister Raj Kumar Chauhan promised new-look roads before Diwali, saying plastic-mix bitumen and dense carpeting, for longer life, were being used.                        
	An upgrade is on way for some of Tamil Nadus key roads.    
	The state government has recommended that three state roads be turned into national highways this year, road minister Vellakoil Saminathan said recently. The Madurai-Thondi, Dindigul-Singampunari and Cuddalore-Chithoor (Andhra) roads will be upgraded. The new-look roads will make links with Chennai quicker.    
	As part of the improvement, 50 of the 300 accident-prone curves on the highways have been straightened.

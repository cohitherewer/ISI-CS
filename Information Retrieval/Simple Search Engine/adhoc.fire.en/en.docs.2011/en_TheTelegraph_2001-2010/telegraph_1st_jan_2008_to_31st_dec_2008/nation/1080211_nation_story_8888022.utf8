	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Alleged kidney transplant kingpin Amit Kumar was today remanded in CBI custody till February 22 so that the agency could probe the national and international ramifications of the racket.        
	Deported from Nepal yesterday, the 40-year-old doctor was produced before chief metropolitan magistrate Sanjiv Jain at his residence amid tight security.        
	Kumar wore a cap and a muffler covering his face.        
	Seeking his custody, the CBI lawyer said the agency needed to question the doctor to unravel the network of his alleged organ trade. The sleuths, who interrogated him since last night, have pieced together a bit of the jigsaw, sources said.        
	It now appears the Gurgaon-based doctor was associated with influential people, including senior politicians, senior bureaucrats and some eminent doctors in the capitals top hospitals.        
	This is only the beginning. It is very difficult to say how much is true and how much is hype. We need to corroborate each and everything he says. He is claiming, for instance, that he was running a clinic in Noida in a house let out by a senior Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat, a CBI source said.        
	The CBI wants to confront the doctor with an alleged victim, Shakeel, whose kidney was removed without consent. The questioning would also throw light on the sources of Kumars income, the agencys lawyer said. Investigators have found Rs 1 crore in one of his bank accounts.        
	The CBI told the judge it wanted to find out from Kumar, who allegedly carried out over 500 illegal kidney transplants, who the donors and recipients were, besides the surgeons who helped him remove the organs.        
	The probe has revealed that the multi-crore-rupee racket was spread across the country, with many of the clients being foreigners. Hundreds of labourers were duped into parting with their kidneys on the pretext of medical tests.        
	Kumar, who has been charged with illegal organ transplant, wrongful confinement, cheating and possession of illegal foreign currency, faces up to 10 years in jail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Revealed: Glasgow plot
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Revealed: Glasgow plot
  - Kafeel ally found guilty of conspiring mass murder        AMIT ROY                           Bilal Abdulla                                         
	London, Dec. 16: The inside story of how two studious brothers from Bangalore, Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, the former a PhD student and the latter a junior doctor, got mixed up in a plot to commit mass murder in Britain has now come out following the conviction today of a third man, Bilal Abdulla, a 29-year-old Iraqi.         
	Had the plot succeeded, the toll might have been much higher than in Mumbai.         
	At Woolwich Crown Court today, Abdulla, was found guilty of conspiring to murder hundreds of people with car bombs in London and Glasgow. The judge, Justice Mackay, said Abdulla will be sentenced tomorrow.         
	A fourth man, Mohammed Asha, 28, a neurologist working like the other doctors for the National Health Service, was acquitted and is due to be deported to his home country, Jordan.         
	Abdulla and Kafeel had left two Mercedes cars bombs outside a nightclub and another busy urban point in the West End of London on June 28 last year. Fortunately, the bombs failed to explode though the two men tried to detonate them remotely using mobile phones.         
	Realising the police would now be on to them, they fled to Glasgow, where they had spent months carefully planning their operation. The very next day, the two men drove a flaming Jeep Cherokee into the terminal building at Glasgow airport when it was packed with passengers. The men also threw petrol bombs at bystanders while Kafeel set himself alight. Abdulla was eventually tackled to the ground and taken into custody.         
	Kafeel, who was the driver, was badly burnt, never recovered from his injuries and died in hospital on August 2. His family did not take up the offer to repatriate his body and he lies unmourned in an unidentified grave somewhere in Britain.         
	His brother, Sabeel, two years younger than 28-year-old Kafeel, had been working as a junior doctor in Liverpool. He was arrested and charged with terrorism but was deported to India in April this year when it emerged that he had opened an email from Kafeel, containing information about the terrorist attacks, but only after the Glasgow incident. Had he opened Kafeels suicide email before the Glasgow attack, Sabeel would now be serving a very long prison sentence for withholding vital information.         
	Though Kafeel and Sabeel probably developed militant views even as youths in Bangalore, it appears they were cooked in Britain. Indian intelligence will also be interested in the Kafeel-Sabeel trail which demonstrates not all terrorism originates in Pakistan.         
	In May 2004, Kafeel, studying for a PhD at Anglia Ruskin University, moved to 205 Gilbert Road, Cambridge. Abdulla also travelled to Cambridge to study medicine and to live in Chesterton Road. The two men came across each other at an Islamic meeting house in Cambridge  and the chain of events that would lead to terrorism began.         
	In June 2005 Kafeel returned home to India citing an illness in the family but then travelled to China, Paris and Saudi Arabia. Two years later he came back to the UK twice to carry out laboratory test work.         
	On May 5 last year, Kafeel flew into Heathrow from Mumbai and was met by Abdulla. The two friends had chatted online during their separation. After a visit to Scotland, they arrived in London on May 17 and were picked up by CCTV travelling round London on tourist buses. They were then spotted going round London late at night in a hired car. It seems they were checking the best places where they could cause the greatest damage.         
	On June 2, Kafeel purchased a green Mercedes for 700 from a private vendor in Warrington, Cheshire. Over the next week he used cash to buy a white BMW, followed by a silver Mercedes, blue Mercedes and a green Jeep Cherokee. All the cars were advertised in Autotrader.         
	On June 28, they put their plans into action by arriving in London in two of the Mercedes cars, loaded this time with gas canister bombs.         
	The jury of seven women and five men rejected Abdullas defence that he planned a series of bloodless incendiary attacks to highlight the plight of Iraqis.         
	His defence counsel, Jim Sturman Q.C., said: Dr Abdulla wishes me to emphasise that these offences were motivated by politics, not religion. This is not a case where his intention was driven by religious faith but by his frustration with what he saw as an unjust war. Clearly at the centre of Dr Abdulla is, and was, a decent man, a good son, a good brother who has been brought to these events, he says, by the various wars under which he has laboured.         
	Comments of the kind made after the Mumbai massacre came from Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, who said: The attack on Glasgow Airport was a despicable and cowardly act, designed to inflict death and injury on innocent men, women and children, during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.         
	Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall, who heads Scotland Yards Counter Terrorism Command, said investigators were shocked when they discovered the key suspects were doctors whose job was to cherish life.         
	He said fundamentalism could spread in every part of society, including highly-trained professions. If the car bomb had exploded on the Haymarket and indeed on Cockspur Street (in Londons West End), given that it was parked next to a night bus stop, and given that that would have been an escape route for those who survived the first bomb, there would have been wholesale carnage. I think we would have seen mass casualties.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Injured youth held for Britain student murder
          AMIT ROY                           Jyothirmai                                  
	London, May 8: The murder of Samrajyo Jyothirmai Vempala, the 23yearold Wolverhampton University postgraduate student, at her lodgings in the Birmingham suburb of Handsworth on Tuesday afternoon a man has now been charged with her killing appears to have been the result of a domestic situation rather than a breakin, The Telegraph can reveal.         
	Last night, West Midlands police said that a 24yearold man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently helping police with their enquiries.         
	In the first statement on Tuesday police announced that detectives had launched a murder inquiry following the discovery of a womans body at a house in Handsworth, Birmingham.         
	Police also said that a man who had suffered serious injuries was also discovered at the house in Montague Road, at about 4.45pm on Tuesday.         
	The Telegraph can now confirm that the two men are the same. After treatment in hospital the man was released and then immediately arrested on suspicion of Jyotirmayees murder.         
	The man, who is also a student, possibly another Indian from Wolverhampton University although this has not been independently verified by The Telegraph, has been questioned.         
	And tonight, West Midlands police said the 24yearold man had been charged with her murder and will appear tomorrow before Birmingham Magistrates Court (when he will be named).         
	Police are not pursuing the line that Jyothirmai was killed by an unknown assailant, possibly a darkcomplexioned man, who broke into her lodgings for the purposes of burglary.         
	We dont know where that has come from, a police source told The Telegraph, referring to inaccurate reports in sections of the media.         
	At first police would not officially name the victim until she has been formally identified but the statement last night said: A post mortem examination has been conducted, which established that the 23yearold woman died as a result of head injuries. The woman is an Indian national who was studying in the UK.         
	The police stressed: No further information regarding the victim can be released at this time as she is yet to be formally identified.         
	But later in the evening, police said: The woman has today been named as Samrajyo Jyothirmai Vempala, a 23yearold Indian national who was in the UK on a study visa, attending the University of Wolverhampton.         
	(The spelling was slightly different from that used by the university.)         
	For Wolverhampton, the consequences of the murder are potentially disastrous. Like all universities in the UK, it depends on a healthy intake from India partly because Indian students are regarded as being academically very bright and hardworking and partly because they are a source of much needed revenue.         
	It is understood that the university is sending two senior officials, probably Ashar Ehsan , its marketing and communications diector, and someone from its international students section, to meet Jyothirmai devastated parents and other members of her family at their home in Vijayawada.         
	The University wishes to express its deepest sympathies to the family of Samrajya Jyotirmayee Vempala, Ehsan said in a statement.         
	Feedback from fellow students and tutors indicate that she was a very bright and enthusiastic student, he said. She was a model international student, who will be missed by all, here at the University.         
	Ehsan added: We have offered our full support in this time of grief to the immediate family and have been in contact with the family to offer this support. The University intends to hold a special day of condolence, on Friday 9th May, so that we can support fellow staff and students, and also remember Samrajya Jyotirmayee Vempala. Mrs J D Pavel, Consul General of India, will be present, along with the European Telegu Association President and members of the local community.         
	Ehsan also said: The circumstances of this tragic event that took place in Handsworth, Birmingham, in private accommodation, are currently being investigated by West Midlands Police, UK, and the University is fully cooperating with them.        
	It also said: The circumstances of this tragic event that took place in Handsworth, Birmingham, in private accommodation, are currently being investigated by West Midlands Police, UK, and the University is fully cooperating with them.         
	It is not clear whether Jyothirmai and two or three other girls rented lodgings that had been vetted by the university or found rooms that had not been security vetted by Wolverhampton.         
	The security of Indian students, especially women, coming to the UK for higher studies will be a priority for the new Indian High Commissioner, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, who was due to arrive in London today.         
	Its a big problem, we have nearly 20,000 Indian students who come, a source pointed out.

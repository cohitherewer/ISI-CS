The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Desert blackout looms on Jodhaa
                                                                                                               Desert blackout looms on Jodhaa
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          A poster of the film Jodhaa Akbar.                                  
	Jaipur, Feb. 14: Cinema halls in Rajasthan arent sure if they will screen Jodhaa Akbar amid protests by Rajputs who say Jodhabai was the wife of Jehangir, not Akbar.        
	Theatre owners hadnt made up their mind on the eve of the release of Ashutosh Gowarikars movie across the country. Usually, they take a decision on screening by Tuesday, three days before a Friday opening. This has fuelled fears Jodhaa will be put off for now.        
	Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the patron of the Rajput Karni Sena, said his volunteers had fanned out to halls in Jaipur today, asking owners not to screen the film.         
	The films distributor, the Mumbai-based Anil Thadani, said he couldnt confirm whether the film would be released in the desert state. Local Inox chain operator Ajay Pal Singh also would not say if a decision on the release would be taken by this evening. Most other halls, including Entertainment Paradise and Space, were unsure.        
	As uncertainty loomed on the release, Rajasthan High Court asked the government to make arrangements to ensure the screening went ahead unimpeded.        
	The order by a single-judge bench of Justice M. Rafiq came on a petition filed by UTV Software Communications, which has produced the film, seeking to restrain Rajput organisations from preventing distribution, publicity, promotion, release, screening or viewing of the film.        
	UTV alleged in its petition that police had been calling up theatre owners and informally asking them not to go ahead with the release. The administrations inaction was creating fear in the minds of the public and would stop people from watching the film, UTV said.        
	But the judge, after asking the police to ensure peace, disposed of the plea, saying it couldnt be heard merely on the assumption that Rajput organisations would physically prevent screening and viewing of the film.         
	The 16th-century epic love story stars Aishwarya Rai as Rajput princess Jodhabai and Hrithik Roshan as Akbar. But director Gowarikars portrayal is bitterly contested.        
	Rajputs claim Jodha was the daughter of Jodhpurs Mota Raja Udai Singh and was married to Jehangir in 1586. She was called Jodhabai because she hailed from Jodhpur, they said.        
	Just because in Mughal-e-Azam, Jodhabai was shown as Akbars wife, Gowarikar cant repeat the mistake for cheap publicity, Kalvi said.         
	Scrambling to end the controversy, Gowarikar issued notices in local dailies citing historians and the Jaipur royal family to say that his film was based on facts. He argued that Akbars wife was, indeed, the daughter of Raja Bharmal of Amer.

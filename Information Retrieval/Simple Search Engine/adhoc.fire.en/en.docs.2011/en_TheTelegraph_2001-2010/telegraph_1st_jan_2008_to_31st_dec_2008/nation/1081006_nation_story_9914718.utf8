          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 5: Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP) has opposed a move by women and child development ministry to replace cooked meals with pre-packaged food for children under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).        
	The ministrys proposal to feed ready-to-eat processed food to some 8 crore children between three and six years under the ICDS is likely to be placed before the cabinet for approval soon. If the proposal is approved, crores of children will be deprived of cooked meals, which nutritionists stress is the best way to a balanced diet that pre-packaged food fails to proide, said Bikash Das, the executive vice-president of CLAP.         
	In Orissa, the ICDS operates under 326 projects, including 314 community development blocks and 12 urban local bodies through 41,697 anganwadi centres.        
	CLAP, a legal support advocacy outfit, had submitted separate memorandums seeking intervention of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi regarding the issue last week.        
	Distribution of ready-to-eat food through ICDS will legitimise commercialisation of childcare and child nutrition in India, stated one of the memorandums. Copies of the letter were made available to the reporters today.         
	Besides, the proposal to feed ready-to-eat fortified food to children goes against the spirit of a judgment presented by the Supreme Court that mandates cooked meals for the lunch requirement of 300 calories and 8 to 10 grams of protein for children up to six years of age, said the executive president.         
	The court had made it clear that contractors shall not be used for supply of nutrition in anganwadis and preferably ICDS funds shall be spent by making use of village communities, self-help groups and Mahila Mandals for buying grain and preparation of meals. Apprehensions were expressed that pre-packaged food would automatically lead to a few large suppliers, manufacturers and distributors getting a captive and lucrative market across the country.

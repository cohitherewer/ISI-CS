          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, April 9: The expansion of the two-year-old Nitish Kumar-led council of ministers appears to be on cards with BJP president Rajnath Singh assuring an expansion soon.         
	I had called upon Nitish Kumar and spoke with him. I can tell you that the chief minister will expand his council of ministers, said Rajnath Singh while talking to the media after meeting Nitish.         
	The chief minister, a couple of days ago, had stated that he was about to expand his cabinet, while describing the exercise a matter of routine expansion.         
	Fact remains that many MLAs, mainly from the BJP, aspiring for ministerial berths, are reportedly fuming over the party leadership for its failure to pressure the Bihar chief minister to make his ministry full size.         
	According to the quota of ministers, between the BJP and the JD(U) the BJP should get five ministers, against four from JD(U), in this expansion.        
	Apparently, BJP MLAs who are about to get a bigger slice of the power cake are in no mood to wait any longer.         
	Few of the party MLAs, including Bhola Singh, have openly spoken out against the chief minister for not expanding the ministry sooner.

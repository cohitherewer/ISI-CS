                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     JD(U) team to look into resignations
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 5: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today said a team of senior JD(U) leaders would visit Gaya soon to find out if the 64 NDA leaders and cadre, who quit their posts and parties yesterday, actually buckled under rebel pressure.        
	Yesterday, workers and leader belonging to BJP and JD(U) of Imamganj Assembly constituency (Gaya), represented by Speaker U.N. Choudhary, resigned from primary membership following, what sources call, rebel threat.        
	I have discussed the en masse resignation with our national president Sharad Yadav and have decided to send a team of senior party leaders from all over the country to Gaya, to look into the matter, said Nitish Kumar.        
	The team, reportedly, would also try to find out if the party workers statements of police excesses and administration apathy leading to their step hold any truth.        
	Talking to the media today, Nitish conceded that part of the investigation would also be carried on by the inspector-general of police (Patna).        
	Today at the janata darbar Nitish also defended Bihar road construction departments recent decision to cancel a contract with a Tantia-based construction firm. This construction agency has been flouting all norms and has done sub-standard work, he added. Taking the matter a step further, the chief minister issued a warning to the agency and said that it would be allowed to leave Bihar without finishing left over construction work according to contract specifications.        
	Before taking up the construction matter, Kumar gave a patient hearing to the wife and son of Banka additional district and sessions judge, Subhash Chandra, whose daughter Rani Archana Singh (26) went missing from Capital Express on its way to Patna from New Jalpaiguri on August 14, 2007.         
	Though a case was registered at Gandhi Maidan station and police later registered a dowry/harassment case against her husband, Rajiv, Archana has been untraceable. The mother-son duo later met deputy-general of police, S.C. Jha, and additional director-general of police, (headquarters), D.N. Gautam.

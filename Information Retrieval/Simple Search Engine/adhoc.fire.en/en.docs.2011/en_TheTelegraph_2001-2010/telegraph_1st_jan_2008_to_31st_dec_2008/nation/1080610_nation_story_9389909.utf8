  Harass heat on force staffers          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                  
	Srinagar, June 9: A CRPF constable has been suspended for following a woman into an airport washroom yesterday even as four air force staffers landed in custody for teasing a girl on a weekend of embarrassment for the forces.        
	Police sources said constable Sudhakar Rao, of the paramilitary forces 29 Battalion, chased the woman, an employee of JetLite airline, into the washroom at Srinagar airport.        
	Airport sources said Rao opened the door and passed lewd remarks at the woman. She raised an alarm that caught the attention of other staffers who rushed to the spot and caught hold of him, an airport official said.        
	CRPF spokesperson Prabhakar Triphati said the constable had been placed under suspension and a probe ordered.        
	The airport sources said the inquiry was ordered after authorities took up the matter with the CRPF top brass.         
	We have placed the constable under suspension pending inquiry. He was posted at the airport for guard duty, Tripathi said.        
	We are inquiring into the matter. During questioning, he told us that he opened the door accidentally because he did not know somebody was inside. However, the complaint has been lodged. Therefore, we have decided to take action as per rules.        
	DIG, central Kashmir, Mohammad Subhan Lone said police had not lodged any case but an investigation was on. We are trying to ascertain whether the door was opened intentionally or deliberately, he added.        
	The four air force officials had to spend two nights in lock-up on the charge of teasing a girl and later assaulting a police party.        
	The four, part of the IAFs ground staff here, were today produced before chief judicial magistrate Mohammad Ibrahim, who handed them over to their parent organisation for preventive custody.        
	While handing them over to their commanding officer, the magistrate ordered them to be produced in court on Tuesday.        
	Ibrahim gave the air force the option of trying them by a court martial or trial by a civilian court.        
	The four  identified as Sundeep Singh Mishra from Uttar Pradesh, Sagir Ahmad and Rohit Singh Dev from Uttarakhand and Nitin Natyal from Bihar  were arrested on Saturday afternoon after the police found them allegedly teasing a girl in a city park.        
	They later assaulted a police party which had gone to arrest them, Srinagar (south) police chief Uttam Chand said, adding that a case had been registered against them.

	New Delhi, May 12: An Indian-American studying in Delhi University was found dead in his rented flat in north Delhi today.        
	Kannan Mehra, 21, was from North Carolina and doing research in philosophy. He had arrived in the capital just a month back.         
	Mehra had rented a second-floor flat in Hudson Lane in Mukherjeenagar on April 8. Today, the youth was found lying dead in a pool of blood on the bathroom floor after police broke open the door to enter the flat.        
	I got suspicious when Kannan didnt come out of his house for two days. A very social guy, he would go out often. So I decided to check, said the flats landlord, who alerted the police.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that Mehra suffered stab wounds in the neck and also had head injuries.        
	The house was bolted from inside. It could be a case of suicide. His friend went to enquire about him when they couldnt contact him. They informed his landlord, who in turn informed us. The door was broken open and Mehra was found dead in the bathroom. The body has been sent for post- , deputy commissioner of police, north-west Delhi, Manish Agrawal, said.

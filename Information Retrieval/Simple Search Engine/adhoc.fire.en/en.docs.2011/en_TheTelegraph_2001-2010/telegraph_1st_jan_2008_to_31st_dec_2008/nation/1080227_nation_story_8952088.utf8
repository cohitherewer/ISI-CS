     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 26: The Orissa government today ordered an administrative probe by revenue divisional commissioner (northern) into the alleged gangrape of an MCA student in Sambalpur.
    
	The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The chief minister directed the revenue divisional commissioner (northern) to probe into the circumstances that led to the incident and submit a report within two weeks. 
    
	Four men allegedly involved in the incident have been arrested and forwarded to court. 
    
	The incident has triggered state-wide student protests. Today, an eight-hour bandh was observed in Sambalpur and pupils boycotted classes in GM College (Sambalpur). Yesterday, Sambalpur University closed sine die after students ransacked the campus. Members of DSO and the ABVP staged blockades and protests yesterday in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Partnership on Rice lips, not Pranabs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Partnership on Rice lips, not Pranabs

	Washington, Oct. 11: Pranab Mukherjee does not love Bush. Or at least he evidently doesnt think the people of India do.        
	Even as the foreign minister operationalised the nuclear deal with US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice here yesterday, it was clear the deal is a house of cards precariously held together by scotch tape: the challenging task of interpreting its provisions will only confront both sides when talks start on implementation of the deal in compartments.        
	It was not surprising, therefore, to watch Mukherjee  at the signing ceremony with Rice and later at a news conference  share none of the effusion for US President George W. Bush that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh displayed at the White House last month.        
	With his head on his shoulders and his feet firmly on the ground, Mukherjee made it clear that he sees the deal as a way of making the world its oyster for India in nuclear commerce. He specifically mentioned France and Russia as two countries with which India is engaged in this effort.        
	While Rice talked about the deal unlocking the doors for our strategic partnership in the 21st century... on every area of national endeavour, not once did Mukherjee refer to any such partnership.        
	Instead, he talked about the careful balance of rights and obligations in the deal. Mukherjee pointed out to Rice at the signing ceremony that the agreement has been passed by the US Congress without any amendments.        
	He stressed that the provisions of the agreement under Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act for civil nuclear co-operation are now legally binding on both sides once the agreement enters into force.        
	At a news conference later, Mukherjee asserted that the only elements in the deal that India was bound by were the text of the 123 Agreement and the joint statements by Singh and Bush in July 2005 and in March the following year. Mukherjee added that provisions for enrichment, reprocessing and supplies of nuclear fuel are spelt out in the 123 Agreement and that they have been reiterated by Bush while signing the nuclear package into law.        
	He said India would implement the agreement in good faith and that he expected Washington to do so as well. Mukherjee amplified in answer to a question that good faith implied trust between the two governments.        
	In the twilight months of the Bush administration, which negotiated the deal that is already open to multiple interpretations here, no one asked Mukherjee if trust is a transferable commodity to an Obama or a McCain administration after January 20.        
	Sources here suggested that the economic meltdown in the US may have made the Manmohan Singh government fall out of love for Bush. Mukherjee acknowledged that certain developments may impact on the overall economic situation and on Indo-US economic relations.        
	At the news conference, he went out of his way to emphasise I have not used the word preferential treatment for US companies in the award of contracts for nuclear plants.                          
	He said these would be commercial contracts where commercial elements play their role. At the signing ceremony, Mukherjee declined to go beyond saying that we look forward to working with US companies on the commercial steps that will follow to implement this landmark agreement.

          OUR BUREAU                          Twist to the tree tale                                  
	Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, April 25: The day when the upbeat Orissa government decided to go for a massive plantation drive, Orissa High Court ordered a probe into parcelling out of reserve forestlands to private parties by revenue officers on the basis of fudged orders in Cuttack        
	According to a Forest Survey of India report for 2007, the states forest cover has gone up from 47,033sqkm (1999) to 48,374sqkm in 2005. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who looks after the forest department portfolio, reviewed the progress of afforestation programmes and directed officials to take up plantation in another 1-lakh-hectares. For this, 4.3-crore saplings will be raised with the help of the self-help groups and vana samrakshan samitis (joint forest management groups).        
	Besides, 2.65-lakh labourers would be engaged for 100 days during the current fiscal for the plantation work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.         
	Massive green programmes will also be taken up in industrial, mining and thermal plant areas. Plans are in the pipeline for further plantation under Jagannath Vana Prakalpa to supply timber for construction of chariots of Lord Jagannath.        
	The chief minister today shared plans to start plantation of medicinal plants and herbs with central assistance.         
	In order to give a boost to forest officials morale, Grade-II rank will be given to forest rangers, announced the chief minister.        
	But while all these were happening, the high court ordered a probe into allotting reserve forestlands to private parties at Badamba in Cuttack.         
	A single-judge bench of Justice A.S. Naidu ordered an inquiry after finding prima facie evidence of illegal settlement against revenue administration both at tehsil and sub-division level.         
	Forestlands are community land meant to serve the larger interest of the society and they need to be protected. Private ownership cannot be claimed over community land for the next hundred years by fudging old land records, the court ruled. While Badamba tehsildar was found guilty of settling forestlands in favour of three persons on the basis of forged orders, Athagarh sub-collector was accused of following up the settlement with an order and issuing pattas within three days.         
	The case reached the high court when residents of Barimula village under Badamba tehsil filed a petition seeking judicial intervention. Prafulla Chandra Pradhan, along with 10 villagers, had filed a petition challenging the settlement of a big patch of land (10 acres), falling within the reserve forestlands, in favour of the three unnamed people. The court had promptly sought a status report on the forestlands.

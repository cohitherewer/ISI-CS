The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Babus train to be model husbands
                                                                                                            Babus train to be model husbands
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Bureaucrats are set to become the new role models in the governments battle against domestic violence.         
	A year after the Domestic Violence (Prevention) Act was passed, wife abuse continues virtually unabated in India, according to statistics released by the Centre.        
	The government has now decided to train and sensitise the babus about the act and its purposes.        
	On December 19, the ministry of women and child development had held a workshop for its junior officers and employees on the act and its implications.        
	Officers  both male and female  of the rank of deputy secretary, under secretary and director participated in the workshop, sources said.         
	The main aim of the workshop was to make our own officers role models for others to follow. Their job does not end at 5pm. Their job, as role models, must continue even at home, a senior official told The Telegraph.         
	As role models, the bureaucrats are expected to not just abstain from abusing their wives, but to keep an eye on the neighbourhood as well.        
	We dont want them to spy on other families. But if they know the law well, and are sensitive, they can help resolve disputes between couples. They can also aid a woman in distress by offering her advice, the official said. We will be holding several such workshops. It is not a one-time thing.         
	One officer who attended the workshop called it a learning experience. Often, we are so busy with pushing files that we honestly do not understand the laws we ourselves work on in their entirety, he confessed.         
	To another officer  a lady  the workshop was an opportunity to see the inherent biases men carry. I will not take any names but the workshop was an experience because I saw the way some of my own colleagues were almost going red with embarrassment when cases of domestic violence were read out, she said.         
	The ministry, officials said, had written to all other ministries and departments asking them to spare their bureaucrats for one-day workshops along the lines of the one held recently.         
	Some have responded favourably, others have not responded yet. But as and when they give us dates, we will organise workshops for officers of other ministries and departments, an official said.

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	Bangalore, Sept. 14: Terrorism will be the BJPs main campaign plank in the next general election, and not inflation or development.        
	We will think of development when we survive, an MP said, summing up the mood at the partys three-day national executive meeting that ended here today.        
	The fight against terror had always been a BJP catch-phrase, but yesterdays Delhi blasts have convinced the party the issue now dwarfs all others.        
	BJP leaders said the repeated terror strikes had caused such fear and desperation among people that it had driven into the background even their worst concerns over inflation and their demand for development.        
	The BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, declared that if the party came to power, the first 100 days of his government would be spent on a firm anti-terror agenda.         
	In dealing with threats to national unity and national security, the current leadership of the Congress has shown the kind of callous unconcern that would have shocked many nationalist Congressmen of yesteryear, Advani said as he wrapped up the conclave.        
	Terrorists have no fear because the Congress and its government are gripped with fear  the fear of losing vote-banks  when it comes to taking uncompromising legal and administrative measures against terrorism.        
	The BJP had claimed yesterday that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi had recently warned that the next terror target could be Delhi, but the Centre had not acted. Advani today attacked the Congresss myopic politics of minorityism and spineless leadership.        
	He, however, alleged that it was the ruling alliance that was casting a slur on Muslims by portraying the fight against terror as anti-Muslim.        
	Advani said a new phase had begun in Indias terror war with the global masterminds of the menace spreading their roots across the country, while receiving open support from sections of the political class. He didnt name anyone but the allusion was probably to those who had opposed the ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India.        
	However, Advani also touched on subjects like good governance, farmers woes, economic management and communal harmony, perhaps keeping in mind the upcoming state polls where the BJP faces anti-incumbency in some states.        
	The party released its economic resolution today, comparing the NDAs performance with that of the UPA, which it labelled a disaster.         
	Advani said no government since Independence, except Indira Gandhis which imposed Emergency in 1975, had given so many reasons to people to throw it out.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 10: The National Democratic Alliance today ripped into the Centre for approaching the IAEA without a trust vote, contrary to what it said was an assurance from foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	L.K. Advani said the NDA was outraged by the deceitful and duplicitous action of the government that had lost all credibility and whose word could not be believed any more.         
	The BJP accused the Centre of a midnight betrayal.        
	Advani recalled Mukherjees statement, made barely 48 hours earlier, that the government would approach the IAEA only after seeking a trust vote in the Lok Sabha.        
	If its senior-most ministers solemn declaration about seeking a trust vote before going to the IAEA can be so summarily overturned, how can the Prime Minister be trusted with anything? It is capable of going back on assurances even before the ink is dry.        
	An NDA statement said: Pranab insisted he was giving this assurance after consulting the Prime Minister.... In fact, interacting with the media en route to Japan, the Prime Minister himself had committed that all parliamentary norms would be followed.        
	It added: Surreptitiously, even before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned to Delhi from the G8 summit..., his government has approached the IAEA and the draft safeguards agreement has been circulated among the 25 members of the IAEA board. The NDA condemns the governments action in circulating the draft agreement virtually across the world except to the people of India. What is the government trying to hide?

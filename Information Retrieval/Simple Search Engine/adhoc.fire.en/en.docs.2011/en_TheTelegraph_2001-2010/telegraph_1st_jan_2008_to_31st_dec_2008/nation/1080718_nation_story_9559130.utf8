The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Excise dept hits logistic hurdle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Excise dept hits logistic hurdle
  - Lack of manpower, funds, laboratory pose problems          SUBRAT DAS                           Not enough officers for strict checks. Telegraph file picture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, July 17: As offences rise in the state, infrastructure inadequacies mire the excise department.        
	Sample this: the department is yet to have hazats and malakhanas of its own, as a senior official pointed out to The Telegraph. As a result, officers are forced to keep offenders in their residences and produce them personally before court the next day.         
	But help may be on the way. To overcome this difficulty, the standing committee of the excise department has recommended the Orissa government to construct hazats and malkhanas at range office and charge office levels, said the chairman of the panel, Niranjan Pujari.         
	Excise minister Debi Prasad Mishra admitted that the finance department had made a provision of Rs 10 crore in the budget of the works department in the current fiscal on the basis of the recommendation.         
	Though basic protocol before beginning the process has been followed, a senior official on said, the work was yet to start.         
	The second problem that is plaguing the department is acute shortage of manpower.        
	The strength of the staff working in the field is woefully inadequate. The number of inspectors, sub-inspectors, assistant sub-inspectors and constables is still the same as it was some 20 years ago, when the excise revenue income was below Rs 50 crore per annum.         
	Now, the excise revenue collection has reached Rs 500 crore, but the staff strength, said a senior excise official, has remained the same.         
	Moreover, setting up of 11 bottling plants, four breweries and three distilleries in the state and more depots by the state-owned Orissa State Beverage Corporation has made recruitment of additional excise staff necessary.         
	Presently, around 250 posts of excise constables are vacant. At the district-level, 20 officers belonging to the Orissa Administrative Service cadre are manning the posts of excise superintendents, while only three personnel belong to the excise cadre.         
	While on one hand there is lack of adequate officials, those present are often badly equipped (training-wise) to handle cases of inter-state liquor smuggling and spurious liquor trade.         
	Only sub-inspectors are trained at entry level to deal with such cases. Also, the department does not have a training institute of its own.        
	The only chemical testing laboratory of the department in Cuttack has to deal with all the problems in the state.         
	Though the committee has recommended establishment of chemical testing laboratories in four zones, including three in the zonal headquarters of Sambalpur, Berhampur and Koraput, said Pujari, it remains to be seen if these changes, like others, take a long time to be realised.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 17: The State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) today imposed restrictions on the gradation list of Orissa Administrative Service (OAS) Class-I (Junior) officers.        
	The tribunal bar is expected to intensify the controversy over the implementation of the quota system in promoting the civil servants of the state.        
	The problem had started after Orissas civil servants in the general category raised objections over the reshuffle and recast of OAS cadre by extending the benefit of accelerated promotion and seniority to the SC and ST officers.         
	State revenue and disaster management department had released a provisional gradation list of 559 OAS Class-I (Junior) officers on March 3, 2008.         
	Lagnajit Ray and other OAS Class-I (Junior) officers Parthasarathi Mishra, Srimanta Mishra, Premananda Khuntia and Sangramjit Nayak had filed a petition seeking quashing of the list.         
	Acting on it, SAT today directed the government to hear the grievances of the OAS Class-I officers first and then issue a logical order based on the objections raised within a month, the petitioners counsel Biswa Bihari Mohanty told The Telegraph.

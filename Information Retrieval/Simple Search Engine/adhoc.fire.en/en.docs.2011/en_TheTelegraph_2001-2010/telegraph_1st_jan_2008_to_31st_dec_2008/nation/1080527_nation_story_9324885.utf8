	Keonjhar, May 26: Residents to be affected by ArcelorMittals steel plant in Patna tehsil today staged a dharna in front of the district collectors office where a consultative workshop organised by the UK-based company on Roadmap of corporate social responsibilities activities was being held.        
	Mittal go back, we dont want displacement, shouted activists of Mittal Pratirodh Manch and All India Krishak Khet Mazdoor Sangh, who have been opposing the steel project.        
	We will not allow the plant to come up on agricultural land. We are ready to face bullet, said Muralidhar Sardar, a manch member. We want irrigation, not industries, said Benudhar Pradhan, a villager.        
	Around 14,989 persons belonging to 4,000-odd families living in 17 villages are going to be displaced by the ArcelorMittal plant, said All India Krishak Khet Mazdoor Sangh state unit secretary Raghunath Das. We were ready to have a dialogue with the chief minister since the government was acquiring land for the plant, said he.        
	Local leaders alleged that the real displaced persons had not been invited to the consultative workshop organised by ArcelorMittal in collaboration with the administration even as the UK-based company differed. The main objective of the workshop is to hear the affected people to understand their problems and prepare a CSR plan, said Sanak Mishra, ArcelorMittals CEO for greenfield projects and the workshop main architect.        
	Mishra unveiled the companys CSR plan for Keonjhar district in general and the rehabilitation plan for the project displaced in particular. He announced that the company would support upgradation of the headquarters hospital, four to five primary health centres, set up schools and install water supply projects in the district.         
	Reacting to the demonstration he said: Its a democratic society. People will take some time to be convinced. We will continue with our endeavour to allay their apprehensions through protests.        
	Keonjhar collector B.B. Mohapatra, who inaugurated the workshop, stressed on the need for industries to change the shape of the mineral-rich but underdeveloped district and sought the co-operation of the public representatives in this regard.

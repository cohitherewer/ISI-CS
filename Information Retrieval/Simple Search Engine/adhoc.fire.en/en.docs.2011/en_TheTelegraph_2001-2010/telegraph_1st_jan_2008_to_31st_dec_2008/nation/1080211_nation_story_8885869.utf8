	Gaya, Feb. 10: The Indian social system, particularly the institution of marriage, was taking toll on talented exponents of performing arts, said Isabell Anne, a French performer of Kathak dance.         
	Anne, who was in Gaya on Saturday for a performance at the Renaissance cultural centre, said a more progressive attitude of husbands, in-laws and parents in nourishing talents in performing arts can better the situation.        
	Isabell, who began her dancing career with Bharatnatyam and switched to Kathak about seven years ago, has been living in New Delhi and receiving training from Jai Kishan Maharaj, son of the legendary Kathak exponent Birju Maharaj. The French performer said during her stay in New Delhi, she watched quite a few talented performers including Kathak and Bharatnatyam exponents fading into oblivion after getting married, thereby causing a major loss to performing arts. But, she declined naming any such performer.         
	An attitudinal change is required to correct the impression that stage and a happy conjugal life can not go together. It is for the young generation to come forward and correct the social perspective. The sooner this happens, the better for Indian performing arts, said Isabell.        
	The French Kathak exponent also said that it was ironical that whereas the Indian classical music was gaining popularity in the western countries, the young generation of Indians was losing interest in the same.         
	More and more French and British performers were eager to get training in Kathak and other Indian dance forms, she said, naming Aurilies Odielte (France), Anais Celleau (France) and Quiency Charles (Britain). Auralies and Anais have been in Delhi for about one and half years, receiving Kathak training. The trio accompanied Isabell for her Gaya show.        
	Isabell said that she had visited the Renaissance cultural centre in the past and the ambience of the state-of-the-art theatre and hospitality of the president Sanjay Sahay made her agree to another performance here.         
	On how she reconciled her own upbringing and thought process with an alien mythology (Kathak has strong links with Hindu mythology), Isabell said: Kathak is my obsession and nothing, including the very obvious cultural divide, can come between myself and the performer in me.         
	She revealed that of late she had been experimenting with a blend of Kathak and western classics without compromising with the basics.         
	She presented this blend at the Renaissance show and would be presenting it at the Major Contemporary dance festival to be held in France next month.

	New Delhi, Oct. 27 (PTI): The CBI honoured a mothers wishes last week when it stopped the water flow in Indias longest man-made canal to look for her daughters body.        
	Amandeep Kaur, 17, who went missing four years ago, had been killed and thrown into the Bhakra-Beas canal in Punjab, a recently arrested accused had told the CBI.        
	Her mother then pleaded with the investigators to try and recover her daughters body so she could perform the last rites, a CBI officer said.        
	The agency co-ordinated with four organisations, including the Punjab irrigation department and the state electricity board, and stopped the flow in a 30km stretch of the canal between 8am and 2pm.        
	Divers were brought in to search the canal but the body could not be found.

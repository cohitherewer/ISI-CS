                                                                                                               Reform relief for boy convict
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 4: A juvenile court magistrate today set free a 15-year-old boy convicted of murder and criminal conspiracy, giving him an opportunity to reform.        
	Metropolitan magistrate N.P. Kapure at the juvenile justice court in Dongri said: The boy has pleaded guilty. I have held him guilty for the commission of the offence levelled against him.         
	However, he has expressed willingness to go to his parents house and submitted that he would do a job in his native place if released, Kapure said. He wants to improve in the future.         
	The teenager was among those arrested in February by the crime branch for the murder of 67-year-old Kiran Khanna in her flat in Worli.        
	The boy from Dhenkanal district, Orissa, was a domestic help in Khannas house and had tipped off his friends that the former censor board member had cash and jewellery worth Rs 60 lakh at home. The group, which included two drivers, planned to rob Khanna but murdered her when she screamed. Police, however, said that though the boy was part of the conspiracy to rob Khanna, he did not murder her.         
	An investigation report had suggested that the boy be sent to a special home till he became an adult.         
	But the court asked for a probation officers report that suggested the boys release under Section 15 (1) of the Juvenile Justice Act. Considering the age of the boy, the probation officers report could be considered, Kapure said.        
	There is no criminal history on record. No relative of his is available in Mumbai, nor are his parents here. If he is not sent to his parents house, the possibility of his exploitation cannot be ruled out, he added, asking the police to send the boy home within seven days of the order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flight in double trouble
                                                                                                            Flight in double trouble
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Guwahati, Feb. 7: Eighty-nine people on board a flight from Calcutta to Guwahati had a close shave today after a bird-hit damaged the Airbus A320s landing gear and two of its tyres burst during an emergency touchdown.        
	When flight commander Capt. D. Tiwari finally brought IC 229 to a halt on the scorched runway, it was the end of easily the longest 45 minutes for the 82 passengers and seven crew.         
	That was the time the plane spent circling the airport to use up excess fuel  to help reduce risk while landing  after the bird-hit. With the right landing gear damaged, the plane hit the runway on its left gear and two of the tyres burst on impact. The aircraft tilted to the left before stopping.         
	God was with us and the pilot did a commendable job... he saved us, said passenger Vijay Singh Daga, travelling with his wife and daughter.         
	Air India officials here said Capt. Tiwari and his co-pilot could not have handled the emergency better. The flight commander is among the best we have, one said.        
	Airport director R. Veeraswami said two of the four tyres on the left burst because they bore almost the entire weight of the plane. The pilots did not risk using the right landing gear because they were not sure how much damage had been caused.        
	A portion of the steel frame holding the right wheels was found bent.         
	The aircraft was about 7km from the airport and the pilots were preparing for landing at 11am when the bird-hit occurred. Some passengers suspected something was wrong when they heard a thud and felt the plane vibrate before starting to pick up altitude instead of continuing the descent.        
	As we circled the airport, the plane was still vibrating. The cabin crew were back in their seats. We first thought the plane had not received clearance to land. But after some time, we started asking what was going on. It was then that the pilot announced the bird-hit and said everything was under control and that there was no need to panic, Daga said.        
	Most passengers realised what a close shave it was only when they saw preparations for the emergency landing. There were a lot of people along with fire tenders and ambulances lined up on the tarmac, said Suman Budhiya, who added that nobody panicked.         
	The runway was reopened only after the damaged aircraft had been taken to the apron with a change of tyres.         
	The Bagdogra-Calcutta IC 722 was diverted via Guwahati to accommodate passengers who were to take the return flight. It took off at 4.30pm. Veeraswami said bird-hits in Guwahati were infrequent.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Padmapriya, Raghupati Bhat                                
	New Delhi, June 16: Padmapriya, the Karnataka BJP MLAs wife found hanging from the ceiling of a Delhi flat, may not have wanted to die.        
	Documents found by Delhi police in the Dwarka flat where her body was found yesterday reveal that she, along with her architect-friend Atul, had planned to stay there for at least two months.        
	A rent agreement confirmed that Atul had booked flat No. 20 of Sama Apartments in Dwarka in north Delhi on May 28. He paid the landlord, Tanveer Singh, Rs 13,400 and an advance of Rs 26,800 for two months.        
	Neighbours said the couple moved in some days ago. Padmapriya was married to Udupi MLA Raghupati Bhat but there have been rumours that their relationship was strained.        
	Atul and Padmapriya, 33, had also bought a WagonR in Bangalore, a receipt of which was found among her belongings.         
	Police sources in Delhi suggest the kidnap drama  Padmapriya went missing on June 10 on her way to her parents home  may have been staged by the duo as they were planning to flee.        
	The sources said that when she left her house, Atul may have followed her in another car and later driven to Mangalore in the latters car. On June 11, the duo apparently left for Goa, from where they flew back to Delhi the same day.        
	The next day, Atul flew to Bangalore and reached Udupi, the sources said. Atul, who was detained on June 14, revealed Padmapriyas whereabouts during questioning.        
	Prima facie, Delhi police are maintaining it was a case of suicide. Any foul play can be confirmed only after the report of the autopsy, conducted today at Safdarjung Hospital, is out.        
	Padmapriyas body was taken to Bangalore today. It will be taken to Udupi tomorrow.        
	Bhat, now in Delhi, has blamed Atul for his wifes death. I had gone to convince her to come back with me. I love her, even now. My friend Atul somehow coerced her. She is not a woman of that type. Our lives were good, he said.        
	Karnataka home minister V.S. Acharya said he had known the Bhats for 10 years and they shared a very good relationship.

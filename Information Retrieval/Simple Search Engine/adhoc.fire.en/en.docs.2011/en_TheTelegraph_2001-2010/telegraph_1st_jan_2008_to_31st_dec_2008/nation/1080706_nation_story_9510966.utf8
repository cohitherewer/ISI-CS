                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Never be scared, Rahul tells kids

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul Gandhi at the Bhopal school on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhopal, July 5: As a six-year-old, Rahul Gandhi used to be terrified of darkness. Thanks to his granny, he isnt any more.        
	Indira Gandhi had asked him to face the thing he feared. I practised my grandmothers advice and overcame my trepidation by going into dark places, he told schoolchildren in Bhopal.        
	Therefore, never be scared of anything in life.        
	Personal anecdotes peppered the young politicians interaction today as he shared his experiences with the kids, away from the heat and nuclear dust of Delhi where his party bosses were busy working out a deal for the deal.        
	Rahul responded to all queries, including one on how he would have tackled poverty as Prime Minister.        
	He said there was a stark difference between urban India and the countryside, which lacked roads, Internet and markets, but added that the current structure of markets was not suited for farmers and villagers.        
	But there was another way of looking at poverty, Rahul told the Class VII girl who had asked him the question: poverty, as a state of the mind.        
	There are many financially well-off persons who lack vision and have a poor way of looking at the world, he said. I consider them poor.        
	Rahul said when he was 15, he had several ambitions, like joining the army to becoming a pilot. As these ambitions slowly faded away, I realised that whatever one does, a deep understanding of the world is necessary, he told the Sanskar Valley School students.        
	The young MP and Congress general secretary paused when a girl suggested if India could be renamed Bharat, then said there was nothing wrong with it but it was the inner meaning and spirit of the country that mattered.        
	Would it have mattered, he added, had Gandhi been born under a different name?        
	When a ninth grader asked him about marriage, Rahul said he was hopeful it would happen soon.        
	When the girl asked him about his idea of a perfect match, Rahul laughed. Had he got one, he said, he would have been married by now.        
	His idea of a perfect match, Rahul added, was a caring person sensitive towards others.        
	Given a chance, he said, he would like to see peoples outlook towards other religions become more accommodating.        
	Rahul urged the schoolchildren to face adversities and be curious.        
	He quoted his great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehrus words  Be brave, and all the rest follows  and recalled how Indira Gandhi had showed him the way out of fear of darkness.        
	Narrating another incident from his schooldays, Rahul said he had a habit of asking questions and that one of his teachers used to reply to many of his whys later if the answer wasnt available immediately.        
	Rahul, who inaugurated two hostels  Prerna (for girls) and Kshitij (boys) of Sanskar Valley School formally opened by his mother, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, and industrialist Ratan Tata in 2006  said when he was a 20-year-old college student, he had taken on a strong boxer.        
	He said his coach inspired him to face the challenge and willpower helped him win. Therefore, we can transform weakness into triumph on the anvil of sheer willpower in politics and other fields of life, too.        
	Minister and Rahuls schoolmate in Doon School Jyotiraditya Scindia was also present.

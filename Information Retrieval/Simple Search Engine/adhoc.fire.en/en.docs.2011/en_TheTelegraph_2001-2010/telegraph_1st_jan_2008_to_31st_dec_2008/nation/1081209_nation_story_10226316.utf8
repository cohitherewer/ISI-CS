                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahul talent hunt flops, scorecard 1/8

	Bhopal, Dec. 8: Team Rahul Gandhi has bitten the dust in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Out of eight young candidates said to have been handpicked by the Congress general secretary through a much-touted talent hunt, seven have lost.        
	Rahul had taken a keen interest in the selection of party nominees for the Assembly polls and had personally cleared these eight names. However, his thrust on new faces and education did not appear to have cut much ice with the electorate.        
	Jeetu Patwari, the state Youth Congress chief, was routed from the Rau seat in Indore district. Patwari had been put at the Youth Congress helm earlier this year after an elaborate interview and screening under Rahuls supervision.         
	Patwaris appointment set tongues wagging about his lack of leadership qualities and electoral success. Besides, at 37, he was past the Youth Congress age limit, which is 35.        
	The Congress has a tradition of not fielding chiefs of the Youth Congress, womens wing and the National Students Union of India (NSUI) so that they can devote their time to campaigning for party nominees across their respective states.        
	But an exception was made for Madhya Pradesh, thanks to Rahul. State NSUI chief Rashmi Pawar, 27, was also given a ticket from Gwalior South. Like Patwari, Pawar rsquo;s appointment also had raised eyebrows. She, too, was over-age mdash; the NSUI limit is 25 years.  
	 Ranjan Mandoli from Badwani, Shyam Lal, Mahendra Singh Gujjar, Kuldeep Singh Dung from Mandsaur district and Nasir Islam from Bhopal were other young Congress nominees who reportedly had Rahul rsquo;s blessings.  
																									 State Congress leaders said the lone exception among Rahul rsquo;s chosen eight was Xavier Menda from Jhabua district. Menda had been given a ticket after the Congress changed the nomination of Kalavati Bhuria, the niece of minister of state for agriculture Kantilal Bhuria, following allegations of nepotism. Menda defeated Pav Singh Pargi of the BJP by over 19,000 votes.  
	 A section of the state Congress feels the biggest hurdle in Rahul rsquo;s way is the lack of direct interaction with the party rank and file. The leaders said that each time the Amethi MP visited Madhya Pradesh or Chhattisgarh, it was dubbed ldquo;apolitical rdquo; or called a ldquo;discover India rdquo; tour, in which even the district party chiefs were discouraged from meeting him.  
	 lsquo;Bigger role rsquo;   
	 However, the chorus in the Congress to ldquo;bring Rahul, save the nation rdquo; is expected 
  to grow louder as the party feels that he had delivered in the other states that went to polls this time. ldquo;Rahul will play a bigger role in the future. He has become the third pole in the Congress after the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi, rdquo; said Prithviraj Chavan, general secretary and central minister.  
	 Party sources pointed out that Sonia Gandhi barely campaigned as she was down with a persistent viral infection. But Rahul recompensed her absence by putting in several appearances in all states, including Mizoram.  
	 While the leaders in Delhi would not quantify what Rahul rsquo;s strike rate was, they are seeing his role also in the victories in Mizoram and Delhi.  
	 With Radhika Ramaseshan in New Delhi

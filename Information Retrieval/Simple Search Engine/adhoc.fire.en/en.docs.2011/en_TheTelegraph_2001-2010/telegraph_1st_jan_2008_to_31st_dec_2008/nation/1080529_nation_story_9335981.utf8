	Roadshow begins for college mates    
	Four budding engineers have hit a milestone before they finish college  with a novel device to make life on roads easier.    
	The quartet from the citys Velammal Engineering College have come up with Smart Traffic, a system that promises to ease traffic congestion and improve safety on roads.    
	The four final-year students of electronics and communication devised the application as part of their project work and presented a prototype at a recent news conference.    
	G. Prasad, one of the four who designed the system, said it would help vehicle monitoring and controlling and claimed their brainchild was more adaptable than the conventional time-oriented system used at city junctions.    
	Under the system, infrared sensors fixed on the roadside will gauge the density of vehicular traffic at a particular moment of time. The information will be fed into a central server which, in turn, will control traffic signals, said G. Rajarajeswari, another team member.     
	Emergency services, ambulances for instance, will be able to wade through traffic easily if they are equipped with Smart Traffics radio frequency identification tags.

	Love lost, bail gained    
	Love is not everything in life, a 21-year-old lovesick youth was told by a judge who released him on bail only if he agreed to forget the girl hed been desperately courting.    
	Sumit Kanojia was put in jail after the father of Nikta, the lady he was besotted with, filed a complaint accusing him of assault, trespass and attempt to commit suicide.    
	Bail applicants arent generally brought to court but judge A.M. Thipsay, playing a counsellor, wanted Sumit to be brought so he could be told not to ruin his life over a girl.    
	You have a long life ahead. I will leave you only if you promise not to meet the girl or even look at the lane where her family stays, Thipsay said. Sumit agreed and walked free soon after.    
	Travel smart, Games ahead    
	Commuting in the capital is poised for a big leap in the next two years with a fleet of state-of-the-art luxury buses.    
	Around 10,000 of these buses will be on the streets as part of the plan to put the citys public transport system in top gear for the Commonwealth Games to be held in 2010.    
	Of the total number of buses, 20 per cent will be air-conditioned. The objective is to discourage people from using their cars on roads, chief minister Sheila Dikshit has said.     
	Many low-floor luxury buses, which are designed in a manner that makes it easy for the disabled to board, are already on the roads.    
	The authorities are also girding up to make sure that Delhi has enough power from its own sources by the time the Games kick off.     
	A gas-based 1,500MW plant at Bawana is expected to boost availability.     
	The government has promised several more such power projects in the months ahead.

	Cash drain    
	Some of the capitals dirt-busters are facing the heat for cleaning out money, rather than muck.    
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi last week ordered disciplinary action against 51 engineers and 21 other workers for alleged malpractices in desiltation of drains.    
	The officials are accused of conniving with contractors to dump garbage, instead of silt.     
	The work was started after complaints of waterlogging from recent rains poured in from various parts of the capital.

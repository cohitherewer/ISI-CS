          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Singh                          
	New Delhi, June 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today defended the decision to raise oil prices, terming the hike only modest and stressing that the government and oil companies continued to bear a substantial burden of the global oil shock to protect the aam aadmi.        
	We wish to protect as large a section of our society as possible from its effects. This has been at great cost to government finances and to the economy as a whole, he said.                  
	In his address to the nation this evening, he highlighted the need for the nation and individuals to conserve energy and thus contribute to national security.        
	I urge every citizen to conserve energy at every step, every minute of the day. Be it petrol, diesel, kerosene, LPG, electricity or even water  let us learn to save and use efficiently. Let us reduce wasteful consumption of petrol.        
	Singh invoked the idea of evolving a social conscience in the European mould and suggested development was not just about better lifestyles but crafting a vision for the future. He said the aam aadmi would feel safe, secure and hopeful about the future when people stopped thinking about themselves and the present.        
	According to Singh, development was not about enjoying its fruits but pondering over what was good for future generations, for the welfare and security of our children, grandchildren and their children. It is our duty to ensure their food security and energy security.        
	He maintained the hike was part of that process.        
	Singh also wove in nuclear energy, though tangentially. Saying India would have to develop alternative energy sources, he added: We cannot remain captive to uncertain markets and unsure sources of supply. We have to develop renewable sources of energy, including nuclear energy.        
	But he balanced its mention with a lengthy exposition of his governments social agenda. ...Our country has marched as one of the worlds fastest growing economies. This has enabled us to generate revenues that have been invested for the welfare of our people.         
	The Congress backed the governments decision, saying it had to choose between a rock and a hard resting place. On one hand, you risked closing down the economic engines of the nation and, on the other, you had to bite the bullet. In the interest of the nation, the government decided to bite the bullet, said spokesperson Manish Tewari.        
	Congress sources said the party would neither be defensive nor resort to damage control. Whatever was played out was done in a transparent manner. We hope good sense prevails among the people, a source said.        
	Singh supplied his party with a list of talking points. Stating that Nature had not blessed India with oil as it had with food and, therefore, made it dependent on imports, he said: There are limits to which we can keep consumer prices unaffected.        
	The Prime Minister said if the oil companies continued to bleed, they would have no money to import crude oil.         
	He also warned that issuing bonds and loading deficits on oil companies were not a permanent solution. We are only passing on our burden to our children who will have to repay this debt.

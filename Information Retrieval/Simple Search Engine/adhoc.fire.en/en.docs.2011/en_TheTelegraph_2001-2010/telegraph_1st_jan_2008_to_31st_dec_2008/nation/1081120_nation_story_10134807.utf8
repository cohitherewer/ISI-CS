          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: A man who taught his son to think of his estranged wife as a witch has lost custody of the child to the mother.        
	The Supreme Court today frowned on the tendency to tutor and turn the child against the other parent, and dismissed the fathers appeal against a high court ruling that ordered him to return the child to the mother for wilfully poisoning his mind.        
	The apex court said children were neither mere chattels nor toys of parents and must be allowed to grow up with a healthy regard for both.        
	Absolute right of parents over destinies and lives of their children must yield to considerations of their welfare as human beings so that they may grow up in a normal balanced manner to be useful members of the society the court said.        
	Gaurav Nagpal had forcibly separated his son from his wife Sumedha shortly after the childs birth in November 1997, claiming that she had abandoned the kid.        
	He claimed the child was happy and contented living in a large joint family and was afraid of going back to his mother. He also said his estranged wife, a Delhi schoolteacher who lived in a small flat with her father, would not be able to continue the expensive schooling the child was getting.        
	Nagpal later won interim custody from a lower court. When his wife challenged the order, her appeal was thrown out on the ground that the child would be uprooted from his surroundings.        
	When Nagpal kept denying his wife visitation rights, Sumedha moved the high court. The high court, which had earlier upheld the lower courts ruling, gave the childs custody back to the mother.        
	Should the child be permitted to stay with a father, who inculcates fear and apprehension in the mind of (a) minor against his mother and thwarts court orders with impunity, the high court had wondered before handing back custody to Sumedha.        
	The minor child must be allowed to grow up with a healthy regard for both parents. A parent who poisons the minors mind against the other parent cannot be stated to act for the welfare of the minor, the high court said.        
	Nagpal then moved the Supreme Court, which dismissed his appeal.        
	The court said welfare of the child should be of paramount consideration while deciding custody cases. Moral and ethical welfare of the child must also weigh with the court as well as its physical well-being, it added.         
	While dismissing Nagpals plea, the apex court also urged courts to focus more on saving marriages than breaking them, especially if children were involved.

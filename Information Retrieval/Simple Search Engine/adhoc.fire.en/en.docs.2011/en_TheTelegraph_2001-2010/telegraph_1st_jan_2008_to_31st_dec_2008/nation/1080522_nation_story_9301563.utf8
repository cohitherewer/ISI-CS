        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, May 21: The 3,485 candidates who would take the Orissa Civil Service (Mains) Examination-2006 might have to wait a bit longer.         
	The preliminary test was conducted more than a year ago and was taken by (approximately) 35,000 candidates.         
	Its results were published by January.         
	Then, the plan was to start the main examinations from May 27.         
	But an order by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) directing the Orissa Public Service Commission (OPSC) to recast the preliminary results and re-conduct the test after a gap of three months has triggered fresh uncertainty.        
	As things stand today, aspirants may have to wait for another year if the SAT order is implemented, as institutions (examination centres) would not be available for the 27-day of continuous tests (May 27-June 24) till the next summer vacation.         
	We have challenged the SAT order in the high court, said a senior OPSC official today. The case is expected to be taken up for hearing by the vacation bench later this week, he added.        
	The OPSC ran into trouble when candidates, who had failed to qualify for the OCS (main) Examination-2006, moved the SAT alleging that lesser number of candidates were short-listed for the mains.         
	The board had advertised for 381 posts and the protocol states that 12 times the number of posts advertised (4,572) should have been short-listed for the tests.         
	Acting on it, the chairman of SAT, Haraprasad Das, directed the OPSC last week to declare more candidates eligible for the main tests to conform to the norm and re-conduct the test after three months.        
	The delay is ironical.         
	The OPSC had issued an advertisement in August 2006 inviting applications for the civil service examination for 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 to fill up the 381 Class-II posts in the Orissa Administrative Service and Orissa Finance Service after a gap of six years.        
	For now, OPSCs administrative officer L.N. Mishra has filed petitions in the high court challenging the SAT order.         
	The order does not serve the general interest, but of only a few, Mishra has pleaded, while citing non-availability of institutions to serve as examination centres after three months.

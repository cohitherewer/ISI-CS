          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 26: The Orissa government is contemplating a special battalion for security of VIPs and strategic installations in the wake of last months Mumbai terrorist attacks.         
	A proposal to this effect was mooted at a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy recently to review internal security.        
	According to the proposal, the special battalion will look after the security of ancient temples like Jagannath temple in Puri and Sun temple in Konark, strategic installations like the secretariat and the Assembly and VIPs. Around 800 personnel would be recruited for this purpose, said a senior home department official.        
	The special battalion would be engaged exclusively for the high-profile security purposes and not in law and order duty, he added. A special security zone would be created taking the secretariat and the Assembly at Bhubaneswar, while separate security arrangements would be made for the high court in Cuttack.        
	Entry of vehicles would not be allowed inside the secretariat premises and closed-circuit TV cameras would be installed at strategic points, said the official. Besides, there would be a dedicated wing of the police commissionerate for intelligence gathering for which 138 officers and officials would be posted under the supervision of an assistant commissioner of police. A separate wing of the police would also be created to look after the security of industrial installations on the lines of Central Industrial Security Force.         
	Suggestions given by the Union home ministry for security of big shopping malls, hotels and important highrise buildings were also discussed at the meeting. It was decided that security aspect of highrise buildings above five storeys would be thoroughly examined by the police commissionerate before according approval to the building plan. A senior police officer would be nominated to the building approval committee of the Bhubaneswar Development Authority.         
	Conditions like provision of separate entrance and exit, adequate parking space, installation of closed-circuit TV cameras, metal detectors and centralised locking system would be imposed prior to approval of the building plans of shopping malls, hotels and highrise buildings.

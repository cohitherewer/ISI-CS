	New Delhi, Jan. 28 (PTI): The Indian Medical Association today set up a three-member team to probe the Gurgaon kidney racket and asked the government to relax stringent laws to make organ transplant easier.        
	Doctors who indulge in illegal practices should be punished, IMA national president M. Abbas said.        
	IMA recommends that a liberal approach is required, so that more willing members may be able to donate their organs, he said.

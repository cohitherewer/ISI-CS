	Kuala Lumpur, June 21 (PTI): A man of Indian origin who was sentenced to 36 years in jail for repeatedly raping his minor daughter has appealed for a lighter term on the ground that he had used a condom.        
	Justice should be tempered with mercy, the New Strait Times today quoted the rapists lawyer S.I. Rajah as saying. The accused used a condom every time he committed the offence.        
	The accused appealed against the sentence, the lawyer said, because it was his first offence and he was remorseful for his action.        
	But judge Tengku Baharudin shot back in anger: You mean, it is okay to rape using a condom?         
	The appellate court said the sentence given by the sessions court was appropriate.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Terror-track cops turn to clubs

	Calcutta, Dec. 24: Police are counting on Calcuttans to help them track down the single-storey house in Kamarhati where three suspected bombers spent the night of December 17 before heading to Jammu, where they were caught on Sunday.        
	The police patrolled the north Calcutta neighbourhood, spoke to residents and asked if they had seen any of the alleged terrorists. The North 24-Parganas unit of the CID was also told to get into action.        
	Finding out the house is a tough task because the area comprises more than 60,000 premises where people reside either as owners or as tenants. Besides, our counterparts in Jammu did not give us any specific information about the possible location of the single-storey house, a CID official said.        
	But Manas Mukherjee, the secretary of the Kamarhati Club Samanway Committee, which co-ordinates between the 235 para clubs, was more optimistic. If members of every club take the initiative, tracing the house will not be impossible, he said.        
	Officers of Belgharia police station held a meeting with the committee to ask the clubs  often just a room with a television set  to carry out a door-to-door survey to find out if anyone had noticed three outsiders. Mukherjee said the request had been conveyed to all the clubs.         
	Gobindo Ganguly, the chairman of the Kamarhati municipality, said all 35 councillors were on the job. Since they know their area better, the councillors efforts might help the police locate the house.        
	The municipality has a population of 2.7 lakh.        
	Jammu and Kashmir police had revealed that the three men, who were planning a Marriott-style attack, had entered India from Bangladesh.        
	An officer of Belgharia police station said they had contacted the municipal authorities to get a list of house owners. Kamarhati, he added, had a huge shanty area. Our efforts are on to find out the hideout, but we are depending more on the information given by local people.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kapil is captain once more, at dinner table

	London, June 26: Kapil Dev may have fallen out with the BCCI over the ICL-IPL rivalry but what became clear last night at Lords is that the members of the victorious 1983 World Cup team regard him as one of the most inspirational heroes India has produced in modern times.         
	Twenty-five years may have passed since India vanquished the West Indies but most still revere him their leader.         
	Their sentiments were summed up by Ravi Shastri who told a 25th anniversary dinner held in the Long Room at Lords that Kapils arrival in Indian cricket was very refreshing.         
	Shastri appeared to mean it when he declared: Kapil is one of the greatest players to have graced the game on the world stage.         
	Last nights dinner saw the largest gathering of Indians to have taken place in the Long Room, the inner sanctum of the headquarters of cricket from where women were once banned.         
	Under chandeliers and in a mellow room decorated with cricket memorabilia and portraits of past legends such as W.G. Grace, the vegetarians struggled with the menu (Carpaccio of Roasted Red Pepper, Beetroot of Ricotta Ravioli, and Seasonal Risotto), while the non-veg lot fared somewhat better (Smoked Scottish Salmon, Rump of Lamb).         
	Kapil, who is now one short of his personal 50, managed rather well for a man who admitted he had very little English when he first came into the game.         
	He ribbed his team members, as he introduced them one by one.         
	Balwinder Singh Sandhu, for example, had been hit on the head by a short pitched delivery from the (late) West Indian fast bowler, Malcolm Marshall, whereupon umpire Dickie Bird had remonstrated: Malcolm, you cant bowl that to a number 11 batsman!         
	A contrite Malcolm had walked up to Sandhu and said, Sorry, whereupon the latter had sarcastically tapped his turban: What do you think, Im stupid? Do you think I keep my brain in there?         
	Joking apart, Kapil recalled the remarkable ball with which Sandhu had bowled the West Indian opener, Gordon Greenidge, and started the slide. It had cut in sharply, a ball which most Indians had never seen before: Only a Sardar can do something like that.         
	As an after-dinner speaker, Kapil has certainly come along.         
	He listed the players, among them Dilip Vengsarkar, who had not been able to play because of an injury  If he had, our score would have been 283 (instead of 183).         
	He introduced Roger Binny (my best friend and the heart of the Indian team); Sandeep Patil (we have wanted to rub shoulders with him because he has acted in movies); and the unique Yashpal Sharma.         
	He called Madan Lal earthy said Krishnamachari Srikkanth was a genius with twitchy eyes and that Syed Kirmani was always late, never been known to be on time for anything, but never late to take a catch.         
	Mohinder Amarnath, who was the Man of the Match, belonged to a family which had given India many happy memories  his father (Lala Amarnath) had played for India while Shastri was born to play cricket and was now one of the finest cricket commentators.         
	The media had made much of his allegedly difficult relationship with Sunil Gavaskar  however, if you have differences, it does not mean you dont respect each other.         
	He reminded the new generation of cricket lovers who may not have been aware of this but, batting without a helmet, Gavaskar had broken the back of the West Indian fast bowling and the West Indies then had the worlds fastest bowlers.         
	Before the dinner, Kapil had spoken to journalists about the deep impact of 1983.         
	Beating the West Indies, every moment was very, very special, he said.         
	Could India repeat the glory?         
	We would like to see the next World Cup (to be contested in 2011) back in India, he responded. I feel very good (about Indias chances), the team looks very good and they are playing very good cricket. They just need a little bit of luck.         
	Gavaskar, who looked relaxed sitting next to Kapil, nodded in agreement.         
	Yes, why not, as Kapil said India is developing into a very good one day side, he pointed out.         
	(But) one of the shortcomings seems to be that unlike that 1983 team, when we had so many all rounders  which meant that Kapil had plenty of options of batting order as well as bowling changes  if India can get those kinds of all rounders, then we will be pretty much for winning the world cup. There is always a first time, no host country has ever won the World Cup and I am hoping that in 2011, India will be able to break that jinx.         
	The Indian players who turned up at Lords yesterday looked smart in their grey, galabundh suits and remarkably fit, too, though Kapil doubted he would now be able even to walk to the middle in his pads.         
	The 1983 World Cup victory had changed the lives of everyone in the team, he said. It had also brought them material wealth.         
	But the love and affection we have got over the past week  and the last 25 years  no money can compare with that, he said humbly.

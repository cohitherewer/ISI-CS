          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: Orissa government will execute an integrated action plan of Rs 53 crore for the coming five years for the protection of elephants and prevention of man-animal conflict.         
	A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today.         
	The decision assumes significance in the wake of growing incidents of elephant attacks and poaching of the animals in the state.         
	There are reports from across the state about elephant herds straying into human habitation in search of food because of loss of habitat.         
	Recently, a tusker had strayed into the capital city from the nearby Chandka elephant sanctuary and damaged a vehicle and injuring five persons.         
	Under the integrated action plan, there is a proposal to set up a special squad to prevent poaching, cruelty to the animal and development of their habitats. It was also decided to procure trained elephants from Assam to chase a truant beast back from a human habitation to the habitat. Besides, boundary walls with iron rails would be raised around Chandka elephant sanctuary to prevent straying.        
	It was informed by the wildlife officers that the elephant population in Chandka sanctuary  on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar city  was 67, a number higher compared to the sanctuary area. It was evident that many among the herds had strayed from the sanctuary.         
	There are 1,862 elephants living in the 11 wildlife sanctuaries of Orissa.

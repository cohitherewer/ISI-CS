The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State BJP hits out at Centre
                                                                                                            State BJP hits out at Centre
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: Keeping an eye on the ensuing elections, the BJP today raised the bogey of neglect and apathy of the Congress-led UPA government towards Orissa.         
	The party also played the Hindu card by castigating the Centre and the UPA-ruled states move to set aside 15 per cent of the budgetary allocation for minorities.        
	A resolution to this effect was adopted at the meeting of an extended state executive, which concluded here this evening.        
	BJP state unit president Suresh Pujari said the party would launch a state-wide campaign against the Centre for the neglect and apathy.        
	Flaying the UPA government for its discrimination, Pujari alleged that the Union government had either reduced the flow of central assistance to BJP and BJD-led Orissa.         
	Citing an instance of the apathy, the leader said while the Centre chose to release central aid to the UPA-ruled flood-hit states, flood assistance to the NDA-ruled Orissa was meagre.        
	The UPA government also turned down the states request to retain 10 lakh BPL families in the list.         
	Similarly, economic condition of the farming community has deteriorated due to the faulty policies of the UPA government, alleged the party resolution.        
	The party demanded an agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 50,000, disbursement of 30 per cent bank loan to the farm sector, a reduction in the interest rate on crop loan to 4 per cent and fixing the minimum support price for rice minimum at Rs 1,000 per quintal.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh had announced at a recent rally in Sambalpur that the NDA government would provide all the above benefits to the farmers if it came back to power at the Centre.        
	The BJP state executive also condemned the UPA move of communal budgeting and introducing reservation for Dalits stating that it would indirectly encourage religious conversion.         
	Its unfortunate that the UPA government is trying to divide the country on communal lines, said the BJP executive.

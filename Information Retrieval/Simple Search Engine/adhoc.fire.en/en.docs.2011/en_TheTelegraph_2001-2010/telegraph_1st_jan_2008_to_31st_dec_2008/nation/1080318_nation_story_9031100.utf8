	Bhubaneswar, March 17: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today told the Assembly that eight strike-force squads engaging some 50 retired defence personnel have been constituted along with two sections of armed police reserve force to prevent poaching and deforestation in the Simlipal national park.        
	Along with that, some 716 youths have been engaged as tiger protection force volunteers. The chief minister mentioned all this while talking about the recent report on tiger population in Simlipal submitted by the Dehra Dun-based Wildlife Institute of India.         
	The report called State of tiger, co-predators and prey in India has stated that the number of big cats in Simlipal, Indias fourth-largest tiger reserve is within 20.         
	If the report is true then the numbers have drastically dipped from the 101  claimed by wildlife officials.         
	Talking in the Assembly today, the chief minister assured that the state has been active in guarding the forests. He added that 94 anti-smuggling and anti-poaching camps have been set up in the sanctuary area.         
	Fourteen forest gates have also been set up to prevent smuggling of forest produce. Sixty-five wireless stations have been set up and mobile patrolling parties have been formed in each of the four forest divisions to take up surprise patrolling in the area.         
	Along with that 143 eco-development committees have been constituted in the villages both within and outside Simlipal forests to check illicit felling and poaching and to assist forest department officials in this regard, said Naveen, who holds the forest portfolio.         
	Public awareness generation programmes have been taken up in villages in and around Similpal to protection wildlife, he added.

	New Delhi, July 9: The Centres rural roads scheme under the flagship Bharat Nirman programme appears to have hit a bump in the Congresss own backyard.        
	A review of Bharat Nirman projects across India, released by the Union rural development ministry, reveals that the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has fared the worst in Congress-ruled states.        
	For instance, Haryana, ruled by the Congress since 2004, hadnt completed a single project under the roads scheme by March 2008. Militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir has met merely 4 per cent of its target.        
	The Sadak Yojana had kicked off on December 25, 2000, under the NDA and was later brought under Bharat Nirman by the UPA.         
	States under NDA governments have done the best. Punjab, now ruled by the Shiromani Akali Dal, has achieved 85 per cent of the target while BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Gujarat are at 95 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively.        
	The Lefts performance has been inconsistent, with Kerala having achieved 49 per cent while Bengal languishes at 22 per cent.        
	Officials at the Union rural development ministry, which is responsible for the scheme, cited the rising prices of steel and cement. Under the Sadak Yojana, contractors must stick to the rates mentioned in the original tenders without the option of price revisions.        
	Ministry sources said many road projects had been stalled midway because the contractors were unwilling to renew their contracts without a price revision.        
	They added that if the current situation prevailed, it would be tough to complete the scheme before the next general election.        
	Overall, only 35 per cent of the Sadak Yojanas target of connecting 59,536 habitations has been met nation-wide while another 30 per cent is expected to be achieved by 2009.        
	The ministry is now thinking of revising the contracts, and has formed a review committee that is to hand in its report this month.        
	As for the upgrade projects under the scheme, as opposed to building new roads, the DMK government in Tamil Nadu is at the top of the list, having achieved 99 per cent of the target by March 2008.        
	Bengal and Goa have met with zero progress on this front while Kerala and Jammu Kashmir have achieved just 10 per cent.

                                                                                                               SC relief for Yuvraj
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition by an image management company seeking to extend its right to promote Yuvraj Singh.        
	Percept Talent Management Pvt Ltd had filed the appeal against a Bombay High Court order allowing the cricketer to cut his ties with the company after the expiry of his three-year contract.        
	Percept had claimed that under the agreement, the company was the sole agent for managing Yuvrajs endorsements.         
	The cricketer was promised a minimum of Rs 1.5 crore and assured another crore once he was made vice-captain of the team. The agreement, the company said, was valid till December 11, 2007.        
	In the two months after that, Yuvraj was under obligation to revert to the company with any other offer so that it could match the amount, Percept claimed. But Yuvraj did not give it the first-refusal option in the two-month window and instead signed a contract with another company.         
	The cricketer said the contract had expired on October 16, 2007. The apex court said Yuvraj was free to sign a deal with any company. How can you violate a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) (right to practise any trade, occupation or business)? it said.

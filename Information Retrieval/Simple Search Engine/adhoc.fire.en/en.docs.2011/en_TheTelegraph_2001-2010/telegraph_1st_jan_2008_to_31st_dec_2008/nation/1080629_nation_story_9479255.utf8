          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti slips on the bank of the Ganges in Allahabad on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 28: L.K. Advanis perceived overture to the Bahujan Samaj Party at yesterdays Kanpur rally has rocked the BJP.        
	Most senior leaders from Uttar Pradesh believe that if the states voters now begin to club the BJP with Mayavati, the results would be disastrous.        
	Advani had accused the Centre of biased treatment of Opposition-ruled states and said his party would not discriminate against Uttar Pradesh or any other state if it came to power in Delhi. He had also taken care to avoid any critical reference to the Mayavati government.        
	All this strengthened the perception that he was sending positive vibes to the BSP chief minister who has just snapped ties with the Congress.        
	Some party leaders explained Advanis remarks away arguing he had made a general statement that the BJP did not believe in discriminating against states on political grounds.        
	But those from Uttar Pradesh felt alarmed. One asked if it was a genuine mistake or a considered decision to woo the BSP.        
	What has further fuelled speculation is the absence of leaders like Rajnath Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi and Kalyan Singh at the rally. All three are against any alliance with the BSP and their supporters have been wondering if their absence was by decision or by default.        
	Party general secretary Vinay Katiyar, who attended yesterdays rally, said the biggest mistake the BJP made in Uttar Pradesh was allowing the Samajwadi Party to form the government in 2003.        
	We dont accept our role in that but the people believed so. That finished the BJP as people voted for the BSP thinking that the BJP and the SP had a tacit understanding.        
	State leaders are apprehensive the mistake would be repeated. A senior leader said: After the SP, people saw the BSP and got frustrated with it. This was the ideal time for the BJP to emerge as the alternative. But Advaniji has sent a dangerous message. Now people will not vote for us thinking that we are anyway with the BSP.

             Rahul Gandhi: Dhoni?
                    
	Lucknow, Feb. 4: The Congresss Dhoni is padding up to make a clean sweep of Dalit votes in his constituency.
    
	Rahul Gandhi has organised a two-month cricket tournament in Amethi from tomorrow involving Dalit and backward class children.
    
	After the T-20 World Cup victory, party workers had begun dubbing Rahul the M.S. Dhoni of the Congress, saying that like the Indian captain, the MP would win the next big political match in 2009  the general elections. 
    
	I have no doubt that Rahul Gandhi will return the compliment by decisively winning the next big match, a Congress leader had said.
    
	The official reason for The Rajiv Gandhi Cricket Tournament is to encourage young sporting talents from rural areas. 
    
	Congress office-bearers said Rahul was looking to foster a spirit of camaraderie among youngsters of the region, which has thrown up a star like medium pacer R.P. Singh.
    
	But sources said the tournament was part of Rahuls Project Dalits. He had slept in a Dalit familys hut in Amethi on the night of January 26, making Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati sleepless.
    
	The tournament will feature 1,200 teams from 726 village panchayats of Amethi, said Bhola Tiwari, a secretary in Rahuls office. The winners will receive a cash prize of Rs 3 lakh, Ramakrishnan, Rahuls aide in Amethi, added. 
    
	The participants will be provided cricket kits, organisers said.
    
	Rahul Gandhi will be the chief guest in the tournament final, Jagdish Piyus, a Congress worker in Amethi, said. 
    
	The matches will be played at the B.R. Ambedkar stadium, which had seen Rahul try his hand at cricket when he visited his constituency in November last year. 
    
	Shedding his trademark white kurta-pyjama and donning a white T-shirt and black track pants, the 37-year-old Congress general secretary had batted well, according to party workers.

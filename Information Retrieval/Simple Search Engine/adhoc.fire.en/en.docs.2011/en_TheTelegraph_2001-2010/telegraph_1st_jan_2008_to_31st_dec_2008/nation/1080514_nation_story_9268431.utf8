          SUJAN DUTTA                          AK Antony                                              
	New Delhi, May 13: The top brass in military headquarters is agonising over whether to grant women permanent commission in the armed forces and draft them into combat roles.         
	The suggestion of granting full-fledged commission to women officers on a par with men came from defence minister A.K. Antony recently.        
	But a quiet march has been stolen over the armed forces by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which has put a woman in charge of its strategic missile development programme.         
	Tessy Thomas of the Advanced Systems Laboratory in Hyderabad has been made the project director for an advanced variant of the Agni series of missiles.         
	The details of the nature of her project are being kept hush-hush but it is likely that she would oversee the development of a missile for the navy.         
	I have been the guidance designer for the Agni missiles, Thomas told The Telegraph over the phone from Hyderabad. I can tell you that I am the associate project director (missions) looking after the Agni missile for the last one-and-a-half years. Now I am involved in the full-fledged development of a project.         
	Thomas has been involved in the development of Agni missiles for nearly 20 years. She was in the team of scientists led by Avinash Chander, director of the Hyderabad laboratory, which successfully test-fired the 3,000km-range Agni III from Wheelers Island, off Orissa last week.         
	I suppose I am in the team because I am a scientist doing her job. In fact, there were seven women at the site of the launch of the Agni III from different labs. There are women engaged in this kind of work in a number of places, she said. But she is still the pioneering missile woman  being the first to be put in charge of a full-scale strategic programme.         
	I have been with the Agni group for 20 years, said the 45-year-old Thomas.         
	At the DRDO headquarters here, where awards were given away by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday, a colleague of hers pulled her leg, calling her Agni Putri.        
	There were few women when I joined the DRDO. Now I think there are about 20, she said.

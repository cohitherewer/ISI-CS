          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Chidambaram: Magician                                  
	Mumbai, March 24: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has kept a headroom of over Rs 26,000 crore in Budget 2008 that will help him pick up the tab for the civil servants pay increase from January 2006.        
	Chidambaram has not made any provision for the pay hike in the budget  but like a deft magician he has kept an ace up his sleeve.         
	After the budget, Chidambaram had said he had enough headroom to pay for the pay increase for civil servants.         
	A quick glance through the budget documents shows exactly how big that headroom is: Rs 26,518.85 crore.        
	The total payout amounts to Rs 30,621 crore  Rs 12,561 crore for the salary increase this year and another Rs 18,060 crore for the arrears since January 2006. However, the commission has recommended that the arrears be staggered over two years, so Chidambarams headroom will be more than sufficient to cover the costs in 2008-09.         
	How do we arrive at this headroom figure?         
	Chidambarams calculations in the budget have been predicated on the assumption that the gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices will rise to Rs 53,03,770 crore. He is assuming that GDP at current prices will grow at 13 per cent over the advance estimate of Rs 46,93,602 crore for 2007-08.        
	Budget 2008 projected a fiscal deficit of Rs 1,33,287 crore, or 2.5 per cent of GDP. In absolute terms, this is 11.7 per cent lower than the fiscal deficit of Rs 1,50,948 crore in 2007-08.         
	Chidambarams projection of the fiscal deficit is a gross under-estimation: no finance minister till date has been able to cap fiscal deficit at under 3 per cent of GDP.         
	A slim document that accompanies the budget papers  Statements under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003  gives the game away.        
	The FRBM act envisages an annual reduction of at least 0.3 percentage points in fiscal deficit and 0.5 percentage points in revenue deficit.        
	The mandate is to eliminate revenue deficit and reduce fiscal deficit to not more than 3 per cent of GDP by 31st March, 2009, says this document.         
	In 2005-06, the fiscal deficit amounted to Rs 1,46,435 crore or 4.1 per cent of GDP. And in 2006-07, it was put at Rs 1,42,573 crore, or 3.5 per cent of GDP.        
	In the current year, the finance minister has revised his fiscal deficit estimate to Rs 1,43,653 crore or 3.1 per cent of GDP.         
	Clearly then, there is no reason why Chidambaram should shoot for a tougher and improbable fiscal deficit target of 2.5 per cent of GDP.         
	It is evident that he has kept a headroom of 0.5 per cent of GDP  which works out to Rs 26,518.85 crore  to meet the exigencies of an election year.        
	This suggests the government can seek Parliaments approval for a supplementary grant  a usual practice to meet additional expenditure  without falling foul of the FRBM Act.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: The Congress today took L.K. Advani apart for pleading ignorance about the terrorist swap during the Kandahar hijack in a TV interview.         
	Advanis social call on Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh on Holi cut no ice with the Congress as it tore into the BJPs Prime Minister-in-waiting.        
	General secretary Digvijay Singh said it was unbelievable that as home minister in the erstwhile NDA government Advani would not have been taken into confidence. If it is indeed a fact, it reflects on the functioning of the NDA government, he said.         
	Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi also spoke at length on the BJP leader. Advanis biography, or shall I say hagiography, follows a simple principle: whatever good happened is attributable to me, whatever went wrong is attributable to you, he said.

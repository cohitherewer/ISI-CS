The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taslima leaves with a threat
                                                                                                               Taslima leaves with a threat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Taslima: Bitter goodbye                                  
	New Delhi, March 19: Taslima Nasreen left India today, pouring scorn on her host for years.        
	The Bangladeshi author, who had been put up in a Delhi safe house since being forced to leave Calcutta late last year, boarded a British Airways flight to London early this morning.         
	She was to take a connecting flight out of Heathrow, perhaps to Sweden, whose passport she holds.        
	The author, who had been railing at the Indian government for putting her under virtual house arrest for the past five months, had no kind words as she bid goodbye, probably for good.        
	Before stepping into the BA aircraft, she apparently told security officials accompanying her that she would go around Europe exposing the way a supposed secular democratic country had treated her.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to go to Beijing for the bilateral conference that China wanted to host to mark 20 years of Rajiv Gandhis historic handshake with Deng Xiaoping in December 1988.         
	Congress sources said this had nothing to do with the frost in Indias relations with China after Beijings dubious role at the Nuclear Suppliers Group meeting.        
	China remains our friend and we should strengthen our collaborations on every front, a source said.        
	The source explained that for Rahul, domestic politics takes precedence in an election year over diplomatic engagements. By the end of 2008, Rahul expects to be neck-deep in work, preparing the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections.        
	A member of the Congresss foreign cell said off the record that it would be a struggle for Rahul to try and please Beijing after China first raised and then lowered the temperature at the NSG meeting.        
	Officially, the Congresss chief spokesperson, M. Veerappa Moily, said: I do not think we should develop cold feet on account of China. On the diplomatic front, it is a very important country for us and we should not take a hard stand on the recent events.

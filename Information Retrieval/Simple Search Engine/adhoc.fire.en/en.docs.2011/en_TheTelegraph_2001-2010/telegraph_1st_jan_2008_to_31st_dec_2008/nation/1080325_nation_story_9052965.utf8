          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 24: The piquant situation in Cuttacks municipal politics owing to the recently concluded delimitation exercise took a new turn with Orissa High Court issuing an injunction on it today.         
	A two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and R.N. Biswal issued a stay order on a petition challenging the creation of six new wards by splitting of 14 of the existing ones  a move that had left corporators in Cuttack Municipal Council with no wards to seek re-election in the next polls.         
	The interim stay will remain effective till the petition is taken up for hearing on April 15, stated the court, while issuing notices to the urban development department, municipal administration and CMC to file their replies by then.         
	Dharmesh Nayak, the BJD corporator and two others had filed the petition. Nayak represents ward no-2 in the council.         
	He is one of the seven BJD corporators who have been left in the lurch after the rejig.        
	Nine other corporators (five from BJP, three from Congress and one from the CPI) face a similar plight.

  - Govt plans village task force to battle timber mafia        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Simplipal Biosphere Reserve: Conservation drive                                        
	Cuttack, Oct. 8: The state government has prepared an ambitious plan to conserve the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve. It has decided to commission a task force of local villagers to battle the timber mafia, who have been pilfering natural resources at the countrys sixth largest biosphere reserve.        
	The comprehensive programme being planned to preserve the bio-diversity of the reserve would involve special organisations, besides local participation. The government plans a symbiotic relationship with the members of the task force. The latter will be provided with health and education benefits and self-employment opportunities.        
	The government decision has apparently been prompted by an Orissa High Court order last month seeking an affidavit on the steps being taken to protect the reserve.         
	The court directive came on a PIL that sought judicial intervention against illegal felling of trees.        
	Spread over a total area of 5,569sqkm, the reserve  a 10km wide belt  covers the Simlipal Sanctuary and the adjoining Nato and Satkosia reserve forests. The transition zone has 1,200 villages with a population of about 4.5 lakh, 73 per cent being tribals. The Simlipal hill ranges, a densely forested area, constitute the core and a part of the buffer zone of the biosphere reserve. There are 65 villages within these two zones.        
	The action plan, a forest department official said, envisaged participatory eco-forestation activities involving local communities. A bio-diversity survey would be conducted with the help of the Botanical Survey of India and the Zoological Survey of India. Availability of grazing land and improved methods of sighting animals would be another priority area that would receive attention with assistance from the Wildlife Institute of India.         
	The Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, and the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, will form part of the advisory group that will help form the task force.

	London, Nov. 9 (PTI): Highly skilled migrants applying for a UK visa will have to show a bank balance that can support them and their families during their initial months in Britain.        
	The visa seekers must show they have at least the equivalent of 2,800 (Rs 2.1 lakh) for themselves and 1,600 (Rs 1.2 lakh) for each family member or 7,600 (Rs 5.7 lakh) for a family of four, Home Office guidelines indicate.        
	The rules also require overseas students who want to study in Britain for 12 months or more to show they have 9,600 (Rs 7.2 lakh) for themselves and 535 (Rs 40,000) for each dependant in addition to funds to pay their fees in full.        
	A Home Office spokesperson said that the 2,800 represented a cash reserve for highly skilled migrants to support themselves for just over three months since they were not entitled to public funds.         
	The student rate of 800 (Rs 60,000) a month followed a British Council recommendation. We think this is a fair, reasonable amount to require them to have, the spokesperson said.        
	According to the Home Office guidelines, pensioners from non-European Union countries will be barred from moving to the UK after retirement.        
	Existing EU legislation allows non-residents aged 60 and above to retire to Britain if they have a net disposable yearly income of at least 25,000 (Rs 18.75 lakh) and are able to accommodate themselves and any dependants without public funds.        
	They are not required to have worked or paid taxes in Britain and are entitled to free health care on arrival. After five years, they have full access to the benefit system and are also entitled to apply for settlement and a British passport.        
	The Home Office is preparing to change the rules, saying the policy does not fit in with the idea of earned citizenship. It is difficult to reconcile the existence and entitlements of this route with the governments conviction that citizenship should be earned and that migrants must demonstrate certain requirements in order to progress on their journey, it said.

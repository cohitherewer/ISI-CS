The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong gets used to red rag
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cong gets used to red rag
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 2: The Congress is slowly coming to terms with the political call it had been waiting for nearly two weeks.        
	In other words, rapprochement with the Samajwadi Party  red rag to Sonia Gandhi not so long ago.        
	The party isnt sure what price the Samajwadis would extract for their support but sources said the Congress was coming round to the view that if a deal was struck, it would make the best of it.        
	Last year, when the government looked shaky after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs dare to Prakash Karat, nobody had conceptualised a Plan-B with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh as the fulcrum to draw the numbers needed to win a trust vote.        
	Mulayam was branded a third-fronter, embedded in the CPM-friendly United National Progressive Alliance. Amar was snubbed by Sonia for barging into a dinner she hosted for her UPA and Left friends.        
	With past ghosts yet to be buried, nobody in the Congress headquarters had an inkling that Sonia might not be averse to the Samajwadis if they helped save her coalition and the nuclear deal.        
	It appears that even senior party functionaries working in Uttar Pradesh  where the proposed arrangement could impact and change political dynamics  were clueless.        
	The Prime Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad were the only ones in the loop when the back-up plan was being put in place.        
	NCP chief Pawar is an old friend of Mulayam, while Lalu Prasad was an on-off ally.        
	Mukherjee has known Amar for several years. The Samajwadi leader cut his political teeth in the Bengal Congress and was secretary of the Calcutta District Congress Committee and an AICC member.        
	The Congresss worry is about pulls and pressures the Samajwadi would inflict on the government.        
	Samajwadi sources said while they would like to be part of the government to give it stability, their expectations would be reasonable.

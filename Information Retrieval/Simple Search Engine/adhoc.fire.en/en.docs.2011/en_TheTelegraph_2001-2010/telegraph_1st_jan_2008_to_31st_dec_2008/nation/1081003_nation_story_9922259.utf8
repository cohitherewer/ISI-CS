          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Agartala, Oct. 2: Militant attacks used to be targeted killings in Tripura, with the bullets virtually having the names of the victims written on them.        
	Last nights Agartala blasts  the first urban bomb attacks in the state  mean everyone will now be afraid to step out of home, not knowing when, whom or where the terrorists might strike.        
	The five market blasts in the run-up to the pujas could hold a scary message for Calcutta, too: the countrywide pattern of city bombings has now virtually reached the Bengal capitals backyard.        
	Another frightening aspect is the possible role  direct or indirect  being attributed to the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji) of Bangladesh, linked to bombings in various cities across India, from Varanasi to Hyderabad.        
	Till now, militancy in the Northeast had centred mainly on local ethnic or nationalistic issues, and so Calcutta  if not north Bengal  had seemed safe despite its proximity to the region.        
	Tripura police chief Pranay Sahay today drew a parallel with bomb strikes elsewhere in the country, where the militants aim was to trigger panic in the middle of the festival season.        
	In Delhis Mehrauli and Maharashtras Malegaon, bikes had been used in the explosions, a tactic also employed in one of the five Agartala blasts.        
	Bangladeshi militants, Sahay suggested, had so far used Tripura  whose border with the neighbouring country stretches 856km  as a corridor and not a target.         
	However, the state police, unlike yesterday, were cautious about blaming Huji directly but the overall impression was that even if a northeastern outfit had carried out the blasts, it would have received help from the Bangladeshi outfit.         
	Sahay said the CID had been asked to investigate the explosions, which left 120 injured, 51 of whom are still under treatment.         
	Six persons are being questioned but havent been arrested.        
	Four of them were drunken youths nabbed around 10 last night, 30 minutes before the last explosion. They were passing through Colonel Chowmuhuni, close to the site where a bomb had been found in a bag and defused, in a Tata Indica. Their driver, too, was detained.        
	This morning, a smuggler, Nurul Amin, who lives close to the Bangladesh border, was picked up for questioning.        
	All six have been detained for interrogation, not arrested. They may be taken into custody if we find evidence, said Tripura (west) police chief K.V. Sreejesh.        
	Explosives experts from the National Security Guards in Delhi and forensic scientists led by R.K. Kuila from Calcuttas Central Forensic Institute have examined the blast sites.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to chief minister Manik Sarkar this morning, assuring him central help with the probe.        
	The state has declared a compensation of Rs 5,000 for each of the injured.         
	The blasts dampened Id celebrations. Puja shopping also took a beating. The ruling CPM will organise a protest rally tomorrow.

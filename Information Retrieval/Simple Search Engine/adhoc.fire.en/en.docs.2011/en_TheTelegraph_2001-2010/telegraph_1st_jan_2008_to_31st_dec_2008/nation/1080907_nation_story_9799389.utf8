	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Parties from two ends of the spectrum, the BJP and the Left, today used the same language in their reaction to the Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver: a black day for India.        
	Such like-mindedness would add to the BJPs embarrassment at a time the party that swears by nationalism is trying to explain why it is against a development that saw the global community join hands to end Indias nuclear isolation.        
	However, asked if the party was not swimming against the tide of national sentiments, BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said: It is the government and the Congress which are trying to create an impression that there is cause for celebration. We think it is a black day for India as we have accepted curbs on our sovereignty.        
	It seems that India has given up its claim on transferring dual-use technology, a CPI statement said. If this has been accepted then it is not a historic day but a black day for India. Indias sovereignty has been compromised and its nuclear programme killed.        
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said: Initially it appears that India has neither got a clean nor an unconditional waiver. If this is the case, it is yet another surrender.        
	Rudy denied that the black day slur would hurt the BJPs poll prospects. It is a nuclear deceit. People will not buy the governments propaganda. The issues that the combined Opposition had raised remain unaddressed. The Prime Ministers claim that India is free to conduct fresh nuclear tests is a bluff.        
	Yashwant Sinha, the partys nuclear expert, said he would make a formal statement only after scrutinising the draft. But he said: India has for ever lost the right to conduct nuclear tests. The NSG waiver has come after so many deliberations. Obviously there have been give-aways by India.        
	The BJPs younger lot are, however, wary about a wrong message going out to the urban middle class, and some senior leaders are finding it hard to stomach the Chinese role. We certainly detest standing in the same queue as the Left when China brazenly pursues its anti-India agenda. We have to carefully formulate our response to such tricky issues, a Rajya Sabha MP said.         
	The BJP has long been grappling with divergent views within the party on the deal. Even its candidate for Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, had at one point probed whether there was an escape route from the strident anti-deal position taken by the party.

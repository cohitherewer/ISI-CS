          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Companies have imported over 200 aircraft in the past two years on false declarations and diverted them for private use, customs officials have said.        
	The department today made public the alleged duty evasions, saying over 70 corporate houses, owners of aircraft more suited to the royalty, misused an exemption facility that does not cover planes for private use.        
	Twelve such flying machines  nine planes and three choppers  have been seized and showcause notices issued to the firms, customs commissioner Anood Swarup said. Six companies have cleared or started clearing their dues, running into Rs 35.67 crore, as the probe continues.        
	Officials put the value of the seized planes at Rs 893 crore but the duties (with penalties) on them could be Rs 1,500 crore if the firms are found guilty of having misused the concessions under Section 111 (d) of the customs act.        
	The duty in case of personal use is 28 per cent of an aircrafts value. The penalty can go up to five times the duty evaded.        
	The lid was blown off the matter last month when two luxury jets Reliance Industries boss Mukesh Ambani had gifted to wife Nita were impounded on duty-evasion charges. Younger brother Anils plane was seized on similar grounds. Both deposited bonds, equivalent to the aircrafts cost, to get their jets released provisionally.        
	It doesnt take a genius to figure out that the custom-made interiors and bars in these aircraft arent for public use. Some business houses had taken advantage of the duty exemption announced last year for chartered flights, commissioner Swarup said. The exemptions have been offered under the Non-Scheduled Operators Permit scheme, which requires the planes to be made available for non-scheduled and chartered flights.        
	In some instances, the seizures have led to litigation. Two helicopters of Global Vectra Helicorp Pvt Ltd and a Cessna jet each of Bangalores Taneja Aerospace and Calcuttas Dove Airlines of the Usha Martin group were seized last month, prompting the firms to move court.        
	The high courts in Delhi and Calcutta have asked the companies, which refused to hand in bonds for provisional release of the aircraft, to co-operate in the probe.

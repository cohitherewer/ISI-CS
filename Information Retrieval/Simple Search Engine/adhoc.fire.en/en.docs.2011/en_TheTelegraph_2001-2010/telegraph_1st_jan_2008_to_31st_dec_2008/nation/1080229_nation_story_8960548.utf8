The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar varsities bid for central status
                                                                                                               Bihar varsities bid for central status
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 28: First it was Patna University, now Magadh University (MU), too, has joined the race for the status of a central university.         
	According to vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey, Magadh University enjoys a stronger claim on the central status, when compared to Patna University (PU). Magadh University comprises 44 constituent, three minority and 100-odd affiliated colleges.        
	When responding to reports of active lobbying undertaken by PU vice-chancellor Shyam Lal for the coveted status, Pandey retorted that when it came to parameters, MU was on a stronger pitch.         
	The race has intensified following the Union governments move to have at least one central university in each state of the country.         
	Listing Magadhs advantages, Pandey stressed that Patna should lose on the ground of location itself. Located in the most densely populated areas in Patna, the university does not have a peaceful atmosphere that is vital for teaching, learning and research. Compared to Patna University, MU stretches over a sprawling campus spread over an area of more than 600 acres.         
	In academics, too, the vice-chancellor went on to add, Magadh offers more courses than PU and its recently launched academy of foreign languages and the newly established hotel management course were both a hit.         
	On account of its proximity to Bodh Gaya, MU is better placed to attract foreign academic collaborations  he added.         
	In Magadh, university officials are optimistic about a favourable response from the Union HRD ministry.         
	Their confidence has received a boost from the fact that whereas Patna does not have a single minority educational institution (efforts begun recently to accord minority status to Patna Womens College), three of the four minority colleges of the state belong to MU.         
	They add that the poorly maintained PU building is no match for Magadh.         
	B.N. Pandey, while talking to The Telegraph, said that he would appeal to the governor-cum-chancellor, R.S. Gavai, and chief minister Nitish Kumar to lend their weight to MUs request and in its contest with Patna University for the status.

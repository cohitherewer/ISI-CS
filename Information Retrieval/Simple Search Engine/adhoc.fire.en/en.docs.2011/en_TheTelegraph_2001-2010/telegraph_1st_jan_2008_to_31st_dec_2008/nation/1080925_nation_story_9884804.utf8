                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     US war drill pared after Left sting
          SUJAN DUTTA                           AK Antony                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The defence establishment has asked the navy to pare down the international participation for next months Malabar war games after the Left allegation that India and the US were forging an anti-China alliance with militaries of friendly countries.         
	Last year some people said it (the Malabar drill) sent a message and the exercise invited a lot of criticism, defence minister A. K. Antony said here today.        
	Last year something different happened. Instead of an India-US bilateral exercise, a multilateral exercise took place (in the Bay of Bengal) with Australia, Japan and Singapore also participating. Why should some people try to spread misinformation? This year there is no multilateral exercise.         
	Malabar 2007 provoked a demarche from China while the Left in India organised rallies to protest what it suspected was the beginning of an Asian Nato-type military alliance.        
	But the war games continued and the Indian Navy came out with an experience that its officers found novel.         
	Malabar 2008, from October 15-24 off Indias west coast, will also be a complex drill with a mock encounter between a US nuclear-powered submarine and an Indian submarine among the set of manoeuvres that is planned. A flotilla from Carrier Strike Group-7 with the USS Ronald Reagan, the latest US nuclear-powered supercarrier in the lead, will be off Indias west coast for the exercise.         
	This year we will be doing what we have done in the last 16 years and keep it bilateral, the defence minister emphasised.         
	It is nothing new, the exercise (Malabar series) started in 1992, he said.         
	But on the scale of complexity, Malabar 2008 will probably rank higher than most war games the Indian Navy has participated-in with foreign navies.         
	The naval war games will be complex in nature involving anti-submarine warfare manoeuvres, flying operations and cross-deck embarkations, a senior naval officer said.        
	The Indian contingent for Malabar 2008 will be led by the chief of the western naval command, Vice Admiral J.S. Bedi.         
	Last week, an Indian Air Force contingent, including its latest Sukhoi 30 MKI aircraft, returned after a month-long deployment in the US for Red Flag fighter aircraft exercises, among the most complex air-war games hosted by the US Air Force at Nellis.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Flyover to ease traffic in capital
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          For smooth flow                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 4: No traffic police and no traffic signals, but free way for to drive whichever direction someone wants to. When the three-tier flyover is complete in 2010, the city will heave a sigh of relief as far traffic management is concerned.        
	The foundation stone of the flyover project was already laid and work would soon be launched by the state government at a cost of Rs 67.31 crore        
	The six-lane flyover at Rajmahal Square will run between AG Square and Kalpana Square. The 560m flyover will facilitate smooth running of vehicles form both the sides and would be completed in two phases.        
	Besides, the project also includes a four-lane underground road laid between Master Canteen Square and Sishu Bhavan. Land acquisition and eviction would not be a problem, said a senior government official. We wont have to go for eviction. Only some utility shiftings such as pipeline, electricity and telephone connections have to be relaid, said Nalinikant Pradhan, the chief engineer of works department.         
	The existing road, which would stay between the flyover and underground road, will be given a makeover. The project has been planned keeping in mind the growth rate in the next 20 years, said Pradhan.        
	The underground road will be utilised as an air-conditioned market complex connecting Raj Mahal with Ashok Nagar. The traffic structure would have adequate parking provisions from Master Canteen Square to Sishu Bhavan, said works minister A.U. Singhdeo. Moreover, pathway in front of shops and passage for pedestrians would also be laid.        
	The works department has not prepared a detail plan for the underground road yet. The industrial boom in the state requires more such flyovers, said Singhdeo.

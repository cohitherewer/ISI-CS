	New Delhi, July 19: The Mayajaal threatens to take the country by surprise again.        
	While the Congress and the communists have been preparing for what they see as their big showdown and the BJP making a grab at the big pie, Mayavati has burst on the national arena almost unexpected.        
	Whether the government stays or goes, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief could now turn out the big winner of the latest power struggle in Delhi.        
	She had been slow off the blocks but that changed on July 10, when the CBI filed an assets affidavit against her in the Supreme Court, convincing a stunned Mayavati this was a battle for her survival.        
	The turning point was the meeting with CPM chief Prakash Karat. She now had the one thing she had lacked in comparison with Mulayam Singh Yadav  the secular certificate that an association with the Left brings.        
	Karats move set off a chain reaction. Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu, left in the lurch by the Samajwadi Party, gravitated towards Mayavati and declared she could replace Mulayam as the United National Progressive Alliance convener.        
	Now Mayavati has hit Mulayam where it will hurt most by poaching a few of his MPs, especially Shahid Siddiqui.        
	So far, the Muslims have been with the Samajwadis and the Dalits with her. But if Siddiquis defection wins her minority votes  she has already dubbed the nuclear deal anti-Muslim and met leading clerics  Mayavati will have the powerful Dalit-Brahmin-Muslim axis that had once kept the Congress in power in Uttar Pradesh.        
	CPI chief A.B. Bardhan, the Telengana Rashtra Samitis Chandrashekhara Rao and Naidu have declared she should be the next Prime Minister. It has been evident that unlike Mulayam, ever trapped in his image of a regional satrap, Mayavati has gradually been acquiring a pan-Indian aura as a Dalit icon.        
	A Congress Dalit leader summed it up: I was in a Madhya Pradesh village last week among some Jatavs (Mayavatis caste). They said they had just one wish  to see Mayavati as the PM  because the Congress and the BJP would never give the chair to a Dalit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shortage of doctors hits operations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shortage of doctors hits operations
  - Number of anaesthesiologists plummets in Orissa          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Surgeries have been hit in the absence of anaesthesiologists                                        
	Cuttack, Nov. 2: A shortage of anaesthesiologists has hit the government hospitals hard, resulting in delays of non-emergency surgeries stretching thin an already strained work force.        
	The effect of the shortfall of anaesthesiologists is being particularly felt in bigger medical college hospitals in Cuttack, Burla and Berhampur with increase in surgery waiting times.        
	The situation to some extent is attributed to the professions lack of glamour and dwindling number of anaesthesiologists at the entry level of government medical service.        
	Lack of recognition and proper remuneration apparently dissuaded medical students from opting for specialising in anaesthesiology, admit members of the Orissa chapter of the Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists (ISA).        
	Its a complex situation in Orissa as only 14 of the 30 district headquarters hospitals have post of anaesthesiologist, that too only one against a minimum requirement of two. The sub-divisional hospitals conduct surgery with surgeons, but without anaesthesiologists. Consequently, even minor surgery cases like uncomplicated caesarean section operations are referred by the peripheral health institutions  sub-divisional hospitals and district headquarters hospitals to the three medical college hospitals.        
	With this trend, there has been an ever-increasing work load in the form of surgery cases and affect on patient care at the three medical college hospitals which are already hard-pressed by anaesthesiologist shortfall, said Dr Sukadev Nayak, the secretary of ISA Cuttack branch.        
	Sources said that nearly 30 to 40 per cent of the posts in the SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack have been lying vacant for several years now. So has been the case in the VSS Medical Medical College in Burla and MKCG Medical College in Berhampur. Most of the vacancies are in the rank of lecturers and assistant professors.         
	A large number of qualified anaesthesiologists in the state are unable to render service in their speciality as they have been posted as general duty medical officers at peripheral level.         
	Things can certainly improve if postgraduate seats in anaesthesiology in the three medical colleges are increased and facilities are introduced in Acharya Harihar Regional Research Centre for Cancer in Cuttack, Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela and Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar, said Nayak.

	Mumbai, March 10: All 25 Indian sailors on board the Panama-registered ship that went missing in the Black Sea last month are feared dead, the Mumbai firm that recruited the crew said in a letter to their families today.        
	The intimation from Pelican Marine came even as the directorate-general of shippings investigator was expected to return from Turkey  where MV Rezzak was headed  to Mumbai on Tuesday and file a report on the disappearance.        
	The letters have been issued as a matter of regular procedure because it will facilitate compensation procedures. But this does not mean that the search has been abandoned, said Pelican director Santosh Biswas.        
	The vessel, with its cargo of steel billets and the all-Indian crew, had gone missing on February 18, just a day after it left Russias Novorossiysk for Bartin in Turkey.        
	Tapan Pati, cousin of chief officer Rajesh Sarangi, couldnt believe the 31-year-old was dead. His position on the ship was next to that of the captain, Bharat Goswami. He was doing very well for his age and had signed up with Pelican in November last year, sobbed Pati as he waited outside the firms office in Marine Lines.        
	According to Pati, the ailing parents of the Rourkela-based Sarangi had been hoping against hope that the ship had been hijacked and that the crew were still alive.        
	The letter from Pelican has shaken us. We are not sure anymore that he is alive. But we will wait for the results of the investigations. They are still on, Pati said.        
	The letters shocked more families. One of them was that of the ships cook, Kishore Kumar Roy, 38, from Sonarpur on Calcuttas fringes. The other was that of engineer Aloke Kumar, 24, from Jharkhand.         
	As the chances of survival sank, evidence has started to float that MV Rezzak was not technically fit to sail.        
	According to an official in the office of the DG, shipping, authorities in Novorossiysk had found 37 deficiencies and had detained the ship for 15 days for the problems to be fixed.         
	The certification agency has revealed that it was allowed to sail despite its inability to fix three vital deficiencies, the official said.

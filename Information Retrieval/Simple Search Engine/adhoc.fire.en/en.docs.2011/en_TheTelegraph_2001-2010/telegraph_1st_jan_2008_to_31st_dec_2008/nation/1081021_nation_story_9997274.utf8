          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 20: Maoists ambushed and killed 12 Central Reserve Police Force jawans in Chhattisgarh this afternoon, cocking a snook at the administration three weeks before the state goes to the polls.        
	Two rebels, too, died in the gunfight in the Maoist stronghold of Bijapur district. Six jawans were injured, of whom three are critical and have been flown to state capital Raipur for treatment, officers said.        
	About 30 jawans from the CRPFs 170 Battalion had left the Modakpal base camp this morning on a routine patrol. Vigil has been intensified in the forests of Bijapur, which votes during the first phase of the Assembly polls on November 14.        
	The jawans had reached a spot near Kongupelli, about 22km from the Bijapur district headquarters and 400km south of Raipur, when they came under a volley of bullets around 12.30pm.        
	Sources said the rebels had planned the ambush with care, firing on the jawans from all sides and giving them little time to shoot back.        
	Besides the heavy firing, the Naxalites also lobbed grenades at the security personnel, the deputy inspector-general of police (intelligence), Pawan Deo, said. Most of the dead jawans fell to bullets, he added.        
	As the surviving jawans sent out messages from their wireless sets, another CRPF patrol, which was a few kilometres away, rushed to join the battle. As more and more reinforcements arrived, the Maoists disappeared into the forests, sources said.

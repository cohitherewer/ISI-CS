The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coffers empty, but sedans on way
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Coffers empty, but sedans on way
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                          A Toyota Corolla: Sedan splurge                                  
	Shimla, July 6: Himachal Pradesh ministers will get luxury sedans, the splurge coming after the BJP governments claims of having inherited empty coffers from the Congress government.        
	Maruti Balenos, the Rs 7-lakh models in which the Congress ministers strutted around till December, will make way for Toyota Corollas, the Rs 11-lakh car that appears to have charmed several members of the BJP cabinet.        
	Officials in the state secretariat said nine ministers of the Prem Kumar Dhumal government would get the Corollas. The chief minister is already leading by example: he zips around in a Mercedes worth Rs 22 lakh.        
	We propose to buy three Toyota Corollas in the first phase. But the purchases will be made only after the approval of the finance department. Cars for other ministers will be bought in the second phase, a senior official said.        
	The state secretariat has 81 cars, most of them Maruti models. The ministers are using the Balenos and Esteems that were bought by the Congress government in 2005. The decision had then been panned by the BJP, which had dubbed the Rs 1-crore expenditure ostentatious and wasteful.        
	One of the reasons being offered for the decision to order the luxury cars is that neighbouring Punjab and Haryana have also bought such models for their ministers.         
	Among those who will get the new cars are transport minister Kishan Kapoor, horticulture minister Narender Bragta and social justice minister Sarveen Chaudhary, officials said.        
	Some ministers, however, said they had no knowledge of the governments decision to buy cars for them.         
	I have no idea about the new models. I am happy with the car (Baleno) allotted to me. It works fine, health and welfare minister Rajeev Bindal said.        
	All is not lost for the Balenos, though. Bureaucrats saddled with the old Ambassador, and those who havent been allotted a vehicle, have set their sights on these cars.

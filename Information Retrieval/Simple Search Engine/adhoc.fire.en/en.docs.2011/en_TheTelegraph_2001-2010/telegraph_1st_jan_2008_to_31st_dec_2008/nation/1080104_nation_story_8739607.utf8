	Patna, Jan. 3: Railway minister Lalu Prasads latest move to take IIT to Chhapra  a Lok Sabha constituency that he represents  has put the proposed project in limbo, at least for the time being. 
    
	The state government has acquired some 500 acres at Bihta, on the outskirts of Patna, for the IIT in Bihar. Bihar received the sanction in 2005, along with Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, to set up the premier institute in the state. 
    
	The central team of experts, drawn from five IITs in the country, visited the Bihta site in October 2007 and approved of it. 
    
	Contradicting some newspaper reports, which stated the central team did not approve the site, science and technology secretary Ajay Thakur told The Telegraph: The team has already approved of the site. The team also pointed out that the site could face waterlogging problems in the future and suggested a hydrological report on the land. 
    
	Thakur added that the Bihar government then engaged scientists from IIT-Roorkee to prepare a hydrological report. 
    
	But the Roorkee team, instead of preparing the report, questioned the feasibility of the site, he said, explaining: The team had no business doing that especially when a central team of scientists drawn from five IITs had already approved it. The team should have adhered to its engagement with the government preparing and prepared a hydrological report. 
    
	In the meantime, Lalu Prasad last month said that he met union human resources minister Arjun Singh and who had agreed to the demand to shift the project to Chhapra. 
    
	Sources in the bureaucracy revealed that Lalu Prasad spread words just to create confusion and keep Chhapra voters in good humour.
    
	The sources, while admitting that such machinations could cause delay in the implementation of the project, also added that the state had received no communication from the Union human resources ministry about the shift. 
    
	Ajay Thakur said the government was in the process to engage another agency to prepare the hydrological report. The IIT will come up on the land which has been acquired and approved of by the state. And there are no confusion regarding the fact that the site is Bihata, he said, refusing to comment on what Lalu Prasad has been saying so far. 
    
	According to official reports Rajasthan, too, has been witnessing problems in site selection with political heavyweights trying to get their constituencies in the list. But, Andhra Pradesh has finalised a site in Medak.

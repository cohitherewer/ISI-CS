          ANANYA SENGUPTA                           Sourav, Bachchan, Shah Rukh, Sachin: On food-for-work roll                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Sachin Tendulkar might just be digging trenches as a day labourer, if a government list is anything to go by.        
	The batting legends name appears on a roll for a central food-for-work scheme in an Uttar Pradesh backwater as a labourer, paid in kind with foodgrain.        
	But Tendulkar is in august company: Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly also figure in the list, as do Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan.         
	The star-studded rolls of day labourers unearthed purportedly show beneficiaries of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in Uttar Pradeshs Mahoba.        
	The irregularities came to light when sub-divisional magistrate Ashok Kumar Pushkar scanned the rolls to probe the disappearance of 250 quintals of foodgrain provided to the district under the rural job scheme.        
	Its unbelievable. When the list was scrutinised, we realised that it had a high celebrity content. The celebrities were listed as day labourers in the food-for-work scheme under the rural job plan, said a Mahoba official.        
	A large number of Mahobas peasants who could have benefitted from such schemes have migrated to cities and other states for work. This might have prompted local officials to pack the list with phantom beneficiaries.        
	Because of drought in the area and lack of employment avenues, most labourers have migrated to different parts of the country in search of work, so there is hardly anyone to opt for these schemes, the official said.        
	Around 11,730 quintals of foodgrain have disappeared. This is a racket. We have been unable to track the trucks that ferried the grain. We suspect they had fake numberplates, the official said. The suspicion is the foodgrain was sold in the market.        
	Local officials said around 25 contractors whose schemes had been wound up had not returned the foodgrain to district officials, even as some who had worked were running from pillar to post for dues.        
	In some cases, the lists, which specify the type of work and payments made to the poor, had people who were certified sick, students, landlords and tractor owners.        
	During the verification, officials said all work and payments shown were false. Pushkar, who ferreted out the scam, has promised stringent action against the guilty.        
	Fake rolls had emerged as one of the big problems when the Centre was about to expand the rural job scheme beyond the initial 200 districts.

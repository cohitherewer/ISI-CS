The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Threat to stop milk supply
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Threat to stop milk supply
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 18: Milk producers affiliated to the Orissa Milk Farmers Mahasangha have threatened to stop supply to Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (Omfed) on Friday if their demands are not met.        
	Out of 11 lakh cattle farmers in the state, nearly 3 lakh supply over 3 lakh quintals of milk to Omfed everyday. A resolution passed at a meeting here yesterday stated the government must intervene urgently for addressing the demands of the milk farmers, failing which they would go on strike on Friday.        
	The milk farmers  mostly concentrated in Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Jajpur  will also take out rallies and stage demonstrations in Cuttack with the support of the Utkal Yadav Mahasabha.        
	The Mahasangha members said that they wanted a minimum support price of Rs 18 per litre. Omfed currently pays them mostly Rs 10.40 paise per litre and sells at Rs 20. A few receive Rs 12 in the maximum on the basis of quality. We now want the maximum procurement price hiked by Rs 6 and fixation of a minimum support price at Rs 18 as we are finding it very difficult to make both ends meet with skyrocketing of prices of cattle feed, Mahasangha general secretary Pradip Behera told The Telegraph.        
	There has been more than 50 per cent rise in cattle feed prices. In fact, price of some of them have doubled in recent months, he added.        
	Omfed officials said the demand of the milk farmers entails an additional financial burden of Rs 100 crore. Omfed had earlier assured the farmers a raise of Rs 4 in minimum support price and increased milk prices to Rs 24 per litre from October 16. But the hike was revoked from November 1 following widespread public resentment, the officials said.        
	Behera, however, said: The hike in minimum support price could be sustained through a time-bound subsidy for one year by the state government.         
	Utkal Yadav Mahasabha working president Subash Chandra Behera claimed that an increase in minimum support price to Rs 18 would pave the way for an increase in procurement of milk by Omfed to 10-12 lakh quintals per day from the present 3 lakh quintals per day. He added that the milkmen are getting a raw deal from Omfed even after five successive hikes since 2003.

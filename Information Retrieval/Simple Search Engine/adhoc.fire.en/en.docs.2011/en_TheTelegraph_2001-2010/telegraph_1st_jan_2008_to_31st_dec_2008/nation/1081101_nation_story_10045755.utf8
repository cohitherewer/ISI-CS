          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Dibrugarh, Oct. 31: A pro-peace, breakaway Ulfa leader today argued that the Assam outfit could not be behind yesterdays blasts and said the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami can be suspected.        
	Ulfa had earlier warned that a bigger and stronger force was preparing to strike in Assam in a major way, said Prabal Neog, former commander of Ulfas 28 battalion who has accepted the governments ceasefire offer.        
	He blamed the administration for ignoring the threat from external forces.        
	The state government will have to take the entire responsibility for this disaster (blasts). The government never took the threat from external forces seriously. Rather, it always focused on finishing off Ulfa, Neog said.        
	Police had yesterday named both the Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami (Huji) and Ulfa as suspects, citing how the Islamic militant group supplied the Assam outfit with weapons and trained and sheltered its cadre in Bangladesh.        
	But Neog, part of Ulfas Alpha and Charlie companies that came overground in June, stopped short of accusing Huji directly.        
	We cannot take anybodys name without proof but at the same time, it cannot be ruled out, he said. From the information available and the kind of explosives used, Huji can be suspected.        
	Asked if he was sure that Ulfa did not possess the kind of explosives used in yesterdays blasts  chief minister Tarun Gogoi had mentioned RDX  Neog dodged the issue.        
	In one instance in Lathao near the Manbhum reserve forest in Arunachal Pradesh, we had used explosives of around 50kg, which blew off a huge army truck. What arms and ammunition a guerrilla outfit has can never be disclosed, he said.        
	Neog also cited how the blasts were concentrated in Guwahati and Lower (western) Assam districts, where Huji has been active.        
	He claimed Ulfa primarily targeted security personnel, and that casualties in public places from an Ulfa attack were an aberration rather than the rule. Of course, there have been instances like the Dhemaji blast when innocents died, but that was totally unintentional, he claimed.        
	Asked about past Ulfa bombings such as the one in Guwahatis Fancy Bazar, Neog said: We regret these incidents. That is why we want peace now. Sometimes our junior cadres miss their targets resulting in civilian casualties.        
	Bangla angry        
	Bangladesh today described as blame game the allegation that Huji was involved in the blasts, agency reports said. In Dhaka, a senior home ministry official who declined to be named said the allegation is an irresponsible act. The Indian authorities earlier also could not come up with any evidence to prove the engagement of any Bangladesh-based outfit in terror attacks on their territory, the official said.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                          R.K. Anand: Practice bar                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Top criminal lawyers R.K. Anand and I.U. Khan were today convicted of obstruction of justice and criminal contempt of court for trying to buy off the last standing witness in the BMW hit-and-run case.         
	The two have been barred from practising in Delhi High Court and its subordinate courts for four months and fined Rs 2,000 each in an unprecedented judgment.        
	We are left without a shadow of doubt in our mind... that Anand was a key player in interfering or at least tending to interfere in the due course of a judicial proceeding, said a Delhi High Court bench of Justices Manmohan Sarin and Madan B. Lokur.        
	Anand was the senior defence counsel and Khan a special public prosecutor in the case.        
	A TV sting operation had caught Anand, in collusion with Khan, allegedly offering money to key witness Sunil Kulkarni to depose in favour of prime accused Sanjeev Nanda. Nanda, the grandson of retired navy chief S.M. Nanda, is accused of mowing down six persons with his BMW car in Delhi in 1999.         
	Almost all witnesses have turned hostile, telling the trial court it was not a BMW but a truck that ran over the victims on Lodhi Road.         
	Although Kulkarni, a Mumbai-based lawyer, has also made several flip-flops, he is the only witness who has stuck to his version that the vehicle involved was a black BMW.        
	The court took suo motu cognisance of the sting operation conducted in May last year.         
	Anand and Khan are seasoned lawyers of this court with decades of practice behind them. Anand had led prestigious elective positions in the legal fraternity, including the Bar Council of Delhi. He has been an MP of the Rajya Sabha. That he should indulge in such practice may have taken many in the legal fraternity by surprise, the court said and recommended stripping them of their designation of senior advocate.        
	I.U. Khan is known for his legal acumen and forensic skill and that perhaps is the reason why he was appointed public prosecutor in the BMW case. That he would betray the trust... in the manner that he did was perhaps beyond the realm of contemplation of the prosecuting agency, the judges said.        
	The designation is granted on the recommendation of three judges. It can only be taken away by a high court sitting in its full strength.         
	Khan, who was present in court, refused to react. Anand did not attend the hearing. They can appeal in the Supreme Court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pakistan hand pretty obvious, says Kabul
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pakistan hand pretty obvious, says Kabul
                            
	Kabul, July 8 (Agencies): Afghan authorities today claimed to have sufficient evidence that the Indian mission here was bombed by a particular intelligence agency with a record of attacks in the country, prompting the Pakistan Prime Minister to issue an official denial.        
	President Hamid Karzais spokesperson, Humayun Hamidzada, did not name Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) but said it was pretty obvious who had masterminded yesterdays suspected Taliban attack that killed 41 and wounded 150.        
	The sophistication of this attack and the kind of material that was used, the specific targeting, everything has the hallmarks of a particular agency that has conducted similar attacks inside Afghanistan. We have sufficient evidence to say that, Hamidzada said about the deadliest attack in Kabul since the Talibans fall.        
	Kabul has accused Pakistani agents of the April assassination attempt against Karzai, a mass jail break in Kandahar last month and other attacks.         
	Karzai had threatened last month to send troops across the border to attack Pakistan-based militants.        
	Im not going to name it (the foreign agency) any more, I think its pretty obvious, Hamidzada said. The project was designed outside Afghanistan. It was exported to Afghanistan.        
	A car bomber had rammed the gates of the Indian mission, killing Delhis defence attache and another diplomat as well as two Indian guards along with Afghan workers, visa-seekers and shoppers.        
	An Afghan defence ministry report released earlier today said the bombers had entered the country after receiving training and logistical support across the border, another reference to Pakistan.        
	The report was placed before a cabinet meeting chaired by Karzai. The summary of the meeting said: The terrorists no doubt could not have succeeded in launching such an atrocity without full support of foreign intelligence.

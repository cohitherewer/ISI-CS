  - High court hears nun plea, selects Cuttack        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The nun at a news meet in Delhi on October 24                                        
	Cuttack, Dec. 5: The test identification (TI) parade of those accused of raping a nun in Kandhamal in August would be conducted in Cuttack instead of Baliguda, Orissa High Court ruled today.        
	Based on a petition filed by the 29-year-old nun, Justice B.K. Patel transferred the venue of the TI parade from Baliguda in Kandhamal to Cuttack, where the state police headquarters is located.         
	Its good that the stand-off over the venue has been resolved, paving the way for conduct of the TI parade outside Kandhamal, Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath told The Telegraph.        
	The nun, allegedly raped on the night of August 25, had filed an appeal against the trial court order rejecting her plea for shifting the venue of TI parade from Baliguda. The TI parade may be allowed to be held at New Delhi or any other place in Orissa, preferably Bhubaneswar or Cuttack, she had urged in her petition.        
	The nun said she is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and further alleged in her petition that many criminal elements are roaming free in the area, and if she went to Baliguda court there was reasonable chance of danger to her life.        
	The verdict came after the state government conceded that Baliguda would not be a safe place for conducting the TI parade. State counsel J.N. Mohanty, during hearing on the nuns petition on December 2, had admitted saying the investigating agency (CID-crime branch) also feels that Baliguda is now not safe for holding the TI parade.        
	Invoking the inherent powers of the high court under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code, Justice Patel quashed the order of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Baliguda, and directed the investigating officer in the case to submit a petition for change in the venue of the TI parade venue to Cuttack. The sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Baliguda, will issue directions accordingly and fix a date for the TI parade, the order said.        
	The court had earlier issued a notice to the nun last month, directing her to be present at the TI parade at Baliguda on November 10. It changed the date to November 19 following her petition asking for more time.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hint of Singur compensation hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, July 31: The Bengal government today spoke of a possible compensation hike for Singur landlosers after Tata Motors hinted yesterday that the continuing violence against its small-car project could be testing its patience.        
	Company managing director Ravi Kant had said the project would go on as long as our patience lasts, adding: Ultimately, the people of Bengal have to decide whether they want industrialisation.        
	State industries minister Nirupam Sen today reaffirmed that the government was ready to discuss everything with the landlosers and the Opposition except returning any part of the land. He said the government would consider raising the compensation if such a demand was made.        
	If land is returned to those who have not taken compensation yet, the project has to be scrapped. But we are ready to discuss everything else, Sen told reporters.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, however, ruled out any talks with the government unless it returned the 400 acres she claims were forcibly acquired from farmers.        
	Asked if she would accept the higher compensation offer, Mamata flared up, saying: I have already made it clear that the land has to be returned first.        
	Sen conceded that the former owners of about 350-odd acres out of the sites 997 acres were yet to accept compensation, but said these numbers proved that Singur had more supporters than opponents of the Nano project.        
	The attacks on those working at the factory site have allegedly been carried out by the Trinamul-backed Save farmland Committee. Many believe that the sudden escalation in violence, including a mob attack on an engineer on Tuesday, reflects a build-up to the indefinite dharna Mamata has announced at the factory site.        
	We had planned the dharna from August 20 but have deferred it by a day or two since Left trade unions have called an all-India strike on the day, she said.        
	Singur has seen Bengals first experiment with large-scale land acquisition during its latest drive towards industry. Last year, Amartya Sen had mentioned to The Telegraph that the compensation had not factored in the possible rise in land value after the factory came up.        
	That set the ball rolling in the state government to review the compensation, and a new rehabilitation bill that is ready for tabling at the Assembly does take into account the future value of land.        
	Mamata argued that 600 acres was enough for a car factory and the additional 400 acres acquired for building shopping malls and other things must be returned.

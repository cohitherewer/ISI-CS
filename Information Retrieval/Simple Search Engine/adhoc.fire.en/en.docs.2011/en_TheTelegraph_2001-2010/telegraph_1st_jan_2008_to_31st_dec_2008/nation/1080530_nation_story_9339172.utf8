          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, May 29: Stepping up its campaign against corruption, the Bihar vigilance bureau today arrested two persons involved in fund embezzling and corruption.        
	The first arrest was of a manager of a rural bank, while vigilance sleuths raided the establishments of a block development officer (BDO) in Nalanda.         
	The BDO is absconding.         
	It is being said that Nitish Kumar, who hails from the Nalanda district, had directed the state vigilance department to probe into complaints of irregularities in payments under the Indira Awas Yojna and Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojna  schemes for building houses for those living below the poverty line.        
	Additional director-general of vigilance Neelmani conceded that the matter had reached the higher runks of the Bihar government.         
	Neelmani said: We found that the complaints of irregularities in the housing schemes were prima facie true. We acted accordingly and immediately.         
	Sleuths arrested a manager of a rural bank, Anil Kumar Choudhary.         
	The block development officer, also involved in the housing scam, managed to escape while his home was being raided this morning.

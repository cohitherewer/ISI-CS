                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Maya asks for Aarushi officer
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                          Arun Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: The Uttar Pradesh government has asked the Union home ministry to repatriate CBI joint-director Arun Kumar and five other IPS officers to their parent cadre.        
	Kumar, an officer of inspector-general rank, is probing the murders of Noida teenager Aarushi Talwar and domestic help Hemraj.        
	The case, in which Aarushis arrested father Rajesh is an accused, is believed to have been botched up by Uttar Pradesh police before it was handed over to the CBI.        
	The state governments letter to the home ministry has raised eyebrows. Sources said it was chief minister Mayavatis way of getting back at the Centre, which has turned down several requests from her for CBI probes.        
	Also, she is not happy that an officer of the UP cadre is exposing the shoddy work of Noida police, an official said.        
	Officially, however, the state government has claimed that it is recalling the officers as they have already completed or about to complete their deputation at the Centre.        
	Kumar has been with the CBI for five years, but home ministry sources said his deputation could be extended up to seven years.        
	The other IPS officers whom the state wants to be repatriated are IG Rajni Kant Mishra, DIG Tilottma Verma, DIG Tanuja Srivastava, SP D.K. Thakur and SP Bhanu Bhaskar. All five are on deputation with the CBI.        
	Four other state cadre IPS officers  CBI director Vijay Shankar, who is due to retire on July 31, joint-director Y.P. Singh and SPs Zaki Ahmed and Sujit Pandey  are also on deputation with the central agency, but the Uttar Pradesh government has not made any reference to them.        
	Sources said the home ministry has requested the state government to allow the officers, especially Kumar, to stay on for some more time. Even if the Uttar Pradesh government does not agree, it is ultimately the Centres decision when to relieve the officers. After all, it is the home ministry which is the cadre-controlling authority, an official explained.        
	Kumar, who is with the CBIs special crimes unit, has in the recent past headed investigations into the Nithari killings and the Rizwanur Rahman case in Calcutta.        
	What is giving Noida police and the Uttar Pradesh government sleepless nights is the fact that a state cadre IPS officer, known for his uprightness, is heading the investigation into the Aarushi-Hemraj murders. With him around, they cant be sure what skeletons may come tumbling out, said an official.        
	Kumar used to head the state polices special task force and was instrumental in scalping dreaded gangsters like Sri Prakash Shukla.

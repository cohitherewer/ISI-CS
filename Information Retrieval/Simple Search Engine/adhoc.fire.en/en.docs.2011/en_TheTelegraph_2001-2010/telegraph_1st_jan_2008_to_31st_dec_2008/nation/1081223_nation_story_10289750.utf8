          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Suhail after his arrest        
	Srinagar, Dec. 22: Police today claimed to have caught a Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami chief commander two days before the final phase of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls.        
	Suhail Faisal was arrested from Jammu station last night. A resident of Kishtwar in Jammu, he was allegedly involved in fidayeen attacks as well as blasts in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Abdul Qayoom Manhas, the Jammu range deputy inspector-general, said Faisal was an associate of slain Huji chief Saba. He went to Pakistan in 2000 for training and had surrendered in 2007. But he came back to militancy.         
	Varanasi police, however, refused to buy the claim that Faisal was involved in blasts in Uttar Pradesh. SSP Vijay Prakash told PTI: We have no information about him.

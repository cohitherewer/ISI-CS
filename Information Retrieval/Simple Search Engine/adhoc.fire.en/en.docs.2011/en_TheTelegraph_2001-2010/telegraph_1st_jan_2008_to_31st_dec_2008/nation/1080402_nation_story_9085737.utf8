The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Do-call list 
                                                                                                               Do-call list 
                            
	New Delhi, April 1 (PTI): The national consumer commission has proposed that telemarketing calls be made only to those consumers who wish to receive such promotional information.        
	The apex consumer court has issued a notice to Trai asking the telecom watchdog if it is possible to start a do-call register where mobile phone users interested in receiving messages from banks and financial institutions can enrol.        
	It means there would be a blanket ban on unsolicited calls and users would be spared the trouble of signing up in the newly introduced do-not-call-register service, which bars telemarketing firms from making unsolicited calls.

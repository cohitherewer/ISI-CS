                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     MPs play truant, Sonia pained
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Four out of every 10 Congress MPs let Sonia Gandhi down on her pet project yesterday, paining her by her own admission.        
	I was pained, the Congress chief pointedly told the parliamentary party meeting this morning.         
	Of the partys 151 MPs, 68 were absent when the unorganised workers social security bill was passed in the Lok Sabha yesterday. The absentees included some senior ministers.        
	The Congress had issued a whip to its MPs asking them to be present for the discussion and the voting.         
	Known for being punctilious about attendance, punctuality and attentiveness, Sonia was particularly upset because the bill was one of her pet projects, like the Right to Information and National Rural Employment Guarantee acts.        
	Barring Sonia, nobody, not even parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi, would have noticed the absence had it not been for the Left, which moved an amendment for setting up a dedicated fund for the unorganised sector.        
	Ravi then found only 107 UPA MPs around. Where are the MPs? Sonia asked the hapless minister. By then, Rahul Gandhi and other young MPs seated at the back had started counting the heads.        
	The Left managed to get the BJPs support although Opposition party sources said they were clueless about the amendment. Our limited objective was to embarrass the UPA, a source said.         
	The ruling coalition scraped through and the amendment was rejected by a margin of 17.        
	With an hours breather before the second amendment was to come up for voting, Ravi was told to get his act together. He frantically sent text messages and called whoever was available. Madam was furious, the ministers were told. Even so, sources said some were so casual that by the time they strolled back to the House, the doors had shut as voting was to begin.        
	The second amendment, seeking statutory powers for advisory bodies that would oversee implementation of the scheme, was voted out with a more respectable figure of 28  134 to the UPA and 106 to the Left-BJP.         
	Had the Left-BJP combine got 135 votes  some Left sources said it was not that difficult a number to get, considering that the BSP and other parties had not been tapped  the Congress would have cut sorry face. However, the unorganised workers bill is not a money bill, which if voted out would mean the government had lost the confidence of the House.        
	Left sources also said that had they been less squeamish about doing business with the BJP, they would have carried the day.        
	The gaffe prompted Pranab Mukherjee, the external affairs minister and leader of the Lok Sabha, to shoot off missives last night, demanding an explanation from the missing MPs.        
	By the time the MPs met to debate the anti-terror amendments, Ravi was more in control because a CPM-sponsored amendment to the National Investigation Agency Bill was struck off by 51 votes  a record on a bad day.        
	Disunity jab        
	Sonia has blamed lack of unity and co-ordination among top state leaders for the Congresss Assembly poll defeats in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. She said: We have increased the number of seats and our vote share (in the two states). But that is small consolation.

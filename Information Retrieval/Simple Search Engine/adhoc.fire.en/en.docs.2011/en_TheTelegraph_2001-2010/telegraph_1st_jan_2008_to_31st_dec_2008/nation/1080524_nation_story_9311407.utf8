          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 23: The co-operative banks in Orissa are now wary of their plummeting share in disbursal of farm loans.         
	They are apparently finding it difficult to compete with nationalised banks, as farmers prefer to opt for agricultural loans against a lower rate of interest. While co-operative banks offer farm loans at a nine per cent interest, nationalised banks extend the same at two per cent less interest.        
	According to official figures, the co-operative banks had managed to disburse agricultural loans to the tune of Rs 1,501.79 crore against a target of Rs 1,800 crore in 2007-08. The disbursal during 2006-07 was Rs 1,559.17 crore.         
	If the government does not come up with remedial measures, the co-operative banks would be pushed into doldrums, said Yasodha Mishra, the director of the Cuttack Central Co-operative Bank that operates through 466 co-operative samitis.        
	There are 17 central co-operative banks in Orissa. They primarily extend credit and officials believe the sector has not received the required attention from the government. Their demands for a cut in the interest rate for farm loans have evoked no response. The state budget for 2008-09 had envisaged a paltry Rs 113.99 crore for the co-operative sector, rued sector officials. This crisis figured in the ninth annual conference of the All Orissa Bank Employees Association, held in Cuttack last week.         
	Co-operative banks that have been operating at the grassroots need to be revitalised, said P.K. Tripathy, the general secretary of the association.        
	General secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association C.H. Venkatachalam also attended the two-day conference.

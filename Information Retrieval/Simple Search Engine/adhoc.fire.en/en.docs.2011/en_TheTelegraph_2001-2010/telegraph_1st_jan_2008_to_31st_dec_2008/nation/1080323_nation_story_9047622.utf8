The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Village nails cops for fake encounter
                                                                                                               Village nails cops for fake encounter
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, March 22: The village of a fake-encounter victim saw its five-year fight for justice bear fruit when a murder case was registered against 21 policemen yesterday.        
	The residents of Salawa, Meerut, had repeatedly protested before two police stations, got a chief minister to order a probe and then a court to order a second inquiry when the first cleared the police.        
	The second probe, by the CIDs crime branch, has now indicted the personnel of Meeruts Ichauli and Daurala police stations for killing Salawas Kushal Pal and two other young men on July 1, 2003.        
	Pal, a 24-year-old grocer, was shot dead in Meeruts Uldepur along with Samouli Singh, 27, a technician who had arrived from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, to attend a wedding in Meerut, and Vijayendra Kumar, 23, a small-time supplier from Badaun district neighbouring Meerut.        
	The police had arrested them separately, accusing them of being members of the Kachcha Baniyan dacoit gang, which had terrorised several western Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh districts. The trio were then brought together and shot, the probe has found.        
	The police described the three men as hardened criminals and claimed they were planning an armed robbery when they were chased and shot.        
	The day after the shooting, Pals relatives and neighbours from Salawa demonstrated before the two police stations that had jointly carried out the encounter. The villagers contacted the relatives of the two other victims and launched a campaign, petitioning senior politicians including then chief minister Mayavati.        
	Mayavati ordered a probe by an inspector-general of police late in 2003 but it dragged its feet and then gave the police the benefit of the doubt.        
	We took the matter to court and a fresh probe was ordered last year. We have now tasted victory  at least a small one. A murder case has finally been registered, said Santosh Pal, a relative of Pal from Salawa.        
	Santosh was at Ichauli police station yesterday when the case was registered against 21 policemen, including inspectors Ramavtar Karnwal and Pratapbhanu Sharma.        
	Salawas efforts are being compared to those by the residents of Hashimpura village, where the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) had allegedly killed 40 Muslims on May 18, 1987, during the Meerut riots.        
	The villagers had fought on for 19 years till criminal cases were registered against 17 PAC personnel in 2006.

	New Delhi, May 27: Indias mission to deliver relief, medicines and doctors to Chinas and Myanmars needy has turned into the largest cross-border airlift by its air force and a grand gesture of goodwill that New Delhi hopes will put it at the centre of a global humanitarian effort.         
	Op Sahayata, as the mission is being called by the air force, has involved regular meetings of the disaster management crisis group since Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar on May 3 and an earthquake convulsed China on May 12. The group was convened after the Centre decided that delivering humanitarian aid would get it much diplomatic mileage.         
	The air force will fly at least one more sortie of its heavy-lift transporter, the IL-76, from Kanpur to Chengdu tomorrow carrying 28 tonnes of relief, mostly tents. It has flown six sorties to Myanmar. It takes about Rs 1.3 crore to fly a sortie to Chengdu and back and about Rs 85 lakh to fly into and out of Yangon.         
	Aircrew flying on the IL-76 to Myanmar (Op Sahayata I) reported at first that in Yangon, the Burmese did not even have the equipment necessary to unload the relief that India was sending. India has also flown army doctors to Myanmar on request. Myanmars junta restricted the flow of international aid workers but India and Thailand were among the first to be granted access. Since then, Yangon has allowed in a trickle but the UN has warned that unless Myanmar is flooded with aid, a humanitarian catastrophe is in the making.         
	In China (Op Sahayata II), however, aircrew reported an efficient handling system. After Indias external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee offered help to China, the foreign office was taken aback by the long list of equipment and materials Beijing asked for.         
	China is now mostly requesting tents to shelter the people displaced by the earthquake. Though China has also restricted the flow of international aid workers, it has appealed for relief from the world community.         
	An Indian Air Force officer said 277 tonnes of relief have so far been delivered to Yangon and Chengdu. To start with, the air force flew the smaller transport aircraft, AN-32, to Myanmar and additional supplies have gone on the IL-76 five times, including a flight today.         
	For Myanmar, the IAF has airlifted 125.5 tonnes of relief material including medicines, tents, ready-to-eat meals and 47 personnel. There have been seven flights to Chengdu so far.

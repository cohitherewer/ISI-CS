          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 23: Emboldened by its success at ensuring conviction of criminals-cum-political dons, the Bihar government has now decided to set up fast track courts to try corrupt officials.         
	Previously, special courts set up by Nitish Kumar has awarded life and capital conviction to the likes of RJD MP from Siwan Mohammad Shahabuddin, Saharsa don Anand Mohan Singh and former Bikramganj MLA Akhlaq Ahmand within a span of two-and-a-half-years.         
	The dons-cum-politicians, including some belonging to the ruling establishment, are in jails facing trials in the fast track courts.         
	Raising its tirade against the corrupt officials vis--vis the criminals, the government created Corruption Linked Initiative for Affirmative Action (CLEAN), a special unit in the state vigilance bureau which trapped 182 officials (including the IAS and IPS ones) while accepting bribe within two-and-a-half years.         
	The vigilance bureau has calculated that 20 of the 182 officials caught indulging in bribery have alone amassed property worth Rs 8 crore through illegal means, revealed additional director general (ADG) (Vigilance) Neelmani.         
	The vigilance bureaus figure of trapping 182 officials involved in corruption is very impressive in the sense that the same Bureau had trapped only 47 officials involved in corruption during 15 years of the Lalu-Rabri regime.         
	Sources revealed that the vigilance bureau was in pressing need to have special fast track court to ensure the proper trial of the trapped officers for the courts that are already burdened with cases can not dispose off the cases involving officials in desired time.         
	The bureau, according to sources, has proposed to the Bihar government to start fast track courts exclusively to try the corrupt officials against whom the department has already submitted charge sheets. Advocate general of Patna High Court P.K. Sahi confirmed that the law department was in the process of facilitating the move.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 6: One Sandip Acharya alias Raja was arrested today after actress and music video artiste Lesli Tripathy accused him of threatening her and her family for marrying her.        
	The artiste had met Raja in Baripada jail in 2005 when she was there as a part of a reform programme. Raja was jailed on charges of extortion, kidnapping and murder.         
	Lesli had lodged a complaint against Raja on February 18, 2008.         
	The man has been calling and sending SMSes saying that he would kill me and my family unless I do as he says, Lesli stated in her complaint.        
	According to the actress, the man started to call her right after her jail visit. At first I took the calls lightly. But when I realised the gravity of the situation I made myself clear to him. That is when the threat calls began, she added.        
	The accused, Raja, was released today after he furnished a bail of Rs 50,000.         
	Raja claimed that he and Lesli knew each other personally, a claim that Lesli refuted.         
	She is falsely accusing me because she wanted to marry me and I refused, said Raja. I had gifted her a laptop and Rs 2 lakh. Now that I am planning to marry, I had asked her to return my gifts. That is why she lodged a complaint, he added.

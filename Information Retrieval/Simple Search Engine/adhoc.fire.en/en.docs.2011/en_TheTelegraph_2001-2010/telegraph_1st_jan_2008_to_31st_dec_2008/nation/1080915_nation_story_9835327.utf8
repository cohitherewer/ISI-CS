                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Riot impact on polls ruled out
          SUBRAT DAS                          A house in Kandhamal set on fire during the clash                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 14: The Kandhamal violence is likely to have little impact on the results of the forthcoming urban polls, feel experts and leaders of various political parties.        
	The Kandhamal issue will not have much impact on the urban polls to the extent of reversing the results, said Surya Mishra, the professor in political science in Utkal University.        
	The civic polls are scheduled on September 19.        
	Our voters are not polarised on communal lines. Besides, the urban polls are fought on local issues. Local issues, performance of the sitting representatives, the equation between local MLAs and MPs and incumbency factor will basically decide the poll results, Mishra said.        
	Of course, the Kandhamal issue will be a talking point by the Opposition parties. But since the urban body polls involve local issues, Kandhamal will not influence the poll results in other areas beyond the troubled district. Even the civic polls have been deferred in Kandhamal district, said Damodar Rout, the secretary-general of ruling BJD and former panchayati raj minister.        
	Chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik, who keeps aloof from the controversy over Kandhamal and tries to maintain his partys secular credentials, harps on the neglect and apathy of the UPA government towards Orissa and the achievements of the BJD-BJP government.        
	BJP spokesman Nayan Kishore Mohanty, on the other hand, feels electoral benefits from Kandhamal issue would be gained by the BJP and not the Opposition. The Congress is confused over the issues of conversion and Kandhamal. The BJPs stand, on the other hand, is quite clear  stop conversion and cow slaughter, says Mohanty.        
	I dont think Kandhamal issue will have much bearing on urban poll results. The steam is lost, said Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesman Kailash Acharya. Acharya, however, claimed that his party would win most of the urban bodies because of the anti-incumbency factor of the BJD-BJP government. The ruling party candidates are facing grilling by the voters on the developmental works they have done for the area in particular and the urban body in general, he said.        
	The Congress leader said practically there had been no development in most of the urban areas. The state government had failed to spend two-third of Rs 358 crore released during the last two years under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, he alleged.         
	The government also failed to submit blueprints for sewerage development in Cuttack, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Balasore, he added.         
	BJP spokesman Mohanty said Congress was responsible for the precarious economic condition of the urban local bodies in the state.

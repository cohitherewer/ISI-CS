          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 31: About 25 security personnel had a miraculous escape this morning when a powerful landmine allegedly planted by Maoists went off seconds before their vehicle reached the spot in Narayanpur district.        
	Senior police officers said the rebels probably missed the timing while detonating the landmine that exploded around 11am when the mini-bus carrying the jawans was just 10m away.         
	Sources said about 25 jawans from the District Force and Special Task Force (STF) were returning to Narayanpur  about 250km southwest of Raipur  after an anti-Maoist operation. An anti-landmine vehicle carrying another group of jawans was moving ahead of the mini-bus. The rebels, who laid an ambush between Gulumkudo and Remamand villages on the state highway, allowed the anti-landmine vehicle to pass. They had aimed to blow up the mini-bus to inflict maximum casualty, the sources said.         
	The impact of the explosion was so severe that pellets and stones flew to smash the glasses in the mini-bus that caused minor injuries to the jawans on board, deputy inspector-general of police (intelligence) Pawan Deo said.         
	The vehicle later plunged into the huge crater caused by the blast.         
	The rebels, however, did not open fire as the jawans travelling in the anti-landmine vehicle, which was 100m away from the bus, immediately rushed to the spot.         
	About 17 jawans have sustained minor injuries and have been admitted to a hospital in Narayanpur, about 20km from the spot.

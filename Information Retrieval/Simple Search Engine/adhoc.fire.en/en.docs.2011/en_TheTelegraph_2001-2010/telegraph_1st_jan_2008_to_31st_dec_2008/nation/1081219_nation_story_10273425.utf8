          SHEENA K.                          Let down: Ajit Jogi                                  
	Raipur, Dec. 18: He missed the post of the chief minister. Now, the chance to be the leader of the Opposition in Chhattisgarh has slipped too.        
	The Congress high command today ignored former chief minister Ajit Jogi and appointed party legislator Ravindra Choubey as the leader of the Opposition. The move came as a big jolt for Jogi who had been campaigning for the position after the Congresss defeat in the state polls. The former chief minister, however, won from the Marwahi seat this year.         
	Earlier, his party had set aside his demand to be considered as the chief ministerial candidate. Congress contested the election without a leader. More than 24 Congress legislators, of the 38 elected, had signed a memorandum to elect Jogi as the leader of the Opposition. Choubey was also one of them.         
	The trouble created by his (Jogi) supporters before central observers Janardhan Dwivedi and Narayan Sami cost their leader dear, as both gave adverse reports to the party high command, a source said.        
	Choubey distanced himself from the Jogi camp and enjoyed the support of former chief ministers bte-noire and Congress stalwarts in the state including AICC treasurer Motilal Vora and former union minister Vidyacharan Shukla.         
	Rumors in the Congress circle say that Jogi could resign from his legislator post following Choubeys appointment. Jogi is sitting Member of Parliament from Mahasamund and would contest the Lok Sabha election instead of confining himself to the state politics, sources said.

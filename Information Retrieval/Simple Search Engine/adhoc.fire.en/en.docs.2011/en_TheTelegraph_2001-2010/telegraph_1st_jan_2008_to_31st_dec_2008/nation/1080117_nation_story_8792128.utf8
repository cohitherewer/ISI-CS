     OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: The Supreme Court today put off hearing in the Ram setu case by two weeks after the Centre said it needed more time to firm up its stand.
    
	Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy argued that the Archaeological Survey of India and the culture ministry should investigate whether the setu could be declared an ancient monument. 
    
	The government now has to file a fresh affidavit clarifying whether the setu is natural or manmade, Swamy said. Or monkey-made, he added. 
    
	Attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee sought more time, which the three-judge bench granted.

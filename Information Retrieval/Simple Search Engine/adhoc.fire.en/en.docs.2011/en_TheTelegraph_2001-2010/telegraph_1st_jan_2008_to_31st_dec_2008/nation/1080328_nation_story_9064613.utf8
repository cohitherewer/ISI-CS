The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI settles No. 2 question
                                                                                                               CPI settles No. 2 question
          OUR BUREAU                          Sudhakar Reddy (left) with AB Bardhan (AP)                                  
	March 27: The CPI has named S. Sudhakar Reddy deputy general secretary, reviving the post after 10 years to settle the No. 2 question in the party.        
	Reddys appointment effectively puts him on course to succeed A.B. Bardhan who was today re-elected general secretary.        
	The succession question had been left open to interpretation for some time now. The CPI national secretary, D. Raja, and the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, Gurudas Dasgupta, had made themselves available for the second-in-command slot much before preparations for the party congress began.         
	Reddys name prevailed at the end for a number of reasons, CPI insiders said. Reddy, the Andhra strong man, is considered a quintessential organisational person who also enjoys an electoral base. He is a two-time member of Parliament.        
	He adopts a studied approach to issues, is considered sound on party policies and does not have a reputation for talking out of turn.         
	Raja, a Dalit leader, has had the experience of working at the Centre, unlike many other party colleagues of his generation. Dasgupta had the advantage of a long association with the trade union movement.        
	But Reddy scored over both as he is considered an all-rounder and is popular among party workers.        
	The CPI congress, which concluded today, elected 30 new faces to the 125-member national council.         
	A nine-member central control commission with R. Nalla Kannu of Tamil Nadu was also announced by Bardhan.         
	Addressing the media after being appointed deputy general secretary, Reddy said that before him, Bardhan, Giri Prasad and Indrajit Gupta had served in the same post.        
	Reddy said his partys stand on support to the UPA government would be announced after the CPM congress in Coimbatore this weekend.         
	The congress urged the UPA government to facilitate the discussion on the Sachar report and announce measures for the uplift of the Muslim minority and end discrimination on the basis of religion.

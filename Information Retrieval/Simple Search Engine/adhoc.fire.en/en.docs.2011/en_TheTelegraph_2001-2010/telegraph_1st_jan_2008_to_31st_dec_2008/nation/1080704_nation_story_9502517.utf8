                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fire at empty Mumbai racecourse
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The third-floor enclosure of the Mahalaxmi racecourse in Mumbai on fire on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 3: Fire broke out at Mumbais 125-year-old Mahalaxmi racecourse tonight, engulfing a third-floor enclosure used by members during the racing season and destroying furniture and other property in the stands.        
	No casualty was reported since the enclosure, used only during the November-April racing season, was locked. The horses, usually lodged at the racecourse, had been moved to Pune where the racing season is to begin on July 24.        
	Fire officials said the racecourse security staff reported the fire around 8pm, and eight water tankers and eight fire engines brought the blaze under control by 10.50pm. One problem the firefighters faced was that their water jets failed to reach all the areas engulfed by the fire.        
	Officials at the Royal Western India Turf Club, as the racecourse is officially known, said a short circuit may have caused the blaze. They denied reports that the fire started in the kitchen of the Gallops restaurant, a popular haunt for racing enthusiasts and the well-heeled round the year.        
	The Gallops restaurant and the stables are far away from the spot, but the loss of property is huge, a racecourse security official said.        
	The racecourse, built in 1883 on reclaimed marshy land, hosts the famed, 65-year-old Indian Derby on the first Sunday of February every year. The event, now sponsored by McDowell (United Breweries), attracts the citys whos who.        
	The oval-shaped ground is a replica of the Melbourne racecourse but is a lot younger than the Calcutta racecourse, maintained by the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, which was built in 1820.        
	The Royal Western India Turf Club deputy secretary, N.H.S. Mani, and chief security officer M.R. Gaud were present at the spot during the firefight but could not be contacted for comments.        
	A freak mishap was reported at the Mahalaxmi racecourse last year when a Garware Aviation helicopter made an illegal landing near the riding school on the grounds, killing a mare.        
	Golden Chopper, a popular racehorse, went berserk on hearing the loud sound and crashed into a barrier, which broke her leg and eventually killed her.        
	Helicopter movement has been restricted at the racecourse helipad since the incident.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, June 12: Trial runs at the beer plant being set up with Danish giant Carlsbergs participation resumed today, a day after Citu supporters demanding jobs for locals laid siege to the unit.        
	The trial run went off smoothly after we asked our members not to hold demonstrations, Citu leader and CPM Hooghly district secretariat member Bimal Majhi said.        
	N.R. Upadhyaya, manager of Parag Breweries Pvt Ltd in Hooghlys Bhandarhati, 50km from Calcutta, said work went on undisturbed. Work was normal today. There was no demonstration by Citu people, he said but refused to speak on the demand for jobs.         
	Majhi suggested, however, that the management should talk to members of the Belmuri gram panchayat to sort out the problem  choosing not to mention the word jobs.        
	The plant is under the area of the CPM-controlled Belmuri panchayat. So we have advised the management to discuss the problems with the village body.        
	Sheikh Saukat Ali, who had led yesterdays Citu mob, also struck a conciliatory note. We are opposed to stalling work at a time when private investors are coming to Bengal. We want the management to sit with us and discuss the problems we had raised about jobs for locals.         
	CPM sources in Hooghly, however, said the Citu stance had softened after instructions from Writers Buildings and the party headquarters at Alimuddin Street.        
	Instead of stalling a factory, the union should settle disputes through discussions, said a leader from Calcutta.        
	Majhi insisted, though, that the Parag management had sought his intervention after Citu supporters halted work yesterday. There will be no further demonstrations. We want the plant to function in full swing.

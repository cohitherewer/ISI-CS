The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No immunity for rash cop: SC
                                                                                                               No immunity for rash cop: SC
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 23: The Supreme Court has ruled that a policeman who fatally injured a pillion rider when he jumped a road divider and hit a scooter while on duty would not be immune to criminal prosecution.         
	Head constable Paul George, driving a police mini-truck, was in a hurry to deliver an urgent wireless message to a police station.         
	The argument that the accident occurred when he was on duty and hence he would be immune to prosecution under Section 140 of the Delhi Police Act, 1978, would not hold, the court said.         
	Section 140 bars any suit or prosecution if an offence is committed by a police officer under the colour of duty or authority.         
	George was rushing from the Kashmere Gate police station to the ITO headquarters when he jumped the divider under a railway bridge on Ring Road and hit a scooterist, Hans Kumar. Atma Ram, the pillion-rider, succumbed to his injuries at Jai Prakash Narain hospital. Hans Kumar was seriously injured        
	The trial court as well as the high court had convicted George under Sections 279 (rash driving on a public way) and 304A (causing death by negligent act) of the IPC. But the high court in its judgment of May 30, 2006, reduced his jail term to six months.         
	The apex court upheld the arguments of the two lower courts, saying cops should not enjoy immunity for rash or negligent acts while on official duty.         
	But in Georges case, the court made an exception and directed that he be released under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, under conditions imposed by the trial court.

	New Delhi, Aug. 17: A flotilla of the Indian Navy will participate in war games in the Atlantic Ocean for the first time with the navies of the UK and France, senior naval sources said here today.         
	This will be the Indian Navys farthest deployment for exercises with foreign navies. The exercise will last a fortnight.         
	But before the Atlantic drill, the Indian Navy is getting ready to host the next edition of the Malabar series of exercises with the US Navy  this time off the west coast of India  on a more complex scale, one officer said.         
	Last year, the Indian Navy hosted Malabar 2007 off the east coast in the Bay of Bengal  though the name of the war games derives from the west coast  with the navies of the US and four other countries, an event that sparked protests from the Left in India.         
	The composition of the Indian Navys flotilla for Malabar 08 or for the Atlantic drill has not yet been finalised. We will have to take into account the foreign environment to which we are not accustomed, the senior officer said.         
	The Indian Navy has the Konkan series of exercises with the UK and the Varuna series with the French. The invitation to sail to the Atlantic is under a reciprocal arrangement. Scenarios for the drill are still being worked upon but, said the officer, it would test skills in undersea, air and surface operations.         
	The programme for an expanding series of international naval exercises  mostly with western powers  is being drawn up even as a large Indian Air Force contingent with its frontline Sukhoi 30 Mki aircraft is currently in the US for the Red Flag exercise. The Indian and Russian navies hold a more infrequent exercise called the Indra series. An American army team is also in the Indian Armys Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Vairangte, for a joint training camp.         
	The navy has also sent four warships to the Red Sea and off the African coast for a two-month deployment for flag showing and smaller exercises with African and West Asian navies. The INS Talwar, the INS Godavari, the INS Delhi and the INS Aditya will be making port calls in the Red Sea and also participate in a drill with a French flotilla near the Persian Gulf. The INS Delhi and the INS Talwar have visited Egypt and the two others have touched a Syrian port.

	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Grenades and gunfire couldnt do what an email has done.         
	The people in charge of security at Delhis Indira Gandhi International airport, caught napping even after terrorists unleashed mayhem on Mumbai last week, are on their toes.         
	The alarm bell was sounded by an email threatening attacks on the Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai airports.         
	Passengers were pleasantly surprised, and amused, to find policemen wielding AK-47 rifles standing on the approach roads while CRPF jawans patrolled on gun-mounted jeeps. Frequent fliers are more used to the sight of security personnel dozing off on duty.        
	Till yesterday, the citys police officers would be armed with 9mm pistols, 3.3-bore rifles, self-loading rifles and Insas rifles, while constables carried only batons. But the hi-tech terrorists have changed all that.         
	As people drove down to the airport terminal, hordes of securitymen, flaunting their new-found weapons, descended on the vehicles.         
	Passengers, still reeling from the shock of the Mumbai attacks, found a reason to smile as they watched their baggage being checked with an alacrity seldom seen before.        
	When news of the Mumbai terror attacks broke last Wednesday, there had been no change in the security routine at the airport. A passenger with a backpack as cabin baggage could enter the airport, get a boarding pass and proceed towards security check without even one layer of either personal or baggage scan. This, even after the Mumbai terrorists were found to have packed explosives in rucksacks.         
	Armed with sniffer dogs and bomb squads, nearly 2,200 security personnel are on duty at the Delhi airport. Police sources said the airport was being constantly monitored by three police stations  IGI, Palam and Mahipalpur. Each has 150 officers.        
	Airlines have asked passengers to check in two hours before departure. But most of them are arriving three hours in advance, considering the long queues at the several layers of security checks.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 29: A man from Phulwarishariff married off his two daughters  in their early 20s  to a small-time farmer-cum-trader on Republic Day after a village soothsayer predicted that one of them would not be able to bear a child.
    
	Shailendra Kumar, alias Pintu (31), married sisters Aarti and Puja Kumari in a Shiv temple in Phulwarisharif on Saturday amid curious onlookers.
    
	As Shailendra, a small-time farmer and petty businessman, proudly walked around holy fire seven times with both his brides in tandem, women of Phulwarisharif gathered at the temple to bless the unique union.
    
	Police, however, did not try to prevent the illegal marriages or arrest the groom on charges of bigamy, as they had not received any complaint. 
    
	The soothsayer whose name the family refused to disclose had told the parents of Aarti and Puja that their eldest daughter would not be able to bear a child and hence, the younger daughter should get married to the same person. 
    
	As the word about my daughters infertility spread, none was ready to accept her. Shailendra came forth to accept my both daughters and we agreed, said Manju Devi, the mother of Aarti and Puja. 
    
	While senior police officers said they had not received the news of the marriage, Phulwarisharif personnel admitted that no complaints were lodged.
    
	Senior lawyer of the Patna High Court Tuhin Shankar said the police could have prevented the wedding even in absence of a formal complaint and they could have taken action against the groom, brides, priest, soothsayer and witnesses. 
    
	Bihar State Womens Commission, which otherwise takes up action suo motu on such cases, has not reacted so far. While incumbent chairperson Lasy Singh could not be contacted, former chairperson Manju Prakash said: The matter is worth being taken up to warn propagators of bigamy.

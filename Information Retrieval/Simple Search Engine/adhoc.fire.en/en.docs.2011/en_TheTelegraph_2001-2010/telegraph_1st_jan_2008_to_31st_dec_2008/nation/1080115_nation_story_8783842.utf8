	Beijing, Jan. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Premier Wen Jiabao have asked their special representatives to move forward in evolving a common framework to resolve the boundary dispute.
 
	This is indicative of the political push to the border talks the two special representatives mdash; Indias national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinas vice-minister for foreign affairs mdash; are scheduled to hold tomorrow. 
 
	Singh and Wen both referred to the contentious boundary issue in their statements. They said pending disputes would not disrupt peace on the border. 
 
	The instability in Pakistan following Benazir Bhuttos death also figured informally at the delegation-level talks on regional security, a highly placed source said. 
 
	But no mention has been made of Pakistan in official documents. 
 
	We have agreed that negotiations on the boundary question have made progress, Premier Wen said. 
 
	He added that the special representatives have been asked to find more common ground. 
 
	In any case, pending disputes would disrupt the peace on the border, the premier added. 
 
	Wen also appreciated Indias re-statement of its one-China position, meaning that India was not recognising Taiwan, with which Beijing is locked in a dispute. 
 
	We had useful discussions on the outstanding issue of the boundary question, Singh said. 
 
	We welcomed the progress made by our special representatives in seeking a framework for the settlement of the boundary question that is fair, reasonable, mutually acceptable, and based on the Agreement on Guiding Principles and Political Parameters signed in April 2005, the Prime Minister added.

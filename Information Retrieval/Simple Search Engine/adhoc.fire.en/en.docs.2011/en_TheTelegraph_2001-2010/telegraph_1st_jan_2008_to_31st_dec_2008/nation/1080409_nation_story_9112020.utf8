The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Claim of Naipaul nod to book
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Claim of Naipaul nod to book
  - Biographer, editor say Vidhya okay with truth          AMIT ROY                           Patrick French at the party                                        
	London, April 8: Odd though this might seem, Nobel prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul actually approves of the coruscating and often shocking biography written about him by Patrick French, it was claimed yesterday.         
	Although The World Is What It Is (Picador; 20) reveals Naipaul was exceedingly cruel to his first wife, Patricia, may have hastened her death when she was suffering from cancer, was physically violent to his long-term Anglo-Argentine mistress Margaret Gooding, was a serial user of prostitutes and used and discarded all those who helped him in India and elsewhere, the 75-year-old author is happy with the way things have turned out.         
	This surprising statement was made at the book launch party held last night at Asia House in London by Andrew Kidd, Frenchs editor at Picador who had to keep in close touch not only with the biographer but also Naipaul himself.         
	Sir Vida Naipaul has so far offered no public comment himself about the book and neither has his second wife, Lady Naipaul, the former Pakistani journalist, Nadira Alvi.         
	Naipaul, Kidd said, is currently travelling in Africa, accompanied by his wife, writing a big book on Africa in the way he has written big books about India.         
	Kidd made a brief speech last night in which he said: Its the most astonishing biography I have had the privilege to publish.         
	Referring to Naipaul, he went on: Everyone must be grateful, including the great man himself. The book will be read as long as the works of the great man (are read).         
	Kidd, who is leaving Picador to start a new job tomorrow working for the agency headed by Gillon Aitken, Naipauls long-term and loyal agent, was tackled afterwards by The Telegraph.         
	Did Naipaul really approve of the book even though it had painted the portrait of an exceedingly unpleasant man?         
	Kidd nodded and explained why Naipaul had not objected: It is in keeping with Naipauls philosophy as a writer  to tell the truth, absolutely, as you find it. This was agreed (beforehand) with Patrick. In his books, Naipaul tells the truth as he sees it. This biography is written in the same spirit.         
	As for the unflattering revelations in the book, Kidd said: All human beings are flawed. This comes across ultimately when you read the whole book; then you understand the genius of the man.         
	Was Kidd genuinely reflecting Naipauls sentiments?         
	Kidd was confident he was. I know Vidia. The bits that have come out (in the extracts and the news stories based on the extracts) are not a fair reflection of the book as a whole. Some biographies are full of the biographers point of view but Patrick did not judge (Naipaul). Thats why its successful.         
	Today, French, too, backed Kidd. Earlier, French had taken the line that he had felt obliged to send his manuscript, as agreed, to Naipaul who had not demanded any watering down of the critical portions or any changes.         
	Andrew is right in what he has said, confirmed French. I sent Naipaul the manuscript but I did not really expect a response. He just said, Go ahead and publish.         
	At yesterdays party, French thanked Kidd for the manner in which he had edited the book.         
	He acknowledged their speeches were beginning to sound like a mutual appreciation society but he wanted to put on record that Andrew is an outstanding editor. He saw me through the wilderness period when I had done a lot of research but not put down a single word. Its the most difficult project I have ever undertaken.         
	There was also a word of thanks for the Naipauls, whom he had visited repeatedly at their residence in Wiltshire. Naipaul has shown extraordinary forbearance as has Nadira.         
	Finally, he sought to make it clear that as the official biographer with full access to Naipauls papers and his late wifes extensive diaries  he had spent 24 weeks researching them at Tulsa University in America  he had not betrayed the confidence his subject had placed in him.        
	A man is not diminished by the telling of his life in full, he said.         
	Also present yesterday was Britains most important literary agent, David Godwin, who represents French as well as the two Indian women Booker Prize winners, Arundhati Roy and Kiran Desai.         
	Asked whether such a hard-hitting biography could serve in future as the model for a book about a leading personality in India, Godwin said: Books are not biographical. There are good books and bad books.         
	Godwin emphasised, however: This is an exceptional biography, an important book. This is a very truthful and honest book.         
	But among those who think a similar biography would not be possible in India is Rachel Dwyer, an academic who has brought out a book on the Bollywood filmmaker Yash Chopra (which she thinks he hasnt read but is capable of reading).         
	It would be very difficult, she said. For one thing, archival material is not usually available (in India).         
	She argued that Indians have a different way of assessing their own lives. For example, according to Dwyer, a successful person would say: God has been kind to me.         
	Dwyer continued: They dont have the same concept (as westerners) of themselves as a person.         
	Her husband, Michael Dwyer, who runs a publishing company himself, said: I can tell you in one word why such scholarship would not be possible in India: Shivaji.         
	He was referring to the controversy stirred up by the book Shivaji: The Hindu king in Islamic India, by James Laine, an American academic.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Safety plea                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to ensure that the rights and security of Tamil civilians are safeguarded at all costs.        
	Singh, under pressure from ally DMK and other Tamil Nadu parties, told Rajapaksa on the phone there could be no military solution to the ethnic conflict. He asked the President to start a political process for a peacefully negotiated settlement within the framework of a united Sri Lanka, the Prime Ministers Office said.        
	The Prime Minister also asked Rajapaksa to direct the Lankan navy not to fire on Indian fishermen and stressed their killing was unacceptable.         
	Rajapaksa assured him all necessary measures were being taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the islands Tamils.        
	Lankan troops have stepped up the offensive against the LTTE rebels fighting for a separate homeland this year and the government says its forces have killed thousands of Tamil Tigers since January.        
	The DMK, a crucial UPA ally, has been pressing the Centre to ask Lanka to halt the military offensive since it fears that troops are wiping out Tamils. The partys MPs have even handed post-dated letters of resignation to mount pressure.        
	Singh today asked Rajapaksa to ensure Tamil civilians did not get enmeshed in the military assault against the LTTE.        
	The Prime Minister expressed his deep concern on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the north of Sri Lanka, especially on the plight of the civilians caught in the hostilities, a PMO statement said.        
	Minister of state for defence M.M. Pallam Raju said Indias supply of defence equipment to Lanka was purely for self-defence.        
	Apparently alluding to fears of Pakistans and Chinas growing clout over Lanka, he said: We are clear that we should be the only nation who should be present in this region and we are guarding our interests in the Indian Ocean region.        
	The UPA government has become more dependent on the DMK after the Left pullout. In turn, the DMK-led government in Chennai is also leaning more on the Congress for support after three of its allies  the MDMK, PMK and the Left  quit.        
	Asked about the DMK resignation letters, Congress chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said: This is one channel they have chosen to react through. It shows how strongly they feel about the issue. But the pro-active approach of the Centre should satisfy (DMK chief) Karunanidhi. Besides, Sri Lanka is our close neighbour and we are interested in the security situation.

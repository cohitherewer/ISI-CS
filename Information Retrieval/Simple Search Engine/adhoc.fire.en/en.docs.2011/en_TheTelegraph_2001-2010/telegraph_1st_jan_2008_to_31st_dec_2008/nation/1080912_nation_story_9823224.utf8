          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amitabh                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 11: Raj Thackeray has ended his seven-month war with Amitabh Bachchan, announcing today that he was calling off the often-violent campaign after the actor apologised for wife Jayas comment.        
	Although we wanted Jaya Bachchan to tender a public apology, Bachchan being the head of the family, we accept the gesture he has made. We are withdrawing our agitation, he said, but warned Jaya not to speak on issues she does not understand.        
	She should only utter the lines written for her (by scriptwriters) instead of speaking up on her own, he said.        
	The Bachchans heaved a sigh of relief as the announcement clears the way for the release of three films starring Amitabh or son Abhishek. Drona, The Last Lear and Dostana had come under a cloud after the latest stand-off, sparked when Jaya said she would rather speak in Hindi, not Marathi, since she was from Uttar Pradesh. Yesterday, Amitabh offered a lengthy apology.        
	The Lear premiere was cancelled after Rajs men vandalised a multiplex.         
	I have said in the past that people like Amitabh Bachchan, Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar are iconic figures and are not restricted to one region. Amitabh should realise he does not belong to a particular region, Raj, who has been fashioning himself as a son-of-the-soil crusader, said.        
	Careful to project Bachchans apology as a victory for Maharashtrian unity, he said: People must have realised what happens when Maharashtrians come together.         
	Dare to officer         
	Raj dared joint police commissioner K.L. Prasad to step out without his uniform and see for himself who Mumbai belongs to. Prasad had said nobody should consider Mumbai their fathers property and told Lears producers they neednt cancel the premiere.

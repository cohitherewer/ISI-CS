  - Singh tells Lalu, Paswan he wrote to CM on migrant attacks        OUR BUREAU                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told ministers from Bihar he had written a strongly worded letter to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh asking him to ensure the safety of all citizens.         
	The letter, he said, was sent on October 27, the day police shot a gun-toting Rahul Raj on a Mumbai bus.        
	Home minister Shivraj Patil, too, sought to placate the Bihar leaders, reminding them that his ministry had sent three advisories to the Maharashtra government to take stern action against anti-social elements.         
	Attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra dominated the cabinet meeting today.         
	UPA allies Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan brought up the Maharashtra governments failure to take action against Raj Thackeray, who had led the assault on north Indian migrants.         
	They demanded his arrest under the National Security Act and asked the cabinet to discuss the issue threadbare. They also sought a judicial probe into the death of Rahul Raj, a 25-year-old job hunter from Patna.         
	The duo received support from the Rashtriya Janata Dals P.C. Gupta and Raghuvansh Prasad and Congress ministers P. Chidambaram, H.R. Bhardwaj, Kapil Sibal and S. Jaipal Reddy.        
	The Congresss allies, especially those from Bihar, feel the partys Maharashtra unit is soft-pedalling the issue. They have alleged that the party, along with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, is trying to split the Shiv Sena vote base by encouraging Raj.         
	Paswan said it was evident from Thackerays arrest-and-release drama that he was being turned into a hero by the Deshmukh government.         
	The Prime Minister later left for Nanded, Maharashtra, where he stressed the need to combat terrorism and divisive forces.        
	The country is progressing rapidly. But there are divisive powers who want to break this country and halt its progress, he said at a programme to mark 300 years of the consecration of the Guru Granth Sahib.         
	Singh, however, did not mention the attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra or name Thackeray.         
	Dal quit threat        
	The Janata Dal (United) today asked its MPs to be ready to resign over the Maharashtra attacks, a move seen as a bid to seize the initiative ahead of the general election.        
	We will wait till November 6 for the central government to intervene in Maharashtra where the rule of law has been held to ransom. All of us (five MPs) will resign on November 7 if the Centre stays a mute spectator to what is happening there, Prabhunath Singh, the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, said.        
	Observers, however, believe the Dal (U) quit threat has been made with an eye on the general election, with MPs having almost completed their terms in the lower House.        
	The possible resignations could send a signal that the leaders had made the biggest sacrifice for the cause of Bihar and its people, the observers said, adding that the Dal (U) could win sympathy votes without losing much.

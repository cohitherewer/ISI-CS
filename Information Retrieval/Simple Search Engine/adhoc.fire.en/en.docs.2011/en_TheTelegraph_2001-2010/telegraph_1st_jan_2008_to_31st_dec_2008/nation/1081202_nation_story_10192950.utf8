The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lunch at Leo with swig of defiance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lunch at Leo with swig of defiance
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Leopold Caf after it reopened on Monday. Ananya Sengupta                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: Leopold Caf buzzed back to business today under the glare of bullet holes  a chilling reminder of the two-minute mayhem that claimed 10 lives and scarred the chic 137-year-old restaurant.        
	Around 2 this afternoon, the scene at the bar-cum-caf in the heart of upmarket Colaba causeway was very much like what it was before Wednesdays terror attack forced it to shut shop for three days.         
	It did open briefly yesterday, but the management closed it in a hurry as the crowd was so large it could have posed a security problem.         
	Lunch at this popular caf, a favourite with foreigners and yuppie executives, was the usual  pastas, fish and chicken. For those who enjoy a mid-morning drink, beer flowed freely.        
	Sitting at a table in a corner, Damian Ryan ordered a glass of beer.         
	I was there when the incident happened, I was shocked to see the way the police were handling it. They were just so unequipped, said Ryan, a 30-something British tourist at the caf named after a Belgian king.         
	I am happy Leopold has reopened. Its one of my favourite hangouts, Ryan added.        
	He didnt even glance at a window behind him that was riddled with bullets.        
	In fact, hardly anyone noticed the scarred interiors.        
	The walls, in between posters of Elvis and iconic actor James Dean, had bullet holes, window panes had gaping gaps, the billing desk bore splinter marks, but no one cared. People tucked into the food  their first lunch at their beloved Leo after the carnage was a meal to remember.        
	I still remember the first time I visited Leopold. I was in college, and had heard a lot about this place from our seniors. In fact, going to Leopold then was more like an event I looked forward to. It was like entering a whole new world, said Shruti, a mother of two who was among the lunching crowd.        
	Once, I remember, a foreigner standing in front of our table announced that he sang very well and began an impromptu song. The caf brings back fond memories, she added.        
	As Shruti and her two children gorged on pasta, Leopolds owners, Farzad Jehani and his brother Farhang, looked on indulgently.        
	I have not been able to sleep since that night. I remember watching two youths standing outside with bagpacks but they looked so normal that I did not pay any attention.         
	The sound of the bullets and the blasts still haunt me. I had to gather myself first before opening the caf. I was scared, thought I had lost it.        
	But looking at the enthusiasm of the people who have come here again and even my staff, who joined me in the fight, has made me strong. But what saddens me is when people specially enter the place because of the incident, said Farhang.        
	Amid the chaos the caf was today, a group of British and Korean tourists competed with each other on doing a beer bottoms-up.        
	I just wanted to show my support. I didnt know Id be the first, said Sharif, 39, the first customer of the morning, holding a glass of Carlsberg beer while his six-year-old son Ali sipped coke.         
	People should know we are not afraid, he said.

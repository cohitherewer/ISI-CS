The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bush fire under climate pot
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bush fire under climate pot
  - US President puts onus on India and China, PM lists compulsions         OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Manmohan, Bush                                        
	July 6: Deal on nuclear energy, not on global warming.        
	President George W. Bush today said a deal on global warming was impossible unless fast-growing China and India agreed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions.        
	A few hours later, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is scheduled to meet Bush in Japan this week, issued a statement listing Indias development imperatives  a reference to compulsions that prevent big cuts in Earth-warming greenhouse gases.        
	The focus in India is on the expected meeting between Bush and Manmohan in Japan but climate change is high on the agenda of the annual summit of the Group of Eight rich nations that starts tomorrow at a luxury hotel on the lush northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Manmohan will leave tomorrow morning for the summit.        
	Ill be constructive. Ive always advocated that there needs to be a common understanding and that starts with a goal, Bush told a news conference after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, the host of the three-day summit.         
	And I also am realistic enough to tell you that if China and India dont share that same aspiration, then were not going to solve the problem, said Bush, who turned 62 today.        
	India, China and 12 other countries will join the regular members of the G8  the US, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Canada, Italy and Russia  for parts of the summit.        
	Developing nations, including India and China, want rich states to shoulder most of the burden of cutting greenhouse gases under a planned pact to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. UN-led talks on a new framework are due to conclude in Copenhagen in December next year.        
	India has not set quantitative limits but Manmohan has repeatedly asserted that the per capita emission would never exceed the per capita emission of the developed countries.        
	However, per capita emissions vary even within the developed countries. Both Australia and the US had per capita carbon dioxide emissions of more than 20 tonnes in 2001, but the UK, Germany and Japan had emissions of about 10 to 12 tonnes.         
	Indias corresponding per capita emission was only 1.5 tonnes.         
	But net greenhouse gas emissions in the US have decreased by 3 per cent and in the UK by about 2.9 per cent between 2000 and 2006. Such figures could be used in climate change negotiations to further intensify pressure on India to make its own commitments.        
	Manmohan has also said that solutions to climate change should also take into account the national imperatives of development and poverty elimination.         
	For us, the foremost priority is the removal of poverty, for which we need sustained rapid economic growth, he said in the statement released this evening in New Delhi.        
	The statement did not make any mention of the Indo-US nuclear deal which is expected to generate clean energy.        
	At the G8 summit, India is likely to brandish the National Action Plan on Climate Change released last week as a signal of the countrys intention to make its own contribution to greenhouse gas reductions.        
	But wide gaps within the G8 as well as between rich and developing countries have raised doubts about the chances for progress beyond last years summit in Germany, where G8 leaders agreed to seriously consider a global goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.        
	The statement by Bush and recent remarks by senior US state department officials might be a portent of mounting pressure on India and China to accept binding commitments on reducing greenhouse gases.

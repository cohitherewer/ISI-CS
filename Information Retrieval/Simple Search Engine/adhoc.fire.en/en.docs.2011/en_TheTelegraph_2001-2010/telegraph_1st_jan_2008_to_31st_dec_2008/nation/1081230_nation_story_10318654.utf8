The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary Indian eye on Bangla poll
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wary Indian eye on Bangla poll
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	Dhaka, Dec. 29: Bangladesh officials said around 80 per cent of the electorate could have cast their votes in the countrys cleanest election.        
	Fakhruddin Ahmed, the chief adviser to the caretaker government, and the election commission believe they have delivered.        
	Chief election commissioner A.T.M. Shamsul Huda expected a turnout of 75 per cent by the end of the day. Turnouts have varied between 50 and 60 per cent in the past. Late this evening, officials said 80 per cent had voted.         
	The political parties, chiefly the BNP and the Awami League, are praising themselves because they believe they have observed restraint they were thought incapable of.         
	Yet, India and the West will worry over whether the elections will bring to power forces that will not be responsive to their demands  a crackdown on outfits backed by a militant Islamist minority  in a fearful but diluted replication of the scenario that saw the Hamas being elected in Palestine.        
	Bangladesh at the moment stands on the fork of a road  one leads to further consolidation of the Islam-pasand (Islam-favouring) polity and the other towards a fresh tryst with our highest ideals which are consecrated by the blood of the martyrs of the war of independence and liberation (harking back to the secularist ideals of Mujibur Rehman), columnist N.M. Harun wrote in The New Age today.         
	Harun has a point. But Bangladesh is voting not for India or for America. It is voting for itself. In a rare opinion poll, 61 per cent said they wanted to vote for candidates who were least corrupt.        
	In this poor country of 140 million people, this election is holding out a hope that may or may not be misplaced.

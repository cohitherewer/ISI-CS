          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A policewoman frisks a student at the entrance to an Ahmedabad college. (AP)                                  
	Surat, July 30: Only last month, home guard Bagdaram Purohit had hung up a list of terror dos and donts in a busy market off Varachha Road, Surats diamond street.        
	Dont touch any suspicious object, the board said. If you spot suspicious objects, inform police immediately.        
	This morning, Purohit was forced to remove the board because there was a bomb hidden behind it.        
	Since the weekend blasts in Ahmedabad and Bangalore and yesterdays haul of 18 bombs here, police have been at their wits end wondering how many more they would find tucked away in remote crevices and nooks and corners.        
	The bomb behind the dos-and-donts board was the third found in the narrow lane since yesterday, hardly 100m from the Labheshwar police chowki.         
	Had they exploded, not less than a few thousand people would have been at risk, residents said. On both sides of Varachha Road, innumerable houses huddle together alongside poorly lit diamond-polishing units and crowded markets.        
	A second bomb was recovered from the city today, atop a tree close to Utsav Hotel in the Kapodra locality. A third was found in the Thobasheri area of Mahidharpura diamond market in the heart of the old city, concealed behind the signboard of a shop.        
	The lengthening chain of bombs, however, hardly seemed to have dampened the spirits of the people who sounded as though they were beyond fear and tired of the lingering uncertainty. I touched the thing (the bomb behind the board) because I have lost the fear of the duds, Purohit said.        
	Markets opened in the Varachha area despite directives to keep shutters down. Diamond units were also largely open, a few closed ones showing up here and there. A garment seller, Jaisukhbhai Patel, said he could not let the duds affect business.        
	V.M. Pargi, the Surat joint commissioner of police, said the people had bounced back after the scare and begun leading normal lives. Just as in Mumbai, where people get back to their normal routine after any adversity, here, too, the people are eager to lead normal lives as they dont want their businesses, jobs and commercial interests to suffer.         
	Police sources said the city might have had a providential escape because timer circuits in the bombs malfunctioned. They trashed as eyewash the email that said the idea was to spark a scare.        
	Something went wrong with the programming, perhaps. We are awaiting results from experts, said Jaisinghbhai Patel, the leader of the bomb disposal squad.        
	The sources said similar timer circuits had been used in the Bangalore blasts. But the IEDs in the Jaipur and Ahmedabad blasts had watches as timers.

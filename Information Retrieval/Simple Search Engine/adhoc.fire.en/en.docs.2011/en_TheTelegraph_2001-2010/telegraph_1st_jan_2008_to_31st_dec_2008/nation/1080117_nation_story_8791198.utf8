	Jamshedpur, Jan. 16: Special officer of Jugsalai Municipality Birendra Pathak is again in the news for the wrong reasons.
    
	Having detected a serious anomaly in building construction under the Jugsalai Municipal area, deputy commissioner, East Singhbhum, Nitin Madan Kulkarni had served the special officer with an ultimatum and asked him to respond by January 10. But the special officer has not responded to the showcause. Kulkarni is also yet to act: he has not initiated an action against Pathak.
    
	The deputy commissioner said he was not authorised to suspend the special officer. He can only recommend to the government that Pathak be suspended. 
    
	The special officer declined comment. 
    
	However, sources in the district administration said Pathak would not submit a response to the showcause. They said the special officer was being made a scapegoat. 
    
	There are so many other multi-storeyed buildings violating rules of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee and Mango Notified Area Committee and they have come up over the past two years.
    
	Kulkarni had issued the showcause to Pathak after Narayani Construction was found building a five-storeyed structure on Station Road in Jugsalai. 
    
	The approved building plan for the structure was only for ground plus two floors.
    
	During a surprise inspection of the Jugsalai Municipality, the deputy commissioner, Kulkarni suspended two fourth grade staff on charge of dereliction of duty. During an inspection, someone drew Kulkarnis attention to the fact that rules were being violated under the nose of the special officer.
    
	Kulkarni immediately inspected the building, which was being constructed, and found the allegation to be true. 
    
	He wanted to know how a five-storeyed building could be set up when the approval was only for three storeys.
    
	Pathak tried to clear his position by claiming that an application for an additional floor  apart from the two approved  was pending with the municipal office. But the special officer failed to give a convincing answer when Kulkarni pointed out that the building already had two floors in violation of rules.

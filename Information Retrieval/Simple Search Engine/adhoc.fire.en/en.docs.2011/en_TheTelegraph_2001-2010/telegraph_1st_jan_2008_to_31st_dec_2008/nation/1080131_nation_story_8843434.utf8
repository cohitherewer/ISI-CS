	Patna, Jan. 30: They gave the public easy access through e-FIRs, but now Tirhut police personnel want people to use that access as judiciously as possible. 
    
	Personnel in the Tirhut range, comprising Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Vaishali, East and West Champaran, have started an initiative to sort out trivial cases before they become a complaint called gale milo aur baat banao (embrace and make up), launched in December 2007. 
    
	Perturbed by sundry cases being registered all the time, senior officers decided to give community policing a shot. Talking to The Telegraph, Tirhut deputy inspector-general of police Arvind Pandey said: With officers taking up the role of negotiators, there has been an overwhelming response from the public. 
    
	The DIG said police superintendents of all six districts have been asked to involve stations and village panchayat heads to sort out sundry matters, mostly related to property disputes and petty fracas. 
    
	Pandey said: Registering an FIR and not being able to follow the case up does not lead the police anywhere. We had to take the human approach to policing by winning public confidence. 
    
	The police have so far dealt with two dozen cases across Tirhut range and got over 100 people to resolve disputes. Most cases pertain to common use of government space, division of property and party politics. 
    
	District police have been aiming for an image makeover for long now. 
    
	Muzaffarpur district has been providing police patrolling on the highways to provide aid to accident victims and to car drivers facing vehicle problems. Muzaffarpur superintendent of police Rantna Sanjay said their patrol vans are fully equipped with tools to help drivers repair vehicles.

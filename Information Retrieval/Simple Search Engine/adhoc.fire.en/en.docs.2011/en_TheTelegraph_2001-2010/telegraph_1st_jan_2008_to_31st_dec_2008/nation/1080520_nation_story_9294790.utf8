          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A file picture of Nilofar Akhtar                                        
	Srinagar, May 19: A woman police constable, whose alleged murder by her superiors in 2006 had sparked uproar in Kashmir, was found two days ago, alive, well and happily married a second time.         
	Constable Nilofar Akhtar was traced to a migrant camp at Nagrota in Jammu, living with her second husband, Deepak Pandita, also a constable.         
	We have brought both here for questioning. Her parents were also summoned and have identified her, said Abdul Gaffar Malik, SSP, crime.         
	We have proved wrong the allegation that she was killed by the police. She will be freed as there is no legal provision to detain her for marrying somebody, Malik added.         
	Under the law, her marriage to Deepak is not valid as she had not ended her previous marriage to Tariq Ahmed Khan, a carpet dealer.        
	Nilofar, in her thirties, lived with Tariq and their two kids. She disappeared on February 28, 2006, after leaving home for work in the Badami Bagh cantonment area. When she did not return home that day, her family lodged a missing case.         
	Her parents alleged that she was sexually exploited by some police officers and that they may have murdered her when she threatened to expose them. Nilofars mother said her daughters beauty became the reason for her death.        
	Early last year, when a case of fake custodial killings  security forces allegedly murdered civilians after labelling them militants for promotions  rocked Kashmir, Nilofars case also rose to prominence.         
	Her parents demanded DNA tests on a highly decomposed body of a woman found at a graveyard in Dalgate. They said it could be their daughters and blamed the police for hastily burying the body.         
	Under pressure, the police agreed to the tests but the reports never came, prompting Nilofars parents to approach the state human rights commission six months ago.         
	The commission asked the government to investigate the case, which was then handed over to the crime branch.        
	Our investigation showed that she had fallen in love with police constable Deepak and eloped with him in February 2006, deserting her husband and two kids, a crime branch source said. The two had met when Nilofar was posted in the Civil Lines area, prior to her Badami Bagh posting.         
	She changed her name to Anjali to avoid suspicion. The two were living as husband and wife and she has a son from him, the source said. The couple shifted to the Nagrota camp a few months ago.         
	Her affair with Deepak was known to some of his friends here and this is how the police got the lead. Some relatives of Deepak were questioned and they revealed that Anjali was the missing Nilofar, a police officer said.         
	Her family has gone into a shell after Nilofar resurfaced.

	Bhubaneswar, June 17: Mamali Dass (12) chance of participating in the under-13 football championship organised by the Asian Football Confederation in Vietnam from June 21-29 has been dashed because she could not obtain her passport on time.        
	Her relations could not be identified at first. Nor did we have the documents such as land patta, essential for a passport. Mamali is a minor and passport authorities have been very strict, said Sahadev Rout, the Orissa State Womens Football Association general secretary.        
	Growing up at a Bhubaneswar orphanage, Mamali was trained under ace footballer Shradhanjali Samantray and coach Nanda Kishore. Her performance won her accolades at the under-13 football championship held in Bhubaneswar last year. This year, Mamali was selected for the championship in Vietnam. Football has been her passion and she is an excellent player. We were glad to see her name in the list, said Rout. Mamali, however, will now have to return from the Gwalior camp.

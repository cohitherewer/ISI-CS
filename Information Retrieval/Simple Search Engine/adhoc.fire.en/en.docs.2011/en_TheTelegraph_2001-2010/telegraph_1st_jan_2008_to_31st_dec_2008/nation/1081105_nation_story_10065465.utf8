          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Church of North India has decided to probe allegations of forced conversions in a historic move to clear the air on a controversy that has triggered repeated attacks on Christian minorities.        
	The decision, the first by any major Christian body to look into the touchy issue, came at the CNIs 13th synod held this week.         
	The church is deeply concerned at the repeated allegations of forcible conversions. We always maintained these allegations to be false.        
	Nonetheless, a task force at the World Council of Churches is being set up to study the issue and to settle the controversy once and for all, a CNI source said after the meeting, held in the backdrop of recent attacks on Christians in Orissa and Karnataka.        
	Father Solomon Simon of the CNI, which has a member strength of approximately 15 lakh, said the church had, off late, been at the receiving end with many, especially Hindutva forces, raising the issue of forced conversions.        
	We thought it was high time we did something to clear the air, he said. The churchs silence had been misconstrued by many.        
	Simon said the issue, as well as the attacks on the community, came up at a recent meeting of the World Council of Churches in Geneva.        
	Rev. Samuel Kobia, the general secretary of the WCC, expressed his deep concern at the repeated allegations of forcible conversions and suggested that a panel be constituted.        
	He said the panel would have CNI representatives and others, but didnt elaborate. He added that it would be asked to submit its report at the earliest.        
	The synod also, for the first time, adopted an education policy to reverse what it called elitism in some of the CNIs own institutions.        
	Elitism, far from being a commitment to academic excellence, is its subversion. It inhibits every attempt to broad base merit and obstructs the development and liberation of a society, the policy said.        
	The synod decided to focus on education for boys after a review of church-run institutions revealed that boys, especially in rural areas, lagged behind girls.

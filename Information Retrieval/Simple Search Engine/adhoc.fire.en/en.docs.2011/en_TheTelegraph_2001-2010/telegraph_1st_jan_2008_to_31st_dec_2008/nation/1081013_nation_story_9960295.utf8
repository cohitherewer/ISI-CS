	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 12: The number of arrested persons in strife-torn Kandhamal continued to swell even as sporadic incidents of violence were reported from different parts of the state.         
	After a brief lull, two more murders were reported in the state in the past 24 hours. Both the victims were Hindus, though. The body of one Birupupakhya Majihi (47) was fished out from an abandoned well in Simanbadi under Daringibadi police station today.         
	Yesterday, a 75-year-old man, Krushna Chandra Pradhan, was found murdered in Panganaju village under Raikia police station.         
	With the two deaths, the toll after the murder of Laxmananda Saraswati rose to 39 in Kandhamal, said superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar. Raikia alone has seen more than 15 murders after the seers death.         
	Pradhan was reportedly in a turmeric field behind his home when he was hacked to death. Investigation is on. This murder may or may not be riot-related, said Kumar.         
	Meanwhile, the police team looking into the nun rape case rounded up three more youths, taking the number of arrested persons pertaining to the case to eight.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Atifs father Mohd Amin in their village Sanjarpur. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Police say Mohammed Atif Amin wanted a Vulnerable India; the man himself wrote he loved Mother India.        
	Atif, alleged Delhi blasts mastermind, mentioned the patriotic films Rang De Basanti and Mother India as his favourite movies on social networking website Orkut.        
	Police, however, claim Atif used to gloat over a magazine, found in his flat after the 24-year-old was killed in Fridays gunfight, that had Bebas Bharat (Vulnerable India) blazoned across its cover.        
	Atifs profile on Orkut reads like that of most young men in their early 20s. He was passionate about sleeeeeeeeeeeeeping and couldnt do without his laptop, handycam, clothes, shoes and shades.        
	His photo album is locked and so is his scrap  they can be accessed only by those on his friends list. But if the alleged chief of the Indian Mujahideens sword arm had something sinister to hide, he was most inconsistent about it.        
	In his Orkut profile, Atif revealed his correct home address in Azamgarh and his Delhi address, L-18, in Jamianagar. He also gave two cellphone numbers (under home and cell), which most people avoid doing on a public domain.        
	The numbers  one an Uttar Pradesh number and the other a Delhi one  are the same as those on his rent agreement and driving licence, but it couldnt be independently confirmed if they were genuine.        
	Atif displayed little religious zeal on the site, apart from saying he kept the Quran and a collection of the Prophets sayings by his bedside.         
	On the whole, Atif revealed little of his personality unlike the arrested Saqib Nissar, 25, who describes himself as a cool dude in his profile.        
	Saqib has 63 people on his friends list  28 Hindus and 35 Muslims, including two members of the alleged terror module, Atif and Mohammed Shakeel  and, according to the police, was quite a hit with the ladies.        
	There are no privacy restrictions on his page. On June 27, he wrote Mast hun (Going great guns) in reply to a friends query about how he was doing.        
	Delhi police accuse Saqib  an MBA student of Sikkim Manipal University  of being devious and clever, claiming he was the alleged terror modules chief logistics man and had worked out the details of their Delhi and Ahmedabad operations.        
	His Orkut friends, however, saw in him a person worthy of trust, giving him a rating of 90 per cent on the Trusty factor, a function on the website.        
	Shakeel too got a vote of approval  from Saqib who wrote a testimonial praising their friendship.        
	Shakeel, 24, alleged to be Atifs closest aide, appears a fan of art-house films and Sufi music. Smart is how he described himself.         
	Saqib was today taken to hometown Azamgarh by 22 officers of Delhi police for investigations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Trinamul to skip Nandi talks
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Tamluk/ Calcutta, Aug 8: The Trinamul Congress will boycott tomorrows all-party meeting to restore normality in Nandigram after clashes this week claimed two lives. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is to chair the meeting.        
	We have not been informed officially about the meeting. Moreover, I had already scheduled a rally at Sutahata, near Haldia, tomorrow. All parties have programmes. I dont understand why it was convened on August 9, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee said in Calcutta.         
	The SUCI, part of Mamatas newly floated 18-party alliance, will also stay away. The Congress will participate.        
	Officials in East Midnapore, of which Nandigram is a part, said it was the first such meeting to be chaired by the chief minister in the district since it was carved out in 2002.        
	District magistrate Anup Agarwal has sent out invitations to representatives of all parties for the meeting, which will be held in Tamluk, about 100km from Calcutta. We have invited all parties with a representation in the Assembly, he said.        
	The decision to hold the talks follows the back-to-back killings of two CPM leaders over the past two days amid a spurt in violence that has prompted families to flee Nandigram.        
	However, 24 hours before Bhattacharjees arrival, the Trinamul-led Nandigram panchayat samiti was repairing the roads dug up and culverts damaged in the recent trouble.        
	Other Trinamul leaders saw no point in the talks, saying the demands made in earlier meetings hadnt been met.         
	Police complaints lodged by the CPM against 43 Trinamul supporters today in connection with the twin murders added to their resentment.         
	Sisir Adhikari, the Trinamul MLA from Egra, near Nandigram, and its East Midnapore chief, was firm on the boycott. Sisir and his son Subhendu, MLA from Contai (South), are among those named in the CPM complaint.

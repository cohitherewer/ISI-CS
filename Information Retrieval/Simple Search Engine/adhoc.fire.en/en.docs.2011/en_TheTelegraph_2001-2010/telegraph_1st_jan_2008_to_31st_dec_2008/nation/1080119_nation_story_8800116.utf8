     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 18: Goregaon police today lodged a non-cognisable offence against Govinda for slapping a man who was watching him shoot at Filmistan Studios on Wednesday.
    
	Santosh Rai was reportedly kicking the legs of Govindas chair on the set of Money Hai Toh Honey Hai when the actor-MP lost his cool.
    
	Rai filed a complaint under sections 323 (simple injury), 504 (abuse) and 506 (threats) of the IPC. He was backed by activists of Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, who staged a demonstration at Goregaon police station demanding that a case be lodged.
    
	We have lodged a non-cognisable complaint. We will have to first inform the Lok Sabha that such a complaint has been lodged before we can take any action, an officer said. 
    
	Govinda, a Congress MP, has described the row as a political conspiracy to defame him.

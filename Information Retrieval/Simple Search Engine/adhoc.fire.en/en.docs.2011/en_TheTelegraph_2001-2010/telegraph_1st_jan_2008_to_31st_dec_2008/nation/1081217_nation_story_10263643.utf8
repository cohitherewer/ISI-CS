          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: The Opposition and ruling BJD-BJP members in the Assembly today blamed each other for the meagre flood assistance released by the Centre.        
	While the BJD-BJP accused the UPA government at the Centre of giving step-motherly treatment to NDA-ruled Orissa, the Opposition members alleged that the state government had failed to spend funds available under the Calamity Relief Fund.        
	Fierce trading of charges continued for almost an hour during the discussion on flood relief.        
	Urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo said then Union home minister Shivraj Patil had announced during his visit to the state the sanction of an interim central assistance of Rs 500 crore for taking up flood relief. However, only Rs 98.87 crore had been released from the National Calamity Contingency Fund by November 1.        
	This prompted the BJD-BJP members to criticise the UPA government for its step-motherly treatment to flood-ravaged Orissa. They alleged that the Centre had released a paltry sum to NDA-ruled Orissa, while providing huge amount to states like Bihar and Assam.        
	Singhdeo said the state government had submitted a memorandum to the Centre seeking release of Rs 2,054 crore from the National Calamity Relief Fund for taking up relief, restoration and rehabilitation measures in the flood-hit areas. However, no response was received from the Centre. He said a central team was expected to visit the flood-affected areas after the Parliament session.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik also said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced a flood relief of Rs 200 crore during his visit to the state in 2006. However, only Rs 25 crore was sanctioned from the National Calamity Contingency Fund later, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat                                        
	New Delhi, July 1: The realisation is sinking into the CPM that its ally in protests against the nuclear deal and price rise, the Samajwadi Party, is crossing over to the Congress fold.        
	Another Left partner, the Telugu Desam Party, might move towards the NDA because of Andhra Pradesh politics.        
	Although Samajwadis Amar Singh, who met CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today, said the decision will be taken at the UNPA meeting on July 3, CPM sources said the heartland party seems to be looking at a new alliance to counter Mayavati.         
	The SP may be opposed to the deal still, but if their approach is forming a new political alliance including the Congress and Ajit Singhs party  which it looks like  then they will be helping the government if we withdraw support, a CPM source said.         
	Amar, after his meeting with Karat, stressed on the greater evil BJP and the threat of that party joining hands with the BSP. He told reporters that as of now, the Samajwadi Party opposed the deal.         
	But the sources said opposition to the deal would become immaterial if the Samajwadis teamed up with the Congress to fight the BJP as that would ensure the government gets the support of 39 Samajwadi MPs in case the 60-strong Left pulls out.         
	The Desam today conveyed to the CPM that it remains anti-Congress and anti-deal. But Chandrababu Naidu is fighting too tough a battle in Andhra to take comfort in being with the UNPA, especially now when the Samajwadis appear to have dashed hopes of a third front.         
	Devender Goud, who was No. 2 in the Desam and enjoys the support of the backward classes, has dealt it an unexpected blow by breaking away. Naidu has little choice but to align with the NDA to take on the Congress, his principal rival.         
	Desam parliamentary party leader K. Yerran Naidu, who met Karat today, said it was not officially conveyed by the SP that they are going with Congress.        
	The Left parties will meet on July 4.

	Stephens team on conflict trip    
	Students from St. Stephens College will be visiting Cyprus on a Commonwealth mission to speak on conflicts raging in the world.    
	A team headed by senior economics professor Vinod Choudhary has been invited by the Commonwealth to participate in a conference in September in the Mediterranean island nation.     
	It is a great opportunity for the students. The exposure they will receive will help them throughout life, he said.     
	Choudhary runs the Commonwealth Society at the college and helps students bring out an annual magazine on major events in the Commonwealth nations.    
	The society recently received a personal note of appreciation from Queen Elizabeth II for its work, Choudhary said.     
	The society also helps students meet diplomats from countries that were not British colonies and, therefore, arent part of the Commonwealth group of nations.    
	Days before Kosovo declared itself independent last month, the societys members chatted with the Serbian ambassador.        
	Plugged into trash power    
	Trash might not be precious, but power produced from it is.    
	Two companies vied with each other to offer the best price for electricity generated at a waste-to-energy plant. Tata Power Company bagged the deal with its offer to pay Rs 3.60 per unit, pipping APTranscos bid of Rs 3.10.    
	The 11mw plant set up at a cost of Rs 72 crore is a joint venture of the Greater Hyderabad civic body and RDF Power Projects. It is located at Bibinagar, 25km from Hyderabad.    
	The Tata response, a sign buyers can pay more, has shown the way for more such ventures. The civic body has decided to revive two more such plants that were shelved because the prices offered for their power were too low. Selco, with one such a plant, is planning to procure 700 tonnes of garbage to produce 15 MW for APTransco.    
	Helpline in need of help    
	Mumbai women who dial a police helpline in distress have been wasting time. They might as well run.    
	Callers to 103 are told that such a number is not in use. The helpline might work if theres a landline at hand during the moments of trouble, a rare piece of good fortune. But few can count themselves so lucky.    
	The police have now discovered that the number cant be accessed from a cellphone, the most convenient accessory one can rely on in times of peril.    
	Apparently, private cellular operators have still not acknowledged 103 as a toll-free number. One might not have thought twice about paying for such calls when the need arose, but the companies havent even given access.    
	The decision to set up the new helpline was taken days after the New Year-eve incident of molestation outside a Juhu hotel. So, until the problem is fixed, women could get help only if they are near an MTNL landline!         
	Metro posers    
	Bangalores planned Metro appears on shaky legal tracks.    
	Karnataka High Court last week directed the state government to submit a report on the projects factual and legal position as well as its stage of implementation.     
	A division bench comprising Chief Justice Cyriac Joseph and Justice B. V. Nagarathna passed the orders on a public interest petition that claimed the plan would lead to the displacement of people and demolitions.    
	The petitioners, some commercial establishments and residents associations, argued that the project would have serious implications for the economy and environment.    
	Mumbai: This Thursday, watch Hai Mera Dil, which weaves five separate stories of love, friendship and longing into a single session. The play, by screenwriter and director Akash Khurana, will be staged at Prithvi Theatre, Juhu, at 9pm.

	Dharamsala, Nov. 23 (Agencies): The Dalai Lama today prodded an overcautious India to provide greater support to the Tibetan cause and ruled out retirement, scotching Chinese rumours on his health.        
	He said new policy options on China could take shape in the next one month but reaffirmed his middle way of seeking autonomy rather than independence.        
	In comments that may annoy Beijing, the 73-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader said: I agree with the Chinese democratic movement. If any democratic organisation there calls me, I will come for a meeting.        
	He reminded India of Jawaharlal Nehrus interest in the Tibetan movement. In 1959-60, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took personal interest in Tibet.... Of late, New Delhis view about the Tibetan issue has been over-cautious.        
	The Dalai Lama said he would not retire, putting an end to speculation about his future after he was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain earlier this year.        
	There is no point or question of retirement, he told a news conference. It is my moral responsibility till my death to work for the Tibetan cause.        
	He accused Chinese authorities of spreading rumours about him. The Chinese say (the) Dalai Lama is suffering from hepatitis B. Earlier, they used to say I am suffering from cancer and will die soon. They are free to come and check.        
	The monks statements came a day after Tibetan exiles decided to stick to the middle way approach to China at a six-day meeting in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based.        
	Total independence is not practical, the Dalai Lama said. Majority of views have come up supporting the middle-way path to the Tibetan issue... which is right.        
	China, which has held eight rounds of fruitless talks with the Dalai Lamas envoys, accuses him of trying to split the country in the guise of seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Dalai Lama had called the Dharamsala meeting to review his China policy.        
	With regard to the meeting, I can say concrete things were not expected, the monk said. However, various options have come out. Wait for another month and then we will talk.

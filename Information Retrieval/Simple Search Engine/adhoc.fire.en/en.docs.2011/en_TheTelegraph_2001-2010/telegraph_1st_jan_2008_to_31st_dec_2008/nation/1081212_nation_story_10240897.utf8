                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SRKs Jodi gives Pak a miss
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                      A still from Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi                           
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: The world will catch Shah Rukh Khan serenading his heroine haule haule tomorrow; only, Pakistan is out of the party.        
	In the aftermath of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, Shah Rukhs Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is not being released in Pakistani theatres.        
	An official spokesperson for producers Yash Raj Films said: It was mutually decided by the Pakistani distributors and us that it is not the right time to release the film there. Whether it will release later or not has to be worked out.        
	The film is going to be released in almost 30 countries tomorrow.        
	When The Telegraph spoke to Shah Rukh late last night, he maintained that Rab Ne would help people smile again.         
	The release date of December 12 was fixed long back and when we started shooting in May, we worked very hard to ready the film on time. Who knew that such horrific attacks would happen in the country? Everyones sad hopefully through a feel-good film like Rab Ne, we will be able to lessen the peoples pain somehow, he said.         
	According to sources, all the formalities of releasing the Shah Rukh-starrer in Pakistan had been taken care of before the attacks cast a shadow on bilateral ties.        
	Big Bollywood movies have been releasing simultaneously in Indian and Pakistani theatres for some time, starting with Himesh Reshammiyas Aap Kaa Surroor. Films like Singh is Kinng, Yuvvraaj, Dostana and Golmaal Returns are still playing at standalone theatres in Pakistan. But with Rab Ne withdrawing its prints, other movies are likely to follow suit.         
	Trade analysts say it would be futile to release big films like Rab Ne at a later date because pirated DVDs would reach Pakistan in no time.

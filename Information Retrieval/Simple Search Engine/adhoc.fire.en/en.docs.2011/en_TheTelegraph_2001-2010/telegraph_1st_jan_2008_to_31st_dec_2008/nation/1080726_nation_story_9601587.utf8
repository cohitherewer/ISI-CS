          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 25: Deep fissures in areas near the banks of the Budhabalanga in Balasore triggered rumours of a possible earthquake.        
	The 1km deep cracks that have developed on the ground have been followed by cracks on home walls in the area. While a house was completely damaged, three others have also developed fissures.        
	A team from the geological department reached the spot today to investigate the development.         
	The cracks that appeared a week before started widening from Tuesday and deepened considerably over the week. The administration sought help of scientists of the state geology department to look into the matter.         
	Experts, after preliminary investigation, have said the fissures were created as a result of a mixed phenomenon resulting from a shift in the rivers course. The area also falls under an earthquake zone, they pointed out. They are likely to conduct a thorough study before drawing any conclusion.         
	The site also falls under the jurisdiction of the Indian Army and used as a missile development area. About 300 families live in the area.        
	Purnachandra Das, a geologist, said landslides resulting due to a change in the rivers course in the past few years might have also led to the cracks.         
	The specialists are likely to submit their report to the collector soon.

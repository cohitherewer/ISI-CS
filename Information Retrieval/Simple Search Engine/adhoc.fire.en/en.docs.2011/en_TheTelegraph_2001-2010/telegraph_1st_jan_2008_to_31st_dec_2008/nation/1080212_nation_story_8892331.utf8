	Bangalore, Feb. 11: A senior Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited official and his wife were found dead in their car on a deserted stretch in the early hours here today.         
	Police suspect that the couple poisoned themselves after a chit fund they were running got into financial trouble.         
	Virendra Kumar, 51, was found dead at the wheel of the Santro in Avalahalli. Wife Usha, 42, was slumped in the front passenger seat.        
	The police found two bottles of pesticide and some tablets in the car. Samples of both have been sent to a forensic laboratory to identify their chemical nature.        
	Usha had been running a chit fund for several years, police sources said, but the couple faced financial ruin and shame in recent months. There was intense pressure to pay back some of the money, an officer said.         
	Kumar was deputy general manager, sales, at Bhels regional office in Bangalore and Usha was a home-maker.        
	They leave behind two daughters. The elder, Ramya, lives in the Netherlands with her husband. Navya, who works in Bangalore, lived apart from her parents.

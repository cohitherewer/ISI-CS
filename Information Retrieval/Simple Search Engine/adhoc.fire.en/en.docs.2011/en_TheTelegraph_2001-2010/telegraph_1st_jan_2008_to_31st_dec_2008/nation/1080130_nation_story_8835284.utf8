 - US comes calling

	Patna, Jan. 29: US presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton might consider taking litti-chokha lessons to appease her Bihar brothers if she wishes to avoid a repeat of January 26 South Carolina shocker.
    
	It seems that campaign managers of Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton may have approached Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and senior JD(U) MP Digvijay Singh to canvass for the presidential polls among the Indians settled in the United States.
    
	Though none of the two candidates received any formal invite, Digvijay Singh said: We may go to the USA to drum up support for Hillary Clinton. The campaign executives for the Democratic Party nominee approached us. We have all the sympathy for the party. 
    
	The Bihar chief minister, however, would be too busy to make the trip to the USA after all. Digvijay Singh who is also an expert on the foreign affairs may go, Nitish Kumar said, adding: We support the Democratic Party presidential nominee.
    
	On February 5 the two candidates  Hillary and Barack Obama  go for the Super Tuesday battle where 22 states would be out to vote for their candidates. Among the 22, New York and New Jersey are the key states and have a sizeable population of Indians  many of them from Bihar  whose votes can be crucial in deciding the fate of the candidates in the fray. 
    
	Few days back, Hillary was trounced by 28 points by Barack Obama who won 55 per cent of the votes in a landslide victory in South Carolina, which makes him a favourite for the Super Tuesday battle.
    
	The Bihar chief ministers secretariat, however, reeled off a super-busy schedule for Nitish for February. President Pratibha Patil, former president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Mauritius Prime Minister Naveenchandra Ramgoolam are scheduled to visit Bihar next month. The chief ministers office said the departure of the dignitaries would be followed by the budget session of the legislature, which will keep the chief minister busy  for the next few weeks. 
    
	Perhaps it would take more than sattu to rope in the Bihar brothers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked states to change existing regulations to let private companies hold skill development classes on campuses of government-run higher educational institutions after regular hours.        
	This would help bring down the cost of running these classes and, as a result, the fees students have to pay for the course, the Prime Minister said.         
	At present, most government higher educational institutions across India are bound by state or central laws to refrain from loaning out their premises for work unrelated to their academic activities.         
	In a letter to chief ministers issued yesterday, Singh asked states for their co-operation in implementing the UPA governments planned National Skill Development Mission that is expected to cost Rs 31,000 crore.         
	The mission, first proposed by the National Knowledge Commission, aims to transform India into a global hub of skilled manpower that can meet the demands of industry  particularly the service sector  internationally. Indian-trained housemaids, for instance, can help meet the shortage of personnel in this sector in the Gulf countries, the commission had said.         
	The commission had also argued that the project would help both in reducing unemployment and meeting the demands of industry better than an equivalent investment in opening more high schools or colleges.         
	It is estimated that there are over 2,00,000 educational institutions, many of which can become skill development centres immediately without affecting formal educational transactions that occur during class hours. Necessary regulations can be brought in, the Prime Minister has said in the letter.         
	The mission, to be headed by Singh himself, aims to train up to 10 million people a month in skills as diverse as pottery and stitching on the one hand, and language on the other, which would be helpful for a BPO job.

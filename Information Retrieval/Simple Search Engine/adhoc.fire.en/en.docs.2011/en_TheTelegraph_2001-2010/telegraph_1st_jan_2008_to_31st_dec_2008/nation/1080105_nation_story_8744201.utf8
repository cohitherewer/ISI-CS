The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State in dark after Centre power spike
                                                                                                            State in dark after Centre power spike
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Jan. 4: In a major setback, the Centre today turned down an SOS of the state for additional power for it to tide over an acute crisis, as industrialists at Adityapur mounted pressure for more.        
	The Union energy ministry and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) officials made it clear to the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) that it could not come to the states rescue till the end of this month since there was severe power shortage across the country.        
	JSEBs new chairman B.M. Verma and the boards chief of commercial K.N. Thakur had been meeting the Union government authorities since yesterday.        
	Thakur confirmed Centres stand on providing additional power. But we are optimistic that by the end of this month, things shall improve.        
	Meanwhile, after a delegation of the joint action committee headed by its chairman S.N. Thakur, who is also the president of Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) met deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto at his residence-office in Kadma this afternoon with plea for more power, it was decided by DVC and JSEB to supply additional 100 MW directly from DVC to the Adityapur industrial area in the adjoining Seraikela-Kharswan district.        
	During the meeting, the delegation highlighted the plight of industrialists in running the units in Adityapur, Gamharia, Chandil and the JSEB command areas in the steel city due to lack of adequate power.        
	Thakur had inquired if it was possible for DVC to supply 100MW exclusively to Jamshedpur and Adityapur industrial areas since industrialists are ready to pay power bills to the DVC through a letter of credit.         
	As for JSEB, officials in Ranchi described the situation as critical. The shortfall, they said, was about 400MW.        
	JSEB, which supplies power to 18 of the 24 districts, requires about 850MW daily. But it is getting 243MW from its two generation plants, about 178MW from central pool and about 40MW from DVC.        
	Although DVC had entered into an agreement with the board in November last year to provide 150MW, it has failed to do so.        
	Chief engineer C.D. Kumar rushed to Calcutta to ensure supply, but JSEB sources saw little hope. Kumar could not be contacted.        
	JSEB consumers across the 18 districts, including Ranchi, meanwhile are facing a severe power crisis, almost 12hours a day. In districts like Gumla, a vast section of the consumers had to go without power for three days at a stretch.

                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Attack on auto, driven too far    
	An auto-rickshaw driver failed to nail his alleged assailants because he got too carried away while narrating the incident to a local court.    
	Like a superhero, the complainant managed to snatch the country-made pistol from the alleged robbers despite being fired at.... His deposition appears to be quite dramatic and unrealistic, rather like a stunt scene from a Hindi movie, additional sessions judge Sanjay Sharma said.    
	According to Vijay Singh, his auto-rickshaw was stopped by a gang of three on the evening of July 12, 2005, at an isolated corner of Sunder Nagri in east Delhi.    
	One of them shot at him, injuring his hand and abdomen. A profusely bleeding Singh then allegedly snatched the pistol and ran home.    
	The judge said he found it hard to believe that Singh went home after the incident instead of going to police. The auto-rickshaw driver had filed an FIR at a police station later.        
	Tech team in top gear  
	IIT Bombay is gearing up for an inter-university competition to build cars.     
	The Indian team to compete in this years edition of Formula SAE 2008, to be held at Michigan in the US in May, is confident of driving away with the crown.    
	The event, organised since 1978 by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), is considered the most prestigious engineering design competition at the university level.    
	The tech schools entry is a car powered by a Honda 600cc engine that costs approximately Rs 25 lakh. The vehicle was built by 35 students from various faculties of the institute. It is 2.5 metres long and weighs 275kg.    
	We had to conceive, design and make a small formula-style racing car. The car will have to compete with 120 other vehicles from universities across the globe, said a spokesperson for the team named IIT Bombay Racing.         
	Power women for reel  
	Mukhtaran Mai from Pakistan, who was gangraped and fought valiantly for justice, sums up the need to empower women. When one woman speaks, two others can speak up, too, she says.    
	A group of people at the British high commission recently heard seven women, including Mai, speak up. And they sat rivetted.    
	The high commission had screened seven films made by women and telling the stories of women from across the world.     
	The high commission has selected 41 such documentaries to be shown across the world.     
	Poojita Chowdhurys film on Punjabs villages was the sole Indian entry. My film explores the 33 per cent reservation for women in panchayats. Critics say it is useless as the women sarpanches act as dummy candidates for their husbands or male relatives, she said.     
	Womens empowerment is a jargon used liberally but seldom understood. These films give a snapshot of what empowerment or disempowerment really means, said Jenny Richards, deputy director of a non-government organisation, TVE.            
	Sex worker sops  
	The Andhra Pradesh government has announced sops for sex workers in distress homes across the state after 400 of them fled one such centre in Hyderabad.    
	The government will provide them a monthly stipend of Rs 150 for basic amenities. The sex workers who had run away cited lack of basic facilities as the reason for fleeing. The announcement of the stipend was made in the Andhra Assembly.     
	BANGALORE: Get your kids to indulge in their hobbies this summer. Bright Sparks on 36/1 Millers Road in Benson Town is hosting the Make and Do summer workshop for three- to eight-year-olds on April 7. Music, dance, art and craft, drama, clay modelling and cooking are part of the programme.

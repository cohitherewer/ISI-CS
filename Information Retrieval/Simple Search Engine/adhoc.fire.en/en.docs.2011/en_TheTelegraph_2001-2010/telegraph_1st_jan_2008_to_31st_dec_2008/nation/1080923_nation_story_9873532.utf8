  - Hoteliers fret after floods snap road and railway link        SUBRAT DAS                           The breach on Puri-Bhubaneswar NH203 near Teashpur on Monday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: Tourism officials in Puri were counting losses even before the season had begun after floods cut off a highway to the Orissa temple town and submerged railway tracks.        
	Railway sources in Calcutta, however, said all trains from Howrah left for Puri on schedule today, though the Puri-Howrah Express and the Howrah-bound Jagannath Express, both scheduled to leave the pilgrim centre tonight, had been rescheduled for 7.05am and 8.30am tomorrow.        
	There have been some breaches on the tracks between Puri and Khurda. We expect the breaches to be repaired by tomorrow morning, a source said.        
	East Coast Railway chief PRO J.P. Mishra said Bhargavi, a tributary of the Mahanadi, was flowing over railway bridge No. 44 between Delang and Birpurusottampur stations on the Khurda Road-Puri section but expected the water level to recede by tonight.        
	In Puri, hoteliers and tourism officials fretted over the impact of the floods this season after the floodwaters swamped a highway between state capital Bhubaneswar and the beach town.        
	Sailendra Patnaik, general manager of Swosti Travels, one of Orissas top travel agencies, said the tourist inflow, already affected, would be hit further if the floods continued till Durga Puja, barely a fortnight away.        
	Thousands from Bengal visit Puri during the festival season and Patnaik said some tour operators from Calcutta had enquired about alternative routes after the road link snapped. We had suggested they divert the bookings through the railways. But now with the disruption of train traffic, the bookings may have to be cancelled.        
	Three trains, including the Puri-Tirupati Express, have been cancelled. The New Delhi-Puri Purushottam Express, scheduled to reach Puri tonight, would be terminated at Bhubaneswar.        
	The Santragachhi-Puri Passenger will be terminated at Khurda Road and start its return journey from there.        
	Our bookings and preparations for the Pujas were over. The sudden development (suspension of train service) is a matter of concern, said Surajit Banerjee, manager of Hotel Victoria Club in Puri.        
	Puri tourist officer Sunil Patnaik said not many visitors had been stranded as September was a lean season but admitted the inflow would be hit if train services were suspended till the Pujas.

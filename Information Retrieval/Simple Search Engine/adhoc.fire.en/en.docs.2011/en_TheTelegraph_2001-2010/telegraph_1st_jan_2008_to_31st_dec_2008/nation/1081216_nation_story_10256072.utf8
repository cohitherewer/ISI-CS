	Patna, Dec. 15: Two persons were killed when police fired 10 rounds on a mob that turned violent during a demonstration outside the Sadar police station in Sitamarhi today.        
	Agitated over the murder of local trader Anil Kumar last night, hundreds of people gathered around the police station and torched a jeep. They also pelted stones at the men in uniform and the district headquarters police station, 140km from here.        
	Unable to pacify the mob on the rampage through batons, the police opened fire leaving Rajiv Mishra (18) and Laxman Mishra (20) dead on the spot and injuring several others.         
	One of the injured persons admitted to the Sadar hospital was stated to be in serious condition.        
	Local people believe that the criminals had shot Anil Kumar to death after he refused to pay extortion money demanded by them.         
	Arbind Pandey, the deputy inspector-general (Tirhut range), said that the police opened fire in self-defence after they failed to control the crowd. Chief minister Nitish Kumar ordered a probe into the incidentand promised action against the policemen found guilty. Additional forces have been deployed around the police station and in the town. The situation is under control now, he said.

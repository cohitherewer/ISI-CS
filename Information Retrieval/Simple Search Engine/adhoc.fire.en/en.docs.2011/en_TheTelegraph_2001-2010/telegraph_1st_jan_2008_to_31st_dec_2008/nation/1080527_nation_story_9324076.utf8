	Bhubaneswar, May 26: Suffering from health problems, lawyer-cum-climber Kalpana Dash is currently resting at the Nepal base camp.         
	Although her exact ailment is yet to be diagnosed, dehydration during the climb probably led to her problems. The sherpas, who accompanied her to the peak, helped her to reach the camp.         
	Her family in Dhenkanal was informed about her condition by a satellite phone from the base camp. Officials informed that Kalpana was not keeping well and asked the family to send her brother, Pradip Dash, to Nepal as soon as possible.        
	The officials have asked Kalpanas mother to not to worry, as two doctors have been pressed into service and medical suggestions were being taken over phone from Indian experts.         
	While Paradip has left for Nepal, reports reaching here said efforts were on to shift Kalpana from the base camp to a Kathmandu hospital. However, the attempt was foiled by heavy fog that prevented her helicopter from landing in Kathmandu.         
	My daughter had rung me after reaching the base camp. She was elated and said that she won, said Sailabala Dash, Kalpanas mother. We are all praying for her to recover fast, she added.         
	The 38-year-old became the first Oriya woman to scale Mount Everest on Wednesday.         
	She was among 27 individuals who successfully scaled Everest as members of a High Altitude Workers of HAD International Everest Expedition, 2008. Kalpana was the only Indian among the 27.         
	The climber led a team of five comprising Ryszard Kurdziel (Canada) and three Nepalese, Lhakpa Rangdu Sherpa, Kusang Tenzing Sherpa and Ngima Nuru Sherpa.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                  
	Patna, Feb. 26: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today defended his colleague and Mokama legislator Anant Singh after RJD fired salvo at the controversial MLAs involvement in a murder.
    
	Anant Singhs name, however, was not mentioned either by the RJD leader or by the chief minister.
    
	While participating in a debate over the governors speech, senior RJD leader Shakil Ahmed Khan told the House that despite a JD(U) leader being named in connection to the murder of contractor Sanjay Singh, the government has been taking no action against Singh.
    
	Nitish, however, took objection to what he called unwarranted accusations in the House against a member. Raising a point of order, the chief minister said: If any member has to accuse another, he has to conform to norms and serve a prior notice to the legislator being targeted. He added that the legislator in question must get a chance to submit his version to the House. 
    
	Nitish told the House that character assassination of leaders from either side would only mar the Assemblys honour. The matter subsided after Speaker Uday Narain houdhary intervened and asked Khan to speak on other topics.
    
	Close to Nitish taking on RJD leader Shakil Ahmed Khan, the BJP also took exception to Khan because of naming the BJP and the Shiv Sena chips of the same block. 
    
	LJP legislator Maheshwar Singh took on bureaucrats for their growing interference in state affairs. He said: We are now afraid of talking to block-level officials, as they might level baseless charges against us.
    
	Singh said a private firm recently levelled extortion charges against JD(U) legislator Niraj Singh alias Bablu after he sought information of progress of the construction work in his Raghopur constituency in Supaul. The LJP leader said legislators wield no power under the present dispensation.

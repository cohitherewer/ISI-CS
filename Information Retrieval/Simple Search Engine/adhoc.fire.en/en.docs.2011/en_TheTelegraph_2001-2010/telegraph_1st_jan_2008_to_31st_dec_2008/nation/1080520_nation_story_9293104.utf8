The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lull before Bihar dissident storm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lull before Bihar dissident storm
          NALIN VERMA                                    
	Patna, May 19: The silence before the BJP dissidents sponsored campaign against Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi seems to be the lull before a storm with observers waiting for the battle to begin again after the Karnataka polls results.        
	We will be heading for New Delhi after May 22. That is when the final polls in the southern state would conclude. We would take up the Modi issue with the high command, said a dissident leader, adding: The party high command had asked us to lay low until the Karnataka polls ends with a promise that it would later listen to our demands.        
	The dissidents have been up in arms against Modi ever since Nitish Kumar reshuffled his ministry dropping 10 of his colleagues and changing departments of others on April 13. They have informed the BJP high command that they would not settle for anything less than the removal of Modi as the deputy chief minister.        
	The reshuffle had evoked a murmur of dissent in the JD(U), too, with a couple of dropped JD(U) ministers expressing their anger before the media. However, Nitish Kumar has, by and large, succeeded in quelling the barking ministers in his outfit.        
	But, the BJP rebellion against his deputy has refused to die down despite party president Rajnath Singh and general secretary Arun Jaitley calling the dissidents and holding rounds of parleys with them in New Delhi last month.        
	Unable to make the rebels back out, the BJP high command asked the rebels to stay disciplined and desist from making news statements till the Karnataka polls. We have followed what the party high command asked us. Now, its for the high command to take the call after the polls, said a dissident who is playing the pivotal role in the oust-Modi campaign.        
	What has put Modi and the BJP high command in a tight spot is the sizeable number of dissidents who are refusing to budge from their demands to oust Modi in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.        
	To Modis discomfiture, the caste balance, crucial in Bihar politics, too, seems to have gone against the deputy chief minister who belongs to the urban business community. He is now under fire from legislators cutting across the dominant upper castes as well as the intermediary and backward castes.

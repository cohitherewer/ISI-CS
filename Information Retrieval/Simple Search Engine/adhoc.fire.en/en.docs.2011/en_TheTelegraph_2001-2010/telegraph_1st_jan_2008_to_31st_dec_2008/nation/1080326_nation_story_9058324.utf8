          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bachchan and daughter-in-law Aishwarya with BJP leader LK Advani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, March 25: Amitabh Bachchan has withdrawn his offer to donate 21 acres of land in Maval near Pune to farmers displaced by a dam.        
	The star submitted a letter to Maval sub-divisional officer Sanjaysinh Chavan yesterday saying he had changed his mind on the land that he jointly owns with son Abhishek.        
	Chavan had asked Bachchan to submit documents on a plot he had bought in Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, which the star had cited to buy the Maval land.        
	The actors lawyer, Umesh Deshpande, visited me but he did not furnish any documents we asked for. Instead, he furnished this letter stating that Bachchan wishes to withdraw the previous letter offering to donate the land. The property is owned by him and he has the right to do what he wishes, Chavan said.        
	A controversy had erupted last year after Bachchan bought the land near the Pawana dam close to Lonavala, about 70 km from Mumbai. He had submitted documents saying he was a farmer as he owned agricultural land in Barabanki.        
	According to Maharashtra laws, only farmers can buy agricultural land in the state. The Pune authorities cleared the transaction after scrutinising the stars Barabanki land documents.         
	But they questioned his ownership after Uttar Pradesh challenged the authenticity of the Barabanki transaction. After the actor was accused of acquiring the Barabanki land on forged papers to wangle a certificate declaring him a farmer, Bachchan had given it up. He also wrote to the Pune authorities last September saying he wished to donate his Maval land.

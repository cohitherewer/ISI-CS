	Veerappan ghost strikes tuskers
  
	The forests bordering Salem in Tamil Nadu and MM Hills in Karnataka seem to be haunted by the ghost of their most famous resident. 
  
	The discovery of elephant carcasses with their tusks missing has brought back memories of Veerappan, over three years after he was shot dead by the Tamil Nadu special task force.
  
	For, this is how the big-mouche bandit had started his long reign of terror before he turned sandalwood smuggler.
  
	Seven elephants have been found dead under mysterious circumstances in the last month alone.
  
	Tamil Nadu forest officials recently received information that a suspected poacher named Kumbha had been arrested by their Karnataka counterparts.
  
	The residents of Veerappan territory have already given him the sobriquet of Kutti (little) Veerappan.
    
	New Santas in New Year
  
	So what if the world celebrates Christmas on December 25, chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy and Opposition leader N. Chandrababu Naidu prefer to play Santa Claus on January 1.
  
	The chief minister visited children at Niloufer Hospital, where a recent strike by junior doctors had claimed the lives of several infants. Then he hopped across to some villages and inspected programmes meant for the weaker sections in rural Andhra.
  
	Not to be outdone, his rival focused on the urban poor. Naidu, the Telugu Desam Party president, did the rounds of slums, government hospitals and public schools in Hyderabad. He also had lunch at an orphanage. 
  
	The children might have been charmed, but the CPM sniggered that the gimmicks had nothing to do with the milk of human kindness.
  
	Their actions just bordered on populism as they were nothing but vote-capturing exercises, scoffed a senior CPM leader. 
  
	An SOS from wife guards
  
	The Centre is busy turning babus into role models in combating domestic violence, but seems to have forgotten to help protection officers carry out their roles.
  
	A court in the capital has sought an explanation from the Delhi government for allegedly not providing enough assistance to the protection officers, who have been assigned the job of helping and informing victims on how to use the domestic violence act.
  
	Metropolitan magistrate Devender Kumar Jangala issued a notice to the director in the social welfare department on January 8 after a protection officer from west Delhi knocked on his door. 
  
	The protection officers needs to be provided with necessary office assistance for the efficient discharge of functions non-compliance, thereof, attracts penal consequence, Jangala said.
  
	The officer had filed a petition saying only two protection officers have been assigned for the whole of west Delhi and the outer districts. 
    
	Jayas blessings
  
	Jayalalithaa is known to preside over weddings only in her party members families, and many a hopeful bride or groom has been turned away by a wave of the mighty hand.
  
	But the ADMK boss recently made a pleasant exception for the son of a television journalist. 
  
	A wave of surprised gasps went across the wedding venue as Jayalalithaa strode in, accompanied by close friend Sassikala. 
  
	Whats more, she also showered flower petals on the happy couple and posed for pictures with the more-than-happy parents of the newly-weds.

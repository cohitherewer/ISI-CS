          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 11: Mondays attacks by suspected Sangh parivar activists on the P. Sunderaiah Vignan Kendra in Hyderabad and the CPMs Dehradun office rocked Parliament today.        
	In the Rajya Sabha, CPM politburo member and MP Brinda Karat charged BJP leaders in Delhi with inciting their workers to attack communists across the country, sparking uproarious scenes during zero hour. This is the politics of violence and intolerance they (BJP leaders) are practising. They are cowards, she said, drawing angry reactions from BJP members.        
	Amid cries of shame, shame from the UPA benches, Karat said BJP and RSS workers tried to damage the Hyderabad centre and burn a portrait of Sundaraiah, a CPM leader and freedom fighter. She demanded the Union home minister make a statement on the vandalism.        
	Senior BJP member M. Venkaiah Naidu shot back, citing the violence in Nandigarm to silence Left leaders and accusing CPM cadres of killing thousands in Kerala.

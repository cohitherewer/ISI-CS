                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   IN THE HOUSE
                                        
	When will the debate start?  
	11am on Monday, soon after the Lok Sabha assembles following a customary all-party meeting. Debate follows obituary references and swearing-in of new members.         
	How many hours will the debate last?        
	16 hours have been allocated over Monday and Tuesday. But it is very likely the debate will take much longer. The UPA has been given four of the 16 hours.         
	Can the PM speak?        
	Yes. All ministers, even if they are members of the Rajya Sabha, regularly participate in Lok Sabha proceedings. Since this is a trust vote, all eyes will be on the Prime Minister. He will speak at least twice. The Prime Minister will move the one-line trust motion. The debate may formally be kicked off by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha. At the close, the Prime Minister will sum up and rebut points raised in the debate. He may also make interjections during the course of the debate.        
	When will the voting take place?        
	Uncertain because acrimony can delay proceedings, though the parliamentary affairs ministry wants to wrap up the vote by 6pm on Tuesday. A realistic time will be late evening on Tuesday.        
	Is it an open ballot?         
	Yes. In addition to electronic voting, MPs also fill out voting slips. It will be known how each MP has voted.  
	How is   electronic   voting done?  
	 Red button to oppose   the motion and green in favour. Those who want to choose neither can opt for yellow.  The button has to be kept pressed for 10 seconds. If an MP wants to change the option, it will have to   be done within the   10-second window.

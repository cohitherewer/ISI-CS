     BASANT RAWAT

	Ahmedabad, Jan. 17: In about a weeks time, Narendra Modi should get to know how an ideal chief minister should be  by watching himself.
    
	Come January 25, a film based on the Hindu poster boy-turned-God will release in at least 40 theatres across Gujarat.
    
	Ajisinh Jhala, the Vadodara-based director of Gujarat No Nath (lord of Gujarat), said the chief minister would attend the premiere the day earlier.
    
	He said the tax-free film  whose central message is what an ideal chief minister should be like  was inspired by the charismatic leadership of Modi, to whom the states impoverished snake charmers have built two temples.
    
	So its no surprise that the hero, Namo Narayan Jogi (played by Akhilendra Mishra), looks, speaks and dresses like Modi. His family life also resembles that of the chief minister.
    
	Even the heros name is a take-off on the BJP leader, who is also called Namo (short for Narendra Modi) in Gujarat, while the theme song  Aapnu Gujarat, Augvu Gujarat (our Gujarat, developed Gujarat)  is a slogan that Modi had coined.
    
	All theatres have been booked for the release and the tax-free status would help attract more people, Jhala said.
    
	Entertainment commissioner Bhagyesh Jha denied that the film was getting any special treatment. All films that meet our criteria for Gujarati cinema are tax-exempt, he explained. The waiver, he added, was aimed at promoting Gujarati films.
    
	The film, shot over the past year and financed by Surat-based builder Ranmal Ahir, will soon be dubbed in Hindi, Jhala said. Minister Purshottam Solankis brother Bharat is one of the producers.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          A girl with BJP stickers on her face in Bikaner on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, Nov. 24: Sonia Gandhi and L.K. Advani campaigned in Madhya Pradesh today raising their pet themes of lack of development and terror, but their lieutenants stayed put in their constituencies shoring up support.        
	With just a day left to court voters ahead of the November 27 polls, at least 15 senior ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chauhans BJP government were cooped up in their constituencies.         
	This included former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew Anup Mishra, Jayant Malaiya, Babulal Gaur, Narottam Mishra and Gopal Bhargava.        
	The Congress, too, appeared jittery. Opposition leader Jamuna Devi, former state party chief Subhash Yadav, Union minister Arjun Singhs son Ajay and most former ministers stayed put in their areas. Ajay, who heads the partys campaign panel, is reportedly finding the going tough in pocketborough Churhat.        
	Insiders in the BJP and the Congress said their leaders would tour the rest of the state but with just a day left for the campaign the priority seemed to be local issues.        
	Sonia flew into the state for the first time in this campaign and, addressing meetings in Bhind and Gadarwada, focused on the achievements of the UPA, while accusing the state government of corruption and inefficiency.        
	The Centre sends crores of rupees to Madhya Pradesh but the money is not used properly and we do not know to what use it is put, she told the gathering in Bhind.        
	At Gadarwada, referring to the BJPs campaign demand that the Congress account for 50 years of its rule, Sonia said: After Independence, my party was involved in building the country but the Opposition was sowing seeds of hatred. The Congress understands the vexations of farmers and the youth.        
	She said corruption was so rampant under the BJPs rule that some (leaders) had bought currency-counting machines. She avoided naming chief minister Chauhans wife Sadhna Singh, against whom the state Congress had levelled specific allegations of corruption.        
	Advani harped on national security, accusing the UPA of adopting a sluggish approach towards tackling terror at a rally in Indore. He questioned Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs announcement yesterday that a committee to draw up a roadmap aimed at preventing terror strikes would be set up within 100 days.         
	Manmohan Singh took over as Prime Minister in May 2004 and after 1,600 days, he is talking about a 100-day roadmap, he said.        
	The BJPs Prime Minister candidate demanded the restoration of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, saying police officers at yesterdays conference  where the 100-day roadmap was announced  would have raised the need for such a legislation.         
	Taking a dig at the Congress for harping on Hindu terrorism, Advani asked: Why are they silent on the blasts in Assam and other places? Why is only the Malegaon issue being talked about?        
	He was speaking hours before Malegaon blast suspect Pragya Singh Thakur levelled more allegations against the Maharashtra anti-terror squad.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Elections in Jammu and Kashmir, due later this year, are likely to be delayed with no signs of the state returning to normality.        
	Election Commission officials have cancelled a scheduled visit to the state to study the ground situation, sources said. The officials decided to delay their visit since it would have strained the security further, a source said.         
	The commission is meeting tomorrow to take an official view on elections in the border state and in Delhi. Chief electoral officers of the two states will brief the commission on poll-preparedness.         
	Yesterday, poll preparations in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Mizoram were reviewed and found to be smooth, the sources said.         
	The commission sources said a delay in Jammu and Kashmir was a strong possibility because the month-long Amarnath agitation had hit poll preparations.        
	The process of finalising electoral rolls was on. Also, electoral photo identity cards were being issued. The entire thing has come to a standstill, an official said.         
	Issuing photo identity cards is a time-consuming process since new cards are being issued to all voters in the state, the sources said. This follows reports that militants trained in Pakistan had procured cards issued earlier.        
	The Election Commission has already been getting feelers from the Centre about delaying polls in the troubled state, where Presidents rule is in force since the Ghulam Nabi Azad government fell over the Amarnath land row.         
	It is too early to make a categorical statement. After tomorrows meeting, the Election Commission will also hold a meeting with the home ministry and representatives of paramilitary forces and the army to discuss the security scenario in the state, the official added.        
	The officials will also have to take into account the Valleys harsh winter  it is under snow after November.        
	Either the elections have to happen by November or they will have to take place with the Lok Sabha elections sometime in March next year. In that case, Presidents rule will have to be extended in the state, the official said.        
	Government sources said the Congress was not in favour of early elections and had conveyed that voting should be put off till tensions eased both in Jammu and in Kashmir.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 28: A group of villagers beat up a quack, smeared her face with limestone and paraded her, holding her responsible for the worsening condition of a mentally unstable woman.        
	Police rescued Lalpari Devi, 45, yesterday at Adalchak Dumaria village on the outskirts of Patna. Six persons were arrested today and sent to jail.         
	According to the police and villagers, Lalpari, a resident of Naubatpur, had visited neighbouring Adalchak Dumaria to treat Manorama Devi.         
	When Manoramas condition worsened, her husband Ramayodhya Rai caught hold of Lalpari and slapped her. He then beat her up with shoes, a broom and farm tools.        
	Some villagers joined him in the assault, smearing Lalparis face with limestone. They tied her up with a rope and paraded her. Patna police reached the village and found the quack tied to a tree.         
	Ramayodhya was among those arrested today.        
	The villagers beat me and abused me by calling me a witch, Lalpari said.        
	The incident was brought up in the Assembly today with the RJD-led Opposition accusing the government of patronising feudal forces.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar promised stern action against the accused.

	Holy bath, with buckets of dung    
	Every Nagpanchami, groups of people in Gadag throw cow dung at each other in a rather unorthodox monsoon celebration.    
	he north Karnataka town, which is around 400km from the Karnataka capital, has steadfastly stuck to this ritual during its week-long Nagpanchami festival every year. The objective, though, is more earthy: to draw attention to the fact that dung is a better alternative to fertiliser.    
	The locals urge farmers to use dung as manure in place of harmful chemical fertilisers, whose use is widely blamed for the poor fertility in an area that has otherwise been known for its high yields of a rich variety of vegetables.     
	During Karekatemli, as the festival week is called in the area, locals bathe in water mixed with dung, believed to have many medicinal properties. The festival attracts thousands, with local farmers contributing heaps of dung  enough to throw at each other and make the event a success. Dung has several other uses, as firewood and to wipe houses, but nothing quite like this holy bath.        
	CM goodies for quality films    
	Tied to a shoestring movie budget? Dont worry. Make sure you are in Tamil Nadu and M. Karunanidhi is still at the helm.    
	The chief minister recently loosened his states purse strings to dole out Rs 4.9 crore in subsidies to 70 quality budget films that had been made with Tamil titles in 2006 and 2005.    
	Speaking after handing over the amount, which worked out to Rs 7 lakh for each movie, Karunanidhi claimed Tamil Nadu was possibly the only state in the country to have implemented such a subsidy scheme for films.    
	A two-member jury had picked the films. The subsidy will encourage producers to make quality films and to choose Tamil names so the language can be promoted, said Karunanidhi, an author and a self-confessed movie buff.     
	Varsity cell for dream jobs    
	Delhi University has started thinking of life after campus.    
	A centralised placement cell to attract prospective employers will be set up so that students can find the jobs they want.    
	A few colleges have such cells. But the centralised cell will help students from nearly 60 colleges get equal opportunities in companies of their choice, Seema Mehra Parihar, deputy dean, student welfare, said recently.    
	Some short-term programmes, to develop the job-getting skills of students and to help them overcome shortcomings, have also been lined up. We will organise workshops and short-term courses to build communication and personality-development skills to get their dream job, Parihar, overseeing the initiative, said.    
	The recruitment cell will collect data from eligible students and recommend them to potential employers.    
	Companies from sectors like software, pharmaceuticals, finance, humanities and life sciences are coming to the university in search of skilled employees, Parihar said.        
	Knotty affair    
	This will be quite a tying of knots  2,500 couples together.    
	The plan is a brainchild of the Andhra government, which is organising a mass wedding ceremony this month-end for poor Muslim men and women who cant afford a lavish walk down the aisle.     
	Minorities welfare minister Ali Shabeer says the plan is based on the marriages of underprivileged Hindu couples organised by the Tirupati temple. Chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy wants a similar ceremony for minorities.

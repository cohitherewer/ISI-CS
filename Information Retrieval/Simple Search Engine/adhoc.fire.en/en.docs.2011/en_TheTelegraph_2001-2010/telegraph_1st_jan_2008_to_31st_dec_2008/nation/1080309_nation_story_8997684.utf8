          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, March 8: The body of A. Srinivas, the Indian doctor who was found dead in the US last Saturday, was brought back to the city today.         
	Srinivas, the 29-year-old who was pursuing his postgraduation in Pennsyvania University, was found with deep injuries on his neck. Police suspect it to be a case of suicide.         
	His father Anjaiaha, who brought back the body, however, said: MY son was not a coward to commit suicide.         
	Relatives and friends gathered at the family home at Korutla in Karimnagar district where the body was kept for a few hours before cremation.         
	Anjaiaha fainted as he lit the pyre.        
	Relatives of several Andhra students studying in the US took part in the funeral. Many of them accused the US authorities of indifference in investigations of murders and attacks on Indian students.         
	I am scared of my daughters studying in the US and have urged them to come back soon, said R.V.V. Krishna Rao, whose daughters are pursuing MS in America.         
	US ambassador David Mulford, who met chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy yesterday for opening a consulate in the city, assured him that all steps would be taken to ensure safety of Indian students in the US.        
	Some relatives also urged the Centre and the state to take initiatives to ensure their childrens safety. Andhra higher education minister D. Srinivas recently said the government was not involved in either sending the students or providing them any financial assistance.

          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad receives a red rose from wife and Opposition leader Rabri Devi at his Patna residence on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, June 11: True to his signature flamboyant style, railway minister Lalu Prasad celebrated his 61st birthday today in Patna by cutting a train-shaped cake with icing that read Garib Rath.         
	He fed the first slice to his wife Rabri Devi, who offered him a rose wishing him all the strength to serve the nation.        
	Lalu Prasads supporters, who had gathered in hundreds to greet him on the occasion, chanted Lalu Prasad jindabad, as the Union minister joined workers in distributing cakes and an assortment of sweetmeats among his supporters.        
	The RJD had also organised a Garib Bhoj in Patna on the occasion. What more, for a change the party cadre came out on to the streets not with placards but with brooms to clean the city as a mark of their leaders birthday.        
	Sources close to the railway minister revealed that the leader received calls from UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and other central ministers wishing him on his birthday.        
	Lalu Prasad did not miss to remind the assembled workers of the Lok Sabha polls due within a year on the occasion. Gear up for the polls. Do not waste time, he said.        
	As in the past, today, also Lalu Prasad maintained that he was not aware of his actual date of birth as his poor and illiterate family had hardly maintained a record of his birth, he joked.         
	My supporters celebrate my birthday every year on June 11 on the basis of my matriculation certificate. The certificate states that I was born on June 11 and if that is good enough for my people then it is good enough for me, said the charismatic leader.        
	I am thankful to my supporters for wishing me well on this day, he added.

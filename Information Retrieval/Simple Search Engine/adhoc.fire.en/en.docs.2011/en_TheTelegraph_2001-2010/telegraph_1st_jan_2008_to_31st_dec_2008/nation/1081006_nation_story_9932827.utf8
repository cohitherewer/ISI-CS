	Hyderabad, Oct. 5: After the Karnataka recce, Tata Motors MD Ravi Kant today flew into Andhra Pradesh to check out potential plots on offer to relocate the Nano plant.        
	Kant and his colleagues were first driven to Seetharamapuram, about 40km from Hyderabad. Alluru, farther away, was next.        
	Agencies, however, reported that the team faced a hostile reception at Seetharamapuram, after which the members cancelled their trip to Alluru.        
	Sources told PTI the government had 1,200 acres in Seetharamapuram, of which 40 per cent had been rented out to farmers. But this could not be confirmed.        
	The Tata team is also believed to have checked out some sites in Visakhapatnam, Anantpur and Nellore. They were taken around by Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation staff and other industry officials.        
	The team looked up Andhra Pradesh chief minister, who was out of station, after his return late in the afternoon. The members also spent time with industry minister J. Geeta Reddy.        
	We are open to any proposal. Please do not hesitate and leave out any of your demands. We will give you anything you want, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy is reported to have told Kant.        
	Kant merely said his team had made a spot study of the locations and a decision would be taken soon. We are keeping our options open to visit other sites in other states, he told reporters.        
	On Friday, the day Ratan Tata pulled out of Bengal, Andhra Pradesh had announced huge sops in its integrated automobile policy to bring it on a par with Tamil Nadu.        
	Among the slew of incentives were allotment of land at concessional rates, 100 per cent exemption from stamp duty, subsidised power with dual feeder line, exemption from electricity tax for 10 years and other tax breaks.        
	Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal today said he would approach Ratan Tata to invite him to set up the plant in the state. If he agrees, the state will extend all possible help to enable the Nano car to roll out in time, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Arjun Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 5: Education minister Arjun Singh has asked his Kerala counterpart M.A. Baby to consider altering controversial sections in a school textbook.        
	The state Congress and religious outfits have alleged that the communist state government was trying to promote atheism through these sections and demanded their withdrawal.         
	Government officials said Singh suggested that Baby change the wording used in two chapters of the Class VII textbook.         
	Several Muslim and Christian organisations have also complained to Singh, sources said.         
	A chapter in the social science textbook relates the story of a boy asked by his teacher which religion he belongs to. The boys parents have names that suggest they belong to different religions. The boy tells the teacher he has no religion. The flabbergasted teacher turns to the boys father who says his son is free to choose his religion.         
	Another section, on Indias first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, mentions his will stating he did not want any religious cremation after his death.         
	Singh has suggested that instead of removing these sections altogether, the wording used could be changed, ministry sources said.         
	The minister suggested certain words be changed to make the text less offensive to those opposing the book. That way, the state government can escape the embarrassment of withdrawing the book while responding to the concerns of opponents, a source said.         
	The Kerala government has set up a panel to examine whether the textbook needs to be withdrawn, Baby is learnt to have told Singh.

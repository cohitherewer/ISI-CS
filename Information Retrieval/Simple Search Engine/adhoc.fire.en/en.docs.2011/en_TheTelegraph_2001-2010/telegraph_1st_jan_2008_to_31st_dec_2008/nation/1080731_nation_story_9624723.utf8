The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi turns moderate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Modi turns moderate

	Surat, July 30: Moderation is in the air in Narendra Modis Gujarat  echoing in the speeches of the usually bellicose chief minister, the responses of his police force and even the comments of the RSS.         
	Terrorism is a proxy war. If we do not follow the rules of the war, if the nation is not united against terrorism, then the terrorists will take advantage, Modi said.        
	For once, he was not speaking of Gujarati pride.        
	Terrorists were attacking the countrys economic progress by targeting centres of economic growth like Bangalore and Hyderabad, he said, adding in the same breath Ahmedabad and Surat.         
	Only last month, Modi had thrown a dare at the Centre: Gujarat would stop paying taxes, and Delhi could stop aid to the state. When the comment caused an uproar, he challenged the Union government to charge him with treason.         
	Today, Modi even skipped his usual jibes at the media and instead appealed for help to lift the morale of the people.        
	The chief minister, who visited the diamond hub of Varachha and other areas where bombs were found, announced a Rs 51-lakh award for information on the terror network behind the Ahmedabad blasts. He promised Rs 21,000 for every information on live bombs planted in the state.        
	With general elections only months away, the BJP leader is keen to be seen as a national player rather than a regional strongman. Since the December Assembly polls, he has been restrained in his comments on the minorities.        
	He would also be concerned that the blasts should not affect the investments Gujarat draws.         
	The moderate mood seemed to have rubbed off on other Sangh parivar units. At a rally in Ahmedabad yesterday, VHP workers carried placards that said: Allah naam par aa shu karyu, Allah kadi maaf na kare evu karyu (What have you done in Allahs name? Allah will never forgive what you have done).         
	Many marchers did bring up their usual charge of state bias against Hindus but were firm that Ahmedabad has to stand communally united.         
	If the rally was any proof, the Sangh parivar seems to be uniting in the state. It included members of the RSS, VHP and the BJP, though it is widely believed that the VHP and Modi do not see eye to eye.        
	Haresh Thakkar of the RSS described the blasts in Ahmedabad and the bombs planted in Surat as terrorist  rather than communal  acts. He accepted the suspicion that local residents might be involved but added: Even this we cannot say with certainty.         
	Inspector K.S. Patel of Katargam police station went a step further, saying any local resident from any community could have offered support to those behind the blasts.         
	Gujarat police are facing questions for being so clueless about the blasts when they have in the past claimed to have busted about a dozen plots to assassinate Modi.         
	With the intelligence network floundering, the return of four police officers who were shunted out because they were unbiased during the 2002 riots might now be due.

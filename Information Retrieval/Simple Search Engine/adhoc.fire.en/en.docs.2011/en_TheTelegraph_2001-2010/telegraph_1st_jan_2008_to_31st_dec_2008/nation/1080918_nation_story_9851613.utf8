          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Congresss Christian leaders have urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to be pro-active on attacks on their community.        
	The appeal came after Bajrang Dal and VHP activists vandalised at least 15 churches in Karnataka on Sunday to protest the alleged proselytisation of Hindus and refused to allow people to attend the weekly service.        
	In an indication that the Congress would not remain on the backfoot vis--vis the Sangh parivar, the party has officially demanded a ban on the two outfits and central intervention in Karnataka if the violence continues.        
	A Congress Christian leader from Karnataka told Singh that if the government and party watched mutely, the leader would have no choice but to engage in a personal and non-political capacity with the community and retaliate against the pro-Hindutva forces.        
	The leader told The Telegraph that calls were pouring in from the state, asking what heavy duty Karnataka representatives in Delhi  four Congress general secretaries are from the state  were doing for the Christians in distress.        
	Following the leaders intervention, Singh spoke to Karnataka governor Rameshwar Thakur and chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa about the attacks.        
	Sources said Yeddyurappa told Singh the violence was provoked by the pro-activism of new evangelical groups which were allegedly more in-your-face on conversions and religious propaganda than the traditional church.        
	But Congress leaders, dealing with Karnataka, stressed the Bajrang Dal and the VHP had started the attacks. No matter what the trigger was, the outfits had no business taking law in their hands, they said.        
	Sonia and her aides decided the party would stage protests, involving leaders of all communities. General secretary M. Veerappa Moily, who is looking to fight the Lok Sabha polls from the Mangalore region, offered to lead the protests.        
	But sources said the leaders frowned on the move, saying this was not the time to feather ones political nest.        
	The need of the hour is to assuage the feelings of a community under siege and not look to score political points, said one of Moilys colleagues.        
	The sources said if things were allowed to continue unchecked, Karnataka could get irredeemably polarised on Hindu-Christian lines.        
	The feedback was Christian youths were beginning to feel it was time for active self-defence, as the state government was seen to patronise the Bajrang Dal and the VHP.        
	The boys are saying if Muslims retaliate, why shouldnt we? We should stop appearing vulnerable, a source said. The government asked the National Human Rights Commission and the National Minorities Commission to do a spot check. Once their reports come, it will chart the course of action.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 30: The recent floods have cast a shadow over Durga Puja, which draws lakhs of people from adjoining areas for its pomp and gaiety.        
	The Cuttack Mahanagar Puja Committee has decided to make the Puja, starting October 6, and the immersion ceremony a simple affair.         
	The collector gave the proposal at a meeting for the Durga Puja.         
	The Puja committees of different localities have since unanimously assured to make it a simple affair, said Pravat Kumar Tripathy, the secretary of Cuttack Mahanagar Puja Committee.        
	The Puja committees of different localities have further decided to hive off portions of their budget for this year for the flood-affected people in the district, Tripathy said. The committees have already started giving their donations to the Chief Ministers Relief Fund through the district administration, he added.        
	At least 100 Pujas are organised in different localities of Cuttack.        
	Meanwhile, the official toll in the flood has gone up to 73, while more than 42.05 lakh people living in 6,481 villages and 189 urban wards across 19 districts had been affected, said state disaster management secretary G.V.V. Sharma.         
	Cuttack is one of the worst-hit districts in the Mahanadi basin devastated by the sudden spurt of water in the rivers in the delta.

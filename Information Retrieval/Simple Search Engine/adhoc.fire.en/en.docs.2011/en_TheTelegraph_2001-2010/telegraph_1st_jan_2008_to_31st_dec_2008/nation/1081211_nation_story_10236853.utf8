          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 10: Sleuths are probing how an expelled cadet was re-admitted to the Indian Military Academy under a false name and remained undetected for months.        
	The officers are poring over the documents of 25-year-old Sanjeev Yadav, who produced his 22-year-old brother Deepaks testimonials the second time. It has also emerged he had faked his fathers name when he took admission the first time in 2005.        
	Sanjeevs father, Major (retired) R.S. Yadav, was arrested today for allegedly misleading a police team that had gone to their Meerut home to verify his sons credentials. In 2005, Sanjeev had given his fathers name as Swarn Singh Yadav, a farmer.        
	The cadet was handed over to police yesterday, just two days before the passing-out parade. He was expelled in July 2006 for prolonged absence.         
	Sanjeev, sent to police custody for seven days today, is said to have confessed his crime. He accused the IMA authorities of throwing him out without valid reason. After my expulsion, I decided to prove a point and adopted a fake identity to get back into the IMA, the police quoted him as saying.

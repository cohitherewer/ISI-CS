          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Centre has more or less decided to curtail the ongoing session of Parliament by four weeks.         
	The House could be adjourned as early as on October 24, nearly a month before the sessions scheduled end on November 21.        
	This means Parliament will have sat for only six days in the second phase of the monsoon session without any substantive transaction other than passing a supplementary demand for grants to meet a procedural fiscal requirement.        
	Government sources said the decision  to be firmed up before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh leaves for a foreign trip tomorrow  followed a consensus across the political divide that lawmakers were more preoccupied with the upcoming festivals and the six state polls than House proceedings.        
	The government is thinking of resuming the sitting after December 8 when nearly all the Assembly election results will be out.         
	But the government is in a quandary over whether to prorogue the House and convene a fresh session in December or allow the ongoing session to spill over, the sources said. There are merits and demerits in both decisions, said a cabinet minister.        
	If the House is prorogued, the Opposition can bring a no-confidence vote against the government in the new session. The rules say the government can face only one no-trust motion in a session. The UPA went through the exercise in the first leg of the monsoon session on July 21 and 22 after the Left withdrew support over the nuclear deal.        
	The governments strategists had concluded then that rather than prorogue the House and call a winter session, the July sitting should be kept alive to insulate the government against another no-confidence motion.         
	Sources said the revived sitting was almost certainly going to be the last in the 14th Lok Sabha, indicating the government was looking at a general election in January-February instead of April 2009.        
	If a new government comes into being in end-February, it can convene a parliamentary session almost immediately and then call a budget session later.        
	Through an early poll, the government wants to cash in on the slow but certain decline in inflation, the slump in oil prices and the reasonably good growth rate despite global pulls and pressures. Before the negative effects of the meltdown percolate, we should go in for an election, a source said.

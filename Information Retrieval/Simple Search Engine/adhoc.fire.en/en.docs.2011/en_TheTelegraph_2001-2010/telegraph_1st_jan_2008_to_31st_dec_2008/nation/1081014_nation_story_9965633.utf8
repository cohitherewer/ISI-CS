          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 13: Indian Mujahideen suspects arrested by the crime branch have revealed that anaesthetic tablets and ampoules seized from them were to be used for abducting prominent businessmen, opening up a new battlefront for the countrys terror-busters.        
	Two of those arrested revealed that they had planned to use the injections and tablets to kidnap businessmen for ransom, joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said. They had identified a prominent Pune builder and a jeweller as prime targets and even conducted a 15-day reconnaissance in the early months of 2008.        
	Mumbai police had announced the haul at a news conference on October 6.         
	Among the drugs seized from 20 Indian Mujahideen suspects, including alleged co-founder of the group Sadiq Shaikh, was ketamine, primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug.        
	It is also a popular anaesthetic in veterinary medicine.        
	Maria refused to reveal the quantity seized but joked that it was large enough to put an entire stable to sleep.        
	Asked whether the drugs were meant to counter the effects of a narco-analysis test, he said the police were medically examining the possibility.

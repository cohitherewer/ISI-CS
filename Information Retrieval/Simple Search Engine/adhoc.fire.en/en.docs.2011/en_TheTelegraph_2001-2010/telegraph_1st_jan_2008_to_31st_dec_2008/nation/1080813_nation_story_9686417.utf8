          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Sangh parivar is stepping up its Amarnath campaign: as the BJP holds nationwide protests, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has threatened to do an Ayodhya.         
	VHP leader Praveen Togadia said today: Like the Ayodhya chalo call, we will ask millions of Hindus from all parts of the country to march to Amarnath. If the government does not restore the land given to the shrine board, the agitation will intensify and Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi will be responsible for that.         
	The VHP will start its protest tomorrow with a two-hour chakka jam (road blockade) all over the country.         
	BJP leaders, led by L.K. Advani, have hit the streets with a vigour not seen during the recent protests against price rise. They have spread out in state capitals to lead party programmes and court arrest. Other than Advani, Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj are at the forefront.         
	The party has become hyper-active, holding programmes all over. Even its minority morcha, led by Shahnawaz Hussein, organised a protest at Jantar Mantar here today.        
	Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad rebuffed suggestions that the BJP was behaving irresponsibly and argued that it always wanted a peaceful solution. He added that the party was for the unity and integrity of Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Reports have surfaced in the past that the BJP had seriously contemplated dividing the state and even discussed the proposal with Pakistani representatives when A.B. Vajpayee was Prime Minister. In 2002, while Vajpayee was in power, the RSS had adopted a resolution at its Kurukshetra conference calling for the division of the state into Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.

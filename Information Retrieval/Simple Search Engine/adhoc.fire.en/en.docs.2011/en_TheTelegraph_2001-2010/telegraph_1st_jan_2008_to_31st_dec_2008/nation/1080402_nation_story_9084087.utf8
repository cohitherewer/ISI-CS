          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 1: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today recommended a probe into the harassment slur on former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty, who stepped down from office yesterday.         
	Talking to reporters this evening, the chief minister said he had earlier suggested a probe into the allegation by a House committee. However, since the Opposition has not co-operated, he went on to add, he has requested the State Human Rights Commission, a statutory body, to probe into the allegation.         
	On the night of March 25, Gayatri Panda, an assistant lady marshal of Orissa Assembly, had accused the Speaker of sexual harassment, plunging the Assembly into turmoil. On March 27, she lodged an FIR against Mohanty at Mahila police station.         
	The Opposition, all along, had been demanding Mohantys resignation, even as he announced that he would not preside over the House till he was cleared of charges.         
	Mohanty had also suggested for a House committee probe  a plea that was later supported by chief minister Naveen Patnaik who had said the matter should be inquired by Assembly members and not by any external agency.         
	However, the Opposition did not agree to the suggestion arguing that such a probe would not be neutral since the Speaker belonged to the ruling party and could hold influence a House committee.         
	The Opposition had stalled the Assembly proceedings for a week demanding an impartial probe by CBI or a sitting judge of the high court. On Monday, they had sought the intervention of the Governor, M.C. Bhandare. The members met him last evening even after the Speaker stepped down to press for a CBI probe.         
	Apparently, bowing to pressure put by the Opposition and womens organisations, the chief minister today decided to go in for a probe by the State Human Rights Commission.         
	Meanwhile, Bilasini Nayak of Mahila police station visited Gayatri Panda yesterday and recorded her statement. Nayak, who is investigating the case, said interrogation was on for the second day today. However, she declined to divulge further details.        
	Panda, whose morale has been boosted after the Speakers resignation, said she was hopeful that the truth would come out after the inquiry.

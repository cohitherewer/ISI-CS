                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     DMK 13 resign over Lanka
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Oct. 17: The DMK has secured post-dated resignation letters of 13 of its Lok Sabha members, stepping up pressure on the Centre to persuade Sri Lanka to halt a military offensive against the Tamil Tigers.        
	Those who submitted the letters include seven Union ministers. The letters are dated October 29, by when the DMK lawmakers have asked the Centre to ensure an end to the Lankan troops offensive against the Tigers.        
	The Prime Minister had expressed concern at the raging conflict but the government is loath to repeat the disastrous intervention of the eighties.        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon today summoned Lankan high commissioner C.R. Jayasinghe and told him that Colombo should address New Delhis concerns over the humanitarian situation and stop harassing fishermen.        
	Menon said Colombo should find a negotiated political solution to the ethnic problem rather than look for a military victory.        
	Sources said the DMK resignation letters, though submitted to the organisation, were addressed to the Speaker, suggesting that the party might precipitate the issue to battle growing anti-incumbency in Tamil Nadu.        
	Without the support of the DMKs 16 Lok Sabha MPs, the UPA government may just about manage to hang on.         
	The ministers who handed over resignation letters today include T.R. Baalu (shipping), A. Raja (telecom) and S.S. Palanimanickam (minister of state for finance).        
	Karunanidhi said this evening that the Centre should take firm steps to stop the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The Centre clearly knows how to bring about peace in Sri Lanka. I hope they will decide and act. People know what happened in Bangladesh, he said.         
	Asked how India could interfere in the internal affairs of Lanka, he said: Like we did in Bangladesh.        
	Responding to a question, the chief minister said: I am not saying that India should intervene militarily. I do not believe that bullets are the answers to bullets.

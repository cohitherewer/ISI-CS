          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today managed to meet Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, to discuss the Kosi besides inviting him to be Bihars guest on his next visit to India.        
	Nitish had apparently requested the Centre to include him in the discussions with the Nepalese leader but the idea was dismissed, sources said. So the Bihar chief minister met Prachanda at a luncheon under the auspices of the Indo-Nepal parliamentary forum hosted by forum president and colleague, Sharad Yadav.        
	At a personal meeting on the sidelines of the lunch for Prachanda, Nitish discussed the issue of water management of Kosi and other rivers which originate from Nepal and pass through Bihar. The change of course by the Kosi has wreaked havoc in Bihar, killing hundreds and leaving millions homeless.         
	The hope for Bihar came from the Nepal Prime Minister who said that he was in favour of big hydel projects in Nepal that could generate up to 10,000MW over the next 10 years. He understands peoples problems and knows the problems of Bihar, Nitish told reporters later. Prachanda is understood to have promised to visit Bihar the next time he visits India.         
	A dam, if constructed on the Kosi, would enable controlled discharge of water that would solve Bihars problem to a great extent, the chief minister said. Nitish said he had told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also that Nepal should be helped to construct big dams. As a long-term measure for managing rivers from Nepal, Nitish had submitted a Rs 17,000-crore proposal to the Centre.        
	The August 18 breach in the Kosi left lakhs homeless in five north Bihar districts  Madhepura, Supaul, Saharsa, Purnea and Araria  within a couple of days.

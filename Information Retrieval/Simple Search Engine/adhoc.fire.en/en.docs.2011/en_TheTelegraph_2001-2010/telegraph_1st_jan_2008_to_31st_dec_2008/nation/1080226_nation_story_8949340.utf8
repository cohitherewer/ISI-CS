          SUJAN DUTTA                           Robert Gates at Pearl Harbour last week                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: US defence secretary Robert Gates is expected in New Delhi tomorrow for a visit that is largely intended to suss out the Indian governments reading on the civilian nuclear deal and bolster military relations.         
	Neither the US embassy nor the Indian defence ministry is revealing the agenda for Gatess talks. But the US defence secretary, who is leading a 46-member delegation, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan apart from his counterpart, A.K. Antony. He is also slated to meet the leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani.         
	A US newspaper has reported on its website that Gates is carrying a letter from President George W. Bush offering to give the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk to India, along with 65 F/A-18E/F Superhornet aircraft that may be based on it.         
	Indian defence ministry sources officially declined to comment on such an offer.         
	But Indias navy chief, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, said in December that India was not interested in the Kitty Hawk right now because, in his words, it is too old.        
	There have been other commentators, however, who find merit in an offer of the USS Kitty Hawk to India. A defence ministry official was ambiguous when asked if a formal offer of the ship was made and said there was some talk of it about two years back.         
	Since then, India-US military-to-military relations have intensified and, after India approved a $1 billion deal to buy six Lockheed Martin-made C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft last month, the US defence spokesperson said the contract was the signal for many more military transactions to come.         
	The USS Kitty Hawk was hosted by the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal last September for the Malabar war games. But its history of wartime deployment since it was commissioned in 1961  it is a year older than the Indian Navys only aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat (in its avatar as the HMS Hermes)  marks it out for the Left in India and abroad as the imperialist war machine. Aircraft from the ship flew out and bombed Vietnams communist army in the early 1970s.         
	The Kitty Hawk, that is due to be decommissioned shortly from the US Navy, has almost always been forward deployed.         
	Indias current troubles with Russia over the delayed acquisition of the carrier Admiral Gorshkov are further feeding speculation over the Kitty Hawk offer after Moscow demanded an additional $1.2 billion over the amount contracted in 2004.         
	The Kitty Hawk is among the oldest warships going but, even as it prepares for its decommissioning, the 82,000-tonne (at full load) super-carrier is fully operational.         
	In contrast, the Gorshkov was taken out of the Russian navy in 1996 after only eight years in service even though it is 20 years younger than the Kitty Hawk.        
	The Kitty Hawk is nearly twice the size of the Gorshkov.         
	The Indian Navy currently at least does not have a port in which to berth a vessel that large, but there are anchorages that it could use.         
	Gates is expected to enquire about a Logistics Support Agreement during his visit.         
	The agreement, which will allow India and the US to host and replenish each others ships and aircraft at bases in either country, has been pending with the cabinet committee on security for nearly two years after it was cleared by the armed forces headquarters and the defence ministry.

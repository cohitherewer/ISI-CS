	Srinagar, Oct. 19: Saleem Iqbal is resigned to a busy season in hospital  because Assembly elections are on the way.        
	I think there will be an escalation of violence in the next couple of months and a lot of injured people will be rushed to our hospital, the senior surgeon at Srinagars Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital said.         
	The Election Commission today announced the poll dates  the first of the seven phases will be held on November 17.        
	But in these troubled times, few in Kashmir are in the mood for polls.         
	Before August 11, I had no grudges against India, but everything changed on that day, Iqbal said.        
	That day is when police and CRPF jawans opened fire at protesters marching towards the Line of Control to break an alleged economic blockade of the Valley. The wave of violence that the firing triggered left around 50 people dead and thousands injured.         
	Like Iqbal, many doctors in Kashmir havent had much sleep since then. So many wounded people were admitted to our hospital that I have lost count. It was terrible I have myself become a hypertension patient.         
	The party that wants the elections the most is the National Conference (NC). Out of power for six years, it sees the polls as a chance to revive its fortunes.        
	We have a Herculean task ahead but we are accepting the challenge of joining the poll fray, NC provincial president Mehboob Beig said. Elections cannot solve the Kashmir issue but there are other issues like unemployment, roads, power, etc., which also need to be addressed.        
	The Peoples Democratic Party is crying foul. We are not just disappointed but shocked, too. They (the commission) should have given us time to settle things here, a leader said.         
	The PDP doesnt want polls now because it knows that reports of its two leaders facilitating the transfer of land to the Amarnath shrine board are still fresh in the electorates mind.         
	The separatists also are against elections.         
	Nobody is interested in these elections. We will ask people to stay away from the process. Polls cannot be an alternative to the right to self-determination and the time has come when New Delhi should take steps to resolve the dispute according to the wishes of the people of Kashmir, Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said.         
	According to police sources, the separatists pose a tougher challenge than militants, who are not as potent as they used to be. The separatists may try to disrupt the poll process by organising marches and rallies. So, security has to be stepped up, an officer said.         
	Another group the authorities might find difficult to handle is government employees, who had openly sided with the separatists during the Amarnath stand-off. There is a possibility that they might boycott election duty.         
	The Election Commission, however, has a contingency plan of bringing in around 5,000 Urdu-speaking government employees from other states, as was the practice before 2002.

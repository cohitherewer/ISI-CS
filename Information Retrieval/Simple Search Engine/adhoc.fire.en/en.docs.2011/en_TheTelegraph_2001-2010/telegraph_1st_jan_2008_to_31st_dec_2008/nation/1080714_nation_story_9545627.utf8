          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, July 13: The Naxalites operating across the states of Bihar and Jharkhand have decided to oppose the India-US nuclear deal describing it as an instrument to push India in a trap of slavery.         
	The imperialist forces have conspired to put India into economic slavery through the UPA government at the Centre, a news release issued by Bihar-Jharkhand zonal office said, adding that stepped up armed struggle would be the right answer to this conspiracy.         
	We will oppose it (N-deal) will all our might, it stated.        
	The central committee of the outfits eastern zonal committee also criticised the Left parties for their dubious policy of supporting the UPA government for over four years and then backing out ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The statement also called upon people to remain vigilant about all parties that serve the interest of the capitalist forces and multi-national companies and asked the public to boycott them in elections.         
	The statement reiterated the rebels resolve of boycotting polls, asserting India is not fit yet for the electoral politics.

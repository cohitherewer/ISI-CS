          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 21: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked IAS officer and former home secretary Santosh Kumar to conduct disciplinary proceedings against suspended inspector-general (IG) of police Sanjiv Marik, who has been accused of having links with a group of criminals from Bihar.        
	The chief minister said the Lokpal inquiry report would be examined thoroughly and action would be taken against the suspended IG, if charges against him were proven.         
	Whatever is appropriate would be done, assured Naveen Patnaik today after he returned from New Delhi in the afternoon.        
	The Marik matter began on February 23, 2007, with an armed robbery in Bhadrak branch of Central Bank of India where two lives were lost along with Rs 23 lakh.        
	Later investigations revealed the involvement of a Bihar gang, following which five members were nabbed with help from Bihar police.        
	Subsequently, the Orissa police received a message from their Bihar counterparts of a likely party of accomplices travelling to Bhadrak jail to bail out the five.         
	The Bhadrak police intercepted the car and took four people into custody  three from Bihar and one Krushna Chandra Behera from Bhubaneswar.        
	The Bhadrak team were taken aback to find that Behera was deputed by former IG Marik to escort the three to jail.         
	Former director-general of police Amarananda Patnaik who had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the matter, had expressed his displeasure over Marik lending his assistance to the Bihar group. This was an unwarranted step and unbecoming on the part of a senior IPS officer, Patnaik had observed.         
	Marik was suspended on May 21, 2007, on the basis of the report.        
	Subsequently, the Orissa chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, had referred the matter to the Lokpal for further investigation.        
	A few days ago, Lokpal Justice S.C. Mohapatra had submitted his report to the government.         
	Meanwhile, Marik has pleaded innocence. Quoting the provisions of Orissa Jail Manual, Marik today said any body can visit a jail and meet an undertrial.         
	I think I have not done any wrong by arranging such a meeting, he argued.

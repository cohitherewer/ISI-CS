	London, June 27: Asif Ali Zardari has spelt out his thinking on how Pakistan and India should improve their relations for the first time since the Pakistan Peoples Party came to power following Benazir Bhuttos assassination.        
	In a message sent to a high-powered conference in London, India Pakistan: Designing a New Future, the PPP co-chairman said that lack of a solution on Kashmir should not hold up progress in other areas.        
	This appears to be a different approach, at least on paper, from that which had been adopted by President Pervez Musharraf.        
	The message from Zardari, the power behind the throne in Pakistan, came during a visit to India by Islamabads foreign minister. It received applause from Indians and Pakistanis alike when it was read out at the Tehelka-organised conference.        
	On the issue of Kashmir, we must make a viable peace. This is a solvable problem that must not take further lives, Zardari said.        
	Pending a final settlement, we agree with the statement of your Prime Minister supporting an autonomous Kashmir running much of its own affairs. A commission can be established between the two countries and the leaders themselves to work out what should be done in foreign and defence affairs.        
	Zardari added: While working out the solution to Kashmir we should not allow slow progress on it to be an obstacle to work in other co-operative matters.        
	He outlined his vision on India-Pakistan relations: The PPP believes that Indo-Pakistan relations can and should be creatively discovered. This requires making conscious decisions and deliberate choices.        
	On terrorism, he said: We also agree that a very serious danger to the peace process comes from militants and terrorists. Therefore the challenge for us is to dismantle the militant cells so that they cannot hold the foreign policies of the two independent nations hostage to their acts of terrorism. The PPP therefore welcomed the decision by both India and Pakistan to work together on anti-terrorism efforts and to share information in this regard as a positive step forward.        
	He emphasised: The PPP had made trade, not conflict with India, a top priority of its relations with India. After 60 years of independence and mutual acrimony we must now pledge an end to war, terrorism, death and destruction.        
	He said: The PPP believes that a very important thing for Pakistan is to have civilian control over the military.        
	Zardari also promised a liberal regime in the field of culture. The entertainment industry is huge in India and growing in Pakistan. There must be no boundaries between our countries in this area, too.        
	The conference was entertained by Karan Johar who said his next movie, My Name Is Khan, was about a Muslim who wanted to meet the American President so that he could say: My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist.        
	Among those who have spoken at the conference are Imran Khan, Ram Jethmalani, Abhishek Singhvi, Arun Jaitley, Farooq Abdullah and a number of senior Pakistani politicians and bureaucrats, including Sartaj Aziz, a former finance and foreign minister.

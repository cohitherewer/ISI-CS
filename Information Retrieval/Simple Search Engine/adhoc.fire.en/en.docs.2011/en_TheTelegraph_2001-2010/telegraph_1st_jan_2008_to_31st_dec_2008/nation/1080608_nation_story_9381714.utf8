	Guinness run for work minus leave     
	EST, Mumbais transport corporation that isnt a stranger to strikes and lost man days, has an example in one of its own: an employee who is set to break into the Guinness World Records for having not taken leave in 17 years.    
	Sudhir Shastri had been showing up at work without a break all these years but never expected that his organisation would recommend him for a place in the record books.    
	Shastri, who works as secretary of the BEST committee, has attended 671 panel meetings during his 17 years and seven months in the organisation. He retired on May 31.    
	Shastri began his stint in 1977 in the statistics department but went on to work in several other divisions before being appointed secretary in November 1990.     
	The recommendation has surprised him as he doesnt feel he has done anything extraordinary. I attended all meetings, except one in June 2006 when I was too ill. I never thought of a record. I didnt take leave as I feel one must be sincere.        
	Court green light for Metro    
	Metros elevated corridor in parts of Delhi raced past another hurdle recently when a suit claiming the trains would cause alarming noise pollution was thrown out.    
	Delhi High Court dismissed the petition, filed by residents of colonies on the route of the project, but asked the authorities to ensure there was minimum noise.    
	Residents along the 4.5km corridor, being constructed between Jawaharlal Stadium and Kalkaji Colony, had argued that the trains would pass too close to their homes and affect the way they lead their lives now. The route passes through Jangpura, Kailash Colony, Defence Colony, Lajpat Nagar and Greater Kailash.    
	The Centre defended the elevated plan, saying an underground corridor was too expensive. The Metro said work contracts had been given and it wasnt possible to step back. (PTI)    
	Villa rush hits new peak    
	Whoever told you Hyderabads property market was slipping off its heights hadnt looked at the luxury villa rush.    
	The demand for such villas and luxury apartments, which have changed the citys realty picture, remains as high as ever with rates in the range of Rs 8 crore to Rs 20 crore.    
	An example on offer is the Boulder Hills Golf and Country Club, being constructed by a joint venture of the Dubai-based Emaar group and Delhis MFG, where villas within its 531-acre plot are going for rates up to Rs 20 crore.     
	The Rs 5,610-crore project has 100 such villas, all of which have been booked. The main attraction is a 192-acre, 18-hole golf course laid out in line with international standards. Also, the villas will be close to the IT companies and the new Shamshabad airport.     
	An IT special economic zone is planned in the enclave, as is a retail outlet spread over 3m sqft.     
	Emaar-MGF chief executive William Robert Rattazzi says the villas have been designed by a California-based firm and constructed in Spanish, Italian and Moroccan styles. Items used in their construction have come from the world over.         
	Tongue twister    
	A Chennai flier who came perilously close to slicing his tongue with chunks of glass in an Indian food packet has successfully sued the airline for Rs 50,000.    
	Businessman Abdul Khader claimed that the glass shard was found in the food supplied to him on the Chennai-Singapore flight over two years ago.    
	A consumer forum fined the carrier for deficiency of service, saying it should have taken its caterers to task for the lapse.    
	MUMBAI: If fairy tales excite you, watch Hair this Sunday, a play about a little girl who was imprisoned by a witch in a tower so long that her hair touched the ground below and her rescue by a handsome prince. Venue: NCPA Experimental Theatre, Nariman Point. Time: 7pm.

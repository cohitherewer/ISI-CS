	New Delhi, April 7: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury called on Sonia Gandhi this evening to explain the enormity and gravity of the price-rise crisis and why the Left had to take its agitation to the streets.        
	Yesterday, the Left and the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) had announced a weeklong protest from April 16 against the relentless price rise.         
	Yechury told Sonia that the CPM would do everything to stop the BJP from coming to power. But he also pointed at the thorns in UPA-Left ties.         
	He reiterated the demands of the Left and the UNPA, including universalisation of the public distribution system and restoration of foodgrain allocation to states under the PDS.        
	There was no word from the Congress on what Sonia said to Yechury at the 45-minute meeting. We were not privy to their conversation, a spokesperson said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: The CBI today claimed it was nearing a breakthrough in the twin murders of Aarushi Talwar and domestic help Hemraj, saying arrested compounder Krishna had made a confessional statement.        
	Agency joint director Arun Kumar didnt give details but said the statement had been recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC (confession before a police officer), which, however, means, it cannot be produced in court as evidence.         
	Kumar refused to say if Krishna, compounder of Aarushis arrested dentist father Rajesh, had owned up to being the killer or part of the murder conspiracy. But another senior CBI official said the endgame in solving the mystery may just be a few confirmatory forensic tests away.        
	Although the probe now seems fixed on domestic helps, including Rajkumar, who worked for the Durranis, family friends of the Talwars, Aarushis father Rajesh hasnt been given a clean chit. He still remains a key accused. Even his wife Nupur is under the scanner, said a CBI official.        
	Krishnas confessional statement was part of the CBI case diary submitted today in the designated court that agreed to extend his remand with the agency by six days.        
	Moving the remand plea, the CBI said Krishnas presence at the Talwar home on May 15 night, when the murders were said to have taken place, had been established.         
	Krishna has also admitted to taking a khukri (dagger) to the house on May 14 on Hemrajs request.        
	Kumar said a khukri had been seized from Krishnas house and experts were trying to find out if it was used in the murders.         
	Sources said Krishna had to be interrogated further to recover the murder weapon and to tie up several loose ends. One of them is the murder motive, which the CBI doesnt appear close to establishing, though many theories are floating around.        
	Earlier, the CBI had claimed to have found a heavy metal strip from a drain near the Talwar house in Krishnas presence and suggested it could be the second weapon used to hit Aarushi and Hemraj on their heads.         
	A team from the agency, accompanied by forensic experts from medical institute AIIMS, today searched the house of Rajkumar, the domestic help of Praful and Anita Durrani. Clothes and a few other items seized were sent for forensic tests. Krishnas clothes are also being examined.

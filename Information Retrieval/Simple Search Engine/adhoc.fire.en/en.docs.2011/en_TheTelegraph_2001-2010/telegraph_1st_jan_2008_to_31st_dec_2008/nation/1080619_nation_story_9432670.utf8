	London, June 18 (PTI): An Indian doctor with Britains National Health Service has been barred from treating female patients, except in emergencies, following complaints of inappropriate examination of two women.        
	For nearly four years, Syed Asghar Zaheer, who graduated from Lucknow University in 1958, has had restrictions on his job after being found guilty of the charges.        
	The General Medical Council has now decided to extend the restrictions by a year since he didnt submit evidence on how he had addressed the concerns raised when he was first pulled up for the controversial examinations.        
	At a fitness to practice hearing this week, the council, which regulates medical professionals, ordered that except in life-threatening emergencies, Zaheer must not see female patients without the presence of a chaperone. He was also asked to maintain a log, signed by the chaperone, detailing every patient who consulted him.        
	The council said Zaheer, not in clinical practice since June 2004, had also failed to provide any objective evidence to demonstrate he had kept abreast of medical advances.

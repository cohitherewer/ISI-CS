          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: The finance minister today repeated a slew of promises in education that he had made in last years budget, raising the funding for the sector but winning few friends within the education bureaucracy.         
	P. Chidambaram announced new Indian Institutes of Technology in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar today, but the funding for fresh IITs has gone down from Rs 80 crore in his last budget to Rs 50 crore this time.         
	Last year, the budget set aside Rs 125 crore for starting five Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), a new breed of education institutions aimed at increasing Indias research output. A year on, three have been built, but two have fallen behind the deadline. Nonetheless, the funding for the IISERs has gone up to Rs 150 crore.         
	Buoyed by the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan  which the government considers a success  the Centre planned to universalise secondary education as well. The scheme, termed Success, was a major announcement last time. A year on, the scheme is still being formulated, Chidambaram admitted.         
	In his Independence Day speech last year, the Prime Minister had said the Centre would start 16 new universities. Chidambaram repeated the pledge today. There is sadly nothing for education that the nation already does not know, UGC consultant Sudipta Mishra said.         
	Chidambaram today started the segment of his speech on education with the remark Knowledge is power. Before he had completed his speech, the ministry of human resource development was abuzz with an SMS circulating between officials: Knowledge is poor.         
	The money we have received is enough to continue with existing schemes. But the new ones may not kick off this year, an official said.

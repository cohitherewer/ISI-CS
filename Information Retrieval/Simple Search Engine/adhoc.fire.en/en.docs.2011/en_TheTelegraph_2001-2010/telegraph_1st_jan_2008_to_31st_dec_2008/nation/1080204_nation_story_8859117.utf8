	Raipur, Feb. 3: Chhattisgarh police on Saturday framed charges against Narayan Sanyal, member of a supreme council of Maoists, in a local court of law for reportedly waging a war against the state. 
    
	Besides Sanyal, charges have been framed against national vice-president of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties Binayak Sen and abettor Piyush Guha  a resident of Murshidabad (Bengal), who was arrested in Raipur in May 2007. The arrest of Sanyal, a Calcutta resident and an employee of a nationalised bank, in January 2006 was a blow to the Maoists, as he was one of the six members of the central committee  the highest decision-making unit. 
    
	Sanyal alias Naveen Prasad alias Vijay is also suspected to be the brain behind the Jehanabad jailbreak and the attempt on the life of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on October 2003 near Tirumala. The arrests of the other two are also associated with Sanyal. Guha has been accused of ferrying Sanyals messages to the Maoists through a Doctor Sen, who was allegedly a regular visitor in the Raipur central jail, where he was detained. Sen was arrested on May 14, 2007. 
    
	According to public prosecutors, charges against the three were framed for waging war against the state and under relevant sections of the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act, 2005. 
    
	Sources said Sen and Guha denied the charges in the court while Sanyal sought time for studying the charges framed against him. The court had posted the next hearing for February 13.

	Srinagar, July 24: Nine persons, including five children, were killed in two separate terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, one of which occurred in Srinagar and appeared to have targeted migrant labourers.        
	At least seven Amarnath yatris returning home were among the 28 injured when suspected militants hurled grenades at the Batmalloo bus stand in Srinagar around noon.         
	The family of a Bihari labourer, Muhammad Afroze, bore the brunt of the 12.15pm strike. Afroze lost his wife Rubina Khatun, 32 and four children  Khushboo, 13, Ayub, 8, Qayoom, 7 and Adil, 4. Afroze, unconscious in hospital tonight, was travelling with his family to Bihar.        
	The target of militants were the outsiders (migrants in Kashmir) who are present at the bus stand in large numbers daily, Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul-Mujtaba said.         
	According to the official, this was the first major strike targeting non-Kashmiri labourers for more than two years in the Valley. In June 2006, nine Nepali labourers had been shot dead in Kulgam, Mujtaba added.        
	Earlier this week, a little-known separatist group, the Peoples Political Party, had given labourers from outside Kashmir an ultimatum to clear out by August 10. The outfit had apparently blamed them for the rising drug addiction, robberies and prostitution in the Valley.        
	The strike also left the yatris shaken. We had come here after darshan at the Amarnath cave and were waiting for a bus to Vaishno Devi. Suddenly there was a blast and all of us fell on the ground, said Muni Bhai Sahu from Madhya Pradeshs Vidisha, hit by splinters in the leg.        
	Most yatris take the Baltal route, which cuts through Srinagar, and the strike renewed fears about their safety.        
	Panic gripped the bus stand, where blood-splattered walls, and shoes and luggage strewn around were grim reminders of the attack and the travellers scramble for cover.        
	The Srinagar strike came hours after suspected militants killed a former militant Ghulam Hassan, his wife Azeema Begum, 45, daughter Aisha Bano, 24 and five-year-old nephew Tawseef in Badi Marmat village in Jammus Doda.        
	Deputy inspector-general of police (Doda range) H.K. Lohia said militants stormed Hassans house and sprayed bullets indiscriminately. His son Mohammad Yasin is in a Doda hospital. We suspect that Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants carried out the attack, Lohia added.        
	Elsewhere, a CRPF jawan and a civilian were injured when unidentified militants lobbed a hand grenade at the forces 161 Battalion in Srinagars Noorbagh.        
	Militant attacks have increased since June and is continuing despite official claims about the return of normality. Last week, eight army jawans were killed in a Srinagar explosion. This was followed by a Gulmarg attack that left two, including an Uttar Pradesh tourist, dead.

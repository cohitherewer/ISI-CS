          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 1: The human resource development ministry has accepted a proposal from the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to introduce OBC quotas in its teacher training courses, top officials have said.         
	The NCERT admits 850 prospective teachers a year to training courses offered at its regional centres in Ajmer, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Mysore. The courses are widely rated as the best in the country for schoolteachers.        
	A formal notification clearing the quotas is likely to be issued later this week, ministry sources said.         
	In a proposal submitted to the ministry in May, the NCERT had said its teacher training courses were part of higher education and could not be excluded from quotas, the sources said.        
	The NCERT also asked for an increase in retirement age of its staff from 62 to 65. This, too, has been accepted, the sources said.         
	The OBC quota law  the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admissions) Act, 2007  requires institutes to also increase seats to ensure general category students dont suffer because of reduced opportunities.        
	Anticipating that the existing teacher crunch would explode into a public embarrassment with the expansion in seats, the Centre had allowed higher education institutions to raise the retirement age to 65. The law was principally enacted to ensure reservations for the educationally and socially backward classes at higher education institutes, ministry officials said.         
	Although the NCERT is not a higher education institution, the quotas have been cleared using a clause in the OBC quota law that council officials say entitles them to reservation.         
	Section 2(d)(5) includes in its definition of central educational institutions any an educational institution set up by the central government under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The NCERT was set up under this act in 1961.

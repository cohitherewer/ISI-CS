The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farming irony: peasants become miners
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Farming irony: peasants become miners
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          A mining machine hovers over a mound of iron ore in Rameshs field                                   
	Hospet (Karnataka), May 14: Ramesh breaks into a smile as he looks at workers digging up his land. He isnt being sadistic, he clarifies  he just cant help himself.         
	Six months ago, I would be the one doing back-breaking work on these fields. Now, I just sit back and watch my fields churn out money, he says.         
	The 43-year-old used to cultivate jowar in his fields outside Hospet, 350km from Bangalore, earning barely enough to support his family  a wife, a son and a daughter.         
	Now, he allows a private contractor to dig his fields and extract high-grade iron ore that fetches him as much as Rs 20,000 a month.         
	Officially, mining on agricultural land is illegal, but there is no one to complain. For Ramesh isnt alone. And the private contractor may be none other than the local MLA.         
	Hundreds of farmers along the Hospet-Bellary stretch of National Highway 63 are dumping the traditional agricultural economy of the region and turning instead to iron ore for quick money.         
	Till the reforms of the early 1990s, the Government of India-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Company (MMTC) was the only firm allowed to export iron ore from the region.         
	Private contractors could obtain lease for mining on government land, but had to sell all the iron ore they mined to MMTC, says B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer from Bellary.         
	MMTC would fix the rate, and the private contractors could not make too much profit. So, the land they leased was also relatively small. Post liberalisation, private contractors can export the iron ore themselves. The profit margin today is huge, Venkatesh says.         
	Realising the value of their land, ordinary farmers are now turning to mining, says M. Bhagyalakshmi, a local researcher who has been studying the mining boom in the region.         
	The farmers often dont possess a lease, but they sell the iron ore from their land to private contractors who have leases. The private contractors pass the ore off as obtained from the land they are allowed to mine on, she explains. China is the principal source of the demand.         
	But like the California gold rush, such a free-for-all state of affairs will harm the ecology and even human lives in the long run, she says, referring to the mid-19th-century search for gold in the American state. In the gold rush, rivers were diverted and native Americans were forced off their land.         
	Suresh, the private contractor bingeing on Rameshs fields, confirms Bhagyalakshmis allegation of rampant illegal mining. Thats how it works, and even the politicians know, he says.         
	The politicians are private miners themselves.         
	Anil Lad, the Congress candidate from Bellary City for the May 16 Assembly polls, and his BJP opponent Somshekhar Reddy are both mining magnates.         
	So are H.R. Gaviappa, the Congress candidate from Vijayanagara (the constituency Hospet falls under), and his BJP rival Anand Singh.        
	It is truethere is some illegal activity going on, Somshekhar Reddy admits. But it is the primary mover of the economy here.        
	Suresh, the private contractor, says the iron ore contains 67-72 per cent iron, and fetches him Rs 1,000 a tonne. On an average, workers dig up 20 tonnes a day. After payments and submitting instalments for the machinery he has bought, he still earns over Rs 4 lakh a month.

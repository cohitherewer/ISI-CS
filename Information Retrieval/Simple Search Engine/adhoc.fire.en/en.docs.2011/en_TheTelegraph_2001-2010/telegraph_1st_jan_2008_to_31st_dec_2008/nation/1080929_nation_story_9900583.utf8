          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          J.B. Patnaik. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 28: Blaming the Naveen Patnaik government for neglecting the state and failing to control the present flood, the Opposition today demanded the chief ministers resignation.        
	This government should go. It has no moral right to continue. The longer it remains in power, the more people will suffer, said the leader of the Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, while addressing reporters today.        
	I am not saying that the flood was man-made, but the government neglected several issues that made the situation worse, he observed.        
	The former chief minister said that the 630ft Hirakud reservoir was filled to the hilt, even when authorities received prior information about a possibility of a heavy water inflow from Chhattisgarh.        
	When they were supposed to discharge extra water from the reservoir, they did not do so. So, all 46 sluice gates had to be opened to evacuate 4-lakh-cusec of water after water flowed in from Chhattisgarh that added to the outflow of 12-lakh-cusec of water from the Tel and resulted in high flood in the Mahanadi system, Patnaik said.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who holds the water resources portfolio, should own up to his failure, said the Opposition leader.        
	The veteran Congress member was also critical of the present government for its continued neglect of river embankments. During the past eight years, this government has not spent a penny for the repair of bridges and embankments. Whatever has been spent has been on pen and paper, he alleged.        
	Lambasting the Naveen Patnaik government for mishandling the situation, the Opposition leader said that flood relief had not reached the marooned people in some areas even after a week.         
	He brought to the reporters attention the cabinet committee constituted by him after the 1982 floods to monitor flood relief and restoration works.         
	It seems that the present chief minister does not wish to take his cabinet colleagues into confidence. He would rather run the administration with the help of officials, he remarked.        
	Flaying the government for its failure in initiating permanent flood measures, Patnaik said during the 1990s a plan was prepared to construction at barrage-cum-dam over the Mahanadi near Subalaya that involved limited loss in terms of submergence of villages.         
	He had presented a memorandum to the then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee, who had appreciated the idea. But the Naveen Patnaik government, for political reasons, did not pursue the project, he alleged.        
	Had this project been executed, there would not have been such devastating flood in the Mahanadi this time, rued he.        
	Senior Congress MLA and former minister Nalinikanta Mohanty said a House committee of the Assembly was constituted, headed by the state revenue and disaster management minister, Manmohan Samal in 2004 to suggest permanent flood control measures.

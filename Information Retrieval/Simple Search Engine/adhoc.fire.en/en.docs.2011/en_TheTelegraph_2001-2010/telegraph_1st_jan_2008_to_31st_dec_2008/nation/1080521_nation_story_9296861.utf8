          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 20: An Orissa High Court order nullifying the creation of six new wards in Cuttack has rekindled hope among 16 corporators in the present 48-member Cuttack municipal council.         
	The urban development departments notification issued in February 2008 increasing the number of wards from 48 to 54 under the delimitation exercise had apparently sealed their fate. Sixteen corporators (seven from BJD, five from BJP, three from Congress and one from CPI) had been left with no wards to seek re-election in the next civic polls, as six new wards were demarcated by splitting 14 of the existing wards.         
	But, the high court has directed the urban development department to issue a fresh notification on the delimitation exercise within a fortnight after reconsidering objections and concerns expressed by different parties. The high court order has vindicated our grievances, said Dharmesh Nayak, one of the seven BJD corporators, who have been left in the lurch following a ward reshuffle.         
	A two judge bench of Justices B.P. Das and R.N. Biswal directed the urban development department last week to hear out objections and concerns of the parties in due consultation of Cuttack Municipal Corporation authorities resolve the issue within 15 days.         
	The urban development department had fixed 10,000 as a benchmark for the delimitation exercise. Objections were raised as under the new arrangement as many as 11 of the 54 wards had a population over 11,000. Congress (city) unit president Suresh Mohapatra hoped that the invalidation had paved a way for reservation ensuring actual representation of wards.

          OUR BUREAU                          The Metro Cash amp; Carry store on EM Bypass in Calcutta                                  
	Calcutta/Delhi, Sept. 26 Industry leaders today praised Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees move towards getting Metro Cash amp; Carry a licence, saying it would restore investors confidence, shaken by the Singur fiasco.        
	Venugopal Dhoot, the chairman of Videocon Group, said the taint earned by the state had been washed away by this act of the chief minister. It is a very bold step. Foreign investors will take heart from this. Singur is an isolated investment, he said.        
	Dhoot, an early-bird investor in Bengal, has proposed a large steel-and-power plant and several special economic zones in the state.        
	Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal, which is executing Jindals steel project at Salboni, said: This sort of firmness is what people look for.        
	McDonald MD Vikram Bakshi said: Every such step that the CM takes will be in the direction of attracting further investment.        
	D.S. Rawat, secretary-general of Assocham, said Bhattacharjees move would boost the states image at home and abroad.        
	Metro had invested in Bengal against an assurance that a farm product marketing licence would be issued to it. But the Forward Bloc-run agri-marketing board withdrew the licence after the German wholesaler had built a store.        
	Keventer Fresh chairman Mahendra Kumar Jalan, who has taken on the board for denying licences to his company, was excited by Bhattacharjees move. Investors will get a lot of confidence from this action, he said.        
	Keventer has moved 11 petitions against agri-marketing committees under the board for sitting on its applications.        
	Legal experts feel Metro has a stronger case since it was issued a licence that was twice renewed before being abruptly withdrawn. They said the farm product marketing acts provisions were less than clear.        
	The criteria for award of a licence are not specific. But that does not mean the authority (agri-marketing board) has discretionary powers not to give it. The boards rejection would not pass the test of law, an expert said.        
	Debanjan Mandal, a partner in Fox and Mandal, the solicitor firm appearing for Keventer in the cases at Calcutta High Court, said: Unfettered discretion is against the basic structure of the Constitution as has been repeatedly held by the court of law. It is a fundamental right to do business subject to reasonable restriction.        
	All eyes will now be on Keventers challenge to the agri-marketing board, pending in the high court.

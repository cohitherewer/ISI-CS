	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 12: In view of increasing nuisance by gangsters and criminals in prisons and jailbreak by Maoists, the government has decided to set up a high-security prison in the state.         
	Recent exposure of gangsters like Raja Acharya and Hyder operating from jails over cellphones, seizure of narcotics and weapons from the jail and R. Udaygiri jailbreak by Maoists in March 2006 apparently prompted the government to pursue the proposal.         
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra said the proposed high security jail would be set up near Bhubaneswar or Cuttack.         
	Such jails would prevent jailbreaks by Maoists, as happened in R. Udaygiri, Jehanabad in Bihar and Dantewada in Chhattisgarh, prison department sources said.         
	Electric fences, cellphone jammers, motion sensors, closed-circuit television sets, remote-controlled doors and alarm bells would be fitted in the high-walled high security jails to prevent jail escape and keep a watch on the movement of the inmates, said an official. Besides, sophisticated weapons and gadgets would be installed to deal with any attack on the jail staff or violence among criminals lodged inside.

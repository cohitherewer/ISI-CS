  - Sharp exchanges at Left-UPA meet on nuclear deal, objections force changes to statement        JAYANTH JACOB                           Karat (right) and Yechury after the UPA-Left meeting. Picture by Prem Singh                                         
	New Delhi, June 25: Two clichs were missing from the statement that capped the Left-UPA meeting this evening: fruitful and cordial.        
	The statement hadnt passed through hands with improved drafting skills. It was just being truthful.        
	Tempers flared up more than once at the 100-minute meeting today, unlike the earlier eight rounds when most nursed hopes that a way out could be found.        
	RSP general secretary T.J. Chandrachoodan, a professor from Kerala, told the meeting that the government was seeking to implement the nuclear deal in a piecemeal manner. The carrot-and-stick game must come to an end, a source quoted him as saying.        
	He reminded the UPA members that the the Left has helped the Congress keep the BJP at bay for four years and two months. Now the Congress should take care of the rest 10 months instead of handing over everything to the BJP on a platter.        
	At this point, Pranab Mukherjee asked CPM chief Prakash Karat whether this was his stand, too. To which, according to sources, Karat replied: It is a collective decision.         
	Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said today would be a sad day for the nation in the face of the Lefts obduracy, which angered CPI leader A.B. Bardhan. The CPI veteran intervened to register his protest, saying this deal was not in the interest of the country.         
	Differences of opinion cropped up on the statement, too. Some Left leaders raised objections to certain sentences, a source said without disclosing details. Eventually, the statement was revised  the first time such a correction was made since the panel was convened, the source added.        
	The committee completed its discussions on all aspects of the India-US civil nuclear co-operation agreement. The next meeting of the committee, to be held in due course, will finalise its findings, said the sterile statement read out by Pranab Mukherjee. Sitaram Yechury translated the statement into Hindi for the media.         
	At the UPA-Left meeting, Karat read out a three-page statement, making it clear that the government would not be allowed to go to the IAEA board. Given the fact that IAEA boards approval is required for the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Left parties cannot agree to the government going ahead, the statement said.         
	The sources quoted Karat as saying that seeking the IAEA boards approval was a step in operationalising the deal. It added that the US would take an active part at the Nuclear Suppliers Group meetings, suggesting that the IAEA was the last step in the deal that required an active Indian role.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad apparently asked the Left parties to solve the differences with the government. However, as the committee sat down for discussions, it became clear that there cannot be a consensus as both sides stuck to their known positions, the sources added.

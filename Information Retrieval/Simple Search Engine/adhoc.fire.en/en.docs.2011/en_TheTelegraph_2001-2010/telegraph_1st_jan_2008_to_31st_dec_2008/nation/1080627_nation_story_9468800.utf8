          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 26: Jagatsinghpur district police today recovered six crude bombs and swords from a school located on the proposed Posco steel plant site near Paradip.         
	Inspector in charge of Kujang police station Anil Mishra told The Telegraph the weapons were found in the evening from Govindpur High School.         
	Incidentally, 59 Posco supporters were held hostage in the same school last Friday by anti-Posco protesters after bombs were allegedly hurled at them, leading to the death of Tapan alias Dula Mandal.         
	Abhay Sahu, the president of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, told The Telegraph that they received a tip-off around 1pm about weapons being stocked in the school.         
	We opened the room in presence of the teachers and found 30 bombs and 20 swords stacked. The Posco supporters were confined in that same room last week, said Sahu, adding that they informed the police about the incident immediately.

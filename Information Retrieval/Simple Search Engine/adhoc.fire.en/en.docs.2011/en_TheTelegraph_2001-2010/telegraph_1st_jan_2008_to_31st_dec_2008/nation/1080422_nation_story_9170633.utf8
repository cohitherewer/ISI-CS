	Mumbai, April 21: The initial TV ratings for the Indian Premier League matches have been beyond expectations, say media buyers.        
	The opening game between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Bangalore Royal Challengers logged the highest television rating points (TRPs) among the first two days matches.        
	The opening ceremony, however, notched just 2.90 points. It shows its the cricket that is attracting the eyeballs; the game doesnt need Bollywood-style tamasha, said Manish Porwal, CEO, Percept Talent Management.        
	Its a great beginning. Its equal to the TRPs of an off-shore ODI played by India. The ratings will go down a bit, but Im sure they will pick up again before the semis.        
	TRPs, a tool to judge which programmes are viewed the most, are crucial in attracting advertisements.         
	A device, called peoples meter, is attached to TV sets at a few thousand viewers homes to determine how many times each programme is watched, and by how many. An average is then worked out for a 30-day period. TRPs are available for single-day events, too, like the IPL games.        
	TAM Media Research has released the TRPs for the first two days of the league from six metros: Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.        
	Of the two April 19 matches, the Chennai-Mohali contest scored around 5 TRPs. Industry experts said that despite being a cricket-crazy city, Chennai fans did not contribute much to the figure because of distribution issues between broadcaster Set Max and the citys cable networks.        
	The Jaipur-Delhi game fetched a TRP of nearly 5.5, with the highest tune-ins from Delhi and Mumbai.        
	The audience section used to map the TRPs was the four-plus age group in cable and satellite TV homes, which includes anyone aged four or more. Advertisers, however, may attach more importance to narrower, select groups such as 15-24 or 30-plus.        
	We need to see what happens when all the age-group figures are available, including those on weekdays. But the current figures are very encouraging. We would have been happy with TRPs of around 4, said Shyam Shankar, president, IMX (India Media Exchange), an arm of Publicis.

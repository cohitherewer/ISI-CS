          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 5: A 25-year-old village woman disguised herself as a militant, bullied an old labourer into accompanying her to a desolate spot and then killed and robbed him, police said today.        
	Officers, who have arrested Fatima, a resident of Sonbrari village in south Kashmir, said she had smashed the head of Habib Saradan, 65, probably with a stone.        
	Saradan was changing his jacket in a field when his money slipped from his pocket. Fatima was watching him closely and hatched a plan to fulfil her greed, an officer said.        
	Fatima walked away from the spot but reappeared sometime later, her face covered, the police said.        
	According to Fatimas alleged confession, she told Saradan she was a Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant and asked him to guide her to a hideout in a neighbouring village. Saradan was reluctant but after she threatened him, agreed to show her the way.        
	Saradan accompanied the woman on a dusty road. She told him to show her a road not used by others so she would not be detected. Once she reached a spot where there was no one in sight, she hit the victims head with some weapon, possibly a stone, the officer said.        
	The victim fell unconscious and she hit his head repeatedly till he died.        
	Fatima unzipped the victims jacket and left with a case that contained Rs 14,445. She went back home and handed the money to her parents for safekeeping, the officer said.        
	The police said the crucial lead they received was information that Saradan always carried all his money on his person. Since no money was found on his body, they began listing all the people who had been seen in the neighbourhood of the crime scene just before the murder.        
	Some suspects were summoned for questioning. All the evidence pointed towards Fatima, the officer said. Fatima allegedly broke down during questioning and confessed.

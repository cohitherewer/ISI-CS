          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 14: Alleged Hindu tribals killed a CRPF jawan in Kandhamal last evening, within hours of chief minister Naveen Patnaik telling the National Integration Council in Delhi that all was fine in his state.        
	Buxi Singh was murdered in retaliation for excesses by the paramilitary, sent to contain the anti-Christian attacks in Kandhamal, local people said.         
	The toll in the district has now reached 37  most of the dead being Christians  two days after the Pope condemned the violence.        
	Singh and a colleague had gone to Sisapanga village, 221km from here, from the Gundhani CRPF camp to buy meat when they were attacked by six to seven tribals. The colleague escaped unhurt but Singh was dragged into a forest and hacked to death, Kandhamal police chief S. Praveen Kumar said.        
	After a search, the body was found in a hill stream near Sisapanga. Singh, who was with the Assam Delta 175 Battalion, will be cremated in Assam.        
	Patnaik, who returned from Delhi this afternoon, promised stringent action against the perpetrators of violence but skirted the allegations of paramilitary excesses.        
	The Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti, an apex body of tribal organisations in Kandhamal, demanded the immediate withdrawal of paramilitary forces and release of innocent tribals. It criticised the appointment of the anti-tribal IAS officer, M.S. Padhi, as special administrator for Kandhamal.        
	Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan again called for a ban on the Bajrang Dal  a demand the Prime Minister appeared to reject yesterday  and sought a national committee to ascertain the nationalist credentials of organisations.

	Mumbai, June 4: A low-intensity explosion this evening injured seven people in the parking lot of a Thane theatre showing a play with references to the friction with north Indians, four days after a live bomb was defused inside a Navi Mumbai auditorium where the same drama was being staged.        
	Police said the explosive was placed on a bicycle in a plastic bag in the basement of Gadkari Rangayatan theatre. The blast took place around 4.10pm, minutes before a Marathi play, Amhi Pachpute (We the Pachputes), was about to start.         
	A part of the false ceiling and some tubelights were damaged, but the wooden structure above the ceiling was not. The bicycle also suffered no damage.         
	We spotted the plastic bag and suspected it could contain a bomb. We told the watchman to inform the theatre office. We went to check the bag when the blast occurred, said an eyewitness.         
	Seven persons, most of them theatre staff, were treated for minor injuries.         
	On May 31, the Navi Mumbai police had recovered and defused a live bomb from an unclaimed plastic bag at Vashis Vishnudas Bhave auditorium during the staging of the same play.         
	Amhi Pachpute is believed to have some lines that touch upon the friction between Maharashtrians and north Indian migrants, triggered by Raj Thackeray earlier t his year.         
	Director Santosh Pawar said: It is a normal comedy, with perhaps one sarcastic remark about north Indians. But there is nothing controversial.

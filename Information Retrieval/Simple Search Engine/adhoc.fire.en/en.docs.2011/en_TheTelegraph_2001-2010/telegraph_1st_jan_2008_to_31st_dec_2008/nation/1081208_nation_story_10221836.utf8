                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Party bosses plan to target Kerala CM
          JOHN MARY                           Achuthanandan: Hemmed in                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 7: CPM bosses in Kerala have decided to strike at V.S. Achuthanandan at a time his popularity is perceived to have taken a knock following his remarks on the visit to slain commando Major Sandeep Unnikrishnans house.         
	The party state secretariat has decided to petition the politburo against the chief minister for bypassing key aides in his office and seeking the advice of people who have fallen foul of the party.         
	The move follows the release of an inquiry report at the CPM state committee meeting that ended on Friday. The report criticised Achuthanandan over eviction operations in Munnar, suggesting that the last of the comrades has turned against him.        
	The report, prepared by a panel headed by Left Front convener Vaikom Viswan, indicted Achuthanandan for his one-upmanship during the Munnar anti-encroachment operations.         
	But the worst charge  of being misled by a cabal  had the backing of Achuthanandans own aides, who distanced themselves from him at the meeting.         
	The CPM central committee is scheduled to meet in Kochi from December 8 to 10, during which the party is expected to address governance issues, including those involving the chief minister.        
	Aware that he has little support from decision-making forums in the party, Achuthanandan today fired a salvo against the dominant faction through a bureaucrat.         
	K. Suresh Kumar, the former additional secretary to the chief minister and former head of the Munnar anti-encroachment drive, alleged in TV interviews that Achuthanandans private secretary S. Rajendran and political secretary K.N. Balagopal, nominees of the ruling CPM, had suppressed important files and tried to subvert timely decision-making.         
	Kumar alleged that no follow-up action was taken by the aides on Achuthanandans recommendation for a high-level CBI probe into a sex scandal in which the sons of two CPM leaders, now ministers, were reportedly involved.         
	Both instances show that the chief ministers supposed aides worked against his priorities. Even two-and-a-half years after being in office, theres no clear delegation of work in the chief ministers office, Kumar said.         
	The developments in the state committee meeting were apparently scripted by the CPM leadership. Both Rajendran and Balagopal were apparently chosen by them to target the chief minister during the discussion on the Munnar operations.         
	The timing of the move against Achuthanandan is significant. Last week, he took on Prakash Karat for expressing regret for the Unnikrishnan episode, saying the CPM general secretary was possibly influenced by false campaign by the Congress and the BJP.         
	Achuthanandan may be removed before Lok Sabha elections to allow the party to project a new leader. Or the move could be deferred so that the blame for electoral reverses, widely anticipated, can be heaped on him.        
	Achuthanandan, however, has not given in yet. He is in silent mode, refusing to take questions on the party report. He is relying on the masses to bail him out. In 2006, the masses had rallied behind him, forcing the politburo to field him for the Assembly elections.

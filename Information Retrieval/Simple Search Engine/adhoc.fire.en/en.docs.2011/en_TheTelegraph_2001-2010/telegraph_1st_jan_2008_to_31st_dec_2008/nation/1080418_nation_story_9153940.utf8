          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 17: Kolkata Knight Riders is likely to be one of the few Indian Premier League teams to break even, owner Shah Rukh Khan said today.        
	Considering the sponsor support we have, I think well be the only ones who will be able to break even and make some money. As for the tickets, weve taken care to keep the prices very low, the actor said today at a programme here to announce Nokia as his teams main sponsor.        
	The team has other sponsors, such as Ddamas for the jewel-encrusted helmets that will be given away to the man of the match, Reebok for the team clothing, Tag Heuer for the players watches, as well as Belmonte and Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited.        
	Shah Rukhs Red Chillies Entertainment has tied up with Reebok to launch an affordable clothing line, designed after the Knight Riders colours, for young fans. The actor is also tying up with Planet M, which will stock Knight Riders merchandise across the country in its shops, which are frequented by teens.        
	We are extremely privileged to be associated with Kolkata Knight Riders and look forward to an action-packed season for our young customers, said D. Shivakumar, vice-president and managing director, Nokia India.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jaipur, May 31: The Rajasthan government has removed state police chief A.S. Gill for mishandling the Gujjar agitation that has led to 39 deaths, allegedly all of them by police bullets.        
	The Congress accused the BJP government of turning Gill into a scapegoat to hide its own failures, but Gujjar leader K.S. Bainsla appeared to soften his stand.        
	According to PTI, Bainsla said he was prepared to hold talks with chief minister Vasundhara Raje if she showed inclination and a positive attitude, but it wasnt clear if this had anything to do with Gills removal.        
	Let the chief minister make up her mind for talks, I am ready, Bainsla was quoted as saying.        
	Gill, due to retire in 2011, has been asked to go on leave till July 31. He refused comment. K.S. Bains, special director-general (anti-corruption bureau), has taken over charge.        
	Congress MP Sachin Pilot, a Gujjar, told The Telegraph that Gills removal midway through the agitation reflected a breakdown of the government machinery.        
	The police and bureaucracy work on the governments orders, the Dausa MP said.        
	The ninth day of the agitation for Scheduled Tribe status for the Other Backward Classes community witnessed bandhs and blockades but no clashes.

          JAYANTH JACOB                           Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi was backing the Kolkata Knight Riders but is now looking for another team to cheer. The team I was cheering for got knocked out last night.... Now I have to look for another team, he said. Qureshi had a word of praise for the IPL. With IPL, you have revolutionised cricket. Its a huge hit in Pakistan, he told a news conference. (AP picture)                                  
	Islamabad, May 21: Pakistan today spoke of a grand reconciliation on all outstanding issues with India and both sides pledged to work for better trade and root out terror.        
	The neighbours signed a consular access agreement as Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee concluded his one-and-a-half-day visit during which he met the entire gamut of leaders in Pakistans new civilian government.         
	The assurance of the grand reconciliation in resolving all outstanding issues came from Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi. We are ready to solve all issues with self-respect and dignity for the peace, stability and the development of the region, he said, but added Kashmir remained the core issue.        
	Asked whether the new government subscribed to President Pervez Musharrafs formula of solving the Kashmir problem, he said: The Kashmir issue should be addressed with the UN resolution and taking into account the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. But we are open to all innovative ideas. The UN resolution on Kashmir, however, had been kept in the back burner under the Musharraf regime.         
	Stressing on trade and good economic relations, Mukherjee cited Indias good terms with China to send the message that healthy commerce helps in solving other problems. He pointed out that despite boundary problems with China, India targets to do trade of $60 billion by 2010.         
	The foreign minister termed the meetings useful.         
	Both sides reiterated the importance of enhancing (ways of) mutually beneficial economic and commercial co-operation and agreed to discuss further steps for facilitating trade, the joint statement said.         
	Indian and Pakistani railway officials will also meet soon to enable better freight movement between the countries.         
	Unlike the past joint statements, this time there seemed to be a greater resolve in combating terrorism. The ministers reaffirmed their determination not to let terrorism impede the peace process and take all necessary steps to eliminate this scourge against humanity, the joint statement said.         
	On Siachen, Mukherjee said progress had been made and both sides were determined to find a definite solution for which some distance still needed to be covered.         
	The neighbours have also decided to make the anti-terror mechanism more productive.         
	Proposals to increase the frequency of bus services and to make the visa rules more liberal were among the issues discussed today.         
	The two sides also discussed Sarabjit Singhs fate. The Pakistan delegation said his execution had been stayed, but there was no word on whether his death sentence would be terminated.        
	Mukherjee said India would expedite Pakistans standing invitation to Manmohan Singh. It is now expected that Singh will travel to Islamabad later this year.         
	The Pakistan foreign minister will visit India in June, ahead of the next round of the composite dialogue to be held in New Delhi in July.

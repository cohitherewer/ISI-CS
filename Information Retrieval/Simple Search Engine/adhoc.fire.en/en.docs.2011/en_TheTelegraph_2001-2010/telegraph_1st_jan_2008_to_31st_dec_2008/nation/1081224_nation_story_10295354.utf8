	Gaya, Dec. 23: Passengers of the 5510 Buddha Purnima Express running between Sarnath and Rajgir were robbed this morning.        
	Nearly 50 people travelling in the general coach of the unescorted train were robbed. Fifteen lost their mobile phones in what may be called an operation conducted in a leisurely pace between Aurangabad and Guraru stations of the grand chord section of the Indian Railways.        
	According to eyewitness account, more than 12 men boarded the train at Aurangabad around 3am. The deputy superintendent of railway police Rajindra Singh, however, put the number at six. When one passenger tried to resist, the robbers fired from a country made pipe gun injuring businessman Ashok Kesri of Saharsa on the temple. Kesri was admitted to the Gaya Railway Hospital and is said to be out of danger.         
	This is the second train robbery in the section within a week. Earlier, passengers of Palamau Express were looted near Guraru station.         
	Police said one Shankar Yadav was arrested from Jamhore of Aurangabad for the robbery in the later part of the day. Three mobile phones and Rs 7,000 were recovered.         
	Further raids are being conducted to nab other members of the gang and remaining items.         
	Singh claimed that the same gang was involved in Palamau Express robbery.

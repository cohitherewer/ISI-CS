  - Democracy lessons for neighbours from one-poll-old Bhutan        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          bang on target: Bhutans King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk tries his hand at archery in Thimphu on Saturday. (AP)                                        
	Thimphu, Nov. 8: The worlds youngest democracy is ready to teach its older neighbours a thing or two about political probity and people power  by example.        
	Bhutan, fresh from its first general election this year, will introduce laws to curb money power in poll campaigns and to make people rather than Parliament the custodian of the Constitution.        
	A National Referendum Bill will make it impossible for even a government-Opposition combine to amend the Constitution without popular support.         
	Any proposed constitutional change will go to a referendum conducted across the country. A simple majority will be enough to clear the amendment.        
	The idea is to ensure that our democracy does not turn the people into mere rubber stamps who vote once in five years but have little control during a governments tenure, chief election commissioner Kunzang Wangdi told The Telegraph.        
	The Constitution represents the fundamental values of our democracy, and only the people of Bhutan have the right to tinker with it.        
	A second law looks to set another standard unprecedented in South Asia. Under the Public Election Fund Bill, at least half the campaigning expenses of all eligible candidates and political parties will be publicly funded.        
	The government will pay up to Rs 1 lakh per candidate per constituency in a general election, and Rs 50,000 per candidate for a local body constituency. Bhutan plans its first ever district and local body elections next March.        
	Under the bill, each candidate can additionally use money from his party coffers up to an amount equal to that granted from the public fund. So, a candidate who has benefited from a Rs 1-lakh public grant can spend another Rs 1 lakh of party money.        
	The bill also seeks to regulate how political parties  Bhutan now has two  can collect funds. They can only seek donations from registered members, up to Rs 1 lakh per member per election.        
	All the limits may need to be raised slightly, however, Wangdi said.        
	Both laws have been cleared by Parliament  made up of the National Assembly (lower House) and the National Council (upper House)  and are awaiting the new kings assent to be implemented.        
	For a democracy to be successful, money cannot play a key role in deciding voter preferences, Wangdi said.        
	Public funding for poll campaigns  at least partially  is common in South America and Europe but has been absent in Asia till now. A referendum is required for a constitutional amendment only in Ireland, Denmark, Japan, Australia, Switzerland and some US states.        
	Currently, Wangdi is occupied with efforts to take democracy to the grassroots after the general election last March.        
	We are carrying out Bhutans first delimitation exercise. We hope to complete that soon and be in a position to conduct elections at the district level and to local bodies by March next year, Wangdi said. Bhutan has 20 districts, called dzongkhags.

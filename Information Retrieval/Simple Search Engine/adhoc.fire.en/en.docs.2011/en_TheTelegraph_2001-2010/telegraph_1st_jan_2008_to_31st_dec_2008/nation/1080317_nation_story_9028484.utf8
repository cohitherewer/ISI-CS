                                                                                                               Festival blast kills four in Assam
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dibrugarh, March 16: Militants lobbed a grenade a little after midnight at a community hall in Dhemaji around which 15,000 Mising revellers had gathered to celebrate a tribal festival, leaving four dead and at least 50 injured.        
	Although police suspect Ulfas involvement, the outfit has denied its hand in the blast, saying that killing innocents was not how it operated.         
	The denial did not stop grieving relatives from hitting out at the outfit.        
	This is one of the worst things Ulfa has done. It will get a fitting reply from the people, wept Phuleswar Pegu, husband of one of those killed in the blast.        
	The bombers struck when the crowd was cheering the recipients of prizes on the concluding day of the 54th Murkongselek Mising Kristhi Kebang, organised as part of the Ali-ai-Ligang festival, at Kristhi Bhawan in Jonai.        
	We were in the middle of merrymaking. The prizes of various competitions were being distributed and all you could hear was applause. Suddenly, some of us noticed two motorcycle-borne youths speeding towards the hall. Moments later, they threw something  which we now think was a hand grenade  and there was the blast, said Rakesh Pegu, one of the survivors.         
	Three  Kavita Sonowal, Sumesh Sutradhar and Sahjahan Ali  died instantly.         
	Sixteen of the injured were shifted to the Assam Medical College and Hospital, where 50-year-old Bina Pegu was declared dead on arrival. Thirty-six more are being treated at Dhemaji Civil Hospital.        
	The deputy commissioner of Dhemaji district, Diwakarnath Mishra, said chief minister Tarun Gogoi had called him to take stock of the situation. The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 3 lakh for the family of each of the dead. It will pay for the treatment of the injured.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 21: A Dalit Christian was allegedly hacked to death last night in Kandhamal, breaking a six-day lull in the riot-torn district whose police chief insisted the situation was under control.        
	Iswar Digal, 33, was waylaid as he and wife Pranati walked back to their relief camp in Phulbani town, about 250km from here, through a forest around 8.30pm.        
	Pranati has told police that a group of tribals forced Iswar to accompany them deep into the jungles and then killed him, but it wasnt clear if she had witnessed the alleged murder.        
	Iswars wife has lodged a case, said Paitambar Bisoi, officer in charge of Sarangada police station. However, we are yet to find the body.        
	The couple had been staying at the relief camp since their home was attacked during the violence against Christians that broke out four weeks ago in Orissa.        
	If Iswar has been killed, the toll in Kandhamal  the epicentre of the violence  would rise to 28.        
	Iswar had left the camp in the morning after being falsely informed that his paralytic father had died at their home in Gatringia village, 7km away. He hid in the jungles and visited his father only after sundown, Pranati said. Then the couple set off for their camp.        
	Police sources said the news of Iswars return seemed to have reached the tribals and they lay in wait for him.        
	Finger at Bajrang        
	The National Commission for Minorities has blamed the Bajrang Dal for the communal violence in NDA-ruled Orissa and Karnataka, reports PTI.

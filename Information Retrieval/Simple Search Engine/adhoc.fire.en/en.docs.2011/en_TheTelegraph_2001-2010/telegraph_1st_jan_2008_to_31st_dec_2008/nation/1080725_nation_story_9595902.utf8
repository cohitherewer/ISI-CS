          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Push for poor                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 24: The state government is set to launch World Bank (WB) funded Targeted Rural Initiative for Poverty Termination and Infrastructure (Tripti) in 8,369 underdeveloped villages of 10 coastal districts in Orissa.         
	This decision was taken at the general body meeting of the Orissa Poverty Reduction Mission, chaired by chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy today.         
	The officials also decided to create a directorate exclusively for this World Bank-funded project and appoint a project director to oversee implementation.         
	Sources said the loan negotiation with the World Bank officials was finalised at New Delhi last month. The government will initially release Rs 50 lakh towards its share, said the sources.         
	The project that aims to enhance socio-economic empowerment of rural poor, will be implemented in 8,369 under-developed villages of 10 coastal districts. The districts are Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Balasore, Bhadrak and Angul.         
	Estimated 12.55 lakh rural families living in the selected villages of the districts would be benefited by the project. Of the total 12.55 lakh beneficiaries, 6.2 per cent belong to ST, 20.19 to SC and 52.9 per cent belong to socially and educationally backward classes.         
	Under the project, permanent physical infrastructure would be built up in rural areas and income generating assets would be created, said a senior official of Orissa Poverty Reduction Mission. The aim of enhancement of social and economic empowerment of rural poor would be achieved through development of their self-sustained and community-managed institutions.         
	The project would enable the rural poor and entrepreneurs to develop their organisation and provide access to better services, credit and assets from the public and private sector agencies and financial institutions.         
	Besides, the project will also invest in capacity building public and private service providers and promoting micro-finance and agri-business sectors.        
	SC probe sought        
	In a fresh turn to the issue of cross-voting during trust vote in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, BJD today demanded a judicial probe by a Supreme Court judge into the matter.         
	The circumstances under which BJD MP Harihar Swain changed his mind to cross vote needs to be investigated, said senior party MP B.K. Tripathy.        
	Tripathy said Swain had earlier resolved to vote against the UPA government during the trust vote at a meeting held at his residence. Tripathy suspected that money might have played a role in the defiance.         
	Swain yesterday had denied voting in favour of the UPA government for money. He said that he had done so to settle scores with chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

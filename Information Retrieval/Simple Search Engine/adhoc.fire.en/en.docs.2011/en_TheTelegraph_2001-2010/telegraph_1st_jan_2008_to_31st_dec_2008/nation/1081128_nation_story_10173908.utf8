          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 27: Opposition in the Assembly today stalled proceedings for the day, demanding a statement from chief minister Naveen Patnaik on the alleged sexual escapades of senior BJP minister Manmohan Samal in his recent visit to New Delhi.         
	Congress members stormed the well of the house, forcing seven adjournments, till the House was adjourned for the day without conducting any business.         
	Raising the issue during the zero hour, Opposition whip Satya Bhusan Sahu referred to the news reports and accusations levelled against revenue, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Manmohan Samal during his recent visit to Delhi.         
	Stating that the dignity of the Assembly was involved in the incident, Sahu urged the Speaker to direct the chief minister to make a statement in the House clarifying the matter.         
	His statement was supported by the PCC president and Assembly member Jaydev Jena.         
	However, Speaker, Kishore Mohanty, rejected the demand saying that he cannot direct the chief minister to make a statements based on media reports. Infuriated by the refusal, the Congress members trooped to the well shouting slogans against the chief minister and the BJD-BJP government.         
	Amid the pandemonium, Mohanty adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes and then twice for 10 minutes.         
	When the House re-assembled, Congress member Padmalochan Panda pressed the demand yet again, leading to a chaotic situation yet again.         
	At that point the Speaker adjourned the House till 3pm.         
	At the outset of the afternoon session, the issue was raised again. Minister Samal rose to give a verbal clarification. However, the Speaker asked him to give a written statement tomorrow.

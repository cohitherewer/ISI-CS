The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai Chhath pinch for RJD
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai Chhath pinch for RJD
          SANTOSH SINGH                              
	Patna, May 20: Lalu Prasad accepting the official invitation from Maharashtra government to organise Chhath Puja in Mumbai this winter may be seen as a gesture of peace between north and west India, or RJDs move to capture new turf  perhaps at the cost of its home one.         
	Of late, the RJD has been concentrating on the sizeable population of north Indians in Maharashtra. Before the RJD chief travelled to Malaysia, he had asked his Mumbai lieutenants to take care of Raj Thackeray and thus make a place in hearts of the Bihar Diaspora that has been bearing the brunt of jingoism at hands of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.        
	While doing so, some political observers believe the railway minister left his home turf virtually without an Opposition. But, as a senior JD(U) leader commented: Even if Laluji and his men stay here, they cannot do much. Needless to say the RJD national spokesperson and general secretary Shyam Rajak thinks otherwise. Rajak confirmed to The Telegraph about his recent stay in Mumbai to get some kind of RJD base in Mumbai and take care of the people of Bihar.        
	Rajak added: There is no question of RJD taking a break from Bihar. Rather, it is about challenging Raj Thackeray in his own backyard. I stayed in Mumbai for three days last week and held a news conference to voice RJDs support to north Indians. Laluji will hold a puja in Mumbai to send out a message that we, north Indians, would not be cowed down by the likes of Raj, he added.         
	Asked why the RJD had to go all the way to Mumbai to extend support to Bihar people, the leader said: It is a pan-Indian message from our party.

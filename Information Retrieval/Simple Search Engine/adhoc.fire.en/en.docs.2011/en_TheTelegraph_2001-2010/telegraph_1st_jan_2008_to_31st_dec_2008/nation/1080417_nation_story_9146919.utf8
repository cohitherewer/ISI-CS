          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 16: Over 100 armed Naxalites swooped down on the Faisar railway station masters office on the Aurangabad-Mughalsarai section, around 100km from here, and took four employees hostage late last night.        
	Those taken hostage included the Faisar station master, C.P. Vishwakarma, cabin man Arun Kumar, porter Satyendra Kumar and two drivers.         
	Though the rebels released the railway employees two hours on, they left only after threatening to blow up several stations in Bihar. They added that their move was to send a warning across to the state government and the Centre.         
	The trains passing through the Aurangabad-Mughalsarai section were delayed for hours, as employees of Faisar railway station were warned of disruptions along the tracks at various places by the rebels  an information that was soon relayed across the stations. The train services were restored early this morning.         
	The Aurangabad incident follows the death of six persons in a red raid and attack at Jhajha railway station three days ago.         
	Aurangabad railway police said 2301UP Howrah-Rajdhani Express, 2820 Sampark Kranti Express, 2453 UP Ranchi-Rajdhani Express and a few others were delayed because of the bomb alert.         
	East Central Railway chief spokesperson A.K. Chandra said that the train services had been restored. An additional force has been sent to the stations for patrolling.        
	In a separate incident, Patna police went into a tizzy late last evening after receiving a call from a private number warning of a bomb threat in Patna station. Bomb squads were pressed into service, but the call turned out to be a hoax. The police are yet to trace the caller.        
	Inspector-general of police (operations) S.K. Bhardwaj has assured security across sensitive stations. Director-general of police Shiv Chandra Jha has assured that the police would go all out to nab the Jhajha culprits and a massive combing operation had been launched to apprehend them, he added.

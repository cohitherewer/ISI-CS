          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: A city gynaecologist and a general physician have lost their medical licences for two years for botching an appendix surgery they were not even qualified to conduct.        
	Debashish Mitra and Bikash Kumar Ghosh had denied conducting the surgery that led to 28-year-old Sunanda Ghoshs death four years ago, but the West Bengal Medical Council found both guilty of knowingly risking the patients life. The primary charge against the duo was that neither of them was a general surgeon or an anaesthetist.        
	Their names were removed from the councils register for two years after the charges of negligence were proved, Dilip Ghosh, the councils registrar, said.        
	Sunanda, a resident of Ukilpara, had been admitted to the Baruipur nursing home owned by Mitra in August 2004 with severe abdominal pain that was diagnosed as appendicitis. She was wheeled into the operating theatre on August 15 for removal of her appendix and died three days later. The patients family said no anaesthetist was present during the surgery. She was apparently anaesthetised by these two doctors, a member of the council said.        
	The committee that probed the incident found both doctors guilty of medical negligence and recommended that the council file chargesheets against them. Mitra said that he hadnt decided whether to challenge the decision. I will decide after a few days, Bikash Ghosh said.

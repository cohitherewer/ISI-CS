	In the report titled Left economist set to miss UN bus on November 7, it was mentioned that the Left suspected the Prime Minister to have floated the name of another person for a UN task force. The Telegraph has subsequently come across little to substantiate the assumption. We regret the inconvenience the reference may have caused the Prime Minister.

	Mumbai, June 19 (PTI): Pilot associations have moved Bombay High Court against civil aviation regulator DGCAs decision to keep its latest rules regarding duty hours on hold.        
	The pilot bodies said reverting to old rules, framed in 1992, would mean longer duty hours and reduced long breaks, which could lead to fatigued crew and threaten aircraft safety.        
	The Joint Action Committee of pilot said the longer breaks were essential to maintain alertness in the cockpit. The DGCA had last month issued a circular putting the scientifically charted new rules on hold.        
	The pilots alleged the circular had been issued under pressure from airlines to cut operational costs.

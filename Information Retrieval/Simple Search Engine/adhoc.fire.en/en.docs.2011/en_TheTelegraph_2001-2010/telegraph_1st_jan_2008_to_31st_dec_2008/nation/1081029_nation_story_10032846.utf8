The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Crores to kill turncoat bunds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Crores to kill turncoat bunds
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           A jawan at the Line of Control. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Centre has approved in principle a Rs 135-crore project to clear Indian-made obstacles that once shielded labourers but are now inadvertently helping militants sneak in.        
	The mud bunds were constructed during fencing of the international border after 2000 to protect Indian labourers from Pakistani firing. Now the same bunds, which fall in the line of fire between Indian security forces and intruders from across the border are being used by militants to shield themselves from BSF bullets.         
	Pending with the home ministry for months, the project to excavate tonnes of earth along the international border is estimated to cost Rs 135 crore. Pakistan continues to construct bunds metres away from the zero line (demarcated border), apparently to help militants get cover.         
	Not sure about Pakistans reaction, the BSFs estimate for the excavation project also provides for extra security for labourers.        
	A parliamentary panel on home affairs, in its report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on October 21, had said the committee had been told that the Indian bunds had now become counter-productive and was helping militants.         
	Despite the BSFs insistence, the project was not on the priority list of the government. Apparently, the report in Parliament pushed the project through.         
	We have approved the proposal in principle, although it has not reached the cabinet. The central public works department is preparing reports on the basis of a primary estimate of Rs 135 crore, a home ministry source said.         
	The bunds, a few feet high, are between the zero line and the fence. Fencing is done 150 yards from the zero line and the bunds are about 50 yards from the line.         
	Infiltration of militants in Samba (May) and Kanachak (August) in the Jammu sector this year was possible because of the obstacles.         
	The issue was raised by home ministry officials in Lahore earlier this month.         
	When Pakistan officials complained that the BSF was firing upon innocents, they got a terse reply. The BSF will not refrain from firing if anyone meddles with the fencing, a senior home ministry official said.         
	Militants have been known to use gloves and steel pliers to cut the electrified fence in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The parliamentary panel has recommended that the fence in some places be shifted towards the zero line. That will enable fertile land between the fence and zero line to be used by farmers.        
	The committee has strongly suggested that India upgrade border surveillance and military preparedness.

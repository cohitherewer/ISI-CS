          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 24: The CPM has said it is strange that after four years of Left support, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has alleged that it wanted him to behave like a bonded slave.         
	The Prime Minister has accused the Left parties of wanting to treat him as a bonded slave. Strange that it took him over four years of being the PM on the strength of the support of the Left parties to hurl such accusations, an editorial in the forthcoming issue of the CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy says.         
	Singh, it adds, should have been a bonded slave to the common minimum programme and not to anybody.         
	The PM may have won the vote, but his government has lost the trust of the nation, it said.         
	This is the first time that a Prime Minister seeking the confidence of the Lok Sabha could not vote on a motion moved by him. This is a small point. The Indian Constitution permits a member of either House to be the Prime Minister. The more important point is the fact that this is the first time that the Prime Minister could not reply to the debate prior to the vote.         
	Responding to Singhs charge that the Left had not allowed him to complete negotiations even though he promised to come back to Parliament before operationalising the nuclear deal, the editorial said this was because the agreement would be on auto-pilot course of implementation once the IAEA board of governors cleared it.

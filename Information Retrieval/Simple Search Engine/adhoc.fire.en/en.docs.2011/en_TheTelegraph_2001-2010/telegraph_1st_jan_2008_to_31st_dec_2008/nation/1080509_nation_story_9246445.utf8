	New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): M.F. Husain today got a relief when Delhi High Court quashed criminal proceedings against the artist for allegedly hurting public sentiments through some of his nude paintings.        
	The allegations made against the painter are baseless and it would not be proper to hold that he had a deliberate intention to manifestly insult Bharat Mata, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said. A painter at 90 deserves to be in his home, painting on his canvas.         
	Husains works  a nude Bharat Mata as well as Hindu goddesses in the nude  had sparked a furore, with the VHP and the Bajrang Dal issuing threats.

          JAYANTH JACOB                           Mukherjee and Qureshi in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Not a ball was bowled, but it was cricket all day.        
	By stumps, terrorism, trafficking and death-row convicts had all figured, but the game was clearly the flavour of the diplomatic talks between India and Pakistan.        
	The Indian team is welcome to Pakistan. Indians are welcome to Pakistan, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters after he touched down for a four-day visit. People of Pakistan and India love cricket. Let them enjoy the game.        
	Qureshi, who discussed bilateral ties with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee, also sounded positive on the fate of Indian death-row convict Sarabjit Singh.        
	In Islamabad, where home secretary-level talks ended today, something positive, too, seemed to have emerged on the fate of 101 Indian prisoners in Pakistan jails.        
	But it was cricket that dominated the diplomatic agenda for the day.        
	Asked if bilateral ties would be affected if the Indian government cancelled the cricket teams upcoming tour to Pakistan because of security concerns, Qureshi said: I am positive about it. I am not negative at all.         
	The minister said people of Pakistan were keen to watch the Indian team perform. We will address the security concerns, he added. Let us create a positive pitch.        
	Sources said the cricket tour figured in the delegation-level talks, too. India, however, would like to have an expert teams assessment of the security situation and the foreign ministry remains risk-wary about the tour.         
	Mukherjee, who listened intently as Qureshi spoke, said we hope the team will go and everyone enjoy cricket before ending the joint news meet.        
	Qureshi extended the positive note to the Sarabjit case, saying Pakistan was aware of it and hoped to have some good news on it.        
	To a question on Jammu and Kashmir, Mukherjee reiterated the Indian position that Delhi would not favour third-party intervention.        
	At the two-day home secretary-level talks that ended in Islamabad, both sides said their law enforcement agencies would soon discuss ways to co-operate in executing Interpol warrants and underlined their resolve to jointly fight terrorism.         
	The two sides decided that Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency and Indias CBI would schedule a meeting at an early date on issues like human trafficking and counterfeit currency.

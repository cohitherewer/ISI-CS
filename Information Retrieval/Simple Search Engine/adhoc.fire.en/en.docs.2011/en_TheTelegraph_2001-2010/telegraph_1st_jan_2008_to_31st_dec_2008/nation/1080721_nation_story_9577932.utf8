          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 20: Ajit Singh and H.D. Deve Gowda today told Mayavati their MPs would vote against the government.        
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, who had bigwigs calling on her yesterday, today began visiting leaders.         
	She went to Gowdas home and, soon enough, the former Prime Ministers Janata Dal (Secular), with three MPs, was on board.         
	The tempo to win over Gowda was set when H.D. Kumaraswamy, Gowdas son, showed up at the Left-BSP-UNPA lunch hosted by the Telugu Desams K. Yerran Naidu. Mayavati visited the former Prime Minister, living close by, to tie up the loose ends.         
	Before that, she had won support from Ajit Singh, who declared his three Rashtriya Lok Dal MPs would vote against the confidence motion on July 22.         
	The luncheon ended with Mayavati saying: We have a one-point agenda, to vote against the government on July 22. Others, including the CPMs Prakash Karat and the CPIs A.B. Bardhan, chorused.         
	The Desam and its Andhra rival, the Telangana Rashtriya Samiti, are in the same boat after TRS boss K. Chandrashekhara Rao vowed yesterday to vote against the motion.        
	Asom Gana Parishad president Brindaban Goswami, whose party is also part of the splintered UNPA like the Desam, said its two MPs would vote against the government.         
	Mayavatis flock appeared intact, unlike the Samajwadis, five of whose MPs have drifted to the BSP. None of our people are going anywhere, a BSP leader said. Some BSP leaders feel, though, that Mayavati may have made herself vulnerable to a more intensive CBI probe if the UPA wins the trust vote.

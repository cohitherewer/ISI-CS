                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fire ravages Northeasts first shopping HUB

	Guwahati, April 30: The Northeasts first shopping complex  a five-storey symbol of affluence  was gutted in a pre-dawn blaze today.        
	By the time the city woke up, HUB, the glitzy home of the biggest lifestyle brands and swanky restaurants at Bhangagarh on the busy G.S. Road, stood seemingly unscathed.        
	But inside it was a different story.        
	Retail outlet Eastrends  spread over three floors  had been reduced to ashes.        
	Chef Sanjeev Kapoors signature restaurant chain Yellow Chilli, caf retail chain Caf Coffee Day and Fun Cinemas had been affected in varying degrees.        
	The cause of the fire was still being investigated but an official of the State Fire Service Organisation said the blaze started from the first floor around 2.30.        
	Since the main power switch was turned off, an electrical short-circuit cant be the cause. A technical snag in the UPS or the batteries may have sparked the blaze, a HUB employee said.        
	By the time the drowsy security guards heard the shrill cry of the fire alarms, the flames were everywhere, feeding on the huge stock of clothes, plastic toys, electronic items and shoes.         
	The intense heat generated by the flames shattered windowpanes, twisted steel stands out of shape and left the interiors covered in black soot.         
	A distorted mannequin, its melted legs forcing the doll into a squatting posture, told the story of the destruction.        
	Everything seemed unreal in the cavern-like, dark interiors of what was till late last night a glittering mall, where kids played slip-and-slide on the polished floors as their parents shopped.        
	Wristwatches of different brands lay in cracked display cases, their time frozen at 2.40am.        
	The banquet hall of Yellow Chilli, a part of Caf Coffee Day and the lobby and ceiling of Fun Cinemas were destroyed in the fire, said Mukesh Sharma, general manager of Mridul Properties Private Limited, which owns the mall.        
	Over 10 fire-engines battled the blaze for about two hours.         
	No damage was caused to the superstructure of the building, thanks to prompt action by the firemen, who were assisted by local police, Sharma said.        
	HUB, which opened in 2005, retails in all premium brands, from clothes to accessories and lifestyle products and has a daily footfall of around 2,000 people.         
	On weekends, it goes up to around 3,000, Sharma added.        
	Eastrends, the flagship store, records a daily turnover of nearly Rs 5 lakh.         
	A few shoppers arrived around 11 this morning as the nearly intact exteriors gave no hint of the damage inside.        
	From outside, the only visible signs of the destruction were a few broken windowpanes.        
	Representatives of Mridul Properties said they had assessed the loss to be around Rs 10 crore.

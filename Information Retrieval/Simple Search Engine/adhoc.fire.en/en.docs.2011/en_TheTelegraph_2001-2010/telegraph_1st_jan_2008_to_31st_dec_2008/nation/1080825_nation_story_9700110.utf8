          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 24: The Bhitarkanika National Park in Orissa has hosted more number of winged guests this monsoon than last year due to its dense mangrove vegetation and pristine atmosphere.              
	About 50,000 water birds of different species have already flown in to Bagagahana in Bhitarkanika for breeding and nesting as against 9,000-odd birds last year.        
	The 11 species spotted so far, according to forest department officials, include the Openbill Stork, Little Cormorant, Intermediate Egret, Large Egret, Little Egret, Purple Heron, Grey Heron, Night Heron, Darter, White Ibis and Cattle Egret.        
	With the onset of monsoons in June, these birds congregate in large numbers every year and the nesting process gets over by the end of November.        
	This year the birds arrived late due to a delayed monsoon, but their number has been distinctly larger, said P.K. Behera, the divisional forest officer, Rajnagar.        
	What apparently attracts such large numbers to this mangrove eco-system is the abundance of fish, prawns, frogs and molluscs.         
	The serenity of Bagahana area in the park also offers a safe haven for the thousands of winged visitors to settle down for breeding and nesting, the senior forest officer said.         
	Nests were reportedly visible on top of the canopies of Guan, Sundari, Jagula, and Bani trees. The forest department is taking measures to step up security to protect these winged creatures from poachers.         
	According to the governments wildlife researchers, one of the largest colonies of water birds in India is located in Bagagahana, spread over nearly 8 hectares of mangrove forests inside the Bhitarkanika National Park.        
	The Darter, Grey Heron and Purple Heron start breeding early and often the young ones are seen by the end of August.         
	The Openbill Stork and White Ibis, being late breeders, come up with young ones a month later.        
	The Openbill Storks that prefer to nest on the top canopy of Guan trees form nearly 60 per cent of the total nesting population every year.

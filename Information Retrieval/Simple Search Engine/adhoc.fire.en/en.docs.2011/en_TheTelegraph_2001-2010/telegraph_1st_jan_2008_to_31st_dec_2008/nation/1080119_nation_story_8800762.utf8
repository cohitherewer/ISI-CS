 - Party proposes reserving a third of tickets instead of seats

             Sushma Swaraj
                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The BJP today withdrew its support for 33 per cent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and Assemblies, striking a fresh blow to the planned legislation that has been deadlocked for a decade.
    
	It, however, threw its weight behind an alternative plan suggested by the Election Commission  that every party set aside 33 per cent of constituencies for women in state and Lok Sabha polls.
    
	Reserving tickets instead of House seats has a major flaw  the parties can simply hand the women the un-winnable seats  but the BJP suggested a partial remedy.
    
	It said reservation should be state-wide, that is, a third of tickets in every state should go to women. This would, for instance, prevent the BJP or Rashtriya Janata Dal from confining women candidates to the south or the DMK to the north.
    
	The biggest drawback, however, is that the proposal will not ensure the presence of 33 per cent women in legislatures, which a current, serially stalled bill aims to do.
    
	But the BJPs move may also be seen as an attempt to make the best of a bad situation.
    
	Ensuring 33 per cent quota for women in legislatures is impractical. We tried bringing that legislation twice during our rule but failed, Sushma Swaraj, who announced the BJPs shift of stance, said.
    
	Atal Bihari Vajpayees government had tabled the legislation in its stronger form in Parliament in 1998 and 1999 but violent opposition from the smaller parties blocked it.
    
	The Congress and the Left want the seat quota and the Centre has been trying for a consensus.
    
	The BJP somersault has now changed the situation. Although it hasnt said it would oppose the existing bill, its new stand will encourage regional parties like the RJD, Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal (United) to pressure the Centre to junk the bill.
    
	Sushma said it would be easier to enact the Election Commissions proposal since it didnt need the Constitution to be amended.
    
	Two other alternatives had been suggested over the past 15 years. The first was to rotate the reserved seats for 15 years and then perhaps abandon it since a womens leadership would have emerged by then.
    
	Many opposed this saying rotation would dilute members commitment towards their constituencies.
    
	The second plan was to increase legislature seats by 50 per cent so that reserving a third for women would still leave the men with as many seats as are open to them now.
    
	This pacified many male MPs but entailed logistical problems, such as a long-drawn delimitation and shortage of accommodation. In Parliament, Central Hall could have been used instead of the Lok Sabha but the Assemblies dont have that kind of infrastructure.
    
	We are convinced that there cannot be a consensus on the other two proposals, Sushma said.
    
	The poll commission has suggested legislation to de-recognise political parties that do not give women a third of the tickets.
    
	Earlier we thought this would not work. But we have seen that such a system has bolstered the presence of women in legislatures in some foreign countries. If the other two proposals are un-implementable, we cannot delay things further, Sushma said.
    
	Fresh delimitation will take a lot of time. We want 33 per cent women to contest elections from the next general election itself.
    
	She said the calls for a sub-quota for women from the Other Backward Classes and Muslim women  mainly a ploy by regional parties to stall the current bill  should also stop now. It will be up to the party leaderships to give the tickets to women from any category.
    
	The BJPs Mahila Morcha will launch a nation-wide agitation in support of the demand, ending with a rally in Delhi on February 21, days before the budget session starts.

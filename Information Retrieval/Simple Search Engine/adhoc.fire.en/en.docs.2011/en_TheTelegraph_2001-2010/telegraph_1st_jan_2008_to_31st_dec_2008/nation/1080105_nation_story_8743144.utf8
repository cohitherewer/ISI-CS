The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar dials Centre for more power
                                                                                                            Bihar dials Centre for more power
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 4: Tired with the states recurring problems of power shortage, Bihar government has now sought for additional power from the Centre.        
	The Bihar government has asked the Centre for an additional 300MW, besides teh existing central allocations of 1,170MW.         
	For the past two days, Bihar has been reeling under frequent powercuts. Most of the powercuts are related to technical snags at an unit under the 500MW Farakka and Talchar Super Thermal Power Plant.         
	Patna received 12-16 hours of regular power supply yesterday. Though loadsheddings have reduced since Thursday evening, the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) today forward its request for an additional 300MW to meet Bihars power demand.         
	BSEB chairman Swapan Mukherjee had recently written a letter to Union ministry of power seeking more power. Mukherjee had stressed that Bihar was not getting its assured power even after swapping 260MW from Kahalgaon power plant, with hydel power, from Tala since August 2007.        
	This was the governments fourth request in the past few months.        
	With the states power situation getting more grim every day, the BSEB chairman left for Delhi yesterday to take up the matter with the Union ministry.         
	BSEB spokesperson S.K. Ghosh told reporters here that the electricity board had a tough task at hand distributing power to the railway, Patna city and areas in Nepal, despite a crunch from the central pools.        
	He added that problems and snags at the Barauni Thermal Power Plant had only made matters worse in the past couple of days.         
	Despite efforts by the government, the state has been unable to boost its generation beyond 50MW mark.         
	Though, the government has signed MoUs with several companies, it has come to little use. A BSEB official said: A joint sector enterprise has been inked between Kanti General Power Project, coming up with BSEBs help, and NTPC, for the enhancement of Kanti Thermal Power Project.         
	On an average day, Patna receives electric supply for 22-23.5 hours, daily. District towns get electricity for 14-20 hours. Sub-divisional towns have to bear with only 5-8 hours of power. While rural Bihar gets three-four hours of supply on an average day.

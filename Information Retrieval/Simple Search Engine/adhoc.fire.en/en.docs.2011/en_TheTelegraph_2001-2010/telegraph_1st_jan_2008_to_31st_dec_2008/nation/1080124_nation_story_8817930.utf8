 - Less starchy tuber turns tables in Vaishali

        Counting his blessings 
   
	Hariharpur (Vaishali), Jan. 23: Those diabetic or on a diet and yet fond of potatoes can thank Bihar farmers.
 
	Vaishali and Patna markets will soon have a newly grown variety of the tuber with three to five per cent less starch than the usual variety. 
 
	Lady Roseletta or the LR variety is fast becoming a favourite with Vaishali farmers. Though LR has been around for many years, its found a permanent place in Bihars fields, mostly in Vaishali, last year. Its yield has picked up with LR giving three times more yield than usual. Dozens of farmers at Hajipur, Vidupur and Lalganj have taken to growing the variety. Amod Kumar, a farmer of Hariharpur, said: On an average, LR variety yields 400 mound per acre as against 150 mound from other variety. Its greener than usual ones.
 
	Hariharpur grows LR on eight acres and the crop for this year is expected to be ready within a month.
 
	Amods father, Bindeshwar Prasad Singh, added that the LR variety contains less sugar because of less water content. He, however, could offer no scientific explanation as to why some farmers would sell it by calling it sugar-free. 
 
	Programme co-ordinator of Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Haripharpur, Brajesh Shahi, offers an answer to the misplaced notion of the sugar-free potato. No variety of potato can be sugar-free. Bt LR contains two to three per cent less starch than usual local varieties, said Shahi. 
 
	He said varieties such as Chandramukhi, Ashoka, Rajendra Aloo 1, 2 and 3, also have similar characteristics. But LR seeds are easily available and Vaishali farmers have given it a shot successfully. LR is also a favourite because its cultivation takes eight to 10 days less than the usual 90-day crop, said Shahi. 
 
	Farmers growing LR seem more than happy with the variety because of its good yield. Rakesh Singh, a Vidupur farmer, said: Customers like it. We do not know if it is sugar-free, but I surely believe that it has less sugar.

  - Woman burnt after quarrel at public tap in parched MP          RASHEED KIDWAI                                    
	Bhopal, June 7: A quarrel at a public tap has led to a woman being set on fire in parched Madhya Pradesh, witness to serial violence over water this summer.        
	Prerna Bai, 55, died of her burns in hospital today after a mob attacked her on Tuesday at her home in the village of Kamtara, Harda district, 250km south of Bhopal.        
	Her daughter Dolly said Prerna had intervened in an argument that broke out in the queue before the village tap. Around 80 people barged into our home and poured kerosene over my mother and set her on fire. We had by then forgotten about the dispute.        
	We have registered a case under Section 302 (murder). Its not a caste dispute; both sides belong to the weaker sections, Harda police chief K.P. Venkateshwar Rao said.        
	He added that the police were probing if the water dispute indeed lay behind the attack.        
	Thirst has fuelled conflict in Madhya Pradesh  among people and even between animals and humans. Two brothers were killed in Bhind in March while violence reared in Gwalior and Sagar in April. One farmers cattle straying into anothers fields to drink water have set off caste conflicts.        
	In Datia town, a donkey attacked a pitcher-bearing woman and a group of over 20 monkeys raided Jaitpur village, not to snatch fruits but to drink water. Elsewhere, a hyena is said to have chased a boy drinking water, quenched its thirst from his pitcher and left without harming the child.        
	In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, the state government recently booked some 2,000 farmers in drought-stricken Bundelkhand on the rare charge of stealing irrigation water from a canal not meant for them.        
	Such scrambles over water, experts say, will increase with the whole planet facing a water crisis as a result of climate change, rising population and economic growth.        
	The UN, which has declared a Water for Life decade from 2005 till 2015, has urged governments to make water a right for all. But the impending global water shortage that prompted the call has also kicked off the debate whether governments can afford a free supply.        
	Bottled water, civic taxing and restaurant bills have already ensured that the liquid, once free like air, must often be paid for.        
	Experts say freshwater could become the oil of the 21st century  a blue gold exported in tankers across oceans, determining the course of geopolitics and even causing wars.        
	Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have been fighting bitterly over the Cauverys waters for decades, and many believe India and Pakistan would one day squabble over water resources rather than territory.

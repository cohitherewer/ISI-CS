                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Minority varsities await green signal
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Arjun Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Centre plans to launch three new central universities that will be classified minority educational institutions and could be allowed to reserve up to 50 per cent seats for Muslim students.         
	The human resource development ministry is set to approve a proposal by the minority affairs ministry to start the universities in Bangalore, Ajmer (Rajasthan) and Kishanganj (Bihar), officials said.         
	The plan to start the minority universities comes ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and despite a cloud of uncertainty on whether two popular existing central universities are minority institutions.         
	The Supreme Court is examining a petition by the Centre against an earlier Allahabad High Court order striking down the minority character of Aligarh Muslim University.         
	No other central university is officially recognised as a minority institution under the legislation that created it, though sections of the faculty and students at Delhis Jamia Millia Islamia are demanding minority status.         
	The minority affairs ministry proposal had recommended that the three new universities be among 30 new varsities promised by the UPA under the 11th five-year plan, sources said.         
	Of the 30 new varsities, 16 are to be in states that do not have a central university. The remaining 14 are to be world-class universities.         
	The HRD ministry has, however, said the three new minority universities must be over and above the 30 central universities already announced, the sources said.         
	HRD ministry sources said the minority affairs ministrys proposal was likely to be cleared soon. Education minister Arjun Singhs final stamp of approval is all that is awaited, but the minister has been unwell for over a month now, the sources said.         
	The aim is to launch universities that would have central funding, and the autonomy required to cater to the needs of the Muslim community in particular, a minority affairs ministry official said.         
	Only four per cent of undergraduate students are Muslims, when the communitys population share is 13.4 per cent, the Rajinder Sachar committee has said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: TV channels have adopted self-regulatory guidelines on covering terror or hostage situations, agreeing not to air gory scenes or live coverage of commando operations.        
	The News Broadcasters Association (NBA), a conglomerate of various channels, has come up with the emergency protocol after widespread criticism of the coverage of the Mumbai attack last month.        
	Channels have agreed not to beam live contact with the victims or security personnel engaged in rescue operations. The guidelines also urge broadcasters not to telecast the number or identities of hostages, and to eschew reportage or commentary that appears sympathetic to the terrorists.        
	Coverage should avoid shocking, offending or misleading the audience, and horrifying or bloody situations must not be beamed, the protocol says.        
	It adds that reporting must not jeopardise the nations security. Security experts had said the Mumbai attack coverage may have distracted the commandos while providing key inputs about security forces plans to the gunmen.        
	The protocol asks senior editorial and management staff to carefully vet planned broadcasts that explore the views of people who use or advocate violence for the achievement of political ends.        
	The guidelines are similar to the advisories the information and broadcasting ministry had issued to TV channels during and after the Mumbai terror attacks. At the time, however, the channels had refused to abide by what they saw as government intervention.

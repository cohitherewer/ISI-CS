	Patna, June 3: Four CBI teams today conducted raids at the home, offices and official residence of the general secretary of the SBI Staff Association (Bihar), J.N. Singh, and seized property papers, both for immovable and movable assets, worth Rs 62 lakh at Patna and Darbhanga.        
	Singh stands accused of misappropriating several lakhs of association funds.         
	Singh was present in Patna at the time of the raids.        
	The Union finance ministry recently instituted an inquiry into the issue and a disproportionate assets case was lodged against Singh at CBIs Patna branch.        
	Four CBI teams today started simultaneous raids at Singhs 8, Kautilya Nagar, Kankerbagh, association office, at SBIs local office in Gandhi Maidan, the association guesthouse near Patna museum and his native Sajanpura village at Darbhanga since 7.30am. Raids continued till this evening.        
	Sources said that sleuths seized incriminating paper, documents and diaries containing vital information of investments by Singh and his family members.         
	Singhs wife Vijaya Singh is associated with the JD(U).        
	The CBI, however, has not made an official announcement of the seizures.         
	An investigating agency official said the district attorney has lodged a case against Singh at the instruction of the CBI joint director. Earlier, SBI (central) staff associations chief general secretary had also received complaints of financial irregularities against Singh, who has been holding the post for the past 10 years.        
	Singh has a three-storey house worth Rs 1 crore at Kautilya Nagar. He and his family hold 22 bank accounts in several banks. Singh earns some Rs 18,000 per month.        
	However, the agencys three-hour-long search at Singhs Sajanpura house, where his 70-year-old mother stays, proved to be fruitless.         
	Singh, who has accepted that at a Leh meeting his case was discussed last month, said he was being framed by interested parties.         
	Singh added the association chief general secretary Ashok Dutta had also stated that the complaints were the handiwork to dislodge Singh from his present position.        
	Singh also called it a smearing campaign by a microscopic section of disgruntled employees. Dutta had added that the central executive committee of the association would not proceed with the case against Singh.

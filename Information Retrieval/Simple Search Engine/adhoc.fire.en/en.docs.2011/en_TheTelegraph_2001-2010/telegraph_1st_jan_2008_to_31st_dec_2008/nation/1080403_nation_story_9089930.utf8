	New Delhi, April 2: Over 100 employees of a call centre in west Delhi were rushed to hospital with suspected food poisoning after they complained of abdominal pain.         
	The employees of the call centre, which handles banking queries, had just finished lunch when they started feeling unwell.         
	Usually, we have no problem with the food, said an employee, who did not want to be identified. But today, after my lunch of aloo-matar, I started feeling ill. People were vomiting and had a stomach ache.         
	The call centre employs close to 200 people.         
	About half the number fell ill after eating the food.         
	I am lucky as I ate very little, another employee said.         
	Police have detained the caterer, Sita Ram. A case has been registered against him for selling food believed to be adulterated.         
	There were 107 people who were brought to the hospital at 3.30pm, a source said. But only 46 of those who needed attention were admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital.         
	By evening 44 of those admitted had left against medical advice, upsetting the doctors. We told the patients that they needed to stay the night, but they refused, said one doctor on duty. They insisted on leaving. Only two girls chose to stay back.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 25: Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) has landed in mosquito muddle. A multi-crore scandal involving the use of inferior quality mosquito larvicide (ML) oil allegedly led to the failure of mosquito eradication drives in the city.         
	Apparently, the civic body had procured substandard quality of ML oil over the past eight years, even as the mosquito menace steadily increased to unendurable proportions, triggering widespread discontent.         
	The scandal surfaced this year when a PIL was filed in Orissa High Court alleging that poor quality ML (of Rs 7.5 crore) was procured between 2000 and 2007.         
	A close relative of a cabinet minister had reportedly supplied the ML oil over the years.         
	The state vigilance wing, that was asked to probe into the scam, submitted a report stating that the oil purchased was of a very low quality and was able to destroy only 20 per cent of the larvae. The report further indicated involvement of senior government officials in the scam.         
	Meanwhile, the high court had recently asked the CBI to conduct an in-depth probe into the scandal and asked the state vigilance department to hand over all the relevant documents to the central investigative agency.         
	Mayor Nibedita Pradhan, however, maintained: Let the law take its own course.         
	For now, the CMC has decided to undertake a massive indoor residual spray of sulfac, a compound of sulphur and phosphorous, to tackle the problem.         
	The insecticide proved effective against adult mosquitoes in some slum areas. Extensive use would be considered on the basis of the outcome, said N. Das, the CMC health officer.         
	The civic body had earmarked Rs 2.5 crore in the current fiscal for mosquito control even though it had failed spend less than Rs 1 crore in 2007 for the task.         
	In the last budget estimate, the CMC had allotted Rs 1.5 crore for fighting menace.

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 21: Its nearly the end of winter and time for the annual census report on Bhitarkanika National Park  home to the saltwater crocodiles in India.
    
	This time round the total number of crocodiles stands at 1,498  just 16 more than last year. 
    
	The 2007 census carried forth by the divisional forests office of the Rajnagar mangrove wildlife forest division showed a population of 1,482.
    
	Out of 1,498 crocodiles, 1,421 are inside the sanctuary and 77 live on the fringes. Of the total number, 538 are hatchlings, 342 are yearlings, 227 are juveniles, 139 sub-adults and 252 mature crocs.
    
	The officials have also sighted three giant crocodiles, which are more than 20-feet long. The largest (23-feet-long) saltwater crocodile, which was enlisted in the Guinness World Records last year, was also spotted.
    
	The snail-paced growth has caused worry among the forest officers. 
    
	Experts believe that a drop in the salinity-level of estuarine water is the reason for the slow growth and development, said S.S. Srivastav, the chief conservator of forests. The department is planning to conduct a study on the same, he added.
    
	The park survey is conducted through direct sighting in various creeks and rivers  both in the day and at night. 
    
	The headcount carried out on land is, however, considered easier and more accurate.
    
	The crocodiles are generally counted during the daytime, when they come out to bask in the sun and at night from their eye reflections, as they float in water, said P.K. Behera, the district forest officer.
    
	We used non-mechanised boats and Global Positioning System machines for the survey. The Orissa forest department imposed a weeklong ban on the entry of tourists into the national park from January 7 to 14 to cut down on the noise and carry out the count peacefully, said Behera.
    
	River systems of Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary and its fringe areas are the last stronghold of the estuarine crocs in Orissa. 
    
	The estuarine or the saltwater crocodile are the biggest among all living species. 
    
	It inhabits the deltaic regions of the Bramhani, Baitarani, Dhamra and Mahanadi systems and in the estuaries of the rivers where tidal water from the sea mixes with sweeter river water. 
    
	During 2002, the Bhitarkanika mangroves spread over an area of 2,672sqkm were declared a Ramsar award winning site.

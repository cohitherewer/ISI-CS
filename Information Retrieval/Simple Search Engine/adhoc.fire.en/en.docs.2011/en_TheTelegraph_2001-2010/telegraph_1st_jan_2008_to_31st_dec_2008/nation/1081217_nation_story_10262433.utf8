	Mumbai, Dec. 16: The Maharashtra Opposition today gunned for the scalps of the state home secretary and two top cops as the Mumbai attacks held centre-stage in the House.        
	Ramdas Kadam, the Shiv Sena leader of Opposition, moved an adjournment motion demanding that home secretary Chitkala Zutshi, trapped in the Taj hotel during the November 26 attack, DGP Anami Roy and Mumbai police commissioner Hasan Gafoor be sacked.        
	Kadam criticised the police for not screening the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus after the NSG operation. Eight kg of explosives were found five days after the operation.        
	State BJP chief Nitin Gadkari demanded a probe into the police lapses.         
	Union minister Sharad Pawar, whose NCP is part of the ruling alliance, has demanded that bureaucrats and intelligence agencies also be held accountable. We might have to take action against Gafoor, an NCP leader said in Nagpur. State intelligence department chief D. Sivanandhan is tipped to replace Gafoor.

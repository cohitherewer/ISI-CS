          PAMELA TIMMS                               
	Porvorim (Goa), March 6: The mother of Scarlett Keeling, the 15-year-old British girl found dead on a beach in Goa, has threatened to release graphic photographs of her daughters battered body to prove that she was raped and murdered.        
	Scarletts semi-clad body was found two weeks ago on Goas Anjuna beach, known to be a hippy hub, where her family, from Bideford, north Devon, had been staying.        
	I just want the police to admit that a crime has been committed, said her mother.        
	A first autopsy found that Scarlett had drowned but her family believes she was attacked after leaving a beach bar in the early hours of February 19.        
	Her mother, Fiona MacKeown, claimed that detectives had overlooked cuts and bruises on her daughters body, and the absence of water in her lungs.         
	Earlier this week, the Indian government appeared to back her claims when it said it was embarrassed by the controversy and ordered the police to reopen their inquiry.        
	Last night, however, MacKeown said she was losing faith in the local authorities and that she did not believe they had any intention of catching her daughters killers.        
	She believed that releasing graphic pictures of her daughters body was her only hope of forcing Goas chief minister to conduct a proper inquiry.        
	After local officials failed to publish a promised second post-mortem report, she said: Of course I dont want to put the pictures out, but I dont have any alternative.        
	Theyre just trying to drag it out so well get fed up and go home. Then theyll close the case. I just want the police to admit that a crime has been committed.        
	She was due to meet chief minister Digambar Kamat but two meetings were cancelled. He had said earlier: The police have not found anything to suggest murder.        
	Vikram Varma, the familys lawyer, said last night that he would be proceeding with legal action to force the police to continue their inquiries.

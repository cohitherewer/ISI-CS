          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The mother of Rohit Shekhar, who filed a paternity suit against N.D. Tiwari, has joined the young lawyers fight to get the Congress veteran to acknowledge him as his son.        
	Ujjwala Sharma yesterday formally moved a petition seeking to implead herself as a co-plaintiff in the suit pending before the high court.        
	In her petition, the 63-year-old said for the first time that she had been drawn into a relationship with Tiwari, now governor of Andhra Pradesh, while separated from her then husband, and that Rohit, 29, was born out of the relationship.         
	Tiwari, 85, has denied he is Rohits father and refused a DNA test, but he has accepted that Ujjwala was his paramour at a time she was married.         
	In her petition, Sharma said Tiwari told her since he was issueless, they should have a child together. Tiwari, she added, assured her that the formalities of marriage could be completed after the divorce (with her husband) came through.         
	She said repeated requests convinced her of the love and affection shown by Tiwari, who came from a respectable and prestigious family, and she submitted to the emotional pressure that culminated in Rohits birth.        
	Sharma also claimed that she entered the relationship with the much older Tiwari only after a decade of persuasion from him and had a child  Rohit  10 years after she had had her first child.        
	She said though she and her husband finally got divorced by mutual consent in 2006, she had no marital relations with him since 1970, two years after her first child was born.        
	Tiwari was a frequent visitor to the house of my father who was an MP and we used to meet frequently as he was the president of the All India Youth Congress and I was general secretary of the All India Young Womens Congress, she said.        
	Sharma said she tried to hold Tiwari to his promise to acknowledge his son by adoption after his wifes death in 1993. But after acquiring power, as an elected MP, Tiwari, her petition said, wanted to lead an unfettered life and did not want to acknowledge her. He even used his influence to have her threatened, Sharma alleged, forcing her to seek police protection.        
	Sharma said Tiwari called Rohit and her over to his Uttarakhand home on his 80th birthday, where Rohit was treated like any other visitor, and then ushered into the drawing room where he was told to meet Tiwari strictly outside public eye.         
	Later, Sharma said, they were arrogantly told Tiwari would not associate with them any more.        
	The petition said Rohit had to be hospitalised with depression and heart ailment because of the humiliation. Her health, too, had been affected, Sharma said.

	Oslo, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Higher levels of pollution in Asia may affect the formation of clouds high in the Himalayas, perhaps disrupting the monsoon and speeding the thawing of glaciers.         
	A report by scientists in France and Italy found microscopic particles in the air that could be seeds for water droplets at a Nepalese mountain observatory, the highest in the world at 5,079m above sea level.        
	It was the first time that scientists observed such particles forming so high, far above those seen in previous studies from Europe and Japan.        
	We think its because theres a lot of pollution in the valleys which rises and meets clean air masses high- er up. This creates new particles, said one of the auth- ors, Karine Sellegri, at the Universite Blaise Pascal in France.        
	The study in the American journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said the particles might come from smoke emanating out of burning wood in Himalayan valleys. Or they might have a natural origin, from vegetation.        
	Still, the scientists pointed to wider risks of the cloud-forming mechanism.        
	Rising air pollution levels in South Asia will have worldwide environmental consequences, the climate study said.        
	Transport of pollutants from the densely populated regions of India, Pakistan, China and Nepal to the Himalayas may lead to sub- stantial radiative forcing (warming effect) in South Asia.        
	In turn, that could affect the monsoon, disrupt the regional climate and have dramatic impacts on glacier retreat in the Himalayas, the scientists wrote.        
	The UN climate panel said last year that Hima- layan glaciers, which feed rivers on which hundreds of millions of people depend, could shrink to 100,000sqkm by 2030 from 500,000sqkm now because of global warming.        
	Sellegri added, however, that it was too early to know exactly what impact rising pollution would have in the Himalayas.         
	We need more modelling, she said.

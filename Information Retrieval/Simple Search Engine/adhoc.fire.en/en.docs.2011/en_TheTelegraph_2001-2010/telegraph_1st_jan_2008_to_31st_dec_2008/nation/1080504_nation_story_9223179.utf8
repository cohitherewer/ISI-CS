	Hyderabad, May 3: A fire razed Asias biggest chilli market in Guntur today, blowing clouds of pungent smoke across the town and leaving several thousand farmers, traders and labourers devastated.        
	Many residents of the town, 400km southeast of Hyderabad, suffered from burning eyes, cough and hiccups but no serious illness was reported. Town authorities blared warnings from hired rickshaws, asking people to cover their eyes with wet cloth.        
	The 9.30am fire burnt down the 46-acre market yard with over 3 lakh bags of chilli stocked for the Saturday auction, which attracts merchants from Manila, Hong Kong, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. The annual business at the market  the trading centre for the famed red Guntur chilli  is worth about Rs 15-20,000 crore.        
	Market sources said the losses would run to Rs 250 crore although chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy told reporters in Delhi that chilli worth Rs 20 crore, three-fourths of it insured, had been destroyed.        
	Its a disaster. Our crops had already lost half their value after unseasonal rain discoloured them. Now the fire has destroyed all our hopes, said a tearful Bolla Venkateswarlu, a farmer who had brought his crop from Vinukonda two days ago to sell at the market.        
	Some 1.5 lakh bags of chilli, each weighing 40kg, had been brought to the market last night for the auction.        
	Some 450 shops, 45 godowns, 35 huts and even the Andhra Bank branch in the market burnt down along with several trucks. The fire spread to cold storage units outside the yard and some nearby houses, which were evacuated.        
	Some 1,300 traders (many of them farmers, too) and commission agents, as well as the markets 1,500 labourers, were left pondering their future today.        
	Its starvation time for all of us till the market opens again, said Savitramma, 32, one of the 200 women labourers who made Rs 75 to 120 a day cleaning and sun-drying the crop.        
	A short-circuit in a single godown, that of Mayuri Enterprises, triggered the inferno, fire officials said. They said they expected to douse the blaze by tonight.        
	We have brought 20 fire-tenders and requisitioned 10 more from neighbouring districts, said district fire officer Mohan Rao.        
	The authorities have procured helicopters and firefighting equipment from ONGC.        
	Eight chilli farmers in Guntur district had committed suicide after two spells of rain destroyed crop worth several hundred crores in late March.        
	We dont know how many heartbreaks there will be now, said Guntur mayor Rayapati Srinivas, a chilli and tobacco merchant.

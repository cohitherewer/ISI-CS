	Mumbai/ New Delhi, Dec. 6: Narayan Rane was today suspended from the Congress for violating party discipline, but his threat to topple the government and expose the misdeeds of Vilasrao Deshmukh promises to make the winter session of the Assembly, which begins on Thursday in Nagpur, stormy.         
	I can stop the formation of the new government. I have sufficient MLAs with me. I can also topple the government even if it is formed. Around 25-30 MLAs can go with me to tell the governor they do not support this government. But the prevailing situation in Mumbai needs a stable government. So I wont do it. Congress leaders should not provoke me to do so either, he warned, accompanied by 13 MLAs.         
	Rane, who lashed out at the party yesterday for not making him chief minister, said 48 MLAs had backed him for the post as compared to 32 who supported Ashok Chavan, but the party leadership delayed the declaration of his name.        
	Chavan was last evening named Deshmukhs successor as Maharashtra chief minister. Together with Chhagan Bhujbal, chosen his deputy, he met governor S.C. Jamir and submitted a letter claiming the support of 168 MLAs to form the new government.         
	Rane said Sonia Gandhis political secretary, Ahmed Patel, known to be close to Deshmukh, the outgoing chief minister himself, and the state and city party chiefs, Manikrao Thakre and Kripa Shankar Singh, had conspired against him.         
	He sarcastically welcomed the suspension and said he was denied the post because he had been opposing sale of land owned by government undertakings. I had opposed the sale of 1,100 acres of CIDCO land to Videocon. I had also opposed the sale of Mhada and MIDC land. So with Vilasraos blessings, some industrialists and Congress leader Ahmed Patel have done this, he said.         
	Ranes mentor in the party, Margaret Alva, lost her party post recently for indiscipline.         
	Flaunting a copy of the Comptroller and Auditor Generals 2007 report, yet to be tabled in the Assembly, Rane said it had found that the government lost Rs 1.19 crore after MIDC land in Latur was given to the Vilasrao Deshmukh Foundation at cheaper than market rates.         
	This report has not been tabled for one and a half years. The party would have demanded Vilasraos resignation had it been tabled. I would tell Vilasrao, this is just the beginning. I can make a new revelation every day, he said.         
	Rane also blamed the government for the terror attacks. Security, not development, should have been given priority, he said.         
	Some leaders have been providing funds and shelter to foreign-trained terrorists. They should be probed. I will reveal more at the right time, Rane said.         
	But while he had yesterday said he did not have faith in the entire Congress leadership, including Sonia Gandhi, Rane was singing a different tune today. I respect leaders like A.K. Antony, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. The party has been running because of them, he said, stressing he had nothing against any senior leader except Patel.        
	The Congress is not too worried. Sources said Rane would not be able to split the legislature party, at least not until Chavan had named his cabinet.         
	After that, he may try and work on the disgruntled elements, a source said. But even then, no MLA would risk his seat to go with Rane unless he created a credible political space for himself by either joining another party or floating a new one.         
	The NCP, a Congress ally, would not want to touch him now and the Shiv Sena, which Rane quit in 2005, is still cut up with him. Closer to the Lok Sabha polls, he may step up his political activities, a source said.

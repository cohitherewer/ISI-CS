          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Words spoken in a fit of anger or emotion without any intention cannot be termed instigation to suicide, the Supreme Court has said while upholding a high court order quashing suicide charges against a woman.        
	The woman had called her husband ugly and impotent in public and sworn never to live with him. He committed suicide days later.        
	Sonti Shanti Sree had married Venkateswara Rao, a Kendriya Vidyalaya employee in Machilipatnam, on May 29, 2004. On June 2, a day after they were to consummate the marriage at her home, Shanti insulted Rao in front of family and friends gathered for a ceremony.        
	She said he was impotent, that her life was spoiled and that she would not accept the marriage.        
	Raos father, Sonti Rama Krishna, claimed in his FIR that his son had told him Shanti had refused to cohabit with him because he was ugly. Shanti was allegedly fair-complexioned whereas he was not good-looking.        
	He, however, stayed on at Shantis home in Vijayawada for three more days before returning to his village, Turakapalem. Shanti apparently did not go with him.        
	On June 9, Rama Krishna received a message three days later from police saying Rao had committed suicide.        
	The FIR alleged that Shantis intentional instigation and cruel conduct had prompted Rao to kill himself. Proceedings were initiated against her before the additional judicial magistrate, Machilipatnam. Shanti then challenged the prosecution in the high court, which held that even if the allegations were true, the abusive language could not have led to a suicide days later.        
	Raos father appealed to the Supreme Court, which noted that the marriage was arranged, and that it was impossible to believe the couple had not met before the wedding. So, Shanti could not have noticed for the first time on June 2, 2004, that Rao was ugly.        
	The court also noted that there was no suicide note.

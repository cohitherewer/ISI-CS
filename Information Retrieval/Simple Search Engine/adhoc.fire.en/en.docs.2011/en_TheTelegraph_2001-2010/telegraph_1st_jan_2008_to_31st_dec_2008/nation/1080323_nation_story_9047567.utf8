	Polls at doorstep, God help Gowda    
	Politicians are busy seeking peoples blessings when polls are round the corner, but H.D. Deve Gowda would rather knock on Gods door.    
	The JD(S) chief, a frequent temple hopper, is performing pujas of various kinds.    
	Gowda recently engaged a team of priests who performed special rituals, including a nightlong homa, in the hope that his party and particularly his son, former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, would be bestowed with lost power.    
	The super-secretive pujas  even party leaders were kept in the dark  were performed at the JD(S) office under the direct supervision of Gowda and his astrology expert son, former minister H.D. Revanna.    
	But, alas, he couldnt keep the homa under wraps for long. The smoke and the fragrance of incense, coupled with the rather loud chanting of hymns that echoed across the building, had spread in no time.     
	Gowdas flock was soon flocking to the office to take part in the rituals quot;to ward off evil and ensure the party comes back to power in the coming elections quot;.    
	Now, Gowda can only hope the prayers have reached Gods ears.        
	Kannada film on cloud nine    
	The Kannada film industry is flying sky high.     
	The music of the yet-to-be-released Meghave, Meghave (clouds) was released mid-air.     
	The producer had hired an aircraft, which hovered over the city as the chief guest cut the ribbon.    
	The actors, crew and their families, too, were taken for a ride in the chartered plane decorated with the films posters.    
	Once the aircraft had reached high enough for a brush with the clouds, the chief guest, a former minister, released the CDs to a hearty applause.     
	Around 40 people were witness to the unique one-hour event, perhaps a first of its kind in India.     
	Bark up the wrong man    
	A dog may be mans best friend, but it need not always be trusted, not when a murder case hangs on its nose.    
	The Supreme Court has ruled that police cannot rely on clues provided by a sniffer dog to prove the guilt of an accused.    
	While the services of sniffer dogs may be taken for investigation, their faculties cannot be taken as evidence to establish the guilt of an accused, a bench said.    
	The ruling came while the court acquitted an engineer sentenced to life imprisonment on the charge of murdering his wife and adopted daughter. They were found dead at their home in Assams Dibrugarh district on May 25, 1999.     
	A police dog brought to the scene of the crime had circled Dinesh, which made the investigators suspect him, the prosecution said.        
	Soul-search    
	Actor-turned MLA Sve. Shekhar had recently come in Jayalaithaas firing line, but he isnt one to sit at home and sulk.     
	The ADMK legislator, who represents the Mylapore constituency, made himself busy organising the last rites and mass burial of 45 unclaimed bodies from various government hospitals in the city.     
	Shekhar, who faced Jayalalithaas music for skipping the partys general council meeting, led members of his charity, Serve The Dead, to the Krishnampet burial ground in south Chennai on the morning of March 2.     
	Hindus believe that laying unsung souls to rest earns Gods blessings. Now, Shekhar can only pray that the ADMK almighty has taken note of his good deed.

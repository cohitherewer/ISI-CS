	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 3: This year residents of the capital city can bid adieu to ugly posters and graffiti on walls, as Bhubaneswar Municipality has decided to beautify walls with forms of art  without spending a penny. 
    
	The work, which has already begun, will be completed in phases with money from private sources. 
    
	As a part of the first phase, work has begun at Airport Square and the Powerhouse Square. After these are completed, the focus would shift to the stretch between Capital Hospital to AG Square, followed by Nayapalli and Jaydev Vihar.
    
	As many as 32 artists have been engaged for the paint project. The artists, most from BK College of Art, have been divided into two groups of 16 artists each.
    
	The walls would be painted with tribal motifs reflecting the Orissas rich heritage. Besides, the art would portray Oriya rural life with paintings focusing on Odissi, farming, village life and musical instruments. 
    
	We have kept the durability factor in mind and have used paints that would last longer, said Trilochan Behera, an artist. The artists are using plastic paints and waterproof coating to make the paintings last for at least 10 years. 
    
	The BMC wont be paying a single rupee for the project, said Aparajita Sarangi, the Commissioner. The cost would be borne by private partners who have tied up with us, she added. Areas that have been painted already, costs have come to Rs 52,000. 
    
	The stretch from Capital Hospital to AG Square would be financed by Vedanta. The work would be completed in 10 days. The stick no bills phrase has been of little help. But we hope that people will not like to mess these beautiful walls and thus save them from defacement. Besides, the city would look pretty, said Sarangi. 
    
	The images are simply lovely. I am looking forward to seeing my city after the makeover is over, admitted Samarendra Bhatt, a commuter.

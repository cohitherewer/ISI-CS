          K.P. NAYAR                           Richard Boucher                                  
	Washington, July 21: Without awaiting the outcome of tomorrows trust vote in Parliament, the Bush administration is moving full steam ahead on all fronts to operationalise the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	It will consummate the nuclear partnership with India even under a caretaker government in New Delhi, the state departments senior-most official dealing with India has indicated.        
	Richard Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, told an ethnic Indian weekly, India Abroad, in an interview that instead of doing one thing after another, which is the way we would normally do this, we have broken this out and said, OK, we can move three or four channels in parallel to work on the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) decision, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) decisions, the internal discussions, the certifications, the drafting.        
	He added that we have really set ourselves up to do this as fast as possible but there is an enormous amount to be done.... We are already heavily engaged  we have got designated teams working on this stuff.        
	Boucher was careful not to appear to be interfering in Indias internal affairs or arrogating the prerogatives of the US Congress, which has a veto on the deal.        
	Boucher stressed that in terms of the US and India, we deal with the legally constituted government of India  whoever is running that government at the time, that is who we sign agreements with. So, that is not a problem for us.        
	He explained Washingtons legal position that if India has a legitimate government  people who are empowered to run the government  that is who we will deal with. As long as they are a duly constituted government, we are happy to deal with them.        
	What he did not say was that the US has a long and colourful history of dealing even with governments that are not legally constituted as long as such governments serve US interests  Chiles junta led by General Augusto Pinochet, for example, and more recently General Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan.        
	The US diplomat scoffed at the idea that there was anything lacking in minority governments.        
	Minority governments are common around the world and you cannot say, Oh, well, we are going to stop dealing with you till the next election or until some new coalition or something. That is not for us to say.         
	Boucher emphasised that on our side, there is no legal problem or moral problem. On their (Indian) side there may not be a legal question, but there is (sic!) always political questions and they are going to have to figure that one out themselves.         
	He said President George W. Bush can only certify that the requirements to operationalise the deal have been met and take the package to Capitol Hill, but I cannot promise what the US Congress will do. If we take it to some point and time expires on this Congress, then the new Congress will have to take it up  that is all you can say. So, that is our pledge.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 29: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today urged the Centre to not revise the working hours of labourers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).        
	Earlier, according to NREGS work schedule, an unskilled labourer worked for seven hours per day. However, the Union rural development ministry issued a notification recently revising the working hours nine.         
	In a letter to Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh the chief minister said if the lunch break is included, the new working hours would extended to more than 12 hours.         
	Since under the NREGS, emphasis is laid on physical labour, working for such a long period may prove to be hazardous for a man or a woman.        
	It may even prove fatal during the summer days, he added in his letter.

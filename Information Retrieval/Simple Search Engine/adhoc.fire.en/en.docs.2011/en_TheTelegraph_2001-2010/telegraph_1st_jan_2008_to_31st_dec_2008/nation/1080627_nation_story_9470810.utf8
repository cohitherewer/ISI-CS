          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 26: If the red monkeys quit, Manmohan Singh can count on Shiv Sainiks.        
	The Sena today said it wasnt averse to bailing the UPA government out in national interest if the central combine, led by traditional rival Congress, asked for its support to keep the US nuclear deal alive.        
	This is a purely hypothetical scenario, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said from Delhi, asked if his party, a strong supporter of the deal, would support the government if the Left pulled out.        
	But national interest has to be taken into account, and the Sena chief (Bal Thackeray) will take a decision if such a scenario arises tomorrow.        
	His party, he added, was one of the oldest allies of the BJP-led NDA. So, we will always stick on with them. But we know what national interest is.        
	The assertion came a day after a stinging editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna slammed the Left for blackmailing the government and branded the comrades red monkeys.        
	The article said there was no need to clarify how much of the political chaos in Delhi was national interest and how much of it was selfish interest because it was clear that the Marxists were wary of India-US friendship because of their love for China.        
	Nobody else except the red monkeys denies that the nuke deal is beneficial to India, the article added.        
	Raut, who is also the executive editor of Saamna, said it was clear that the Left was behaving on Chinas cue.        
	His words should boost the spirits of the Congress because, even with the 39 MPs of the Samajwadi Party, the government would be three short of the majority mark in the Lok Sabha if the Left pulls out.        
	The Sena has 12 MPs, a handy number to bridge the deficit.        
	Raut said even BJP leader L.K. Advani had expressed his support for the deal. How long would the Left blackmail go on? It is holding the government to ransom.        
	The BJP has, however, ruled out coming to the governments rescue if the Left withdraws support.

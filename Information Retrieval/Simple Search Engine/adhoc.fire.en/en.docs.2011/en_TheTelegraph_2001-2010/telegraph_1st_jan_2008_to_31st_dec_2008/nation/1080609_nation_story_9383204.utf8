          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Channel trouble                                  
	Cuttack, June 8: All India Radio (AIR), Cuttack, that completed 50 years of service in Orissa, is now embroiled in a controversy for allegedly overlooking a Central Administrative Tribunals (CAT) ruling and initiating a fresh recruitment process on May 30 for its newsroom.         
	Taking a note of the AIR move, the Cuttack bench of the CAT has issued a restriction on the outcome of the recruitment.         
	The bench comprising vice-chairman M.R. Mohanty and member (administration) C.R. Mohapatra on March 11, 2008, directed AIR authorities to enlist qualified candidates who were kept out in the final round during the recruitment of news reader-cum-translator in 2005-06.         
	The CATs direction was on a recruitment process in which 113 applicants were allowed to take a written test and 43 of them were short-listed for a voice test.         
	For the final round, 12 candidates were found suitable and were called for viva voce. Nine were finally selected.         
	Two candidates who were allowed to face the viva-voce tests but failed to make it to the final list of selected candidates had challenged the recruitment process. Both alleged that candidates less qualified than them were selected.         
	Meanwhile, the AIR authorities on May 30 issued a fresh advertisement inviting applications for casual news reader-cum-translators and casuals for editorial/reporting work without implementing the March 11 CAT order.         
	Subsequently, the two candidates, A.N. Das and S.K. Panda, filed a fresh petition before the CAT bench.         
	Acting on it the CAT Bench of member (administration) C.R. Mohapatra issued notices (returnable within two weeks) to the AIR (Cuttack) authorities. The recruitment initiated will be subjected to the outcome of the case, the CAT order issued on June 3 had stated.         
	The first news was broadcast by the AIR-Cuttack on May 26, 1958 and since then the regional news unit has taken great strides and played a pivotal role in disseminating information among the Orissa population.

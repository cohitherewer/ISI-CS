     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 24: Both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar are the disciples of Bihars socialist icon Karpoori Thakur  but that is perhaps not a strong reason to unite over.
    
	At war with each other, the railway minister and the Bihar chief minister chose different days to celebrate Thakurs birth anniversary today. 
    
	And instead of dwelling on the leaders ideals  Lalu and Nitish both used the occasion to attack each other. He (Lalu Prasad) camped in Bikramganj for days. What happened? Eventually, the people voted for the party and government that is trying to carry out development in the state, the Bihar chief minister said, addressing an event held to commemorate Thakurs anniversary today. 
    
	Nitish Kumar not only attacked Lalu Prasad but he held all the RJD ministers at the Centre responsible for creating hurdles in the development of the state.
    
	These RJD ministers are aware that the Centre has brought only 65-lakh families under BPL schemes in Bihar against an actual number of 1.16crore. As a result thousands of families living below the poverty line are not receiving benefits meant for them, he said.
    
	Kumar claimed that he and his government was the true representatives of Karpoori Thakurs ideals and wishes. 
    
	On the other hand, Lalu Prasad who celebrated his ideals anniversary yesterday launched an all-out attack on the Nitish Kumar government. Look how people from the BJP camp, too, are claiming to be Thakurs successors. Even the communal BJP, against whom Thakur fought throughout his life, finds it fashionable to celebrate his anniversary, Lalu Prasad remarked. His words were sarcastic at best. Central funds are being looted in Bihar. I have no idea where the funds, especially meant for the poor, are being used, he added.

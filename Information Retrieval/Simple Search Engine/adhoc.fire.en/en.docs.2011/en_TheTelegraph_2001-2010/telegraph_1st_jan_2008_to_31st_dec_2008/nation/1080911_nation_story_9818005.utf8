	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Sonia Gandhi is likely to ask Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to explain why Raj Thackeray was being allowed to get away with intemperate and provocative statements against the Bachchans.        
	Congress general secretary Margaret Alva has asked Deshmukh why his government was doing nothing when there was a gag order from the court against Thackeray. Alva, who is in charge of Maharashtra, briefed Sonia this evening.         
	Congress sources, who admitted they did not know where Bachchan-Gandhi relations stood now, said Sonia viewed Jayas spat with Thackeray as a law and order problem. She is concerned about its political implications in the context of the regional chauvinism that Thackeray is trying to whip up against the non-Marathi speaking population, they said.         
	Since the Congress dumped the Left and embraced the Samajwadi Party, speculation has been rife on whether the political understanding would lead to a rapprochement between the Gandhis and the Bachchans, who were close friends for decades before their relations soured.         
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, who calls Bachchan his elder brother, said Jaya, a Samajwadi MP, was happy with the turn of events and had no problems with the Congress.        
	Soon after the Congress came to power in 2004, Jaya had said her husband was betrayed when he was passing through a bad phase, in comments that were seen as targeted at the Gandhis. This drew a sharp reaction from Rahul Gandhi, before Amitabh stepped in to end the public row, saying he regretted his wifes remarks. But he added a reference dripping with sarcasm. Woh raja hain, hum runk hai (They are king and we commoners), he said of the Gandhis.         
	Congress sources said it was unlikely Sonia would want to mix up her partys alliance with the Samajwadis with personal issues and use it to reach out to the Bachchans. They said she was keener on wrapping up seat-sharing talks for Uttar Pradesh and ensuring the two parties put up a good fight against the BSP.        
	Sonia stayed out of the first two rounds of talks, leaving it to son Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Digvijay Singh to work out a formula. But after a heated exchange between Amar and Digvijay, sources said she might attend the next meeting scheduled for September 15.        
	In political and social circles, there is a feeling that Jayas comments  she said that since she was from Uttar Pradesh, she should speak in Hindi and that Marathi-speakers should excuse her  reflected her tendency to speak out of turn. This has imperilled several relationships, including that with the Gandhis.        
	Another view is that the enforced silence on the Congress-Samajwadi alliance has taken its toll, forcing her to speak up to attract attention.         
	Sources said Jayas remarks were not innocuous or off the cuff, as she and her family would have people believe. Those who know her said the MP savoured the cut and thrust of politics.        
	In an attack on Thackeray, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said: The people of Maharashtra will have to take a fundamental decision whether they want to bow down to the diktats of a lumpen wanting cheap publicity or uphold the rule of law.

	Kochi, Jan. 16 (PTI): A group of passengers who arrived on a Jet Airways flight from Kuwait last night were taken to the domestic terminal of the Kochi airport without the mandatory immigration and customs checks.
    
	Airport officials said an airport bus took about 20 passengers to the domestic terminal instead of the international one by mistake. The officials realised the faux pas when the passengers asked for their luggage, which awaited clearance at the international terminal.
    
	All the passengers, except one, were then taken to the international terminal, the officials said. Eliot Dsooza, who was carrying only hand baggage, had left by then. Airport officials traced him and asked him to return to the airport.
    
	Air India, which handles ground operations at the airport, said an internal inquiry would be launched into the incident.
    
	AI sources said the flight from Kuwait, expected at 9pm, landed half an hour early and was parked at the 10th bay near the domestic terminal. The bus took the first set of passengers to the domestic terminal without realising they had come by an international flight, they said.
    
	The commandant of the Central Industrial Security Force at the airport, Rajvee Panth, said there was no lapses on the part of CISF personnel.
    
	Jet Airways had last week launched its Gulf service from the airport at Nedumbassery, the first in the country to be built with private-public participation. 
    
	Sreeram Bharat, the managing director of Cochin International Airport Ltd, the private partner, today convened a meeting of various agencies, including Air India, to discuss the fiasco.
    
	The company and immigration officials have launched separate inquiries into the incident. The immigration officials have sent a preliminary report to the IGP, bureau of immigration, Delhi.

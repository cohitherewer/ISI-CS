The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Armchair generals worry BJP 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Armchair generals worry BJP 
          SANJAY K. JHA                                                Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi		      
	New Delhi, May 11: The BJP is enthusiastic about its winnable Lok Sabha seats but its winnable leaders are all comfortably entrenched in the Rajya Sabha.        
	The entire frontline leadership, barring shadow Prime Minister L.K. Advani, have come to Parliament without contesting polls.        
	As the party prepares for the next general elections, senior leaders are confused about their role. While some want to contest, others are reluctant to risk it without identifying a safe seat.        
	Many in the party feel that most of the senior leaders should contest, but it is impossible to enforce this rule since it involves the high command.        
	Among those who were senior ministers in Atal Bihari Vajpayees cabinet, none except Advani is in the Lok Sabha. Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Murli Manohar Joshi are all in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Among the second-rung ministers in the Vajpayee government, only Ananth Kumar, Shahnawaz Hussein, Satyanarayan Jatia and Harin Pathak are in the Lok Sabha. Arun Shourie, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudi and C.P. Thakur are in the Rajya Sabha, while Ram Naik, Jagmohan and Karia Munda are not even MPs.        
	The popular B.C. Khanduri, Vasundhara Raje Scindia and Raman Singh have moved to the states as chief ministers.        
	The party would like a sizeable number of its Rajya Sabha heavyweights to contest the next general election but most of them have never done grassroots politics and therefore want a safe seat.        
	These MPs have acquired their high profiles through their stints in the government, and as party strategists and media-handlers, but have never groomed a constituency.        
	Swaraj has fought Lok Sabha polls in the past and has charisma, but she has refused an offer to contest from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Joshis pet constituency, Allahabad, has been transformed by delimitation, so he is reluctant to contest. Jaitley wants a safe seat, as does Rajnath. Naidu is too busy with poll management.        
	The BJPs problem is that no state, except Gujarat, is being seen as safe. The party is in a shambles in Uttar Pradesh and faces anti-incumbency in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There is optimism over Delhi and many stalwarts have set their sights on the capitals elite seats.        
	In these circumstances, the party cannot force the heavyweights to jump into the fray. There is the ready excuse that senior leaders should be kept free to manage such a vast electoral exercise.        
	However, the crowding of its bigwigs in the Rajya Sabha has weakened the party in the Lok Sabha. Leaders like V.K. Malhotra, Kharabela Swain and Sumitra Mahajan  not known for their oratory  have been handling all the important debates and have failed to make an impact over the past four years.        
	The BJP wants to redeem the situation in the next election, but that is proving a difficult task.

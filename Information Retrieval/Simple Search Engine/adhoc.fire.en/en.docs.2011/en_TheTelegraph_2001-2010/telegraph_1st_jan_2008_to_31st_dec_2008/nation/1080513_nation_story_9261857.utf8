          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 12: Dearth of electrical contactors and engineers has hit the rural electrification work in the state.         
	A review of rural electrification works, undertaken by chief minister Naveen Patnaik this afternoon, revealed gaps in the power plans.         
	Energy minister Surya Narayan Patro said the department, after the meeting, decided to issue licences to civil contractors to undertake rural electrification works. Similarly, the government has decided to utilise the services of electrical inspectors of private power distribution companies for issuing work completion certificates.         
	A target was set today to electrify the remaining revenue villages and smaller settlements within one and a half years.         
	Rural electrification works are being executed under central-sponsored Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutkaran Yojana and state-funded Biju Gram Jyoti Yojana. Besides, BPL households are being provided power free of cost. Angul, Nayagarh, Ganjam and Gajapati were covered under the RGGVY in the first phase, while the scheme was extended to all the 30 districts in the next phase.         
	While rural electrification works are under progress in the four phase-I districts, tenders have been floated in 24 districts, the review revealed. A target was set to cover more than 50,000 revenue villages and hamlets under this central scheme.        
	Similarly, 3,700 hamlets will be electrified by June end and all 8,000 hamlets will be covered under the state-funded Biju Gram Jyoti Yojana by January 2009.

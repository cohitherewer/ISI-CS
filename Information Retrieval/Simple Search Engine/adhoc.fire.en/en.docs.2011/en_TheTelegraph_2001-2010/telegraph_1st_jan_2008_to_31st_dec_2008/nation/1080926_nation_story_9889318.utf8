          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Congress today dared Justice G.T. Nanavati to appear as witness and be cross-examined in the Godhra trial.        
	Responding to the panels report describing the 2002 train fire as a conspiracy, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said: If Justice Nanavati is prepared to be a witness and says yes, I will consider resigning my job and cross-examine him.        
	Sibal, who is also a lawyer, dubbed the report a fraud and asked how the probe panel could give a clean chit to chief minister Narendra Modi.         
	How can a commission of inquiry hold anyone guilty or innocent? Its job is to inquire into the circumstances (of the incident) and not grant good certificates to chief ministers. It is not an investigating authority and cannot give an acquittal or conviction verdict. Nanavati is not a police officer empowered under the CrPC to investigate a crime, he said.        
	The report  like the one submitted earlier by the Justice U.C. Banerjee commission that has said the fire was an accident  constituted opinion evidence and carried no evidential value in a court of law unless Nanavati offered himself as a witness, Sibal said.        
	He alleged that the BJPs effort to drum up a campaign on the report was in sync with a larger plan to polarise the polity before the elections. Look whats happening in Karnataka, Orissa and other places, he said.        
	The BJP was crowing today. The truth is out despite the attempt by Lalu Yadav to mislead people through the Banerjee Committee report, spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said.        
	What happened in Godhra is something which should shame every thinking citizen and if the accused are proved guilty, they should be punished, Sibal said.         
	But he asked why only the first part of the report had been submitted and not the second. Those responsible for what happened after Godhra, shouldnt they be tried and punished?

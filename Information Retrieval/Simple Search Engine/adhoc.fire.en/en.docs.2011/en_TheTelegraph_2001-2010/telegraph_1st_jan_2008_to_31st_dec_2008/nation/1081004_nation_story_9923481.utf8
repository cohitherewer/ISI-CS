          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 3: The state governments bid to overcome deficiencies exposed by the Medical Council of India (MCI) has hit a roadblock.         
	The MCI had recommended more faculty members in keeping with an increased number of seats for the MBBS course in the three state-run medical colleges.        
	The State Administrative Tribunal has stayed the recruitment process of 294 posts of senior residents or tutors at the MKCG Medical College and Hospital, VSS Medical College and Hospital, SCB Medical College and Hospital, and Sardar Vallabhai Patel Postgraduate Institute of Paediatrics.        
	Prasant Kumar Mohapatra and six others had on behalf of the Orissa Medical Services Association filed a petition in the tribunal challenging the advertisement issued by the directorate of medical education and training inviting applications for the 294 posts in 32 disciplines, preferably from postgraduate degree holders.        
	The petitioners claimed that the advertisement violated the provisions of the Orissa Medical Education Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1979.        
	The ministry of health and family welfare  while granting 150 seats by increasing 43 additional seats in MBBS course in each of the three government colleges during the last academic session  stipulated the terms and conditions for compliance with the deficiencies brought out by the MCI.

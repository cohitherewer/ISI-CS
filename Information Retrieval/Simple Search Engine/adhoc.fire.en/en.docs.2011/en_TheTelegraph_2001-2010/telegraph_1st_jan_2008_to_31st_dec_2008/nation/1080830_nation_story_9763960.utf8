          OUR BUREAU                          Army jawans help flood victims shift to safer places in Bihars Madhepura district on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi/Patna, Aug. 29: The Centre today released Rs 1,000 crore from the National Calamity Contingency Fund and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar deputed five of his cabinet colleagues to take care of the 22 lakh people rendered homeless by unprecedented floods in north Bihar.        
	The Centre also stepped up support and sent five choppers to Bihar and arranged 118 boats along with deployment of army and paramilitary forces. As millions of people are still marooned in the remote areas, the relief commissioners of Bengal and Jharkhand instructed the district magistrates concerned of the districts neighbouring Bihar to provide boats as required.        
	The CRPF collected about 3,500 tents from its various companies across the country and sent them to Bihar. Strength of army increased to eight columns today as four more columns were deployed.         
	The National Crisis Management Committee headed by the cabinet secretary reviewed the flood situation in Bihar today.         
	Nitish today constituted an all-party committee to monitor the relief work in the flood caused by the Kosi river changing its course after a breach at Kusaha in Nepal.         
	Nitish also pressed two more ministers into the flood zone to supervise the situation. Three ministers are already camping in the zone. The ministers include Dinesh Chandra Yadav (Saharsa in-charge), A.N. Singh (Purnea in-charge), Narendra Yadav (Madhepura in-charge), Nitish Mishra (Araria in-charge), and Dijendra Yadav (Supaul in-charge).         
	He said the army and rescue operation teams in the five worst-affected districts had evacuated 2.5 lakh people so far.         
	But the flood has rendered 22 lakh people homeless and it will take four to five days for the teams to reach remote areas, he said. The chief minister added that the railways had introduced 20 special trains to take people to relief camps in Forbesganj, Katihar and Saharsa.

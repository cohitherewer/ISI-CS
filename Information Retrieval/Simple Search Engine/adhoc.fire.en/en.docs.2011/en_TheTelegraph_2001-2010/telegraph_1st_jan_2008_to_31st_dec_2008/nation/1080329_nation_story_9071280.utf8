The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mother, Bihar govt seek CBI probe
                                                                                                               Mother, Bihar govt seek CBI probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 28: The Bihar government has recommended a CBI probe into the death of Sameer Hussain, the son of Shahnaz Hussain.         
	Sameer (32) died on January 6 in Patna, after falling from the third-floor of Maqbool Apartment, owned by his father-in-law, Mehfooz Ahmed, on Exhibition Road.         
	While Sameers in-laws have alleged that he committed suicide, his mother, who was not present in Patna at the time of the death, suspect foul play.         
	Shahnaz met Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday seeking a CBI probe into her sons death. Nitish agreed to the mothers plea and we have recommended the case to the CBI, said an official of the state home department, adding that a notification to this effect had been issued.         
	Shahnaz reportedly told the chief minister that her son was the president her company and described him as a normal and deeply religious man. He was running the company well, the mother had added. Shahnaz also visited her sons grave in Patna.         
	But Shahnazs daughter-in-law, Rabia, though welcoming a CBI probe into the death, has rejected her celebrity mother-in-laws claims of Sameer being happy or having a stake in the family empire. My husband had nothing to do with his mothers company. He was lonely, said Rabia, accusing Shahnaz of trying to harass her family.         
	Rabia alleged that Shahnaz had always neglected her son and had driven the latter to drugs and alcohol. Rabia, who is five months pregnant, is also the mother of Sameers two-year-old daughter. Shahnazs neglect of her only son made him depressed, she added.         
	Rabia has also alleged that Shahnazs first husband and Sameers father, Nazir Hussein, was also disappointed with his wifes conduct and had tried to shoot himself. He had died soon after he tried to end his life, she added, while talking to the media from Patna.         
	Sameer was depressed when his mother at 61 years tied the knot for the second time with Rajkumar Kapoor, she added.         
	We dont want to meddle in the family affairs. The CBI will now probe into the case, said a senior police officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | False tip hits probe into Indian murders
                                                                                                            False tip hits probe into Indian murders
                            
	Baton Rouge (Louisiana), Jan. 4 (Agencies): Police wasted thousands of hours in their investigation of the murders of two Indian students because a man deliberately provided false information about the case, officers have said.        
	Dallas Joseph Staden, 22, was charged with criminal mischief for intentionally providing wrong information to the Louisiana State University police department, said Baton Rouge police department sergeant Don Kelly, a spokesperson for the task force investigating the murders of Komma Chandrasekhar Reddy and Allam Kiran Kumar .        
	Kelly said yesterday that Staden called anonymously on December 17, claiming to have direct knowledge of people involved in the murders of the doctoral students. Staden named several possible suspects, including himself, Kelly added.        
	Reddy, 31, from Kurnool, and Kiran, 33, from Hyderabad, were shot in the head on December 13 in what the police called a home invasion on the edge of the university campus.        
	Thousands of man-hours were spent over the next week by detectives, analysts, crime lab technicians, patrol officers, tactical teams, administrators and others from multiple law enforcement agencies attempting to verify this (Stadens) information, Kelly said in a statement.        
	The police then subpoenaed AT amp;T to track the phone number of the anonymous tipster. The records showed the call was made from the home of one of Stadens relatives.        
	Stadens mother confirmed to the police on Wednesday that the call was made by Staden after she listened to a recording of the phone call, Kelly said.        
	It has now been determined that it was Staden himself who actually made the calls for reasons that are unknown.        
	Staden was arrested on December 21 on an unrelated warrant and remains in custody, Kelly said. On his Myspace web page, Staden describes himself as a businessman, a local newspaper said.        
	The sketches of two of the four men wanted for questioning and a model seen near the complex, however, remain valid, Kelly said. That information came from other sources, he added.

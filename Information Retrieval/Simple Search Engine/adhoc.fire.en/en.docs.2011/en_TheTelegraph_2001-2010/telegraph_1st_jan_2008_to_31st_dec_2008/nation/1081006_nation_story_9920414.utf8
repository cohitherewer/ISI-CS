                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Riot victims look for petty jobs to survive
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          One of the torched houses in Kandhamal                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 5: Labourer, gardener, security guard or office peon. Akash Digal, 20, is ready to settle for any of these jobs even if someone pays him Rs 1,500 a month.        
	Akash is one of the several survivors of the Kandhamal riots whose house was set ablaze by a mob protesting against the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and his four associates on August 23.         
	One can easily make out the anguish over his face. I was a Plus Three student but all my certificates were burnt in the riots. I dont know if I will ever manage to get a job in Bhubaneswar without a certificate, he rues.         
	Several other victims of Kandhamal violence who managed to flee to the city are on their toes looking for jobs. At this hour, I am ready for any job, else I have to go hungry everyday, Binod Pradhan, another youth said, adding that he had aspired to be an engineer.         
	There was a time when I refused to take up our family business because I wanted to study but today I have to settle for being a peon, says the 22-year-old youth, who lost his father in the riots.        
	Scores of families from Kandhamal have been putting up at various places, including Rentalbasti, Saliasahi and Mayfairbasti in Bhubaneswar. Most of the victims are from Tiangia, Pidisubali, Sipaiju, Laburi Majumaha and Mainia villages.        
	We came here because we had some acquaintances here. Initially we thought the tension would die after a month or so and we could return but there seems no end, said Gitanjali Nayak from Tiangia village where she said eight people had been killed.        
	No one would be ready to keep us as guests for long. We should look for work for a livelihood, said Balawant, Gitanjalis husband, who tried for a post of a security person at some nearby apartments.         
	A person has promised me to find a job but I have to pay him some commission, he rued.         
	I dont think there is an end to the violence. We have decided not to return and rather stay here and try to settle. Who knows there maybe more violence in the future and we will once again be rendered homeless, said Sunachand Nayak, who came here with his family of five after spending days at relief camps.        
	But we might go to receive the compensation. We are keeping information over phone about when the disbursement of compensation will start, he said.

                                                                                                               The  Buzz in Big Cities 
              
	Stone-age feel, modern touch    
	Most like it futuristic and towering. But one resort in the Garden City has made a name for itself by going back to the stone age.    
	Welcome to Guhantara, which claims to be the countrys first underground resort.    
	The unseemly entrance, a retractable doorway laid over a moat, doesnt indicate what lies below. A short walk through a semi-dark underground passageway, with barely visible caveman motifs, leads one to the place.    
	As light filters in and shadows stretch out, the passageway suddenly opens out into a cavernous underground world 30 feet below  with all modern amenities.    
	Guhantara, meaning inside a cave in Sanskrit, is 35km from the city centre. It has been created by RSquare Designs Private Limited. We want to transport people to a different era  the rock age  when humans lived in caves, beams S.N. Ramesh, one of the two architects who created the place.    
	The concrete and steel used in the construction is camouflaged so well that hand-plastered walls and moulded concrete around pillars give it a natural rock-like formation.        
	Court in bike safety check     
	Several two-wheelers in Mumbai could be on shaky ground.    
	A special court officer will verify if some two-wheelers (bikes) sold in the city comply with central motor vehicle rules on wheel cover and handgrip at the rear.    
	Bombay High Court judges Bilal Nazki and Sharad Bobde passed the order last week on a public interest plea.    
	Motor vehicle rules require two-wheelers to have covers half the size of the wheel  to prevent clothes from getting entangled  as well as a footrest and a handgrip for the pillion-rider. The petitioner has argued that the rule isnt observed.    
	Some companies he named in his plea told the court they comply with the rules but the petitioner produced advertisement brochures to demonstrate otherwise.     
	The court officer will make rounds of showrooms to carry out checks.    
	Brace for rate shock    
	A mild shock awaits the capitals power users from March.    
	The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission declared last week that rates will go up by 5 paise per unit for all categories of consumers, including households.    
	The decision foxed many who had taken seriously chief minister Sheila Dikshits assurance there would be no tariff hikes.     
	The tariff will be increased 5 paise per unit for domestic, agriculture and industrial consumers. The rates will come into force from March 1 and stay in effect till March 31, 2009, a senior commission official said.    
	Since April last year, it was decided that retail tariffs would be fixed every year to make up for unforeseen increases in the cost of inputs to generate electricity.    
	The idea behind the annual revisions is to reward performance (of companies), promote efficiency and provide an element of regulatory certainty, the commission said.        
	Slum pangs    
	A recent study has questioned the belief, widely held among government officials, that slum-dwellers are better off in the new sites where they were shifted after eviction.    
	NGO Hazards Centre has claimed these people are worse off now, many without employment and shelter. The main problem is that the new sites are too far from work places.    
	The study was conducted in Bawana, Savda Ghevra, Yamuna Pushta and Madanpur Khader, among the few resettlement colonies. The evictions aim to make Delhi a world-class city.    
	Delhi: This Thursday, troop into Whatever Happened to Harolds Shorts? that revisits the works of celebrated theatre personality Harold Pinter. The First City Theatre Foundation has organised the retro programme. The venue is The Attic, 36, Regal Building, Connaught Place. Time: 7pm.

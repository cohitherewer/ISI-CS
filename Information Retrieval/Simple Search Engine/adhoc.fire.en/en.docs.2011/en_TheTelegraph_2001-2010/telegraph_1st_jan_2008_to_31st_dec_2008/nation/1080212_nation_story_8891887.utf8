The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Global warming, what a pest!
                                                                                                               Global warming, what a pest!
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: Insects are likely to ravage plants with greater vigour as rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere raise global temperature, an analysis of ancient insect behaviour has indicated.         
	US scientists have found that insect foraging had increased dramatically 55 million years ago when high carbon dioxide had increased global temperature by an average of 5 degrees Celsius .        
	The precise sequence of natural causes that triggered this rise remains unclear.         
	The researchers, who studied 5,062 fossil leaves from five sites before, during and after the 55-million-year-old temperature spike, found that the proportion of leaves damaged before and after the spike was below 40 per cent, but had increased to 57 per cent during the warm period.         
	This study convincingly shows a link between temperature and insect feeding on leaves, said Ellen Currano, a team member from the Pennsylvania State University and the Smithsonian Institution.         
	When temperatures increase, the diversity of insect feeding damage on plant species also increases, she said. The findings will appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences tomorrow.         
	Using special techniques to analyse fossil leaf structures, the researchers found that the plants during the high temperature interval were no different from those before and after that period.         
	There is no evidence that the leaves during the warm period were either softer or more nutritious.        
	The researchers believe the warming allowed insects to migrate from the tropics to the north.         
	With more carbon dioxide available to plants, Currano said, plants can make food more efficiently.        
	Photosynthesis is easier and plants can make the same amount of food for themselves without having to put so much protein in their leaves, she said.         
	But with leaves with relatively low protein content, insects need to eat much more to get the nutrition they require.        
	The results suggest that both insect diversity as well as their population density increased with rising temperature.         
	The researchers have predicted that the current phase of global warming - attributed to human activities such as burning up of fossil fuels - may also lead to a similar dramatic rise in insect diversity and ferocity of their attacks on plants.         
	A number of previous studies have indicated that the average global surface temperatures are expected to rise by 1.8 degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius during the 21st century.         
	The 5 degrees Celsius temperature rise 55 million years ago lasted about 100,000 years and is viewed by scientists as one of the best analogues from the past for global warming.

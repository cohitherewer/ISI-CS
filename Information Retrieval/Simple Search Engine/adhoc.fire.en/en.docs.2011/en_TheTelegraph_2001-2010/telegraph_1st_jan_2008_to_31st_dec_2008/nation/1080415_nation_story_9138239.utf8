	Bhubaneswar, April 14: The heat wave sweeping across Orissa in the past one week has claimed three lives.         
	According to district reports, 52-year-old Sachidanda Panda, a wage labourer from Begunia block in Khurda district, died of sunstroke on Saturday.         
	His family said Sachidananda returned from work around 1pm and complained of nausea as well as headache.         
	He then drank a lot of water and fell asleep and did not wake up again.         
	Similarly, Ramani Tanti (45) of Barahatipur village under Ghatagaon police station in Keonjhar district reportedly died of sunstroke as well, when he went into the nearby forests when to gather mahua fruits.         
	One Bichitrananda Khatei (50) of Bianlabarhampur village under Nimapara police station in Puri district also fell ill after complaining of nausea and headaches.         
	It is suspected that like the other two, the middle-aged man succumbed to the sunstroke and the heatwave.        
	However, the district officials are yet to officially confirm the cases.         
	A senior officer at the state revenue and disaster management control room said they had sent the alleged sunstroke death cases to respective district collectors for confirmation.         
	Sunstroke deaths have been reported since 1998. As many as 2,048 deaths had been reported in 1998.         
	But the number of casualties has gradually come down due to increased level of awareness about the heat wave and precautionary measures.        
	Last year, the official death toll was only 11.

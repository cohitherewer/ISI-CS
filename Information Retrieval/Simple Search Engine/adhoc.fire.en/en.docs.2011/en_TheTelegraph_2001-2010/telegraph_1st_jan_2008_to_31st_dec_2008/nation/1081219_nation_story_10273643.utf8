	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Most wives would not stand for it. But first-time writer Daman Singh was only too thankful when hubby refused to take an interest in what she was doing.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs daughter had the audience in splits at her book launch today when she said: I wrote the novel in complete secrecy for a year. I was grateful to my husband Ashok who, when told by me that I was writing a novel, expressed a complete lack of curiosity in what I was doing. I thanked him by naming the most handsome waiter in my novel after him.        
	She added: My son Rohan, who seemed to need me the most whenever I would sit at the computer, was a different story. I had to promise him 1 per cent of the royalty to get him off my back. For his sake I hope the book does well.        
	Her mother Gursharan Kaur, who released the book, said Daman, a graduate in mathematics from St Stephens College, had got bored with NGO work and quit her job when she attempted the novel. Nine By Nine is primarily about hostel life and relationships woven around three women.        
	She had no job and was very restless. I told her to write or paint. She was always a very good writer  I used to show her letters, from her college days, to my friends and exclaim how nicely written they were, Gursharan said.        
	Manmohan, who has three daughters, had been at the launch of Upinders book on history a couple of months ago, but this time he was busy attending Parliament.         
	My mother is an avid reader and a ruthless critic. If she reads my book and I survive her criticism, I can survive anything, Daman said.         
	Daman, who wore a magenta silk sari and minimal makeup and jewellery, was taken aback by the number of people at the gathering and the number of chairs that were continually being brought in.        
	I suspect that the people below 20 are here for the famous snacks (of the hotel where the launch was held); I guess some over 20 are here for that reason as well. But I just hope that some of you are here for my book, she said.

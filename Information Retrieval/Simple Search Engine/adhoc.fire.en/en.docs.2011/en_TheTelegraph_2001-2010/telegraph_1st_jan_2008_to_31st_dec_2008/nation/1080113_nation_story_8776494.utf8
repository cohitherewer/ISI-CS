	Many Calcuttans whom the fire did not affect made it their business to fight it
       
	Citizen fireman
    
	Vijay Bagri does not work for the Bengal fire services. Nor does he own a shop or godown in the Nandaram market or Tirpalpatti.
    
	Yet the 46-year-old spent the whole of Saturday fighting the Burrabazar blaze and helping traders salvage some of their stocks.
    
	Like many Calcuttans, Bagris day began with live pictures of the blaze being beamed on STAR Ananda.
    
	Before opening my shop (of chocolates and toffees near Kalakar Street post office), I decided to visit the blaze site, Bagri said.
    
	The place was in a complete mess. A crowd of onlookers was blocking the path of the fire engines and firefighters. There was no coordination between the different units of firemen who were arriving from different places.
    
	Bagri added: I told a few bystanders to make way for the firemen. They followed my instructions. Even the firemen responded to my instructions. Realising I could be of help, I stayed on.
    
	He was there till evening, shouting orders to onlookers, guiding the firemen and helping the traders.
    
	Bagri could not open his shop on Saturday. He had lost his voice by the time he headed home. But he had been hailed as a hero.
    
	Salvage salve
    
	Aman Mantri, 28, had gone to Kalakar Street to visit a friend on Saturday afternoon. Both decided to visit the site of the fire. They saw traders desperately trying to salvage whatever they could. Aman joined in.
    
	Traders were trying to get into the burning building despite firemens warnings. They were crying out that their families depended on their earnings from these shops, Aman said.
    
	They were desperate. I thought Well, if I can help even one trader save some of his stocks, isnt that a worthwhile thing to do?
    
	Selfless Shankar
    
	Shankar Agarwals shop, India Canvas Company on Jamunalal Bajaj Street, was partially damaged by the fire but that did not stop him from joining the rescue operations to save others shops.
    
	He and Rajesh Karnwat, another trader from Jamunalal Bajaj Street, were the saviours for a shop stashed with blankets on Noor Mohan Lohia Lane. We did whatever we could, Agarwal said.

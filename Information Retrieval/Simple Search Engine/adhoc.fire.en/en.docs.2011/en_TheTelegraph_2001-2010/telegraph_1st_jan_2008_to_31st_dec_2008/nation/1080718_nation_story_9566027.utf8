                              Balakrishnan                            
	New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan today appeared to hint that he might opt out of the Uttar Pradesh provident fund scam case involving judges after a senior lawyer challenged one of his decisions.        
	The countrys topmost judge told counsel Shanti Bhushan he had taken the decision on the administrative side and if he had to recuse (withdraw) from the case, an amended prayer had to be filed.        
	The Supreme Court had earlier this week decided to hear in an open court the corruption case involving a sitting apex court judge, 13 serving and retired high court judges and 12 serving and retired district judges.        
	The move followed petitions that demanded a thorough probe into allegations that the judges had siphoned off crores from the provident fund of employees of the Ghaziabad district court in a scam that could run into Rs 23 crore.        
	Bhushan cited a media report that claimed the Chief Justice had asked a Ghaziabad police officer to prepare a questionnaire, which would form the basis of the probe, and said Balakrishnan should recuse himself from the case.        
	Its a matter falling under the administrative side, the Chief Justice said. The SSP sought my permission and I have taken the decision. If you want to challenge it, you can do so. For this you have to amend your prayer. Somebody else (another bench) will hear it.        
	Minutes before the courtroom drama, the bench had sought a response from the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government on the issue of holding an independent probe.        
	The next hearing has been fixed for August 1.        
	The apex court rejected a suggestion for a probe by a senior retired police officer or under the supervision of any such officer.        
	This is a criminal case with a serious ramification. We have to find a competent officer to investigate it, the bench, which also included Justices P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal, said while issuing notices to the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary and the principal secretary (home).        
	The court sought their response on whether there should be a judicial probe or a CBI investigation into the scam.

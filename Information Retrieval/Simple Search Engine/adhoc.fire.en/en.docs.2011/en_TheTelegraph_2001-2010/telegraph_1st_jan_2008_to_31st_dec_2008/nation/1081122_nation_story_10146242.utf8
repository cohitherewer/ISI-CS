  - Ordinary chief minister emerges as the MP poll mascot        MANINI CHATTERJEE                          Chauhan with party colleagues Sushma Swaraj (right) and Smriti Irani in Bhopal on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhopal, Nov. 21: He does not exude the malefic machismo of Narendra Modi nor the regal persona of Vasundhara Raje nor even the avuncular air of the rotund Raman Singh next door.        
	Ironically, though, it is his very ordinariness that is proving to be chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans biggest asset  his low profile an appropriate fit to a low-key election. And by not projecting a chief ministerial candidate of its own, the deeply divided Congress in the state is only helping Chauhan emerge as the unlikely mascot of these polls.         
	Madhya Pradesh votes on November 27 but even in the last week of campaign, there is little overt fervour or excitement, no palpable sense of anger or of hope that usually characterises a major mandate.        
	Unlike in 2003, when the BJP stormed to power on the crest of an anti-incumbency bijli, sadak, paani (electricity, roads, water) wave and the battle was fought between two big personalities  the assertive Digvijay Diggy Raja Singh and the flamboyant Uma Bharti  the elections this time seem a tame affair.        
	Summing up the BJPs five-year term as nothing very striking, nothing very adverse, a top government official who has worked under several administrations said: But the one unnoticed factor is the chief ministers popularity, especially in rural areas. Ordinary people identify him as one of their own.         
	A senior police officer added: There is nothing flashy about him, nothing dramatic, but he has managed to communicate very well with the people over the last three years. He has held big panchayats of different sections  farmers, women, tribals  and formulated policies and welfare schemes on the basis of the feedback.        
	Officials may be prone to chamchagiri but even political workers  both in the BJP and the Congress  claim that the chief minister is proving to be the surprise factor in the elections.        
	If the BJPs backroom boys have been taken aback by the requests for meetings by Chauhan from every district unit of the state (he is much more in demand than national leaders, including Modi and L.K. Advani, they say), disgruntled Congress workers concede that Chauhan is a plus factor for the BJP in contrast with their own many minuses.        
	The biggest minus is that despite the experience of Gujarat and Karnataka where the Congress suffered for the lack of a clear-cut leader, the party high command has refused to anoint one in Madhya Pradesh.        
	And this in a state where the Congress has had a surfeit of sturdy satraps. True, Arjun Singh may be too decrepit and Digvijay, still licking the wounds from his humiliating defeat in 2003, may have counted himself out of state politics. But there is still the ever-ambitious Kamal Nath and the straining-at-the-leash Jyotiraditya Scindia, both of whom have been confined to their sub-regional fiefs.        
	Instead, Congress workers bitterly complain, it is the bereft-of-a-mass-base Pradesh Congress Committee chief, Suresh Pachauri, who has been calling all the shots and is the de facto chief minister candidate were the Congress to win the polls.        
	So bitter is the anti-Pachauri lobby that a senior Congress leader in Bhopal even attributes Chauhans popularity to Pachauris machinations.        
	Pachauri has never campaigned against Chauhan, never tried to expose the corruption beneath his clean image and do you know why because if the Congress loses, Pachauri wants Chauhans help to win a Lok Sabha seat from Hoshangabad in 2009.        
	Even the pro-Chauhan officials admit that if, say, Scindia had been projected as the future chief minister, he would have galvanised the Congresss still widespread if dormant base in the state and Chauhan would have been running for cover.        
	If the Congresss lack of an alternative has come to Chauhans aid, so has the turbulent history of his own party. Uma Bhartis triple combo (woman-OBC-Hindutva) was a key factor in the BJPs stunning 2003 victory when the party won 173 seats in the 230-member Assembly, reducing the Congress to just 38. But within eight months, she proved too temperamental to handle and was replaced by Babulal Gaur whose 14-month-stint was also a bit of an embarrassment.         
	Then came Chauhan and his low profile was just the right balm for a state unit riddled with factionalism for decades.        
	Chauhan has presided over the only non-Congress government ever to complete a full term in Madhya Pradesh.        
	His sole goal now is to somehow manage to win a simple majority and make history by getting a second term. The Congress, uncertain of its own fortunes, is banking on the Uma factor and the Mayavati magic to ensure a hung Assembly in a state that has stubbornly remained bipolar.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 14: Bombay High Court today upheld a decision of the civil aviation directorate placing additional workload on pilots.        
	The court dismissed a plea filed by a group of pilots challenging the decision of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to keep in abeyance a new set of rules that brought down duty hours of flight commanders.         
	They will have to fly according to the 1992 rules under which pilots have to put in a minimum of nine hours flight time within which they can be asked to carry out a maximum of three landings. In 2007, a revised circular was issued limiting the maximum number of landings to two.         
	The DGCA recently decided to re-enforce the 1992 circular, but the directive was stayed by Bombay High Court. The Supreme Court quashed the stay last month and told Bombay High Court to dispose of the petition as soon as possible.        
	The division bench of Justice R.M.S. Khandeparkar and Justice Amjad Sayed today ruled that the aeronautical information circular framed in 1992 would remain in operation till a committee appointed by the DGCA made amendments to the Civil Aviation Requirement of 2007.

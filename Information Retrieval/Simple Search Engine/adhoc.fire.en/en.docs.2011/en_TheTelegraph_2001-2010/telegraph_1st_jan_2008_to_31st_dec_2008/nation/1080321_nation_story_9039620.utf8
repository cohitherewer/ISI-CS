The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New Stephens ad, old theme
                                                                                                               New Stephens ad, old theme
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 20: St. Stephens College has advertised afresh for a principal, a month after it originally sought applications for the post, but the announcement virtually repeats the eligibility criteria that had drawn the ire of Delhi University.         
	The new advertisement also rules many candidates out from the race to become principal of the prestigious college, positioning M.S. Frank  the man backed for the post by outgoing head Valson Thampu  as favourite.         
	In mid-February, the college had advertised for the post of principal, days after the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) had declared Thampus appointment in 2007 illegal.         
	Thampu did not possess a PhD degree  mandatory for a principal under rules of the University Grants Commission  at the time of his appointment. Just days before the February advertisement, Thampu declared he had obtained a PhD in theology from the Allahabad Agricultural Institute, a deemed university.         
	The first advertisement stipulated that applicants had to be between 50 and 60 years of age, and members of the Church of North India (CNI) or an organisation in communion with the CNI. It also did not require the applicant to possess a PhD degree.         
	Delhi University dean of colleges Nayanjot Lahiri, however, wrote to St. Stephens, questioning the criteria laid down in the advertisement, and ordering its withdrawal. The age group mentioned in the advertisement is inconsistent with that prescribed by the university for the post of principal, Lahiri said.         
	Since the age of retirement is clearly stated as 65, the prescription of minimum age of 50, and maximum age of 60 is not in order, Lahiri wrote.         
	Later, in the same letter, Lahiri also reminded the college that UGC norms mandated that a principal must possess a PhD degree.         
	Lahiri also asked St. Stephens to reword the advertisement to allow non-Christians more qualified than candidates from the community to compete for the post. She suggested a stipulation that members of the CNI would be preferred over others, all other factors remaining equal.         
	Following receipt of the letter, the college withdrew its advertisement.         
	But the new advertisement virtually repeats the age qualification mentioned in the earlier announcement, stating that applicants must preferably  the word had been absent earlier  be 50 to 60 years of age.         
	Frank, the administrative head at the moment, is 55.         
	The new ad also repeats the requirement for the candidate to be a member of the CNI or an associated body.

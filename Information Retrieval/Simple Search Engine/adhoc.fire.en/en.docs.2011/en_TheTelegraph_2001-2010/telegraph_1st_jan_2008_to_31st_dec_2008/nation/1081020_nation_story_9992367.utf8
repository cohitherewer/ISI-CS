          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 19: Police today arrested a labourer in Kerala for suspected terror links after his cellphone number was found in mobile phones of militants killed in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Kerala police said 37-year-old Abdul Jaleel, who paints buildings at Kadachira in Kannur district, had been getting frequent calls from phones found on militants killed in the encounters in Kupwara.        
	On October 5, Jaleel is said to have replaced a SIM card he had been using for nearly a year. On October 7 and 10, four militants died in two encounters in Kupwara. The police found the sequence of the events suspicious.         
	Jaleel, allegedly an activist of the National Development Front (NDF), initially denied getting the calls from Jammu and Kashmir.         
	But when confronted with the details of his old SIM card, he told the police they were calls from strangers seeking details about people here. Kannur police chief S. Sreejith said the SIM details were solid evidence.         
	Jaleel had been kept under watch after the police stepped up vigil against suspected militants on the basis of intelligence alerts from Delhi.         
	Jammu and Kashmir police initially claimed that some of the slain militants in Kupwara were Malayalis after finding Kerala voter ID cards on them.         
	The police and intelligence agencies stepped up efforts to find out links of outfits like the Students Islamic Movement of India and the Indian Mujahideen in Kerala after the encounters.         
	But Kerala police later traced the voter ID cards to two persons residing in the state. They said the cards could have been forged.

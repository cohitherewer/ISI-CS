          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           The BMW that hit the bike in New Delhi on Thursday. Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: One BMW case over, another begins.        
	A BMW knocked a BPO professional and a TV channel employee off their bike today before the occupants, suspected to be the 20-year-old son of an industrialist and a lady, abandoned their car, smashed the windowpanes and fled.        
	BPO employee Anuj Singh and his companion Mrigank Srivastav were taken to the AIIMS. They were said to be critical.        
	The hit-and-run comes days after businessman Sanjeev Nanda was handed a five-year term for mowing down six persons while driving his BMW in 1999.        
	Eyewitnesses to todays 3am accident near the Moolchand flyover in south Delhi said a man was at the wheel with a woman sitting next to him.        
	Police said they had tried to speed away but a snag hit the BMWs front wheel. The car was abandoned near a petrol pump, around 200 metres from the accident spot.        
	The BMW, with a VIP registration number from Haryana, was traced to Golden Rolls Pvt Ltd, a firm owned by Narendra Kumar Bhasin of Sonepat, a Haryana town bordering Delhi.        
	The industrialist was away in China on a business tour, the police said. Sources said his two children, Sakshi and Utsav, had gone out last night from the familys Punjabi Bagh residence in the BMW and were yet to return.        
	Yes, they went out but I cannot confirm if they were in the car or if any of the staff members (working in Golden Rolls) was driving it. It was a company car, said a relative of the Bhasins. The BMW has been impounded.        
	A probe was on to find out if Utsav, said to have passed Class XII, was indeed at the BMWs wheel and whether there was anyone else in the car at the time.        
	Pronouncing the sentence on Sanjeev, the grandson of former navy chief S.M. Nanda, last week, the judge had rejected his plea to let him off on probation because he was only 19 at the time of the 1999 incident and his family had compensated the victims.        
	Todays hit-and-run coincides with a spurt in accidents in Delhi, with eight deaths, including that of two schoolchildren, being reported in the past three days.        
	Two thousand people die in accidents on the capitals streets on an average each year, according to the Union transport ministry. Trucks were involved in 21 per cent of the accidents last year, cars and auto-rickshaws in 14 per cent, two-wheelers in 10 per cent and Blueline buses, often called killers, in only 6 per cent. Delhi Transport Corporation buses accounted for 2 per cent of fatal accidents.

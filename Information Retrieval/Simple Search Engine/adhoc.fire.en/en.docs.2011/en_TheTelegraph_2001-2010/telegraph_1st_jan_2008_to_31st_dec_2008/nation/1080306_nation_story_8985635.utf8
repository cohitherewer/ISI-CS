	March 5: S.M. Krishna has resigned as Maharashtra governor to lead the Congress in the Karnataka elections. Krishna got the go-ahead from party chief Sonia Gandhi last night. He met President Pratibha Patil today to put in his papers.         
	 It is my endeavour to bring the Congress back to power, (to form) a full-fledged, stable Congress government, the former chief minister said.

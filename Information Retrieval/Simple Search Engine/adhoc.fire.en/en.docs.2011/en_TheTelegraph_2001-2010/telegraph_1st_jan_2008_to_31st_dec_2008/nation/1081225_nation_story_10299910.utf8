          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: India is expected to take up with Saudi Arabia the issue of terrorists using the Arab nations charities and other organisations as fronts to generate funds for subversive activities.        
	In a meeting tomorrow with visiting foreign minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, India is also likely to update Saudi Arabia about the alleged role of Pakistani elements in the Mumbai attacks and urge it to mount pressure on Islamabad to take action.        
	Sources said priority would, however, be given to the issue of clamping down on terrorist finances.        
	With Pakistan stepping up its propaganda offensive against India in the Muslim world, New Delhi is likely to draw attention to reports in sections of the Saudi media that have been critical of it but sympathetic to Islamabad.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to go to Saudi Arabia early next year. He was to have gone last month, but had to revise his itinerary because of prior commitments the Saudi king had.        
	Saudi Arabia, the Arab worlds most influential country that enjoys close links with Washington, has been a key ally of Pakistan and has enormous clout in that country.        
	India and Saudi Arabia signed an all-encompassing Delhi Declaration in 2006, including a pact on combating terror.        
	Al-Faisals visit will not be the first from a Muslim country since the Mumbai attacks.         
	Omans foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawai bin Abdullah was in India last week and offered support in tracking down the terrorists.

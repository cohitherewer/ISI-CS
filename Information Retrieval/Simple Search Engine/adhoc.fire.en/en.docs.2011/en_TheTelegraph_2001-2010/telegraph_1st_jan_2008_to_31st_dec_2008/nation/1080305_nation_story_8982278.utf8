	Bangalore, March 4: Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami today hinted that Karnataka might go to polls as early as May, reports our special correspondent.        
	In the city with election commissioners Navin Chawla and S.Y. Qureshi, Gopalaswami met political leaders, poll officials and senior government officers.         
	He later said the commission had drawn up a schedule where revised electoral rolls would be finalised by mid-March and redrawing of constituencies according to the recommendations of the Delimitation Commission would be over by the first week of April.         
	Only after this exercise is over, we can arrive at a definite conclusion on when to hold polls, Gopalaswami said.        
	Presidents rule in the state expires on May 28.

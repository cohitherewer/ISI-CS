          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Patna, Feb. 28: Latest political buzz in Patna involves Nitish Kumar and one Ejaz Ali, a member of the backward minority community, who is the front-runner in the race to Indias upper House.         
	Nitish sent Ali Anwar, another member of the minority community and president of the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, to the Rajya Sabha, two years ago.         
	Bihars political chessboard has been active in the run-up to the biennial election slated on April 2, when tenures, of five Rajya Sabha members from the state, ends. Those completing their tenure are Prem Gupta, Manganilal Mandal and Ramdeo Bhandari (of the RJD), actor Shatrughan Sinha (BJP) and Basishtha Narayan Singh (Samata Party). Polls will also take place against the seat of RJDs Motiur Rahman, who died recently. Thus, there are six vacancies from Bihar.         
	At least 40 MLAs in the 243-member House are needed to elect a Rajya Sabha member. Given the positions of the existing political parties in the Assembly, the ruling JD(U)-BJP combination is all set to bag three. The Opposition RJD is sure of bagging one.         
	And, if the UPA partners fight the poll in unison, they can grab the fifth seat. The JD(U) is most likely to snatch the seat belonging to Mutiur Rahman (RJD).         
	Till now, however, there are no signs of the UPA partners working towards a united fight. The LJP party of Ram Vilas Paswan, according to sources, is trying to field its vice-president Ranjan Yadav.        
	The RJD and Lalu Prasad, however is not likely to back Ranjan Yadav, a friend turned foe of the railway minister.

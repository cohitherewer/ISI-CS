          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Sept. 13: Jharkhand deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto today tried to pacify Bhushan Steel, whose officials were manhandled yesterday, saying the government would not allow a repeat of Singur in the state.        
	Mahto told The Telegraph that the government would extend all possible help to new industries and launch a drive to educate people about its rehabilitation and resettlement policy.         
	I cannot afford to have an another Singur in Jharkhand, he said over phone from Delhi. Land acquisition is a big problem everywhere and has to be handled with care and sensitivity.         
	Residents of Roladih village in East Singhbhums Potka had yesterday gheraoed three Bhushan Steel surveyors on a land identification mission for a steel and thermal power project.        
	The block development and circle officers of Potka rushed to the spot but could not rescue the trio. Police had watched the officials being heckled and even arrested them later in the evening on charges of trespassing.         
	A section of the media claimed after the incident that Bhushan Steel was planning to pull out of Jharkhand, but the firms executive director, Parasnath Singh, today said there was no question of leaving the mine-rich state.

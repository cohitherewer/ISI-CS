	B-school trio play Pepsi adviser     
	The next Pepsi product in India may bear the stamp of MBA students Supreet Kaur, Anand Trivedi and Anand Mohan Sharma.    
	The three have won themselves a chance to meet and advise PepsiCo chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi on the MNCs strategy to unlock the latent demand for beverages in India.     
	They trio, students of the Gurgaon-based Management Development Institute, won the PepsiCo Challenge called Taste the success  become Indras advisers.     
	It feels great to have won. The competition gave excellent exposure to all contestants. We are looking forward to meeting CEO Nooyi and are confident that our strategy will be implemented by PepsiCo, Supreet said.     
	The three will fly in April to the PepsiCo hub in New York, where they will present and discuss their case study with Nooyi. The runners-up, Delhi Universitys Faculty of Management Studies, received an award of Rs 1 lakh.     
	The top six teams, including one from IIM Indore, will also get a chance to appear for a pre-placement interview with PepsiCo, bypassing the initial screening process.         
	Bid to muffle House din    
	The Andhra Assembly will cease to be the bastion of free speech it has been so long if Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy has his way.    
	The rules committee of the House that Reddy headed has enlarged the definition of precincts of the Assembly to include the legislative building, lobbies, galleries, the Speakers chamber and the committee halls.     
	The amendment means dharnas or other forms of protests wont be allowed in these places. Basically, any open space enclosed within the railing and fencing has been included in the definition of precincts.    
	The law revamp was probably prompted by the sleep-in agitation by Chandrababu Naidu and his colleagues last winter. The changes also empower the Speaker to force out suspended members from the House.    
	Whistle surgery    
	Every time Justin breathed, his parents felt they were hearing the sound of a whistle. They werent wrong. A whistle it was, stuck in the seven-year-olds throat.    
	The bizarre medical case came to light when his parents, suspecting something was wrong with their child when they had gone to visit a relative in Coimbatore, put Justin through a scan-and-test procedure.    
	Doctors at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where the boy was examined, found the tiny piece of plastic lodged in the boys left respiratory tract. Apparently, Justin had swallowed the whistle while playing with a doll to which it had been attached. Justins unusual coughing alarmed everyone around.    
	Fortunately for the boy and his parents, ENT specialists R.P. Mothilal and A.R. Ali Sultan carried out an endoscopy to remove the object without losing any time.     
	The boy is fine now and is breathing without any difficulty.

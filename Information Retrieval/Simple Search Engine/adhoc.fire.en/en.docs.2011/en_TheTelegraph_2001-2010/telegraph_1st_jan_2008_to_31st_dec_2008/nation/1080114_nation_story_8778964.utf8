     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Patna, Jan. 13: The Nitish Kumar government, which so far had focused on incentives to the states women and girls, has now turned its attention to Bihars senior citizens. 
    
	Sources say that the decision was taken after a report, presented by the Bihar welfare department, revealed a vast milieu (some lakhs) of senior citizens reduced to a life of penury and gloom. 
    
	The state government has decided to open a day care centre in all districts across the state to help senior citizens and ensure a health care system for them, revealed Vijay Prakash, the principal secretary of the states welfare department.
    
	The state has started with the process and has released some Rs 2-crore as a part of the first instalment towards the centres, conceded Prakash. 
    
	The centres would contain religious books, newspapers, magazines and journals  a makeshift library  for entertainment and yoga trainers and doctors for regular health check ups. 
    
	There would be separate spaces for men and women in the centre, which would be directly supervised by the magistrate of every district, Prakash added. 
    
	Another crucial comfort that the centre hopes to provide  is clean and safe lavatories for the aged. 
    
	The officials concerned are trying to arrange for special bathrooms and restrooms where there would be no stairs and non-slippery floors, Prakash said. 
    
	After giving Bihars women and girls a lot, lets see what the state government does for us. But, if they are made at all, these day care centres would be a ray of hope for people like me, said R.C. Choudhary (74), a retired co-operative department officer, who stays alone in his Ashiana Road residence. His two sons, he adds, work outside Bihar, leaving him quite alone and vulnerable.
    
	The states government, so far, has been generous to the Bihars women. 
    
	It has reserved 50 per cent of seats in local bodies for women and has distributed free bicycles to girls (students) belonging to economically weak families.
    
	The government has also been providing financial help to fathers for their daughters marriage and has directed magistrates and senior police officers, including superintendents of police, to act tough in cases of domestic abuse and violence.

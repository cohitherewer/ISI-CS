	Sachin amp; boys, do a Bhajji    
	Mumbai Indians fans want the team to follow Harbhajan Singh  out of the IPL tournament.    
	Maybe, the win over Kolkata Knight Riders has calmed them down a bit, but the fans  named Mumbai Paltan on the team website  had been going hammer and tongs at Sachin Tendulkar and his boys before that.     
	Next time, all 27 players of MI should group together and beat up Sreesanth on the field. This way, all of them will get suspended from the IPL and save the agony of the MI fans, wrote Brajesh Mishra, referring to the Bhajji-Sreesanth slap controversy during the Mohali match.    
	Our captain is injured and an idiotic deputy has got himself suspended. Our openers have hardly lasted 2-3 overs in a match and at least one of them manages to get run out. Our pace spearhead happens to be Ashish Nehra. Do you think we seriously have a chance of winning unless Sachin is fit for the game? asked Neil Chitnis.     
	Much of the ire seems to be directed at Icon Sachin, who has not played so far because of a groin injury. I think its a waste that we have a batsman as expensive as Sachin on the bench, suggested another fan.    
	DU cant keep quota word    
	The countrys largest university cannot make room for the 27 per cent OBC quota.    
	Delhi University authorities have said they are not ready for further expansion to implement the reservation for Other Backward Class students.    
	In a letter to the ministry of human resource development, DU has said it can accommodate only 9 per cent reservation this academic session. It has also said it will need three years for the rest of the 27 per cent.    
	The ministry is yet to respond.     
	Although no DU official agreed to be quoted over the controversial decision to backtrack from its earlier commitment, sources said the university had decided it would be impossible to implement the quotas over two years.    
	Cop caught chewing cash    
	What should you do when youre caught accepting a bribe? Simple, just gobble up the cash.     
	A policeman tried to do just that, but wasnt fast enough.     
	Sub-inspector R. Chandra Kiran Reddy had been caught red-handed at the Humayunnagar police station while accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000. The anti-corruption bureau had laid a trap for him when they learnt he had demanded the bribe from Mohammad Zakariya, accused in a dowry death case. After pocketing the money, Reddy boarded a bus, the ACB team hot on his heels. When the officers finally caught up with him, the sub-inspector stuffed the cash  eight Rs 500 notes  into his mouth.    
	As he swallowed the notes, the sleuths handcuffed him and took him to Osmania General Hospital, where he was given medicines to vomit the money out. Out of the hospital, Reddy headed straight to jail.        
	Breathing space    
	Passengers huffing and puffing to catch Mumbais local trains need some more seconds to catch their breath, the train operators have realised.    
	The trains stop for only 20 seconds at big stations and 15 seconds at smaller ones. The volume of people depending on the citys lifeline has swelled, and so has the number of trains.     
	The motormen have demanded that the halt time at bigger railway stations be increased to 25-30 seconds. They say the scramble to get into the trains leads to many people falling off.     
	The passengers, especially senior citizens, have backed the demand.    
	Mumbai: Play with Clay, a workshop for kids between 6 and 10 will begin on May 16. It will be a hands-on workshop to create objects where children will learn working on the potters wheel. The fee is Rs 1,200. The workshop will be on till May 21. Timings: 11am to 12.30pm, Akshara High School, Kandivili (W).

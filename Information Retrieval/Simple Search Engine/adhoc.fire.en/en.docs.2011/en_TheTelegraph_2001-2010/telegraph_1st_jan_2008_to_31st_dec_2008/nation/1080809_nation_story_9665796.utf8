          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 8: Officials in Chhattisgarh are in a fix to locate the missing chopper of Ran Air. For, the information and technical inputs about the possible location where the helicopter was grounded are proving to be hoax.        
	Even as five days have passed, there is no clue about the Bell-430 chopper that went missing on Sunday evening within 90 minutes after taking off from Hyderabad. The chopper, hired by the Chhattisgarh government, was flying to Jharkhand when it lost control with the Air Traffic Control on the borders of Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.         
	The officials today got some vital clues from the Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper that had been pressed into service to trace the missing chopper. The IAF chopper, fitted with advanced radar, gave the information that the site was in the interior areas of Dantewada district.         
	Based on the information, security personnel moved to the area  an inaccessible terrain. But the information proved to be false, state civil aviation director Anil Tuteja said. The security personnel had to counter the Maoists, who opened fire when the team was on way to the spot, he said, adding that heavy exchange of fire took place but there was no casualty.        
	According to Tuteja, officials supervising the search operation are getting information. But on developing it, the leads are either proving false or hoax, he added. National Remote Sensing Agency has also mapped two possible spots in Dantewada district, which the search parties are verifying.         
	According to senior police officers, the entire pocket is under the influence of Naxalites that is affecting the search operation. The security personnel are moving with maximum caution to develop the information it is getting, a senior police officer in Dantewada said.        
	Ran Air, a Hyderabad-based private charter service, has announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh for giving information about the missing helicopter. The villagers coming from remote areas to block headquarters for weekly haat were also asked if they had seen any flying machine in their area. But the efforts failed to yield any results, he said.

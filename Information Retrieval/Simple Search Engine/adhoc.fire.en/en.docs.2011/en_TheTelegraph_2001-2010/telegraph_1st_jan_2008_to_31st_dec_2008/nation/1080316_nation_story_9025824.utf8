	Shimla/New Delhi, March 15: Some 44 Tibetans resumed the return march to Tibet this morning from Dehra, 56km from Dharamsala, two days after the first batch of 100 marchers were arrested.        
	Till tonight, police had not served halt orders on the 44, who crossed Kangra district and reached Una, heading for a country thrown into turmoil by two days of pro-Independence unrest.        
	Another 250 marchers left Dharamsala  the capital of the Tibetan government in exile  in the evening to join the advance group, said Tsewang Rigzin, the president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, one of the five NGOs taking part in the march.        
	The resumption of the march comes on the second day of street riots in Tibetan capital Lhasa, where a Chinese crackdown is alleged to have killed 25-30 people.        
	Delhi expressed distress at the reports of the violence and deaths. It dubbed Tibet an autonomous region of China and said the causes of the trouble should be resolved through dialogue and non-violent means.        
	On the march, the Centre said: Tibetan refugees, while they are in India, are expected to refrain from political activities and those activities that affect our relations with friendly countries.        
	Sources said Delhis position was consistent with its policy of not allowing anti-China activities by Tibetans in India. Himachal Pradesh police are waiting for the Centres instructions before halting the march.        
	The first batch of 94 Tibetan men and six women were arrested on Thursday as they attempted to cross Kangra districts boundaries in violation of halt orders served on Monday evening, hours after the march started. They have been remanded in 14 days judicial custody.        
	Like the first 100, the second group also received training in non-violent resistance and discipline at a three-day camp at Dolmaling nunnery near Dharamsala, Rigzin said.        
	The brave protests by Tibetans inside Tibet have made us more determined to see this march through to the end, said Chime Youngdrung, a marcher and president of the National Democratic Party of Tibet.

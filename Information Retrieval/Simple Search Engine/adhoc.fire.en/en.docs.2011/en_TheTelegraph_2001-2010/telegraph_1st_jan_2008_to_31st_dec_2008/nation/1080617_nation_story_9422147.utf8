The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Age takes toll of Rahul talent hunt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Age takes toll of Rahul talent hunt
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                      Rashmi Pawar       
	Bhopal, June 16: Rahul Gandhi wanted to bring transparency into party youth body appointments with a corporate-style talent hunt. It has stumbled with the choice of a state chief for the Congress student wing, said to be overage and not even a student.        
	Rashmi Pawar became head of the Madhya Pradesh unit of the National Students Union of India on May 26 after a state-wide exercise to identify the best and brightest candidate.        
	Within days of Rahul clearing the appointment, Rashmis colleagues began circulating documents that purport to show she is 28 years old, and had completed her masters in 2003.        
	Party guidelines say an NSUI leader must be a student and under 27, and Youth Congress officials should be under 35.        
	Rahul, the general secretary in charge of the NSUI and the Youth Congress, has been trying to reform the appointment processes in the two organisations, which are teeming with overage officials.        
	He had thought of the talent hunt, complete with an interview before an All India Congress Committee (AICC) panel, to send the message that an aspiring Congress politician need not bank on patronage or have a party leader as a parent. The only skills required were commitment to the Congress ideology, leadership ability, organisational skills and passion for the party.        
	Now Rashmis critics have faxed the dossier to Rahul and other AICC officials, accusing her of hiding many facts. First, they say, she was born on May 16, 1980. Second, she failed her Class X exams in 1995. Third, she is married to a Brahmin.        
	Congress sources say that had Rashmi revealed her marital status, the high command would not have crowned her since the state Congress  facing Assembly polls in November  is headed by another Brahmin, Suresh Pachauri.        
	Ironically, Rashmis appointment came after several of the other 16 short-listed contenders were denied interviews on the ground of being overage.        
	The interview panel was made up by general secretary Mukul Wasnik and secretaries Meenakshi Natrajan  who directly reports to Rahul  and Jitin Prasada, who is also Union minister of state for steel.        
	Rashmi, perceived to be close to Jyotiraditya Scindia, is determined to stay on.        
	I dont wish to comment on my age since I have been given the assignment by the party high command. However, the allegation that I am not a student is not true. I have enrolled myself for a PhD programme in Gwaliors Jiwaji University. My thesis is on the different ideologies in the Congress, she told The Telegraph.        
	When contacted, Pachauri feigned ignorance of the controversy rather than defend the appointment. I am not aware of any of this, he said about the allegations and the campaign against Rashmi.        
	Other state-level party leaders too declined to go on record.

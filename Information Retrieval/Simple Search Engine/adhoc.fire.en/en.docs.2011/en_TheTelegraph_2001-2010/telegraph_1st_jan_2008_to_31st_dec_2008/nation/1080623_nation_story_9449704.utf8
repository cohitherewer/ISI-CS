                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani aam aadmi called small man
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, June 22: L.K. Advani has of late been clear about one thing: as the BJP Prime Minister-in-waiting, he cannot pursue aggressive Hindutva politics or play the rabble-rouser he used to be.        
	The leader of Opposition sent out the same message at a media programme in Mumbai, dwelling on a constructive nation-building agenda and bypassing divisive issues.        
	Without touching on issues like the Ram temple or minority appeasement, he promised to unveil a powerful agenda for resurgent India, possibly different from the India Shining days of 2004.        
	He hinted that the new agenda would ensure a vibrant economy and energy security, support small and medium enterprises, revitalise agriculture, alleviate poverty and generate jobs.        
	Let us empower the small man, because the small man will in turn empower the nation, he said yesterday, indicating his party was eager to hijack the Congresss aam aadmi plank.        
	Voicing concern over the prevailing paralysis of governance sparked by the Congress-Left nuclear stand-off and the price rise, he said: India cannot afford a weak and wobbly government at a time when our country faces many formidable challenges.        
	He said the need of the hour was to meet the challenges to internal security and strong leadership.        
	Advani talked of plans he had to woo the youth. Our agenda will also establish a strong bond with the youth of India there will be as many as 10 crore first-time voters in the next parliamentary elections. It is our duty to ensure that their dreams are fulfilled.        
	I would like to see a revolutionary expansion in the opportunities for high-quality education at all levels, especially in higher and professional education, he said.        
	What Advani said seemed of a piece with the new language he has been speaking since stepping into A.B. Vajpayees shoes as the shadow Prime Minister. It was also significant in the light of his recent statement on the Ram temple that had set tongues wagging about his perceived makeover.        
	After watching a film on Lord Ram, Advani had said a temple in Ayodhya should be built only at his birthplace. But he had added  marking a striking change in his position  that such a temple could be built without creating communal acrimony.

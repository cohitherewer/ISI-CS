The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani shows Nano face
                                                                                                               Advani shows Nano face
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Next time Mamata Banerjee rails against the Nano, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can ask her to crosscheck with her Delhi ally L.K. Advani.        
	When I think of Nano, the worlds cheapest car from the House of Tatas, I applaud not only Shri Ratan Tatas courage and determination, but also the entire team that took it up as a challenge and succeeded, Advani today told captains of industry while promising a liberal, all-inclusive agenda when the BJP comes to power.        
	In what could be music for the communist chief minister and a jarring note for the Trinamul Congress leader, the Prime Minister-in-waiting continued: We shall encourage many more such Indian successes in the manufacturing sector.         
	The BJP leaders comments came while he was showering praise on Indian entrepreneurs, thousands of workers, managers, engineers, designers, R amp;D personnel and others.        
	Addressing a meeting of industry chamber Ficci, Advani built on his recent efforts to project a liberal image.        
	He presented his pet theme of robust nationalism in a package that bore the gloss of reforms and development. His assertions had glimpses of the Shining India mindset but offered enough space for the weak and the underprivileged.        
	The BJP leader gave the impression that he had already started looking beyond the Manmohan Singh government. Some of you may be wondering why I am talking of the future and why I am not saying anything about the government of the day.        
	The way this government has been functioning, or been non-functional and internally paralysed, there is really no need to talk much about its past or present. The people are already looking beyond the UPA government. Let me assure you that we in the NDA have been preparing for the future in right earnest.        
	Claiming that good governance, development and security will be the driving force behind the NDA campaign, Advani told the business leaders: Ours is one party that has consistently followed a policy of supporting private enterprise and voicing our opposition to the licence-quota-control regime, even in those years when there was hardly any debate on economic reforms.

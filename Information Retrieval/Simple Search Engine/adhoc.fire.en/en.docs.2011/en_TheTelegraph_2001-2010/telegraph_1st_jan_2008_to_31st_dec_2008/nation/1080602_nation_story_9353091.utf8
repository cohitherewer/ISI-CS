	Check in, take a bus and forget it    
	Taking the tube before a flight might appear like a far-off prospect in Delhi but a luggage check-in within the city and an AC ride to the airport looks delightfully close.    
	Plans have been finalised for Airport Link Express, a fleet of 300 luxury coaches that will pick up airline passengers from different parts of the city. And, like similar services in Sydney, Vancouver, Paris, Tokyo and Amsterdam, fliers will be able to check-in their luggage and forget about it. The companys staff will do the rest.    
	As the plan stands now, 20 points across the city have been identified as the places where fliers will arrive with their stuff, check them in and hop on to the buses.    
	We have decided to launch the Airport Link Express in coordination with the Delhi government to improve connectivity to the airport, Union urban development secretary M. Ramamchandran said. The target is to start the service next year so that it can be effectively used during the Commonwealth Games in 2010. It will be launched in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune later. (PTI)           
	Honour for author CM  
	The Kalaignars has succeeded in turning a new leaf in the West.    
	The University of Californias Centre For South Asian Studies has published a 1,270-page work on Tamil, titled Kalaignar Kalanjiyam (Selections from the Literary Works of Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi). Expectedly, the chief minister, referred to as Kalaignar which means litterateur, was thrilled at what he thought was one of the high points in his 70-year-long writing career. The DMK chief started when he was only 14.    
	The book was launched in the US some time back but Karunanidhi was presented the tomes first copy by David T. Hopper, the US consul general in Chennai.    
	George L. Hart, a Tamil scholar who heads the chair of Tamil studies at the university, has penned the foreword.

	Promise of sop shower  
	Andhras sop opera has just begun and with politicians promising the moon, nothing seems out of reach.    
	The cacophony started in the build-up to the by-polls  17 Assembly and four Lok Sabha seats  last month, but the freebie show could last till the general elections next year.    
	Telugu Desam offered free LPG gas to all below-poverty-line families, a waiver of all farm loans, unemployment compensation of Rs 1,000 per month and pensions of over Rs 500. Party chief Chandrababu Naidu urged farmers not to repay debts till the polls, saying these would be forgiven if Desam came to power.    
	The ruling Congress wasnt far behind, pledging everything under the sun  except the contentious Telengana statehood. The Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) lost no time in accusing the Congress of betraying the people of the region by raising slogans and doing little else.     
	An Osmania University study showed that the sops offered by Naidus party would cost the state Rs 32,000 crore, Rs 5,000 crore more than Y.S.R. Reddys free-for-all regime.          
	Mosquito alarm  
	The recent showers have put the capitals civic authorities on an outbreak alert.    
	Mayor Arti Mehra has asked the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to sensitise councillors about the prevention and control of dengue and chikungunya. She stressed the need to spread awareness among residents to prevent water from accumulating and check breeding of mosquitoes, the carriers of the twin diseases.     
	However, the officials were told to send three notices before slapping fines on any citizen for allowing the insects to breed.

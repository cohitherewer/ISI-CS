          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, April 22: The hungry, thirsty visitors had stolen in unnoticed. Twenty-one of them were spotted and stoned to death or poisoned. The rest, about thirty-odd, slunk back to their parched homes.         
	A frightening example of cynical hospitality?        
	Not really, just one more case of man-animal conflict in a summer-scorched, arid zone.        
	If last years unwelcome guests were elephants driven towards Andhra Pradeshs towns and villages from their dry, grass-depleted dwellings, this years visitors were leopards.        
	The sleek, spotted cats  some 55 of them  had entered villages and even outskirts of cities like Visakhapatnam and the capital Hyderabad in search of food and water after the summer heat dried up water bodies and drove smaller animals  prey for the big cats  out of forests.        
	Figures show the 21 leopards killed since last April were either stoned to death or died after consuming poisoned food and water placed by villagers.         
	We only planned to kill wild pigs which attack our crops, said Prabhakar Reddy, a farmer-turned-forest ranger in Anantpur in southwest Andhra.        
	State forest officials say Andhra has over 550 leopards in its forests and that about 55 were reported to have entered villages and cities since April last year.         
	The animals were either injured or killed by the frightened people, said chief conservator of forests S.K. Das.        
	Sources said the panic reaction had a lot to do with the deaths last year when 22 people were killed by rogue elephants. Though the state forest department formed a task force to send the massive beasts back to Orissa after they raided border villages in Srikakulam, they had returned to Andhra in search of food.        
	We have now planned to create an elephant reserve in the border villages and intend to rehabilitate residents of nearly 22 tribal hamlets in safer places, said forest minister Gollapalli Surya Rao.        
	A campaign has also been launched to set up check dams to ensure water reserves across the states 64,000sqkm forest zone that has 22 sanctuaries and five national parks. Nearly 12,000sqkm of forest land have been marked out as protected areas.        
	Forest officials say they are doing everything to ensure that the wild animals return to the deep forests and that includes providing sufficient food sources and water to offset the impact of the rising mercury, which has bubbled over 40 degrees Celsius this summer.        
	They have also set up cages in villages near forests to catch stray leopards and stop them from being killed by the scared villagers.        
	A 10km strip around forests has been identified as an eco-fragile zone and villagers have been told not to plant crops in this stretch.        
	A committee, including the forest minister and the chief conservator, has proposed jail terms of up to seven years or a Rs 25,000 fine if the villagers trespass on this area.

	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Divisions within the government on the funds required for the countrys flagship project to universalise secondary education are threatening to delay the scheme the UPA hopes to project as its biggest contribution to school education.         
	The human resource development ministry planned to launch the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan by October-end but the scheme may now take off only by next year, top government officials said.         
	The ministry is unhappy with the funds approved by the governments expenditure finance committee for the programme, a senior member of the committee said.         
	Confirming the concerns, ministry sources said they feared that the limited funding currently approved may restrict the universalisation plan to little more than a scheme to build new schools.         
	According to the 2001 census, Indias population between 9 and 18 is around 18 crore  the group that the scheme is likely to affect directly. At present, only about three in every five children get secondary education in India.         
	The HRD ministry is learnt to be unhappy at the poor allocation under the recurring expenditure budget and is likely to approach the expenditure finance committee again for more funds.         
	If they (the HRD ministry officials) approach us again for funds, we will consider their proposal afresh. But we will not revise our decision without some significant pondering. That means the scheme will get delayed, perhaps by a few months, the committee official said.         
	Indias plans to universalise secondary education were first announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram in his 2007 Budget speech.         
	The HRD ministry estimates the scheme will need in excess of Rs 90,000 crore by 2020.         
	The scheme is believed to be the brainchild of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In December 2007, the scheme was included in the 11th Five Year Plan.        
	Earlier this year, the Planning Commission approved the final contours of the blueprint prepared by the HRD ministry to implement the scheme.         
	In July, the expenditure finance committee also gave its in-principle approval, following which the HRD ministry drafted a note seeking cabinet clearance for the plan.         
	That note will now only be circulated after the committee takes a decision on any fresh proposal from the HRD ministry for more funds, the sources said.         
	The scheme is modelled on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan that was launched by the earlier NDA government at the Centre. It aims to provide universal primary education of satisfactory quality to all by 2010.         
	Government officials say the Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan is crucial for India to benefit from the success of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, once that scheme gets over in 2010.         
	The absence of a scheme to universalise secondary education could lead to children enrolled under the first scheme dropping out after primary education, they argue.

	Cuttack, April 28: A steady decline in fish numbers is being witnessed in the states rivers and lakes owing to unregulated inland fishing, especially during breeding season.        
	The impact of unrestricted fishing is being felt especially in the Mahanadi where there has been a drastic reduction of numbers.         
	Migratory marine fishes travel distances through fresh-water rivers such as the Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani and Subernarekha to breed and spawn.         
	Among them migration of hilsa in the past few years has reduced in the Mahanadi. Off late, this sought-after variety has nearly disappeared from its fresh-water sources and is being spotted in the sea only.         
	In case of fishes such as sea perch (bhekti) and mullets (khanga) they are also becoming increasingly rare to find in the fresh waters.         
	With majority of Orissas population having a voracious appetite for fish, more than 48,000 tonnes of fresh water fish are imported from Andhra Pradesh to meet local demand when the state is unable to meet it.        
	Fish lovers and the wildlife panel in the state believes that the situation is so intense that it warrants a two-month ban in rivers and lakes to ensure better spawning and supply.         
	Fishing during the breeding season has been banned in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments.         
	Previously, Wildlife Society of Orissa had demanded a two-month ban on inland fishing during the breeding season We have been demanding a fishing ban between June 15 and August 15. But, the government limited itself to implementing a Centre-imposed two month ban on marine fishing during the breeding season, admitted B. Mohanty, secretary of the state panel while talking to The Telegraph.         
	Periodic surveys conducted by the state wildlife panel over the past decade had revealed a fall in catch by over 75 per cent in the Mahanadi. Village fishermen living along the banks of the Mundali, Padmavati, Kantilo, Kandarpur and Banki are already feeling the pressure, said Mohanty.         
	Senior officials in the state fishery directorate said the ban issue is under active consideration. Options are being weighed, taking into consideration the possible fallout on the fishermen community, said a senior official.

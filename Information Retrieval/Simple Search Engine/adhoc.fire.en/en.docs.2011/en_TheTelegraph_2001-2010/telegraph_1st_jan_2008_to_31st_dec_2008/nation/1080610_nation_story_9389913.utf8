Distribute handbills
                            
	New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): A teenager being tried for eve-teasing has received an unusual punishment: print 500 handbills and distribute them outside a school or a Delhi University admission centre, explaining to young men why one must not behave indecently with women.        
	The court also asked Bharat, 19, to write 25 pages on topics such as how women feel when they are eve-teased and why one should not tease women.        
	Bharat, a resident of south Delhi, had passed lewd remarks at a co-passenger on a bus on July 30 last year. The woman told the court she was willing to settle the case provided the accused realises his mistake and shows some respect towards women through his attitude and conduct.        
	The accused, who is 19 years of age, has a certain thinking pattern and mindset which made him behave disrespectfully towards the complainant. This mindset needs to be changed, the magistrate said while passing the unconventional sentence and setting him free.        
	The station house officer of Chittaranjan Park will later inform the court whether the youth had complied with its directions.        
	Bharat, who could have been jailed for a year for outraging the modesty of a woman, has promised to mend his ways.

	Bhubaneswar, July 31: Encouraged by the discovery of a Buddhist site in Jajpur recently, the state culture department has now decided to begin further excavations in six more sites.        
	A team of archaeologists had found an inscribed monolithic stupa on top of the Panturi hill and several non-monolithic stupas in at Langudi, Tarapur, Deuli Kayama Hills, Neulipur, Bajragiri, Kantigadia and Panturi.         
	The names of Tapasu and Bhallika, the first two disciples of Lord Buddha, were found inscribed in Brahmi on the rocks.        
	Pilgrim Hiuen-Tsang in his many reports on Emperor Ashoka had mentioned that Ashoka had ordered the construction of 10 stupas in Odra or present day Orissa.        
	Director of the Institute of Maritime and South East Asian Studies Debraj Pradhan believes that the stupas authenticate the Chinese travellers writing.         
	Culture minister S.N. Patro said excavation and preservation of Buddhist sites are complete in Kaima, Deuli and Tarapur.         
	The department has now decided that the archaeology wing would take up the work at Deulapur, Neulapur, Bajragiri, Kantigadi, Panturi and Radhanagar  the six new sites.        
	The tourism department has been requested to declare these spots as a Buddhist tourism circuit, said the minister adding that requests have been made to works and rural development departments to provide better road connectivity.        
	Earlier, the Archaeological Survey of India had excavated a monastery and relics from Lalitgiri-Ratnagiri-Udaygiri hills located in the same district.         
	It has already been declared a Buddhist circuit.        
	Archaeological excavations are also going on at Kapileswar and Keduli, located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. A section of archaeologists and historians have been trying to establish that Kapileswar was the birthplace of Buddha.        
	Similarly, Kenduli has been acknowledged as the birthplace of poet Jaidev, the author of Geetgovinda.        
	As a part of the Buddhist circuit plan archaeologists have been asked to take up excavations at Manikpatna, Jaugarh and on the Rushikulya river basin places with a rich past also in Ganjam.

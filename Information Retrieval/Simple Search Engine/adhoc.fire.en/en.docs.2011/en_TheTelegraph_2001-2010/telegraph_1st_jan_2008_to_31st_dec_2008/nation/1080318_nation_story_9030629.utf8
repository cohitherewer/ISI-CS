The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Barabati facelift project tees off
                                                                                                               Barabati facelift project tees off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 17: Orissa Cricket Associations largest renovation project started at Barabati Stadium today with the bhoomi puja.         
	Makeover plans include expansion of the pavilion, Gallery-I and II to accommodate 50,000 visitors, around 20,000 more than the present capacity.         
	The project also aims at other infrastructure changes and is a joint venture between the state cricket panel and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).        
	After the puja today, a Cuttack-based firm began the preliminary work.        
	An upgraded Barabati Stadium is expected to have a new dressing room of international standards, an indoor hall to facilitate practice in all seasons, a swimming pool and a permanent cricket academy.        
	The stadium would be upgraded at a cost of Rs 56.20 crore and would meet international standards, said Ashirvad Behera, the secretary of the state cricket association.         
	The project will be completed with 50 per cent funding from the BCCI in two phases over a period of two years, he added.        
	The makeover is aimed at retaining the allotment of international matches in Barabati, which hosted the third ODI played in the country in January 1982, when India beat England by five wickets to lift the series 2-1. Thirteen ODIs have since been played at the venue, last of them being the India-West Indies match in January 2007.        
	Cuttack has already been chosen as a venue for one of the ODIs to be played with England in November 2008. We plan to complete the dressing room by then, the association secretary said.         
	In 2003, the state association had installed floodlights and a hi-tech multi-gym facility for players with support from the BCCI.        
	Official sources said the project cost was approved on February 24 at a meeting held by members of the state general body following the BCCIs assurance to provide 50 per cent of the funds.         
	On December 7, 2007, the state cricket panel had invited tender for the Rs 52-crore contract.         
	While 14 parties bought tender papers, only eight of them applied with the required technical and price bid, along with a security deposit of Rs 1 crore.         
	The tender process came under cloud when the price bid of a Cuttack-based company was opened on the plea that the technical bids of all other seven applicants had were below par.         
	The panels general body later investigated into the matter and finally approved the bid.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 29: Describing the Union budget 2008-09 as disappointing, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said that the Centre had failed to fulfil its promises to the state.         
	The Centre promised a special package of Rs 3,300 crore through the Presidents address to the Parliament and in the finance ministers budget speech and common minimum programme (CMP) in 2004, said the chief minister.         
	Nitish Kumar welcomed the loan waiver to the farmers, but with a rider. The loan waive will hardly benefit Bihar farmers as the volume of institutional lending in the state is little. Farmers here continue to be in the grip of moneylenders, he said.         
	The chief minister said that the state would have been happier had the finance minister lowered the interest rates and extended the institutional lending to Bihar farmers. But then its election year. The (finance) minister has presented the budget keeping in mind the coming polls, he said.         
	The Bihar Chamber of Commerce, too, has described the budget as disappointing.         
	The Union government has once again disappointed the trade and industries of Bihar. It was expected that the government will provide economically and industrially backward state status to Bihar and will frame special norms for the state on a par with Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and north-eastern states, said chamber president .P. Sah.         
	He, however, hailed the debt waiver scheme for farmers and said it would boost Bihars economy, as it is an agriculture-oriented state.         
	Leader of the Opposition Rabri Devi hailed the budget describing it as poor-friendly. The Congress, too, welcomed it. The UPA has proved that it cares for the aam admi, said senior leader Gajanand Sahi alias Munna Sahi.

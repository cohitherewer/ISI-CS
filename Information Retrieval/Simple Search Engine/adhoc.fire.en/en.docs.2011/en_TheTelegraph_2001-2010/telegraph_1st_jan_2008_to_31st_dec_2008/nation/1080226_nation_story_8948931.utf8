	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Medical colleges run by states may soon have to reserve seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes appearing in the all-India medical and dental entrance exams under the Centres regulations.        
	The health ministry has asked the director-general of health services to ensure that states reserve seats for such students in the CBSE-conducted All-India Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Test, referred to as the AIPMT, officials said.         
	Fifty per cent of the seats in state government colleges are available to students through the all-India test  others are filled through tests conducted by states. The rest of the AIPMT seats are in Centre-run colleges.        
	Each state follows its own reservation policy which, in several cases, covers all seats. Some state quotas are based on domicile status. Others, especially those in the Northeast, are related to local communities. These colleges are now being asked to follow the Centres quota policy  15 per cent for SCs and 7.5 per cent for STs  in the seats filled through the all-India test.

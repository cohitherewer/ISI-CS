The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If its Advani, it must be another yatra
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     If its Advani, it must be another yatra
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Rams charioteer is contemplating another yatra  this time to Amarnath.        
	Sources in the BJP said L.K. Advani, who rode a chariot in the early nineties to mobilise support for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, was planning to hit the road from the Ram setu site in Rameswaram to the Kashmir cave shrine.        
	The sources revealed that Advani had last week broached the idea through an important aide before top RSS leaders, but the Sangh didnt show much enthusiasm and left the decision to a later date.        
	Senior BJP leaders expressed ignorance about any plans for a yatra, saying the issue had not been formally or informally discussed at any forum. But some insiders admitted they had heard of Advanis keenness to undertake another yatra to highlight the anti-Hindu mindset of this government.         
	Sources close to the RSS confirmed the Sangh had been sounded on such a plan but said they doubted whether it would materialise.        
	Sangh leaders and even some in the BJP said they were surprised at the sudden turnaround in Advanis approach as he had been desperately trying to change his image over the past few months.        
	Sources said the leaders had taken note of the language Advani spoke at a rally last Saturday and that glimpses of the charioteer of Ayodhya fame were visible after a long time as he declared the BJP was ready to make any sacrifice for Amarnath.        
	Advani, who had in the recent past been harping on good governance, restricted his speech to Hindu sentiments and terrorism even if it was a rally to focus on problems faced by the countrys youth.        
	The Congress and some other parties have begun to think they can benefit politically by promoting an anti-Hindu mindset, he said. This is clearly evident in the recent developments in Kashmir. A similar anti-Hindu mindset was also evident in the Congress-led UPA governments approach towards the Ram setu issue.        
	This anti-Hindu mindset and the politics based on this mindset, he added, must be defeated. Which is why we wholeheartedly support the courageous struggle of the people of Jammu under the banner of the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti.         
	At the last national executive in June, Advani had talked of the challenges before the nation and focused on the powerless Prime Minister and the state of the economy. He asked party workers to reach out to every section of society, said the BJP wanted the minorities to take part in the countrys overall development, and appealed to the party to change from frontrunner to clear winner through a superior agenda of governance.        
	Clearly, Amarnath and the Ram setu were not given pride of place in this superior agenda.

	Panaji, Jan. 16 (PTI): The Congress-led government in Goa was reduced to a minority on Wednesday after the NCP and an Independent minister withdrew support.
    
	The three NCP MLAs, of whom two were ministers, took the decision even after party chief Sharad Pawar warned of extreme action if they pulled out. 
    
	The NCP ministers, Francisco Pachecho and Joace Philip d Souza, and the Independent minister, Vishvajit Rane, had put in their papers in the evening.
    
	Before the withdrawal of support by the four MLAs, the seven-month- old Digambar Kamat government had a strength of 23 in the 40-member Assembly.
    
	DSouza said they have informed Governor and the Speaker, who is the father of Vishvajit Rane, about the withdrawal of support.

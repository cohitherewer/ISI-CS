          SANTOSH SINGH                          Jabir Hussain                                  
	Patna, May 26: The Bihar Opposition RJD now finds itself in a bit of a spot after a case has been lodged against its main man of integrity Rajya Sabha MP Jabir Hussain for 78 illegal appointments during his tenure as the chairman of the Bihar legislative council in 2006.        
	On May 24, Sachivalaya police here registered a case against the former chairman and former council secretary Kapildev Prasad under IPC provisions and prevention of corruption act.        
	Patna High Court issued orders to the police station recently to lodge a case following an adverse report by the incumbent council chairman, Arun Kumar, finding irregularities by his predecessor. Kumar declared all 78 appointments null and void a few months ago.         
	One Raj Kumar Singh, an applicant for a council post, took up the matter to the high court last year.        
	In a 60-page FIR lodged by Singh, a Siwan candidate for a post in the council, it is alleged that Hussain had used his connections as chairman to appoint 78 people in Class-III and Class-IV grades in contravention of rules.        
	While political parties are refraining from commenting on the case because it is sub judice, they have started trading charges against each other.         
	RJD national general secretary and spokesperson Shyam Rajak told The Telegraph: We have full faith in the judicial system. Hussain is a renowned scholar and man of integrity. As for the case against him, we cannot say anything. Rajak alleged that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government had started a smearing campaign against its leaders and workers. NDA leaders are out to assassinate the characters of our leaders including that of Laluji and Rabriji, Rajak added.         
	The RJD leader claimed that there had been over 100 killings of RJD leaders and workers during the past two-and-a-half years, but the government had done precious little to stop the blood bath.        
	Refuting RJDs charges, JD(U) spokesperson Anil Pathak said: Rajak is imagining the figure. As for the case against Hussain, I would only say that there is hardly any RJD leader who does not have a charge against him or her.        
	RJD rule, Pathak added, was all about scams.         
	Be it fodder, medicine or coal-tar scams, the RJD regime was one of anarchy. Law will take its course against Hussain, he added.

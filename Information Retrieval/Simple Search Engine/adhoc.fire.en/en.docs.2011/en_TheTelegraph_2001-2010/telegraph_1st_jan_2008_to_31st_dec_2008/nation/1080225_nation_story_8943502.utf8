                                                                                                               CRPF stares at fake haul case
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Feb. 24: The CRPF personnel who allegedly made false claims about an RDX haul close to a spot Sonia Gandhi visited are likely to be booked by police.        
	An inquiry is under way by the police chief of Bhaderwah, where 4kg RDX, grenades, detonators and bullets were reportedly found from a Lashkar hideout ahead of the Congress chiefs visit.        
	Claims about the haul were made on Thursday night. The next morning, Sonia, along with Union home minister Shivraj Patil, met avalanche-hit families barely a kilometre away.        
	Yesterday, a fact-finding inquiry was ordered after three policemen who had accompanied the CRPF personnel denied having found the cache. There is enough evidence against them (the CRPF personnel) and they are likely to be booked soon, a police officer said today.        
	Sources said the CRPF had launched a parallel inquiry after being pulled up by the state government. Their top brass was summoned. They ordered a probe, headed by a DIG, the officer said.

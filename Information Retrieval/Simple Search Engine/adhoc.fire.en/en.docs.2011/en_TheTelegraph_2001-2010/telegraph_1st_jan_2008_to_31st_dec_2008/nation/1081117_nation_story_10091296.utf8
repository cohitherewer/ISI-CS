  - Police extend credit to students for initiative          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 16: Rarely anyone would come across a two-wheeler rider without a helmet these days in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.         
	A joint initiative of traffic police and management students has brought about the change in attitude in people here, which was beyond imagination even a year ago.         
	The series of wear helmet drives launched on January 1 with a purpose to ensure a safe and secure ride for commuters in the twin cities have been a huge success, said assistant commissioner police (traffic) Nirmal Satpathy.        
	The credits should also go to the number of management institutes who have been approaching us with fresh ideas that would sink into the public mind effectively, he added.        
	Of late, the institutes have been showing a lot of interest presenting plans before the commissionerate.         
	There are many proposals and ideas by these institutes waiting for approval and we are positive that things will improve soon, he said.        
	The recent one has been by National Institute of Information Technology, which designed boards displaying a 10-head Ravan. It reads: Ravan can afford not to wear a helmet but we cant. Besides, the institute has designed several suggestions forms, which will be distributed among people for generating public opinion. The form will have topics, including traffic police friendliness, autorickshaw problems, parking woes and road conditions in different roads in Bhubaneswar.        
	Also there has been a survey to measure the results after the launch of the helmet-wearing drive. The hugely successful No helmet? Tie a rakhi move is going on once a week. The move has girls from various management institutes across the city tying rakhi on the wrists of erring riders and urging them to wear helmets for safety.        
	Tired of conducting surprise checks and imposing fines, the police commissionerate roped in the students to spread the message of wear helmets for safety.        
	The girl students are made into groups and deployed at major squares of the capital once every week. Riders found without a helmet are made to tie a rakhi while those who wear helmet are thanked with roses. We also give them a card which read wear helmets drive safe, said Pankajini Beuria, a student.        
	There were several efforts in the past to inculcate the habit of wearing helmet but little changed. Things look fine till a few days after the surprise checks and collection of fine but the effect ceases as soon as the inspection stops. Also it is impossible to conduct checks round the year. Call it Gandhigiri or anything, but the purpose was to spread in a more appealing way, Satpathy said.        
	Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissionerate had also started collecting Rs 500 fine for riding without helmet.

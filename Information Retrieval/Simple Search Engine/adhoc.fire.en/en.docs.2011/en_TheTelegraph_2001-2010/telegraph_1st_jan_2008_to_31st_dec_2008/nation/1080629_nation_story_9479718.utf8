	Skys the limit, get two airports    
	Bangalore wants to offer fliers the best of both worlds.    
	The new BJP government recently expressed its keenness to keep the old airport, the one run by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, open for the use of public.    
	The aim is to operate short-haul flights, to Chennai, Hyderabad and Cochin for instance, from the airport and spare passengers the long commute to the new hub, Bangalore International Airport, in the Devanahalli area.    
	We have examples of cities with two to three airports, minister for IT and excise K. Subramanya Naidu said. He urged the Centre to examine the possibility.    
	Naidu said civil aviation minister Praful Patel could start negotiations with the state, which also owns a chunk of shares in the company that runs the new airport.    
	Asked if it was too early to start such talks, given that the new hub opened only last month, Naidu suggested that time wasnt a consideration for such an initiative. A scope for a dialogue exists any time. There is no bar when it comes to development, he added. (PTI)        
	Mumbai ride in Chinese coach

	Paddy battle on the tracks    
	Andhra appears to be reaping a harvest of discontent.    
	Protests swept through the state recently to demand a price of Rs 1,000 for every quintal of paddy from the Centre, which makes the purchases for ration shops.    
	Passengers suffered as the paddy protesters laid siege to the Secunderabad station, holding up trains to the capital, especially the Delhi-bound Andhra Pradesh Express. Highways were blocked in Hyderabad as well as in Prakasam, Krishna, Guntur and Nalgonda districts.    
	The agitators  the Telugu Desam, Left parties and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti  shouted slogans against the UPA government and said it had failed to come to the rescue of the states farmers, most of whom grow paddy.    
	The Centre has hiked the price for normal-grade paddy by Rs 105 to Rs 850 per quintal as an ad hoc measure this year, but an expert panel had suggested a rate of Rs 1,000.    
	We will continue the agitation till justice is done to farmers, Andhra CPI secretary A. Narayana said.        
	Water succour    
	Problem in Delhi, solution in Himachal.    
	The Delhi government has urged the Centre to speed up the construction of a dam in the hill-state to end the acute water shortage in some areas of the capital.    
	Lieutenant governor Tejendra Khanna said recently that the upcoming Renuka Dam in Himachal was critical to dissolving the citys water woes amid soaring demand.     
	e raised the matter in a recent meeting with Union water resources minister Saifuddin Soz. (PTI)

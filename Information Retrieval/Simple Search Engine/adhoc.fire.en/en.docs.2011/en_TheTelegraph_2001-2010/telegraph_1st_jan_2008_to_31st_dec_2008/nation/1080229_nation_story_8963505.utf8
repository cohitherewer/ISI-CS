          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Feb. 28: The trapped Kashmir leopard handed over to wildlife officials for a ransom of Rs 10,000 has died amid conflicting theories about the causes.        
	Six villagers have been booked under the Wildlife Act after officials registered a complaint holding them responsible for the death. They can be jailed for up to six years and have a fine of Rs 25,000 slapped on them.         
	North Kashmirs wildlife warden Mushtaq Ahmad Parsa, whose team had to pay the money to retrieve the leopard from villagers demanding government jobs, claimed the protesters had not allowed antidotes to be given to the trapped leopard.         
	After tranquillising an animal, an antidote must be given within four to five hours, but we werent allowed to. It was also kept hungry for two days, he said.        
	The leopard had been trapped on Monday in Handwaras Lash Mawar, 100km from Srinagar, but could not be taken away for 36 hours because of the protest.        
	Parsa claimed that the animal was found dead after the hand-over. The animal was first handed over to police officials in the village but our officers found it dead. Last night, we shifted it to our base in Kupwara. The post-mortem was conducted today.         
	He alleged that the villagers had shifted it to the house of a local resident before handing it over to the police.         
	Handwara police chief Haseeb Mogul, however, said the animal died while being ferried to Kupwara, possibly from a tranquilliser overdose. People are blaming wildlife officials for injecting a high dose of tranquillisers because of which the animal could not be revived.        
	He said around 3,000 people had gathered when the police went to free the leopard on Tuesday and Wednesday. It was difficult to rescue the animal. It would have created a law-and-order problem if we had used force.

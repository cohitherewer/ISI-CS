	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Rahul Gandhi may now be in sync with the grit and grime of heartland power play but he wasnt always comfortable with the idea of politics. Certainly not when his father, Rajiv Gandhi, was in the thick of it after making a reluctant debut in 1980.        
	As the Amethi MP took a walk down memory lane on the eve of Rajivs 64th birth anniversary, he recalled asking his father in 1989 why he worked non-stop in politics and did not just give it up. You didnt want to do it in the first place, Rahul had said to him.        
	Rajiv, he said, was up at 5am and continued till close to midnight, while Rahul would often turn in by 10pm. Once he was so sleepy that he mistook a cut-out of Rajiv in his room to be the person and wondered why his father was staring at him, arms akimbo, at midnight.        
	Rahuls 1989 poser came when Rajiv was campaigning in Mumbai for the Lok Sabha elections in the wake of the Bofors scam.        
	The election was Rajivs toughest. Bofors apart, he had to contend with the emergence of the BJP as the Congresss toughest adversary.         
	According to Rahul, Rajiv refused to look back. He said: No, I can never think of leaving it because I believe in the people of India.        
	His faith was partially vindicated because the Congress did emerge as the single largest party but Rajiv didnt stake claim to form a government, allowing the Opposition to cobble a coalition of the Left and the Right.        
	Rahul spoke after releasing a book, Rajiv ki Smritiyaan (Remembering Rajiv), written by panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was a joint secretary in Rajivs PMO and his special assistant from 1989 to 1991.        
	After four years as MP, Rahul said, he had realised that at the core of every programme Rajiv had flagged off when he was Prime Minister was his belief in the people of India.        
	If India has a standing outside, it is because the world believes the people of India can compete with anyone. One core idea he believed in was in every single person of India, rich, poor, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, disabled, he said.        
	This is why I suspect he looked surprised when I asked that question because he believed in the empowerment of people. Aiyarji belongs to my fathers generation. I came here to relive the past because I wanted to share my memories with him.        
	Aiyar corrected the perception that he was a close friend of Rajiv. He said he did not know Rajiv either in Doon School or Cambridge University because Rajiv was three years younger.        
	For the six years he worked with Rajiv, Aiyar said he always addressed him as Sir, though people thought they were close because he planned Rajivs meetings and tours.        
	Aiyar recalled that the only piece of advice his boss gave him was to stop giving press interviews.         
	I stopped for a few days, he said.

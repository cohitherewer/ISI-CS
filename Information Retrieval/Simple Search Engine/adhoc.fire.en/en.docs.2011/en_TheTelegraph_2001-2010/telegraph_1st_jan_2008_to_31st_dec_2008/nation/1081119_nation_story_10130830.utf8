                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahul salve on 84 wound 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi with a student at DAV Public School, Amritsar, on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Amritsar, Nov. 18: Rahul Gandhi today said the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi were wrong and that those involved should be punished.        
	The 1984 riots were wrong. People involved in the violence should be brought to justice, Rahul said in this town.        
	Rampaging mobs had killed thousands of Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere in the country after Indira Gandhi was shot dead by her Sikh bodyguards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh on October 31, 1984.        
	Indira Gandhis son and Rahuls father, Rajiv Gandhi, was then reported to have said when a big tree falls, the earth shakes  a comment widely criticised as an insensitive attempt to play down a human tragedy.        
	Today, on the eve of Indira Gandhis birth anniversary, Rahul said his family held no grudge against Sikhs.         
	There was tragedy in 1984. My mother and father hold no animosity against anybody. When my grandmother lost the elections in 1977, it was the Sikhs who had rallied behind her, giving her strength. There is no ill-feeling in the family against anybody. We are very proud of the Sikh community.        
	Rahuls comments came in the town of the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine whose storming by troops in June 1984, authorised by Indira Gandhi to flush out militants, had begun a long estrangement between the Congress and large sections of Sikhs, and led to the Prime Ministers assassination. The October-November riots worsened the relations.        
	Fourteen years later at a National Sikh Council meeting, Rahuls mother and Rajiv Gandhis wife, Sonia Gandhi, expressed anguish at the violence and said she hoped to re-establish the strong bonds between the Gandhi family and the Sikh community.         
	But the old wounds were reopened three years ago over the Congresss dilly-dallying in acting against party leaders Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, indicted by the riots probe panel.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a Sikh himself, then tried to apply balm by saying: I bow my head in shame on behalf of the government for what happened in 1984.        
	Rajnath ticked off        
	Rahul made a sarcastic rejoinder to BJP president Rajnath Singh for calling him a bachcha (child or greenhorn) in politics yesterday.        
	Yes, I am a bachcha. But so are 70 per cent of the people in India. Bachchas think in a completely different manner. Yes, I agree I do not have even half the political experience as the likes of Rajnath Singh, Rahul, 38, said.        
	The Congress general secretary was here to announce the schedule for organisational elections in the Indian Youth Congress, of which he is in charge.         
	He was accompanied by two former chief election commissioners, J.M. Lyngdoh and T.S. Krishnamurthy, whose NGO, Fame, is helping organise the elections.        
	Rahul also met students of the DAV Public School.

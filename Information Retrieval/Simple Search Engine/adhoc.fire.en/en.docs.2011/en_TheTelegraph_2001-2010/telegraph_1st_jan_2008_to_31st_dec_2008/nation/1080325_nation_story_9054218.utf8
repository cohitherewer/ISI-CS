The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eight holidays face the axe
                                                                                                               Eight holidays face the axe
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 24: Central government employees will get only 11 holidays a year instead of the 19 they are allowed now, if the Sixth Pay Commission has its way.        
	The panel has also proposed that the five-day working week be retained, womens work hours made flexible, and maternity and child-care leave increased.        
	The commission wants offices to stay closed only on the three national holidays  Independence Day, Republic Day and Gandhi Jayanti. Staff will also have eight restricted holidays  allowing them to celebrate festivals of their particular community while those from other groups work.        
	Many of these festivals  such as Diwali and Id  are now classified among the 14 gazetted holidays when offices remain closed as on the three national holidays. Besides these, employees now have two restricted holidays they can choose to use.        
	The panels report says all 14 gazetted holidays should be scrapped and the festivals included under the restricted holiday list.        
	We agree that festivals should be restricted holidays but not just eight days. How will the government determine which festivals should attract the restricted tag? said K.K.N. Kutty, secretary-general, Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers.        
	The report backs the five-day week saying it helped women balance work and home better. In all the developed countries (the) five-day week is almost universally in vogue, it says.        
	Womens core working hours should be 11am to 4pm, with the freedom of coming up to one-and-a-half hours earlier or leaving up to two hours late. But the panel conceded that a biometric entry and exit system may be crucial to this arrangements success.        
	Another of its suggestions: schoolteachers, librarians, laboratory assistants and principals be allowed leave on half pay like others.        
	Central government staff are entitled to 20 days half-pay leave a year, eight days of casual leave and 30 days of earned leave. They are also allowed study leave and extraordinary leave. The panel wants no change in the casual, half-pay and earned leave structures.        
	It wants maternity leave extended to 180 days from 135, and child-care leave to two years from one. The second can be taken to bring up children  or when they are sick or have an exam  but not if they are above 18.

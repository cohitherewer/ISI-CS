	Houston, June 15 (PTI): A Sikh who was allegedly sacked by Walt Disney World for wearing a turban and lacking the Disney look has sued the company for $1 million, claiming he was discriminated against because of his religion.        
	Sukhbir Channa, 24, who also sports a beard, filed the suit in the Hillsborough county circuit court in Florida.        
	Channa said he was hired as a seasonal college musician for parades and atmospheric performances. He was initially allowed to wear a red turban in place of the red beret other musicians wore.         
	However, the lawsuit claimed Channa was later removed from the atmospherics because he lacked the Disney look and was given only menial tasks.

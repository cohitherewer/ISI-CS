          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Kishan Maharaj                                  
	Lucknow, May 5: Pandit Kishan Maharaj, the tabla maestro who died late last night, never wanted to stay away from his beloved Varanasi for long.         
	Where can I get the Ganga elsewhere? he would tell those who would often ask why he wanted to remain in a city which, apart from its cultural and religious heritage, had little else to speak of.         
	The 84-year-old tabla artiste, honoured with the Padma Vibhushan, died at a private hospital around 11.45pm. He had been admitted to the hospital on April 29 following a paralytic attack.         
	Maharaj was one of the last exponents of the famed Benares gharana of tabla playing. Like Ustad Bismillah Khan before him, who, too, had refused to part ways with Varanasi despite its infrastructure inadequacies, Maharaj had accepted the fate of the city as his own because it had made him what he was.         
	Bismillah Khan, widely regarded as the artiste who gave the shehnai international recognition, had insisted on remaining in Varanasi because staying away from the city deprived him of the ras (creative energy) the place is known for.        
	Varanasi, though a destination for foreign tourists, is known for its urban decay with its potholed roads, chaotic traffic, poor quality of drinking water and abysmal healthcare facilities. Little wonder then that most from the younger generation who have trained in the Benares gharana have chosen to move out because of greater opportunities.         
	There is no one to match his (Maharajs) talent now in Varanasi. There are many from the Benares gharana but who will now talk about Varanasi? said Pandit Chamanlal Mishra, a vocalist of the Benares gharana.         
	Maharaj, who spent over half a century in Varanasi, gained international fame because of his ability to play cross rhythms and any kind of accompaniment, be it with the sitar, sarod or dhrupad.         
	He wove magic on the tabla, said the maestros grandson Subha Maharaj.

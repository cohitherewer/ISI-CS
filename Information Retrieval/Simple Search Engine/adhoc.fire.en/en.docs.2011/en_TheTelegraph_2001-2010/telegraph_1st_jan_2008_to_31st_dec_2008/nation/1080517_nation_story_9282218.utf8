	Bangalore, May 16: Operators of the new international airport at Bangalore today said it would start functioning from May 23 but were silent on the fate of the existing facility.        
	The Bangalore City Connect Foundation, an NGO fighting to keep the old airport open, said the government was ignoring public opinion. The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to consider citizens plea to keep the existing HAL airport open as accessing the new one, 40km from the city, could be difficult.        
	It is an anti-growth approach, anti-competition move, said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 23: A Christian priest and a nun were found trussed up and strangled in a hermitage in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand last evening, with police today blaming robbers.        
	The state Congress, however, has drawn a parallel with NDA-ruled Karnataka and Orissa where Christians have come under attack from Sangh parivar activists.        
	It looks like the motive was robbery. The belongings of the two were scattered in the two rooms, said Manoj Aswal, the investigating officer. We are still open to other possibilities but so far no evidence has been found to suggest it was not a murder for gain.        
	Some officers, however, suggested the attackers may have deliberately thrown the belongings around to mislead investigators.        
	Father Samuel Francis, 60  locally known as Sadhu Aste  and Sister Mercy, 35, had been living at the hermitage, Samarpanalaya, for the past 20 years, officers said. They were the only two missionary residents of the building at Chhota Rampur village, about 30km from Dehra Dun.        
	Caretaker Mohammad Hasan had found the two rooms barred from inside since Saturday but dared not knock. By Monday, he was worried enough to inform the local church authorities, who called the police.        
	A police team broke the doors open to find the missionaries dead, their bodies tied with ropes. The rear windows were broken, indicating the attackers used them to enter and leave.        
	The post-mortem report says both were strangled, officer Aswal said.        
	One wing of the hermitage was used as a guesthouse by the local church, but there were no guests at the time of the murder, the police said.        
	Father Francis was from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, and Sister Mercy from Lakshmipur near Delhi. Their bodies will be taken to Meerut for the last rites.        
	Christian organisations in Dehra Dun have condemned the twin murders and demanded protection in the light of the Orissa and Karnataka violence.        
	Congress spokesperson Surendra Kumar alleged the BJP government was out to unleash a reign of terror in Uttarakhand and demanded a judicial probe.

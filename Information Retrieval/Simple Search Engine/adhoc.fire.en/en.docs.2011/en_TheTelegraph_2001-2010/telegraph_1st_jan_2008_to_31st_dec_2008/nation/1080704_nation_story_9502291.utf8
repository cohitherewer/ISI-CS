          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           The faces familiar during the political flux of the 1990s but which faded soon after were back in the limelight on Thursday.

	New Delhi, July 3: America has sent another reminder that time is running out for the nuclear deal and that the 123 Agreement, along with the IAEA safeguards and the NSG waiver, should reach the US Congress in September for it to go through during the Bush presidency.        
	US congressional delegation leader Gary Ackerman, who met the Prime Ministers special envoy on the nuclear deal, Shyam Saran, and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, said India would have to speed up the process.        
	The calendar of the American Congress is running quickly and time to get the deal through is getting shorter, he said.        
	Asked if he thought the deal could be implemented during the Bush administrations tenure, Ackerman said it would depend on the Indian government getting it ready on time. If they do it on time, we will be prepared, he said. I do not know if India will be ready by September.         
	If Delhi is not ready by then, the matter cannot be put on the agenda of the US Congress during the remaining calendar, said the New York Democrat, who is also chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee on the Middle East and South Asia.        
	Asked if it was already late now, he said: It is never late till it is late.        
	India has the first bite of the apple. India has the first right to deny. We have a calendar. The calendar is running quickly.        
	Ackerman and the five members of his delegation were briefed on New Delhis efforts to implement the deal at the earliest.         
	The US Congress will break for session in September and meet again after the presidential poll process, he said, making it clear the deal would have to be taken up by the next administration if India fails to complete the next two stages  the IAEA safeguards agreement and a waiver from the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group  by August.         
	We had been hopeful that the processes will move quickly... (but) the processes have moved slower than we had hoped because of obvious reasons, he said.         
	Ackerman, however, said the fate of the nuclear deal would not affect bilateral relations and the US would continue to be friends with India. The delegation is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

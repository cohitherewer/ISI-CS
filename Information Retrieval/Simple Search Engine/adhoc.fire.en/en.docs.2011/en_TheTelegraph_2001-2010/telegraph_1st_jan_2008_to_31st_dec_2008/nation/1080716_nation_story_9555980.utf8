                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blow to Swamy on Nalini appeal 
                                  
	Chennai, July 15 (PTI): Madras High Court today declined to permit Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy to implead himself as a party to a petition filed by Nalini, a life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, saying he is not a necessary party to the proceedings.        
	Nalini has sought premature release from prison.        
	The court, however, permitted Swamy to participate in the proceedings and make his submission as an intervener.        
	Swamy had apprehended that the state and the Centre might collude with Nalini in not opposing her petition.         
	But Justice S. Nagamuthu said: It is baseless, unwarranted and deserved to be rejected.        
	On July 11, Nagamuthu had reserved the order on the petition.         
	Tamil Nadu advocate-general G. Masilamani had requested the court to reject the petition as it was devoid of any merit and was based upon Swamys mere apprehension.        
	Swamys counsel, G. Rajagopal, had submitted that the matter was of serious public interest as it involved assassination of a former Prime Minister.        
	But Nalinis counsel, Doraiswamy, had contended that Swamy had no locus standi to implead himself in the petition.         
	Nalini, serving life imprisonment in the case, had moved court after her plea for release on the ground of good conduct and having completed over 17 years in jail was rejected by the Tamil Nadu government.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 28: State commission for women chairperson Namita Panda would probe into the rape allegations on Congress MLA Subal Sahu.         
	I will visit the victim soon and probe all angles in the cases, Panda said today.        
	The MLA from Bijepur in Bargarh has been accused of raping a woman on pretext of giving her a job.         
	On May 25, the woman and her husband had reached Barpali police station complaining against the MLA.         
	A case was registered and the woman was sent for medical examination.         
	According to the FIR, she and Sahus wife hailed from the same village in Jahrsuguda district and were childhood friends.         
	They continued to be in touch even after marriage and both the families were close to each other.        
	The victim had approached Sahu after he became an MLA asking him to help her get a job. Sahu had apparently asked her to accompany him to Bhubaneswar on the promise of arranging her a job where he allegedly raped her.        
	This continued whenever he visited her home in Barpali, she alleged. The victim recently met the legislator to enquire about the promised job. However, Sahu apparently insulted and threatened her.        
	Following this humiliating episode, the woman had revealed everything to her husband and the duo had reached the police station to lodge the complaint, Bargarh superintendent of police Sanjib Panda said.         
	Refuting the charges, Sahu said that it was a conspiracy by the opponents and meant to trap him as the elections was close.         
	The Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee started an inquiry into the charges. Sahu, however, said that he was ready for a crime branch probe too.

          JOHN MARY AND PTI                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 25: The mystery shrouding the death of a Catholic nun in Kerala 16 years ago deepened when a retired police officer who had prepared the inquest report was found dead today.        
	A suicide note blaming the CBI for his death was found near the body of V.V. Augustine, a former additional sub-inspector of police, in his house at Chingavanam, near Kottayam. His wrists were slit.        
	The note said: The CBI is responsible. It also contained instructions regarding inheritance of the family property.         
	The CBI, which is investigating Sister Abhayas death  her body was found in a well at St Pius X Convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992  had earlier this month arrested two priests and a nun for her alleged murder. Yesterday, it had obtained a statement from Augustine, the first police officer to reach the scene of crime.         
	There was speculation that Augustine, 62, would be picked up for further questioning and could end up being named an accused. He had been subjected to brain-mapping in 2007.         
	Augustine had approached an advocate to secure an anticipatory bail, but there was no progress on it because he had not followed it up.         
	The police, who had initially investigated the nuns death, had declared it a suicide. But on a petition by Abhayas father, Thomas Areekara, the high court directed the CBI to take up the case in 2003. Since then, the CBI has filed three closure reports saying the nun was murdered but the suspects could not be found. The court refused to accept this and ordered the CBI to probe further.        
	Augustine was under the cloud as his inquest report, which suggested the nun had committed suicide, conflicted with the one given by the fire services personnel who brought Abhayas body out of the well.

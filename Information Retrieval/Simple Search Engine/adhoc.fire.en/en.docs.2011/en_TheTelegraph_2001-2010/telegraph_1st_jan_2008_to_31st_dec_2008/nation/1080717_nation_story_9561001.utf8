          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani                                  
	Mumbai, July 16: Anil Ambanis private jet has flown into an air pocket, a fortnight after two of brother Mukeshs private planes were seized by customs for alleged evasion of duty.        
	The air intelligence unit of Delhi customs today reportedly issued a notice to Reliance Transport and Travels Pvt Ltd for evading import duty on a Bombardier BD-700 Global Express aircraft.        
	The Rs 150-crore Bombardier plane was acquired by Anil last year for use by Reliance Travels, a non-scheduled operator that charters flights, but has apparently been used for personal travel.        
	According to the rules of the Central Board of Direct Taxes, an aircraft imported for chartered use has to pay a 10 per cent duty only. But if the plane is meant for personal use, the duty goes up to 18 per cent.        
	Sources said the customs notice to Reliance Travels has asked for payment of Rs 37 crore as import duty on the Bombardier.        
	As per rules, if he fails to respond or pay up, the plane will be seized and a huge penalty will be slapped, a customs source said.        
	Anils fleet comprises a Falcon 2000, a Falcon 7X and the Bombardier.        
	Many private importers of aircraft register themselves as non-scheduled operators to pay lower duty, but use the planes for personal travel.        
	The CBDT and the Delhi air intelligence unit are scrutinising 250 planes that are likely to have evaded taxes. Mukesh Ambanis planes were the first to be seized. In all, 10 seizures have happened, which include planes of GMR, the Oberoi Group and Indiabulls, said a source in Mumbai customs.         
	Customs officials in Mumbai said Mukeshs planes were seized because Reliance Industries Ltd  in whose name the two planes are registered failed to respond to their queries.         
	The planes are all imported through Delhi, so all relevant notices and seizures are decided from there. We have not seized any plane of Anil Ambani, nor are we aware of any seizure notice so far, said G. Ravindranath, additional customs commissioner of the Mumbai air intelligence unit.        
	An official of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group was quoted by PTI as saying: RTT (Reliance Transport and Travels) is a valid NSO (non-scheduled operator) permit holder and has responded and furnished full and comprehensive documentation regarding its aircraft.

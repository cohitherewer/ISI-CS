The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pained Maya threatens to snap support
                                                                                                            Pained Maya threatens to snap support
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Feb. 10: A pained Mayavati has threatened to withdraw support to the UPA government to protest the fake charges being hurled at her and her family.         
	The Bahujan Samaj Party chief, who has been criticising the Congress-led Centre at rallies in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, renewed her attack in Madhya Pradesh today.         
	As soon as the states (Uttar Pradeshs) budget session gets over (on March 10), our party will rethink whether to extend support to the UPA government or not, Mayavati told a sizeable crowd here.        
	Attempts are under way to register cases against my aged parents and other relatives. Opposition parties are raking up fake cases against me to mount pressure, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister added.        
	On Rahul Gandhi spending a night at a Dalit villagers house in Amethi, Mayavati said such gestures would not be enough to win over the weaker sections.        
	This will not work. This will not suffice, the BSP leader said, urging the bahujan samaj to be cautious about such gimmicks.        
	The Congress scoffed at Mayavatis threat, saying her withdrawal of support would have little bearing on the survival of the Manmohan Singh government. The UPA has 217 MPs, in a House of 543, apart from the 60-odd members from the Left parties, which support the coalition from the outside.        
	Digvijay Singh, the AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said his party did not view Mayavati as a threat or a challenger at the national level.         
	The BSP is a UP-centric party. She (Mayavati) can be a spoiler, not a winner. In the Lok Sabha polls, she will not get as many votes as she did in the UP Assembly polls. She won the state primarily riding on an anti-incumbency wave against the Samajwadi Party, he said.        
	Mayavati, however, insisted that the UPA was worried about the BSPs widening mass base. She told grassroots workers this was why it had been mounting pressure on her by reopening the Taj corridor case.         
	She alleged that the UPA and the BJP were together in trying to curtail her rise. Jealous of the BSPs growth, Opposition parties are raking up fake cases against me to mount political pressure. First, the BJP raised the Taj corridor case, and now the Congress-led government is trying to reopen it, Mayavati said.        
	Times change, and when trouble reaches the doorsteps of Opposition leaders kin, they will comprehend my pain. Attempts are underway to register cases against my aged parents and other relatives. However, I am least perturbed as the respect and courage I receive from the BSP will be lifelong assets, she said.        
	I ask the Opposition parties to refrain from personal attacks as it is not a good tradition for healthy politics.

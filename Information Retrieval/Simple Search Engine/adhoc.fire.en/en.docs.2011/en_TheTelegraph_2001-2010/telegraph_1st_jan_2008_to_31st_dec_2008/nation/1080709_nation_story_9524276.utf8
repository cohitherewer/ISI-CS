          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaya Prada and Jaya Bachchan at the meeting. (Prem Singh)                                  
	Lucknow, July 8: Two Samajwadi Party MPs today declared they would not back the nuclear deal or the UPA government while seven others too skipped a party meeting in Delhi called by Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	Mohanlalganj MP Jai Prakash Rawat said he had boycotted the Delhi programme where Mulayam met the partys Lok Sabha members and then announced that all of them would vote for the government on a trust motion.        
	The compromise with the Congress and the nuclear deal serves neither the interests of all communities in the country nor those of the party, Rawat said in Lucknow, implying the Indo-US agreement was anti-Muslim.        
	The Samajwadi MP from Muzaffarnagar, Munnawar Hasan, said: The Delhi meeting is an eyewash since the decision (to back the deal) has already been taken.        
	Seven other MPs stayed away from Delhi, mostly pleading illness, but Rawat claimed they had all boycotted the meeting and that even some of those who attended it were opposed to the party line.        
	At least 12 MPs are protesting against the nuclear deal, the four-time Samajwadi MP told a news conference.        
	Hamirpur MP Rajnarayan Godalias supporters said he had skipped the Delhi meeting because he was ill, but other party sources suggested he was meeting BSP leaders.        
	A Samajwadi leader, speaking from Delhi, suggested that those voicing opposition to the deal were motivated by self-interest. They are speaking the language of Mayavati. They seem to be tutored by the BSP government.        
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati is believed to have offered BSP tickets to Samajwadi MPs if they quit their Lok Sabha seats and their party.        
	Veteran MPs Reoti Raman Singh and Mohan Singh cited poor health as the reason for their absence in Delhi. Sources said that having protested against the nuclear deal when the party was against it, they didnt want to make a U-turn.        
	The other absentees include Raj Babbar and Beni Verma, who have been aggrieved with the party leadership long before its change of heart on the deal.        
	This evening, the lone Jan Morcha Party MLA, Dharmpal Singh, close to Raj Babbar, merged his party with the BSP. Asked if Raj Babbar might join the BSP, he said: Not as yet. But anything is possible.        
	Shia scholar Kalbe Jawad, member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, met Mayavati this evening with 21 other clerics. They are expected to launch a campaign against the deal, sources said.        
	Other than the nine who skipped the Delhi meeting, two Samajwadi MPs are in jail.

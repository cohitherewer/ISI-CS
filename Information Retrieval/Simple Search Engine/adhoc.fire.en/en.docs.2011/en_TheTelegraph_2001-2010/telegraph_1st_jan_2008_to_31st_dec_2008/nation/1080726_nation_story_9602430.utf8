          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Soren in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 25: Shibu Soren is getting impatient for a payback, three days after he helped the Centre win the trust vote.        
	He has bargained hard for the coal ministry and is eyeing minister of state portfolios for at least two of his five Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MPs, sources said.        
	Pressure is being stepped up on the UPA, of which the JMM is officially a part. Guruji, as Soren is called by party workers, has not only asked that the Centre recognise Jharkhand as the countrys coal capital but also iterated his demand for a Greater Jharkhand, carved by adding parts of Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Orissa to the existing state.         
	Jharkhand gives more coal than any other state, so the headquarters of coal companies should be there, Soren said.         
	The Prime Minister may not have finalised his cabinet expansion but Sorens flock appeared increasingly restless. It seems the government has still not finalised the coal portfolio for him, complained a JMM MP.         
	As coal minister, Sorens past tenures have been brief. His run in the NDA lasted only two months. The stint in the UPA was cut short in 11 months after he was chargesheeted in a murder case. His jail terms are hard to miss, though. Suffered imprisonment on several occasions, his bio-data on the Lok Sabha site says.        
	The Dumka MP is also eyeing the tribal affairs ministry, sources said.        
	On Greater Jharkhand, Soren said the Centre must look into the historic demand but, realising the claims impracticality, added that the identities of the tribals in the area are important even if that (expansion) werent possible.        
	Soren has another demand: Assams tea tribes, many of whom are his backers, be recognised as Scheduled Tribes.

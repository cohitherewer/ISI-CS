          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, April 21: Dalit men are fleeing a Madhya Pradesh village to escape the wrath of the upper castes after one of them smoked a bidi when a Thakur was being cremated.        
	The women of these 15 households are camping in Jabalpur city seeking police protection.         
	Markand Devaskar, the Jabalpur superintendent of police, admitted that FIRs against nine persons had been lodged at Belkhera police station near Biharipura village, where the incident happened. But he denied that the Thakurs had chased the Dalits away. There are some complaints and we have taken action but there is nothing like Thakurs forcing the Dalits out of the village, Devaskar said.        
	But Hakki Bai, whose husband and son have fled, insisted that the Thakurs do not behave properly with them. It is not just this incident. They do not allow us to fetch water and we are forced to carry our shoes on our heads while passing their houses.         
	She said Devaskar owed her an explanation on where her husband and son had gone. So far, no arrests have been made.         
	Hakki Bai said some Thakurs had attacked her mud house on April 13 just after the cremation and thrashed her husband. He was told to leave the village with a warning not to show his face again, she said.         
	The provocation, she said, was the sight of a Dalit smoking without seeking permission during the cremation of a Thakur in Biharipura, about 300km from Bhopal.        
	Another Dalit woman, Chakori Chaudhary, said the communitys men had been forced to leave. I want justice. I want to go back, she said.        
	Jabalpur district Congress chief Naresh Saraf said a fact-finding team would be sent to the village in Jabalpur district. We will take this matter to the highest level, he said.         
	State BJP leaders and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan declined comment.        
	Dalits in Madhya Pradesh have traditionally voted for the Congress, but the Bahujan Samaj Party is courting them. The Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls are due later this year.         
	The incident has come to light on a day the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment, Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan, told the Rajya Sabha that Madhya Pradesh recorded the largest number of atrocities against the SCs and STs in 2006. A total of 5,711 cases under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, were registered in the state.

	Kozhikode, April 28 (PTI): The IIM in Kozhikode has put on hold its fee hike plan following a directive from the HRD ministry.        
	In view of the directions from the central government-appointed review committee, we have put the decision on hold, institute director Krishna Kumar said today.        
	The institute had earlier said it would increase the fees for the postgraduate programme from Rs 1.5 lakh for the first year and Rs 1.9 lakh for the second year to a uniform Rs 3 lakh from this academic year.        
	Kumar said the IIMs board of governors would decide in a week on implementing quotas for Other Backward Classes from the June 2008 academic year. We are discussing the issue and a decision will be taken soon. Maybe in a week or so, he said.        
	Kumar said he had urged the HRD ministry to allot more land to the institute so that it could offer better facilities.

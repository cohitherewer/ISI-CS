          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 28: A Nepalese watchman and his two adult sons were arrested in Mayurbhnaj district bordering Bengal for allegedly sending an SMS to a Calcutta television channel warning them about twin blasts.        
	Fifty-five-year-old Gokan Bahadur and sons were arrested late last night after a communiqu from the intelligence agencies alerted Orissa police.         
	Bahadur is a Nepalese citizen who has been living in Bahalda town of Mayurbhanj for 30 years, some 350km from Bhubaneswar.         
	Panic gripped Calcutta after a private news channel claimed to have received an SMS threat that mentioned that Indian Mujahiddin, the outfit that claimed responsibility of the Ahmedabad serial blasts, was planning twin blasts in Bengal.        
	The SMS was sent from a BSNL number in Orissa and the call was traced to Bahadurs cellphone. We arrested the trio, Mayurbhanj superintendent of police Dayal Gangwar told The Telegraph today. Police said that Bahadur worked as a watchman in Nesco, a private power distribution company. The accused are being interrogated at an undisclosed location.

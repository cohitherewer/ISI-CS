                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Panel for law to save farmland
  - Agricultural plots should be taken over only as a last resort        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: A House panel has recommended framing a law to protect prime agricultural land and said acquisition of such plots for industry should be the last resort.         
	The law could be drafted on the lines of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, said the committee, which examined the Land Acquisition Bill, 2007, on Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjees reference and tabled its report today.        
	The findings, advisory in nature and therefore not binding on the government, have come at a time Trinamul Congress-led protests against acquisition of land in Singur are being blamed for the exit of the Nano project from Bengal.        
	Land rows have also stalled projects elsewhere in the country  from Noida, where farmers protesting inadequate compensation were killed in police firing two months back, to Maharashtras Raigad, where Anil Ambani wants to set up a power plant and Mukesh Ambani an SEZ.        
	The panel has suggested the entire land acquisition be carried out either by the private firm that wants the land or by the government.        
	The 2007 bill sets a ratio of 70:30, which means the company setting up a project has to acquire 70 per cent of the land, with the rest being taken over by the government.         
	Stung by protests, states have been trying to keep themselves away from acquisitions, preferring to let companies buy the land directly from their owners.        
	To avoid controversy, we have suggested that 100 per cent acquisition be done either by the government or the private party, Kalyan Singh, the panels chairman, said.        
	In Singur, 997 acres had been taken over by the Bengal government and leased to Tata Motors.        
	Singh, explaining the need for legislation to protect farmers, said agricultural land should be acquired for industrial projects as a last resort, only in situations where infertile or fallow tracts were not available.         
	On compensation, Singh said the sum should be based on market rates. The value of the land to be acquired should be calculated as the highest price in sale deeds in the area over the preceding three years, plus 50 per cent of that sum.        
	The panel also suggested that before a land-acquisition notification was issued, a body at the appropriate government level should be set up to consider and approve the optimum size of land for the project.        
	Once land is taken over, no change in its public purpose should be allowed, the committee said, as such modifications defeat the purpose of the acquisition.

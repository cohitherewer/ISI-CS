          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: Bombay High Court today set up an interim panel to hear out citizens suggestions on fighting terror, discuss them with the government and draw up its own list of recommendations.        
	The panel, to be headed by retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, will have to forward its report to the court in six weeks. It is independent of other committees and will not interfere with the ongoing Mumbai attacks probe.        
	The court set up the panel after six petitioners filed PILs on beefing up security at private buildings after the Mumbai attacks, improving electronic security, blocking access to sensitive installations on Google Earth and evolving a mechanism to battle terror.        
	One of the petitioners, the Society of Indian Law Firms, had appealed for such a panel. The court has ordered that its first meeting be held next Friday at the state secretariat.        
	The panel is expected to have 25 members, including the Maharashtra director-general of police, chief secretary, finance secretary, home secretary and prominent Mumbai citizens.        
	Others likely to be on the panel include Indian Hotels chairperson Krishna Kumar, Mumbai sheriff Indu Shahani, HDFC chairperson Deepak Parekh, security expert Raghuraman and cyber security expert Vijay Mukhi.        
	The names of Rajiv Patil, the president of the high court bar association, and M.V. Garad, the regional director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Kalina, have also been suggested.        
	Srikrishna, 67, who will head the panel, was a Bombay High Court judge from 1990-93. He was then appointed to inquire into the 1992-93 Bombay riots.        
	He was chief justice of Kerala High Court in 2001 before being appointed a Supreme Court judge a year later. After his retirement in 2006, he headed the sixth central pay commission.        
	Earlier, the court questioned why the government-appointed State Security Council had not met even once since its formation on December 2 and why six members of the public had not been appointed to the council.        
	State advocate-general Ravi Kadam said the appointments had been held up by formalities relating to the change in government and because of the legislatures winter session.        
	The state and the Centre outlined steps they had taken to fight terror. A decision has been taken to locate NSG units in hubs like Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Calcutta, the Centre informed Bombay High Court in an affidavit.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: According to the carbon dioxide baseline assessed by the Central Electricity Authority, all thermal power stations in the country are expected to add 1,073 million tonnes of the gas to the atmosphere every year.        
	The Orissa chapter of CII today met here to discuss a few areas that would help reduce green house gas emission. As in March last year, Orissa had 1,865MW of coal-based thermal power stations with a generation capacity of 1,865MW. The state government signed MoUs with different developers to install about 20,000MW thermal power plants which would be commissioned by 2012.        
	This does not include the capacity of captive power plants, which would be installed by various industries especially in the steel and aluminium sectors.        
	Reports said that even if 20,000MW coal-based thermal stations are installed in Orissa by 2012, they would generate about 1,40,000 million units of electricity and emit about 152.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year to the atmosphere.        
	The excessive presence of carbon dioxide is warming the planet and driving the global climate change. It also becomes the cause of excessive thunderstorm and lightning, said one of the experts. In Orissa, the official death toll because of lightning in 2006 was 202. This figure rose to more than 300 cases during 2007 and during this year its already 150. If this figure is compared to the death toll 10 years ago, it was less than 100 and thus the danger because of global warming and climate change could well be conceived.         
	Coal is and will remain a vital part of global energy source but we need to cut down carbon dioxide emission by increasing efficiency of existing power plants using clean coal technologies, said Suresh Mahapatra, state energy secretary.

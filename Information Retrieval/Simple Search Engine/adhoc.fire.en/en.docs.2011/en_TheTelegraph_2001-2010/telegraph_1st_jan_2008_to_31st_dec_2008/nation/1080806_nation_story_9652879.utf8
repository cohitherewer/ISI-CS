          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Text messages will continue to be banned in Jammu for the time being, the Supreme Court said today, staying a high court order that had restored the service.        
	Text messages have been banned in the troubled region since the midnight of August 3 to check rumour-mongering.        
	The authorities had also directed two local channels, Take 1 Channel and JK Channel, to stop beaming provocative and inflammatory content but it was withdrawn later.         
	The high court had lifted the text message ban till the next hearing on August 8 and asked the authorities to treat press identity cards as curfew passes.        
	The high court order had come on a public interest plea filed by the Bar Association of Jammu, which argued that the curbs on text messages and channels violated the freedom of speech. It had also challenged the move not to recognise press cards as curfew passes.        
	In the apex court today, Jammu and Kashmirs advocate-general said the power to issue curfew passes lay with the state. The court cannot assume this power. He promised such passes for all media crew who applied for them on the basis of their IDs.

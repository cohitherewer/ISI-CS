The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 1,000 rally behind anti-Posco stand
                                                                                                               1,000 rally behind anti-Posco stand
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 1: Activists of anti-displacement organisations and Left-wing parties today expressed their solidarity with the anti-Posco protesters by attending the Vikalpa Vikash Samavesh near the proposed project site defying the prohibitory orders.         
	Police detained around 1,000 activists for violating orders clamped by the administration a couple of weeks ago. However, no incidents of violence were reported even as the protesters, who outnumbered the police deployed in the area, laid siege to the Balitutha area, the main access point to the plant site.         
	Members of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, an anti-displacement body spearheading the agitation, vowed to stop Posco from coming up with its steel plant at the proposed site.         
	The government and Posco should see reason after todays rally and should not proceed with the construction, said the association president, Abhay Sahu. Sahu said they had urged the government to lift the prohibitory order and remove the barricade to facilitate todays rally. But when the administration and the police refused to listen to us, we had no other option, he told The Telegraph.         
	Leaders of mass movements, including Bharat Jana Andolan president, B.D. Sharma, expressed their solidarity to the anti-Posco movement and decried the governments stand.         
	If the steel plant is allowed to be set up at the present site, it will affect the livelihood of more than 20,000 families and destroy the eco-system, said Sharma demanding withdrawal of the project.

	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Mayavatis threat to arrest a Congress MLA has provoked the party into a joint protest with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh, but Congress sources are hesitant to talk of a new alliance.
    
	The Congress, which has a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe vote bank in many parts of the country, is wondering if it can afford to be seen as an ally of parties considered anti-Dalit.
    
	Asked if tomorrows rally in Muzaffarnagar, 150km from Delhi, was the beginning of a loose coalition against Mayavati, state Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi said: You can interpret it in whatever way you choose.
    
	Party sources ruled out an immediate and durable understanding with the Samajwadi Party, saying: Its not just a question of Uttar Pradesh, we have to consider the wider ramifications.
    
	The Congress realises the threat the Bahujan Samaj Party poses to its Dalit base the country over, having all but gobbled it up in Uttar Pradesh.
    
	But we wonder if aligning with forces like the Samajwadi and Rashtriya Lok Dal (Ajit Singhs party), who represent powerful intermediate castes, is the answer to fighting Mayavati. We have to protect our Dalit turf, a party official said.
    
	The man at the centre of it all, Congress lawmaker Pankaj Mallik, is alleged to have beaten up a Dalit district development officer on Thursday after accusing the official of deliberately blocking the release of his MLA funds.
    
	Mallik has gone into hiding but Mayavati has set up a police team to hunt for him and threatened to get him booked under the SC/ST harassment law.
    
	When Malliks locally powerful father Harinder, a former aide of the late Chaudhary Charan Singh, called tomorrows rally, local leaders of the Samajwadi Party, RLD, Bharatiya Kisan Union (of Mahendra Singh Tikait) and even the BJP said they would participate.

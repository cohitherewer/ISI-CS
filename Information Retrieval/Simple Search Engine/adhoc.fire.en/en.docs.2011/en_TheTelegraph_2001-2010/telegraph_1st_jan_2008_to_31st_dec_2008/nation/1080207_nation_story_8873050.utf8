The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Port and airport on Buddha wish list

	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Bengal has urged the Centre to salvage a deep sea port plan gone adrift, speed up Calcutta airports revamp and offer a war chest to fight bird flu.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee put the demands on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs table today. At the end of the talks, focused on how the Centre could help boost the states development, he invited Singh to lay the foundation stone for JSW Steels plant at Salboni in East Midnapore in March.        
	Bhattacharjee said the state should be given a free hand on the deep sea port, which hasnt gone beyond the drawing board after years of lobbying the Centre. Singh promised to discuss the matter with shipping minister T.R. Baalu.        
	Bengal is considering a public-private partnership for the project. Several companies, including the Jindals, are keen on it. The firm has been asked to carry out a study. Videocons Venugopal Dhoot has also shown interest.        
	The project is hanging fire over the appointment of a consultant. The state wants to scrap the norm of selecting a consultant and would rather directly seek bids from developers.        
	The Calcutta Port Trust, under the Union shipping ministry, wanted the deep sea port to come up in its own area, at Sagar Island, but the state preferred to pick the best location.        
	There are fears that the CPT, which would lose business if a new port came up, is dragging its feet on the plan, though the shipping ministry has publicly backed the project.        
	On Calcutta airport, the chief minister urged the Prime Minister to intervene and start the revamp that was supposed to begin last month. The work hasnt begun. It should begin soon, he said after the 30-minute meeting.        
	More central funds have been sought to fight bird flu. The demands include loan waivers for poultry farmers, cash to pay compensation to the families affected by the culling and money to cover the estimated Rs 500-crore loss suffered because of the outbreak.        
	Later in the evening, Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said the Centre could announce one package for the bird flu-hit farmers in Bengal and another for the poultry industry in the rest of the country. The relief could come in the next eight to 10 days.        
	Pawar pointed out that the situation in Bengal was different from Maharashtra, where the virus struck in 2006, because of backyard poultry. The number of birds in a family is limited. Families are also very poor. Thats why we have to see what type of package one has to provide.

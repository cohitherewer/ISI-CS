          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Uma Bharti at a news conference in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 14: Predicting a split in the BJP before the general elections, Bharatiya Janashakti Party president Uma Bharti today said her party would gain from it.         
	Bharti, who was in the city to attend a party programme, said the ensuing Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan would be a litmus test for the BJP.         
	Her other predictions included a hastened split in the BJP after the Assembly polls and a large number of disgruntled party men, including a few big shots, would join Bharatiya Janashakti Party, said the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.         
	Bharti claimed that some senior BJP leaders, including former presidents, were keen to join her party. However, she refused to disclose their names. The BJP rebel ruled out the possibility of her returning to the BJP and said there was a conspiracy to float rumours about her homecoming. I have never tried to get back to BJP after April 28, 2006, when I launched my party, said one of Indias most fiery politicians.         
	The saffron-clad seer-cum-politician said her partys campaign would be launched from Puri after a brief puja of Lord Balaram at the Jagannath temple. Her party, she added, would field candidates in all 147 Assembly seats in Orissa in the coming elections.         
	Responding to a query, she admitted that she was not averse to talking to the Congress or even the Left parties, provided they support her party on Ram Setu, Ram temple, conversion and cow slaughter issues.         
	On if she would negotiate with the Biju Janata Dal, an alliance partner of BJP in the state, there was an emphatic no.         
	If they plan to have pactwith us, they may approach us, said Bharti.         
	The former Union minister, however, added that she strongly supports Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaiks stand on the Nalco disinvestment issue.

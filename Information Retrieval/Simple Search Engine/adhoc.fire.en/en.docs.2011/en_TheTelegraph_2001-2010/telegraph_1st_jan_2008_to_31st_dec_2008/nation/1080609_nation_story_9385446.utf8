          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, June 8: First the good news.        
	Last month, the World Health Assembly at Geneva said it hoped India would be the first polio-endemic country to eradicate the most virulent P-1 virus.         
	Two days ago, on June 6, a 12-year-old in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh, was declared afflicted by the virus.        
	Yesterday, district health officials came to know of another case. Polio had also afflicted two-year-old Salim, though it was a less virulent type of the virus, P-3.        
	Salim and Ujjma, the 12-year-old girl who showed the first symptoms on May 4 and went for a stool test 10 days later, are among the 251 polio cases India has so far recorded this year, 17 of them from the heartland.        
	Last year, 873 cases had been reported in the country.        
	A website of the Global Polio Initiative says 11 new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 251. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 14 May from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Immediately after Ujjma was declared afflicted with the P-1 virus, doctors and health officials from the anti-polio campaign visited her home in Badaun, 350km from state capital Lucknow.        
	This is the first case of P-1 virus infection in Uttar Pradesh this year and the sixth in the district in the last 10 years, joint director, health, Habib Sahaswan, said yesterday.        
	Additional health director Nigar Sultana, who also visited Ujjmas house, told reporters that the father of the girl  now admitted to a medical college  had said she had not been vaccinated.        
	The detection of the polio cases has come barely a month after the WHA called on India to intensify large-scale mop-up vaccination campaigns to interrupt the final chains of polio virus transmission, given the very low levels of P-1 in South Asian countries.        
	India, delegates at the Geneva assembly had said, needs to keep up its pugnacious efforts to combat the P-1 virus.        
	Some even said they were confident India could be the first of the remaining polio-endemic countries to wipe out the P-1 virus that paralyses five times more children than the P-3 does.        
	A state official said though a P-1 victim had been found, the spread of this virus had largely been contained.        
	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), P-1 cases in India had come down from 646 in 2006 to 80 in 2007.        
	The WHO unit in Uttar Pradesh said besides Ujjma, four P-1 cases had been reported from the country so far, one each from Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Delhi.

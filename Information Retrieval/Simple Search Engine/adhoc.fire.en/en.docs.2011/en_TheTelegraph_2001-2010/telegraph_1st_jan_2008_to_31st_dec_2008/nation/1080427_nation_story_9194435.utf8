	Manali, April 26 (PTI): Ten civil aviation officials and the crew of an aircraft had a miraculous escape today when four tyres of the plane carrying them burst while landing in Himachals Bhuntar airport.        
	The 70-seater Avro aircraft of MDLR Airlines had come here for route- checking before the start of a regular Delhi-Kullu service.        
	The Chandigarh-based airline has been allowed to fly the route from Monday.

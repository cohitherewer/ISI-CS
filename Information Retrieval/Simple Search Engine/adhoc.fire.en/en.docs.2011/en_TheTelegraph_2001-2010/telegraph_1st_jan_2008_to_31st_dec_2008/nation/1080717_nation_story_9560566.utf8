          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, July 16: Defence minister A.K. Antony has ordered an inquiry into a complaint by a lady officer that she was harassed by her seniors but the army has called the allegation baseless and has insinuated that she was psychologically weak.         
	The army had begun an investigation on its own but the ministers order today overrides that. A fresh court of inquiry is likely to be set up.         
	The officer, a captain with the Army Service Corps posted in Kalka, Haryana, sent a written complaint on July 13, saying she was harassed by three seniors after she was allotted married accommodation  dwellings meant for families. She is not married.         
	She was transferred to Kalka from Misamari in Assam in October 2007. In December, she asked for allotment of quarters meant for married personnel for compassionate reasons.         
	On occasion, my parents and sister used to come and live with me there. However, this irked the three officers and they used to force me to throw them out. If I did not pay heed to them, I was sent on duties at far off places, she said. She also alleged that she was under house arrest.         
	The army has strongly refuted the allegations. Allegations of physical and mental harassment levelled by captain (name withheld) of Kalka-based ASC battalion against her superior officers are baseless, the army said in a press release.         
	On June 30, the officer was asked to move to Pathankot to command a detachment of her unit. She accepted the order but later requested for its deferment till July 11 citing personal reasons. On July 11, she was again asked to move when she requested that she be allowed to move the next day. But on July 12, the captain refused to move to Pathankot, thereby disobeying legal and legitimate orders.         
	The army release added that in her last posting at Misamari, too, the officer had refused to obey orders. When she was questioned, then, too, she alleged mental harassment. An inquiry was conducted and disciplinary action was contemplated but she was let off because of her young age and pleas by her mother.

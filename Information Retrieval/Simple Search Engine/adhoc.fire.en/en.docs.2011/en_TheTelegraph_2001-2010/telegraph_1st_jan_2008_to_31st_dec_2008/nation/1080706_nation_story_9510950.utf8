	New Delhi, July 5: Sonia Gandhi is expected to set up a mechanism soon to thrash out the details of a pre-poll alliance in Uttar Pradesh with the Samajwadi Party, a party source said.        
	The Congress is keen that negotiations with the Samajwadis begin fast so that the contours of the partnership are clear by September. The party is also looking at Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) as a possible ally in the state.         
	The RLD is expected to support the government in a trust vote in Parliament.        
	It is desirable to have a seat-sharing pact with the Samajwadis and the RLD, said Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Congress had identified 29 seats, including the nine it won in 2004, as winnable by virtue of polling over a lakh votes in each. Sources said it was likely to demand 30 of the 80 seats.        
	Asked about the proposed alliance, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said: Nothing formal has started. It depends on the attitude of the two parties and the confidence-building measures they put in place.        
	He cited national security adviser M.K. Narayanans briefing on the Indo-US nuclear deal and the Prime Ministers quick response to the clarifications the Samajwadis had sought.        
	He said more confidence would be infused if the government promptly acted on the partys economic demands.        
	Samajwadi sources said they expected the political nitty-gritty of the proposed Uttar Pradesh alliance to be worked out directly between Mulayam Singh Yadav, Amar and Sonia. They said that whenever Amar had raised the matter with the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh had said Sonia alone would take a call on it.        
	Asked if the envisaged alliance might spell the end for the Congresss re-energisation blueprint in the heartland, a party source said: Our overall plan is to contain the communal forces. Of course, whenever national parties align with regional forces, they stand to lose. But some decisions have to be taken to meet political expediency.        
	The Congress also felt there was no point fighting all the 80 seats without an organisation in place.        
	Rahul Gandhi had publicly criticised the alliance the Congress had with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the 1996 elections as a sellout. Sources admitted the experiment was a disaster but drew a distinction between then and now.        
	Then we had an organisation in place. We gave away that organisation to the BSP. Today we dont have that kind of an organisation.        
	The Congress-Samajwadi tie-up may be extended to Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Maharashtra.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Manmohan Singh is being pressured by a section of the Congress to make a statement on the Jamianagar encounter in Parliament.        
	The Congress leaders want the Prime Minister to present details of the evidence police have gathered so far, principally from the cellphone records of Mohammed Atif Amin, one of the two suspected terrorists killed in the shootout.        
	Sources said the UPA allies would first be shown the evidence in the next few days so that they were on board before the Prime Minister spoke in the House. Some of the partners, like Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, Sharad Pawar and Amar Singh, have sought a judicial probe into the shootout that came after the Delhi blasts.        
	The sources said that while the Congress was prepared for the worst from the Opposition, it was expedient that the UPA did not expose the differences in its ranks.        
	Delhi police have shared the evidence they have with cabinet ministers and senior leaders who had questioned the veracity of the encounter, hoping they would be convinced.         
	But barring one, all these ministers continue to sound doubtful. They say if the evidence is indeed foolproof, why did the police sit on it all this while instead of presenting it before the media as Mumbai police had done when they apparently cracked Indian Mujahideens technological brain?        
	The Congress is awaiting the Prime Ministers response when he meets the partys minority cell members tomorrow. The meeting was scheduled today but had to be called off because of an emergency session of the cabinet committee on security.

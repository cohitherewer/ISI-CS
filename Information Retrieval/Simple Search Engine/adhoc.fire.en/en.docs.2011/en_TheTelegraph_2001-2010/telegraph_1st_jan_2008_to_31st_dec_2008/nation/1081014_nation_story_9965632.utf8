The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Order stayed, Maya targets Sonia rally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Order stayed, Maya targets Sonia rally
          OUR BUREAU                          Sonia in New Delhi on Monday (PTI)                                  
	Oct. 13: The Mayavati government this evening refused permission to Sonia Gandhi to hold a rally at the site of a railway coach factory, hours after a court froze an order to cancel land allotment for the plant.        
	Congress leaders in Delhi would not confirm whether Sonia would proceed to Lalganj in Rae Bareli, her constituency, tomorrow as scheduled following the district administrations decision to clamp prohibitory orders.        
	Sources said she could hold some form of interaction with party workers and people on the outskirts of Lalganj but added that chances of a public meeting appeared remote.         
	District magistrate Santosh Kumar Srivastava said the Congress rally had been disallowed because of the prevailing law-and-order condition.        
	Congress workers indulged in violence and workers of rival political parties are also gearing up for protest. The law-and-order situation is not conducive enough for a political rally, the district magistrate said.        
	State Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said Sonia would visit Rae Bareli. If she is not allowed to hold a rally, she will meet people, attend a health programme in another block and, after interacting with voters, will return to Delhi.        
	Earlier in the day, Allahabad High Court froze the state governments order cancelling the land allotment for the coach factory.        
	In its order yesterday  a day before Sonia Gandhi was to flag off construction  the state government had said the 400 acres belonged to the gram sabha and that local farmers would create a law-and-order problem if it were given to the railways.        
	But farmers from Rae Barelis Lalganj and Dalmou, where the factory was to come up and create 10,000 jobs, hit the streets this morning and petitioned the high court against the government order.        
	Sonia scrapped her visit to her constituency today and the bhoomi pujan was called off, but her party proclaimed moral victory and called tomorrows rally to protest Mayavatis attempt to snub the Congress chief.        
	The Lucknow bench of the high court passed an interim order for status quo on the land following petitions by Northern Railway and two farmers from Ahar village. A two-judge bench fixed the next hearing on October 22, giving the state a week to file a counter-affidavit.        
	A Northern Railway spokesperson said: We have submitted all relevant records to show the land acquisition was perfectly legal.        
	Hundreds of farmers held sit-in protests against the governments order in various blocks of Rae Bareli this morning. Giridhari Jain, a farmer from Sekhwapura village in Rae Bareli, said: The youngsters are extremely angry at being deprived of job opportunities.        
	The villagers are seething. The Mayavati government painted a wrong picture of the local situation. No one was unhappy over the land acquisition by the railways, Akhilesh Pratap Singh said.        
	So the farmers hit the road and demonstrated in front of the district magistrates (DMs) office since the order cancelling the land allotment was based on his report.        
	 The state government acted on the basis of the Rae Bareli DMs report. There is no politics in the move. Well abide by the court order, said Vijay Shanker Pandey, principal secretary to the chief minister.        
	Secretariat sources say the land belonged to the Union agriculture ministry and lay virtually unused before the railways asked for it in February 2007. On May 30 this year, Mayavati got the plot registered as gram sabha land.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cross-vote jitters in BJP
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cross-vote jitters in BJP

	New Delhi, July 16: A section in the BJP is less than enthusiastic about the party leaderships efforts to topple the government.         
	Many MPs will cross-vote. Apart from the talk of moneybags, those members who fear denial of tickets in the next election may choose to settle scores, a very senior BJP leader said.         
	The BJP is the worst placed because finalisation of tickets is in an advanced stage in many states. The list of candidates for Uttar Pradesh was held back last Saturday after the top brass realised that MPs denied tickets could defy the party whip.        
	The BJP is now trying to win over its disgruntled MPs. While the suspension of Rajkot MP Ballabh Bhai Kathiria was revoked today, the party is working on another Gujarat MP suspended by Narendra Modi, Sombhai Patel.         
	The fate of Babubhai Katara, suspended after being found guilty of human trafficking, hangs in balance because the Speaker had barred his entry into the House.         
	There is uncertainty also over whether Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is not keeping well and has kept away from all political activities, will take the trouble to come for the vote. Officially, party spokespersons say Vajpayees presence will depend on his health on the day of voting but many leaders feel there are many questions to be answered.        
	If Vajpayee is well enough to attend Parliament, there will be queries why he is not contesting from Lucknow. If he contests, there will be the issue of leadership. Then, there is the question whether he wants to pull down the government on the nuclear deal. He has not issued any statement, one leader said.         
	The BJP is also grappling with differences among its allies. At least two Akali Dal MPs are said to be upset with their partys decision to vote against the deal, the reason Parkash Singh Badal has refrained from issuing a whip. There are rumours of dissent in the Biju Janata Dal and Shiv Sena, too.

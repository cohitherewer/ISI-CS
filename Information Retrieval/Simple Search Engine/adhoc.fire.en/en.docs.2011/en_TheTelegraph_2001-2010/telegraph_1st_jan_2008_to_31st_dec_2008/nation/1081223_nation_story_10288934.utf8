          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 22: Andhra Pradesh Assembly Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy today accepted the resignation of six Telengana Rashtra Samiti legislators and disqualified three others, all of whom were facing charges of rebellion against their party.        
	Opposition parties described Suresh Reddys decision as a choice between suicide and death penalty for the rebels who seemed to be preparing for greener political pastures with the ruling Congress.        
	The Speakers judgement came after an 18-month legal exercise and four months before the expiry of the MLAs terms. The Assembly polls are scheduled in April-May 2009.         
	The TRS had moved a disqualification petition against the nine legislators for defying the party whip and backing rebel candidates during the February 2007 legislative council election and associating themselves with the Congress since then. The TRS petitioned the Speaker, demanding their disqualification.         
	Suresh Reddy said that only three members were disqualified under paragraph six of the tenth schedule for backing the rebel candidatures.         
	The six others who submitted their resignations yesterday  before the Speaker finalised his decision  escaped disqualification.         
	The Opposition parties, including the Telugu Desam, TRS and the Left parties, alleged that the drama enacted by the Speaker had been scripted by chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy to force the TRS to come to an understanding with the Congress instead of aligning with the Opposition.         
	The TRS  protesting the delay in carving out a separate Telengana state  had distanced itself from the Congress alliance. The rebels, most of whom had won in the Telengana region, aimed to return to the Congress. The nine rebels are now associate members of the Congress.        
	To deliver the best judgement, I held 22 sittings with the petitioners and complainants, besides studying earlier experiences of legislative bodies and court judgments, Suresh Reddy said, defending his decision.

          OUR BUREAU                                        Lalit Modi    
	Dec. 8: The BJP defeat in Rajasthan could be a blow to Lalit Modi, the man behind the Indian Premier League, who was close to outgoing chief minister Vasundhara Raje.        
	It comes at a somewhat worrying time for the 45-year-old businessman and cricket official, the current marketing whiz of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Relations have soured between him and Sharad Pawar, Indian crickets strongman and election-winner Congresss ally, and the Mumbai attack has hung a cloud over international cricket in India, threatening the BCCIs money-spinning power.        
	Still, in Rajasthan, the scion of Modi Enterprises enjoyed strong backing from Vasundhara, to whom he had unbridled access unlike BJP-RSS workers.        
	Many would see the hand of Modi, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) chief, in Vasundharas decision to lease Jaipurs Sawai Man Singh stadium to the BCCI for 30 years, which became a talking point in the elections.        
	Since 1947, the stadium had been hosting the flag-hoisting ceremony on Independence Day and Republic Day but now the venue has been shifted to stadiums in Jodhpur, Ajmer and Udaipur.        
	The affront to Rajasthans history and tradition angered the states conservative voters. Especially since the entire cabinet would be taken to the new venues on a junket every January 26 and August 15, and given a three-day vacation.        
	Initially, the scion of Modi Enterprises was a conduit between the chief minister and some BJP leaders but in recent years, they began complaining that he too had grown out of their bounds.        
	Before the elections, Vasundhara had hired a public relations firm through Modi to project her. But instead, the company officials acted as couriers, carrying messages from the BJP office to Vasundhara or Modi.        
	With the regime change, many would like to settle old scores with Modi. The Rungtas, an influential Jaipur family whom he threw out of the RCA, are believed to be close to the Congress.        
	Modi, however, has done wonders at the RCA by refurbishing the stadium and building a world-class academy, so it will be difficult to topple him on home turf.        
	Such forward-looking moves and ambition, however, can backfire. Some among the BCCI brass think Modi may have become bigger than the board. As IPL chairman, the suave Modi hogged much of the limelight  The Times, London, said he had changed the landscape of cricket  and the impression gained ground that the league was Modis show, not a combined BCCI effort.        
	Modi would be on a stronger wicket if he retained the proximity to Pawar he enjoyed two-three years ago  but they had probably come together just to oust common enemy Jagmohan Dalmiya.        
	The alliance wilted around mid-2007 when it became clear that Pawar, then BCCI chief, would get the board constitution amended to create the post of president-elect and would back Shashank Manohar for the job.         
	Modi questioned the move, and the BCCI split into two camps, I.S. Bindra backing Modi and Manohar (the current president) allying with N. Srinivasan (secretary).

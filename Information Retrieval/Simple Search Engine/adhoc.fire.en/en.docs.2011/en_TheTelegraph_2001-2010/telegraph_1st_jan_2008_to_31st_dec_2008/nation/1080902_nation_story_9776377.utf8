                              At Delhi Universitys faculty of management studies, going on a date can prove expensive, literally.     
	Recently, 10 boys at the B-school put under the hammer a chance to date them at an auction organised to generate funds that will be sent to NGOs like Deepalaya, which runs schools for poor children. The highest bidder was a young lady who agreed to part with Rs 4,000 for a dinner date with Nikhil Jain, one of the boys. Another date went for Rs 2,000. Others were cheaper.     
	The FMS social service cell, Vaahan, has been holding the silent auction, where students put under the hammer obscure articles over the past two years. Auctioning dates, though, is a first. Seniors auctioned their notes, hostel furniture and exam tips. One offered Salsa classes, another a guided trip of old Delhi. A gossip session was also on offer.     
	The event helps break the ice between freshers and seniors, said Pavitra Gupta, a second-year student. Earnings at the auction jumped from Rs 21,000 last year to Rs 65,000.                       
	The security ramp-up after the blasts appears to be hitting a blind spot.    
	Two members from the minority community who had to come to the Lord Muruga temple in Tiruchendur recently to ward off their evil planets were detained for questioning.    
	The duos presence came to light when police checked the records of temple cottages the day before as part of the alert after the Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts.    
	Abdul Rahman, from Pazhayapettai in Tirunelveli, and Mohammad Ali said they wanted to offer prayers on their astrologers advice to ward off planetary effects.    
	Not only did the two have clean antecedents, they were also found to be related to a top official of the state government. The duo had enough reason to doubt their astrologer who warned them of their planets but not the temple trouble. (PTI)                  
	Last months serial blasts have triggered a security alarm at malls.    
	Many prominent arcades have decided to invest in cutting-edge equipment. Others have moved to recruit more people with armed forces and commando backgrounds.     
	A frission of fear had coursed through the citys malls after the July 25 chain explosions, with rumours about the plazas being targeted adding to the panic among customers. The next few days saw a drop in footfalls.    
	Officials rushed to calm the jangled nerves. We asked retailers not to close shops, said an official of Forum, which now has systems to defuse bombs. Around 65,000 visitors arrive here on weekends and 35,000 on weekdays.    
	Kuriakose, a retired colonel with Bangalore Central Mall, said his team traced the owner of a parked car sending out a foul smell. It turned out that his quilt kept in the vehicle had been just dry-cleaned.     
	At Garuda Mall, which has over 25,000 visitors on weekdays and over 75,000 on weekends, similar systems are in place. (PTI)                      
	This was one thing the individuals in black robes couldnt stay.    
	Delhi High Court took its long-expected technology leap recently with the installation of a WI-FI Broadband and Centrax (Intercom) facility within its premises.    
	Chief Justice A.P. Shah inaugurated the services, which will allow laptop-carrying lawyers to use free Net services.     
	MTNL executive director A.K. Arora, whose company provided the connections and wired the building, promised the court uninterrupted services.               
	MUMBAI: This Tuesday, you can make time for Namak Mirch, a hilarious dramatisation of four short stories by the famous Pakistani satirist Shaukat Thanvi. The venue is Juhus Prithvi Theatre. There are two shows, at 7pm and 9.30pm.

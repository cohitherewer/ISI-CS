The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tax sleuth shoots his mouth off, hits arms dealers
                                                                                                               Tax sleuth shoots his mouth off, hits arms dealers
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, March 10: A tax investigators big mouth drew the CBI to the perfect setting that led to the dramatic arrest of the Nandas, the controversial arms dealers, sources said today.        
	The CBI had disclosed yesterday that Suresh Nanda, his son Sanjeev Nanda and their chartered accountant Vipin Shah were arrested on Saturday while they were negotiating a bribe with an Indian Revenue Service officer, Ashutosh Verma.         
	It was Vermas conduct, more than the Nandas, that led to the arrest of the father and son, an officer said. Although Sureshs arrest in the Barak missile deal was imminent, he landed in the net sooner than expected, a CBI officer said.        
	According to the sources, Verma had been under electronic surveillance for more than six months because of his suspicious conduct following raids on the Nandas. It was suspected that he had not disclosed to his department all the documents seized, and that he was negotiating with the Nandas over their price.        
	Verma apparently was heard boasting to someone on phone that I wouldnt have earned in my lifetime even 10 per cent of what I got in this deal. The CBI had since then been hot on his heels.        
	The agency knew that Verma had taken leave and gone on a holiday to Goa with his wife, and that Shah had informed him about a room booked for him at Mumbais JW Marriott. All four were arrested from the hotel room.        
	We could not have asked for a more perfect setting, an officer said. The Nandas were in the room with their loyal chartered accountant, and the IRS officer was there, along with the draft of the investigating report he had prepared to submit to his department.        
	It was a crucial meeting, probably the last before Verma would submit his report to his department. According to our information, Verma had already been paid over Rs 1 crore and he was to get a couple more to help the Nandas out of the mess.        
	Suresh and Sanjeev were questioned today at the CBI headquarters in Delhi. The duo were then brought face to face with Verma, a 1999-batch Indian Revenue Service officer and now a deputy director.        
	Another CBI team tried to crack data from nine computers and laptops seized after the arrests. The agency had also found three electronic chests.        
	We will probably reveal some information in the court tomorrow when the four are produced, the CBI officer said.

	Cuttack, Sept. 18: The government may be claiming that the situation in Kandhamal is under control, but it has not been able to convince at least 15 families staying in a makeshift shelter in Cuttack for a fortnight now.        
	Most of them are reluctant to return home, as they feel their lives are still under threat.        
	The 100-odd people from Gunjbadi gram panchayat in Kandhamal have been living in a private building that has been turned into a shelter home in Peyton Sahi.         
	We are safe here. We will not return home till peace is completely restored, said 48-year-old Simon Nayak.         
	His wife Swarnalata Nayak, who had accompanied her husband along with two daughters and son from Pirigada village, nods in agreement.         
	They are among the 15 families who fled from the riot-hit district and found accommodation in Cuttack after spending days in forests.         
	Ironically, 10 days ago Governor M.C. Bhandare had assured the families that they could get back in the shortest possible time, may be within a week from tomorrow when he came to visit the relief camp.         
	He also assured the people that they will be completely safe in their houses. However, to most of the refugees, his words were hollow.         
	The families had initially fled to nearby forests, after assailants who had been protesting the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23, torched their village under Gunjbadi gram panchayat. But, hunger and thirst forced the families out of the forest after three nights.         
	Afraid of returning, they turned towards Nuagaon block headquarters relief camps, only to decide to move to Cuttack later, some 300km away, when the Nuagaon camp was attacked, too.         
	We will not be safe. The assailants will turn up, said Narayan Digal. His wife Susama Digal agrees.         
	Sanatan Nayak (35), who is at the shelter home with his family, including his 60-year-old mother Sivajini Nayak, also believes that they are no longer safe in their own homes.        
	At the Cuttack shelter home, there are 93 people from the same village, while some 30 others have taken refuge at their relatives homes in the city.         
	The Peyton Sahi Relief Committee members, who voluntarily took up relief work since September 4, are anxious and unsure of how many more days they would be able to continue their operations without any help.        
	Meanwhile, another 23 people from Kandhamal have turned up at the home over the past few days. We are expecting more people in the next few days, said Kamal Chandra Pradhan, the head of the committee.

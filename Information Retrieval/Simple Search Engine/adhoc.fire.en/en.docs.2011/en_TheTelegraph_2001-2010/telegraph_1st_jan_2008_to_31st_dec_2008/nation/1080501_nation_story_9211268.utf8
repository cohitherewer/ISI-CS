          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Total cure		    
	Bhubaneswar, April 30: It took Orissa 24 years to root out leprosy and now the state can boast of having achieved the impossible goal of nearly complete elimination of the disease.        
	This feat may be considered as the second-most important achievement in the field of public health  second only to the eradication of small pox.         
	Elimination, as defined by the World Health Organisation, is bringing down the prevalence rate of leprosy to one per 10,000 population.        
	Today the difference in the state is noticeable. Leprosy colonies off late have had no new entrants and it is no longer a dreaded disease, but a curable one. Leprosy no longer disables, said Ashok Nanda, a senior activist who has been working in this field.        
	The National Leprosy Eradication Programme was started in Orissa in 1983 with the introduction of Multy Drug Therapy (MDT) primarily in Ganjam. The objective of the national programme has been to achieve elimination by bringing all known cases under the MDT.         
	The state (in 1983) had 3.2 lakh cases on record. The prevalence rate in the state was 121.4 per 10,000, against the 55 per 10,000 at the national-level. Orissa was hyper-endemic with a prevalence rate varying from 100 to 228 across the state.        
	It took 14 long years to extend the national programme to all districts in a phased manner. The cure was possible due to the intervention of international agencies such as Leprosy Mission, Lepra Society, SIDA, Unicef and German Leprosy Relief Association. Besides, Danida assistance was made available for the state-level activities. The World Bank, too, assisted the government to extend the MDT programme in four districts.        
	WHO supplied technical support while Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation sponsored the entire cost of MDT drugs.        
	Over 9 lakh cases were brought under MDT, of which about 8.8 lakh cases were cured. Disabilities were prevented in 2.2 lakh cases.        
	As on March 31, 2008, states leprosy cases on record were 3,283 with a prevalence rate of 0.80 per 10,000 population.        
	Prevalence rate plummeted to one and zero in as many as 23 districts. Remaining seven districts, including Bolangir, Jharsuguda, Angul, Bargad, Sonepur, Kalahandi and Nuapda, still have a prevalence rate above one. Out of these, Kalahandi, Nuapada, Jharsuguda and Bolangir have fixed December 2008 as the deadline.         
	Most important intervention for leprosy elimination was implementation of Modified Leprosy Elimination Campaign (MLEC) in 1998 by involving health functionaries such as ICDS, Urban Local Bodies, PRI, Schools and Community.         
	During a joint campaign 78 lakh families were visited by 6,000 search teams in a span of seven days and 3.12 crore people were examined and 62,844 of new cases were detected.

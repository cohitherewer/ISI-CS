                  Dry run goes on, after downpour    
	Hyderabads tech boomtown appears to be high and dry.    
	Ground water levels have dropped dramatically in Cyberabad, leaving a large number of its borewells, the source of water for many households, dry over the past two months.    
	The dry run has continued even after the Andhra capital received more than its normal share of rain this season.    
	Experts have blamed the concrete jungle. According to G. Asok Kumar, the managing director of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, much of the city is swathed in concrete, which prevents water from being retained in the soil.    
	The city has received good rainfall but not even 5 per cent of the water seeps into the ground. Most of it runs off the concrete in malls and complexes, said Kumar.     
	The civic body is accused of adding to the problem by laying concrete roads with no space on the margins for the water to drain into the soil. The water board has now decided to tap rainwater and recharge dry wells.                  
	Buses shift to higher gear     
	Delhi buses, poised for an upgrade, will shift to higher gears under a plan that allows value-added services.    
	The Delhi cabinet recently took the corporatisation of private buses a step ahead when it declared that special facilities like AC and sitting only services would be permitted.    
	The total number of trips with value-added services can be 20 per cent of the total, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the meeting where the plan was approved.    
	Over time, the plan is to move to automated fare collection, through machines. These buses could make up 40 per cent of bus services, the rest left to the Delhi Transport Corporation. Dikshit said she hoped corporatisation would lead to an improvement in frequency, punctuality, safety and reliability of public transport. (PTI)              
	Share power, beat blackout    
	The world outsources to Bangalore. Bangalore does so to Chhattisgarh.    
	Power-starved Karnataka will outsource its generation to Chhattisgarh, where it is planning a 1,000MW thermal unit in collaboration with the central state.    
	Chhattisgarh, ruled by the BJP like Karnataka, is sitting on reserves of coal, of which not enough is available in the south.    
	The plan, believed to be in its final stages, will see 30 per cent of the power generated at the plant retained by Chhattisgarh. The rest will be sent to Karnataka on the central grid.    
	The Karnataka cabinet, which considered the Rs 5,000-crore plant, found it would cost the state only Rs 2.46 per unit, among the lowest in the country. Savings of Rs 1.34 per unit have also been promised in ferrying coal. At present, that is the amount the state spends to transport coal to its Raichur plant, the backbone of its generation.    
	The plant, proposed in Chhattisgarhs Srivari Narayan area, will take around two years to build and would have an option to generate up to 2,000MW in the future.                  
	Crunch punch    
	Tamil Nadu is low on power. A.N. Veerasamy is low on mental peace.    
	The power minister has been facing criticism over the way he has handled the electricity crunch in the state over the past few months. The PMK recently demanded that the minister resign, failing which chief minister M. Karunanidhi should sack him.    
	Veerasamy, from the DMK, has been blamed for slack thermal generation, with critics saying his department could produce only 66 per cent of the states 2,970MW capacity. (PTI)              
	MUMBAI: If you love the arc lights, Gyan Ashram on Mahakali Caves Road in Andheri (East) is where you could be this Monday. Panorama Art Theatre is organising an acting workshop with the National School of Drama.

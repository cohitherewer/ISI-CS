	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 10: The Orissa communal harmony committee, which met today after a gap of five years, suggested that the state government constitute a high-level panel to visit the strife-torn Khandhamal and hear out victims grievances  just like the SC Hota Committee in 1994. 
    
	Chief secretary Ajit Tripathy, who chaired todays meeting, while talking to newspersons later, said suggestions were made by members for an immediate high-level panel, on the lines of the one headed by bureaucrat S.C. Hota during the ethnic tension in Khandhamal in 1994. 
    
	The members a grievance redressal mechanism, in Khandhamal, would help restore harmony and provide a vent to peoples anger and frustration, said Tripathy. 
    
	Expressing their discontent over the fact that the state-level harmony committee met after five years, non-official members representing various sects demanded regular meetings and more such committees at district and village panchayat levels. 
    
	Members also stressed on the need to take precautionary measures both at administrative and political levels to prevent recurrence of communal and ethnic clashes in future, the chief secretary said. The suggestions would be placed before the state government for its consideration and decision. 
    
	Expressing concern over the frequent communal tensions across the state, Archbishop Reverend Raphael Cheenath said Orissas government should take permanent measures to prevent communal tension rather taking an ad hoc fire-fighting measure after incidents. Mischief-makers should be kept at bay before any communal incident takes place, suggested the Archbishop. BJP leader Balgopal Mohapatra, on the other hand, suggested that the government regulates and monitors the flow of foreign funds to NGOs and strengthens administrative machinery. 
    
	Earlier in the morning, activists of Indian Justice Party, All India Confederation of SC and ST Organisations and All India Christian Council staged a demonstration near the Assembly and secretariat expressing their concern over Khandhamal carnage. 
    
	They demanded a CBI probe into Kandhamal incident, a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to each riot victim or their family and Rs 5 lakh to the injured. Addressing the gathering, Udit Raj, president of Indian Justice Party and chairman of the All India Confederation of SC and ST Organisations, said the Dalits and Christians in the state would not allow the Sangh Parivars design to convert Orissa into the a laboratory of Hindutva. We are awake and alert to the Parivars design, said Joseph DSouza, the president of the All India Christian Council.

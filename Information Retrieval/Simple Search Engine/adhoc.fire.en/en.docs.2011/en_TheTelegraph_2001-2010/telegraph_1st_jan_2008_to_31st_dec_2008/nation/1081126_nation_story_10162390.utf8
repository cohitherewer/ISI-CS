          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 25: The recent communal violence in Kandhamal is likely to take centre stage in the winter session of the Assembly starting tomorrow.        
	Kandhamal is the main issue to be raised by the Opposition on the floor, said Opposition whip Satya Bhusan Sahu. We will stall the proceedings of the House until the government agrees for discussion on this issue.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his government have failed in discharging their constitutional responsibility to protect the lives of people, including a Hindu monk and minority communities too, he alleged.        
	The government was just a mute spectator when communal violence continued in Kandhamal for more than three months, in which 38 people, mostly Christians, were killed and thousands of houses were torched, he said.        
	Congress legislators met today in the Assembly to chalk out offensive strategies to be adopted against the government.        
	Much to the discomfort of Naveen, Kandhamal issue would also be raised by coalition partner BJP. BJP legislature party leader Biswa Bhusan Harichandan said the party MLAs had expressed resentment over the governments failure in arresting killers of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati.         
	BJP also boycotted the customary joint meeting of BJD and BJP MLAs this evening protesting delay in the arrest of the monks killers.         
	Congress, along with other Opposition parties, would seize every opportunity to nail the government by highlighting its various failures during the month-long session, as this will be the last session before the general election, said state Congress president Jaydev Jena.

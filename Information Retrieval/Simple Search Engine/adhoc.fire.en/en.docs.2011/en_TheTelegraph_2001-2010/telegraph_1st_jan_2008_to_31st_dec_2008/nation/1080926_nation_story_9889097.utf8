          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, Sept. 25: A law student in Meghalaya tonight confessed that he emailed a death threat to L.K. Advani in the name of the Indian Mujahideen but said he did it out of anger over persecution of minorities across the country.        
	Mominul Haque, a third-year student of Shillong Law College, was arrested from the Laban locality in the state capital earlier in the day.         
	Police said he broke down and confessed after several hours of grilling.        
	The police had traced the email to a cyber cafe in Laban. Further investigations helped them detect who was using the particular IP (Internet protocol) address at that time.        
	Officials said Haque was being questioned further to find out if he had links with any jihadi group.        
	The email, issued in the name of Ali Hussain Badr, a self-styled field commander of the Indian Mujahideen, threatened attacks by suicide bombers. It said the Indian Mujahideen had already convened a meeting of its field commanders to complete its mission.        
	The email was sent to a newspaper house last night and sparked an immediate alert since the BJP leader is scheduled to visit Shillong on Monday.        
	We are verifying the matter, chief minister Donkupar Roy said. The government will ensure that Advani has a safe visit.

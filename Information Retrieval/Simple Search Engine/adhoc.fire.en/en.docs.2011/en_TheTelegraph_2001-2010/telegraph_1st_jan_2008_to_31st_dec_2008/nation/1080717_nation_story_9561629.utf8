The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vienna green light hope in one session
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Vienna green light hope in one session

	Washington, July 16: India hopes to wrap up the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during a single, three-hour, forenoon session on August 1, sources in the UN nuclear watchdogs secretariat told The Telegraph today.        
	This feedback from Vienna today prompted foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon to scale down a briefing originally planned on Friday for all the 144 member states of the IAEA.        
	Menon will now host only the 35 countries which are members of the IAEA board of governors and 19 others who are members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), but are not on the IAEAs executive body.        
	The briefing has also been relocated outside the IAEA premises in Vienna to avoid resentment among the agencys members that some countries have been excluded from an event taking place on IAEA premises.        
	By holding it elsewhere, the event assumes the colour of a private function hosted by a visiting foreign secretary, at least for the sake of form and protocol.        
	According to IAEA sources, the chairman of the agencys board of governors, Milenko Skoknic, is so confident of the smooth passage of the India-specific agreement that he has put two other items on the agenda for the August 1 meeting.        
	These are: a report of the IAEAs Programme and Budget Committee and targets for the agencys Technical Cooperation Fund.        
	IAEA sources said Skoknic and the agencys director-general, Mohamed ElBaradei, did not expect the board meeting to spill into an afternoon session although contingency plans are being made at the Vienna International Centre in case a second session is called for.        
	Singed by the ham-handed manner in which the political leadership secretively handled last weeks approach to the IAEA, Menon is leaving nothing to chance in the run-up to the board meeting.        
	He is an old IAEA hand, having served in Vienna for four years and from there, directly on deputation for three years at the Department of Atomic Energy.        
	India was advised by its friends in Vienna yesterday after it became clear that a briefing was being planned on Friday for all 144 IAEA members that it could open a Pandoras Box if countries which had reservations about the Indo-US nuclear  and others egged on by them  decided to ask for clarifications about gaps in the safeguards agreement.        
	There was worry in particular about a blank page in the agreement, the annexe that was supposed to list facilities to be subject to inspections by the IAEA after the pact enters into force.        
	Also of concern were possible questions about Indias right under the agreement to halt IAEA inspections if the supply of nuclear fuel to facilities in the country were to be interrupted.         
	ElBaradei plans to field IAEA lawyers or attach their legal opinion to board papers at the August 1 meeting to quell any doubts about the conformity of the India-specific agreement to other similar pacts signed by the nuclear watchdog according to its mandate, IAEA sources said.         
	NSG countries which are not on the IAEA board have been invited to Menons briefing because some of them are dragging their feet on a date for a special NSG meeting to discuss India.         
	Any spillover of the NSGs decision-making process into September could seriously interfere with the legislative calendar of the US Congress and bring to nought the efforts in New Delhi to revive the nuclear deal even risking the future of the UPA government.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Unesco goodwill ambassador Madanjeet Singh in Marseilles, France, on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Congress headquarters has no plans for a victory show on the Indo-US nuclear deal. Nor did it have a birthday bash for the Prime Minister on September 26.         
	Blame the blasts, church attacks, the economic downturn or the lingering uncertainty on the deal  at 24 Akbar Road theres no spark.         
	This is not the time to celebrate anything because of the blasts, said Congress chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily.        
	True to the Congresss grain, Moilys formal statement enshrined Sonia Gandhis role with Manmohan Singhs.        
	This is the highest feat of diplomacy chiselled and sculpted by our great statesman PM Manmohan Singh, guided and inspired by our visionary party president Sonia Gandhi.        
	Moily said no decision had been taken whether the deal should be propagated in a big way. The Opposition is indirectly doing our job for us by shouting and screaming about it, he said.        
	Party sources said they were rattled by reports of how Muslims felt angry and alienated after the Jamianagar encounter and the police searches in Azamgarh and thought it was prudent not to go into a nuke deal overdrive.        
	Especially after the Prime Minister expressed the nations deep love for George W. Bush, said an office-bearer.        
	So, when the Prime Minister returns on the night of October 1, his first interaction with the party will be at a Gandhi Jayanti function at his residence and later at Teen Murti Bhavan, Jawaharlal Nehrus house.        
	Given the sobriety of the occasions, the party sources said, congratulations would not be in order.        
	Singhs 76th birthday on Friday escaped the Congresss notice. Not a single poster or banner could be spotted at the headquarters.         
	The Prime Minister was not around. Had he been here, we would have personally wished him, said veteran leader Motilal Vora.

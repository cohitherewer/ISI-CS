          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, Dec. 5: Pakistans ISI chief today called on Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani as Islamabad stepped up efforts to garner global support for its policy against terror.        
	The meeting was held in the backdrop of repeated offers by Pakistan for joint investigations into last weeks Mumbai attacks that killed 171 people.         
	Delhi has said it has proof that the attacks are linked to Pakistan and the ISI. But Islamabad has refused to accept such claims till India shares the evidence.         
	The director-general, ISI, Lieutenant General Ahmad Shuja Pasha, called on Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and discussed the prevailing security situation, an official statement said.        
	Pasha apparently briefed Gilani on how best Pakistan could deal with the situation and what the broad contours of co-operation with India should be.         
	We will give India unconditional support... to identify the criminals and take action against them, Pakistan acting interior minister Rehman Malik said.         
	Islamabad will send five parliamentary delegations to the US, Europe, the Gulf, East Asia and other Asian countries to apprise the international community of Pakistans stance on terrorism.

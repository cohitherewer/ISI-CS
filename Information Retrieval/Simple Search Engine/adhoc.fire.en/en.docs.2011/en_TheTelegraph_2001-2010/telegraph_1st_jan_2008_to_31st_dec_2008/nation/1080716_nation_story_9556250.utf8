  - Dont stay conviction, courts told        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 15: The Supreme Court has urged courts to refrain from suspending convictions of corrupt officials, saying the breather enables them to hold on to their offices and harm public interest irreparably.         
	The sentences, though, could be stayed, pending appeal, an apex court bench said in a judgement yesterday.         
	It is necessary that courts should not aid a public servant who stands convicted for corruption charges to only hold public office, until he is exonerated after an adjudication at the appellate level, the bench said.        
	A public servant found guilty of corruption should be treated as corrupt until a superior court exonerates him, the bench said. The mere fact that an appellate forum has decided to entertain his challenge and to go into findings (charges) once again should not temporarily absolve him.         
	If such a public servant becomes entitled to hold office and to continue official acts until he is absolved from such findings by suspension of conviction, it is public interest which suffers and sometimes, irreparably, the bench said.        
	The suspension of conviction impairs the morale of others and erodes the confidence of people in public institutions, the bench said. It added that other honest officials, either colleagues or subordinates of the convicted person, are demoralised. If honest public servants are compelled to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers on account of the suspension of conviction, the fallout would be one of shaking the system itself.         
	The judgement came in a case where the apex court set aside an order of Punjab and Haryana High Court staying the conviction of a patwari (land revenue official). Navraj Singh had been held guilty by a trial court in Punjabs Nawanshahr under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.         
	Section 7 of this act, which was applied to this case, makes illegal gratification for any official act a crime. Section 13 (1)(d) says any pecuniary advantage for an official act would be construed as criminal misconduct by a public servant. Section 13(2) says the punishment should be not less than a year and a maximum of seven years.        
	He was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment and slapped with a fine of Rs 2,000. The high court stayed his conviction on January 27, 2005, saying the official would lose his job otherwise. The apex court lifted that stay.        
	Corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous dimension in India. Its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for protection of the republic. Proliferation of corrupt public servants could cripple the social order if such men are allowed to continue to manage and operate public institutions.

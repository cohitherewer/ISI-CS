                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Motera marchers halted in tracks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A bus that was set on fire by a mob protesting the death of the two ashram boys in Ahmedabad. (PTI)                                  
	Ahmedabad, July 20: Police today foiled a march to the Motera ashram of Asaram Bapu, the spiritual guru of L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi, over the deaths of two gurukul students.        
	The protesters chanting anti-Modi, anti-Advani slogans were stopped in Nirnayanagar, where the two boys lived and where their fathers are on indefinite fast to press for a CBI probe.         
	The ashram has a police clean chit, though the bodies of Deepesh, 11, and Abhishek, 10, were found on a riverbed close to it on July 6.         
	Their fathers, Praful Vaghela and Shantilal Vaghela, believe the boys, who were cousins, were killed in an ashram ritual.        
	A large number of residents gathered for the silent march at Nirnayanagar but couldnt go far because of the heavy police deployment on the 3km route to the ashram.        
	Many locals have been arrested over the past two days after they clashed with the police and ashram supporters.        
	Nirnayanagar, a BJP stronghold, falls under state home minister Amit Shahs Assembly segment and Advanis Lok Sabha constituency. Modis elder brother lives only 2km away and the chief minister is registered as a voter from the area.        
	Neither Modi nor Shah has visited Nirnayanagar and consoled the Vaghelas but today there was a buzz that the chief minister would show up.         
	We have been told the chief minister is coming, said Kishorbhai, a local resident.        
	The police were quick to deny the reports. The chief minister is not coming. Im here to stop the people from marching towards the ashram. We will not let them go, deputy commissioner of police Brajesh Jha said.        
	After yesterdays clashes, Shah had promised an impartial probe and said the police would examine TV footage to identify the rioters who had left more than 25 people injured.         
	Asaram allegedly instigated his followers to attack journalists and residents, who had called a Motera bandh after the police clean chit to the ashram.         
	The residents retaliated by burning ashram buses and trucks and stoning devotees gathered for Guru Purnima.        
	Today, there was an uneasy calm in the ashram but an inmate said they were incensed at the campaign against their Guruji. We know Guruji is innocent. But there is nothing we can do as we have been told not to react.        
	A group of media crew was warned not to go in as the inmates were unhappy with the way facts were being allegedly distorted. Please go away as some sadhaks (inmates) might misbehave with you, one of them said.         
	Outside, the area appeared to have turned into a fortress. Anti-riot vehicles were parked at the entrance, the first visible sign that all wasnt well. Such was the fear that Asarams driver was seen dressed like a policeman to escape the eyes of anti-ashram mobs.         
	Asarams followers alleged that certain political forces were instigating and misleading people.         
	Clearly there is someone behind it (the campaign), said ashram spokesperson Uday Sangani. The facts are being distorted. There seems to be a systematic campaign to tarnish the image of a sant (seer) of Asarams stature.        
	The inmates alleged that there is a religious-political nexus fuelling the protests. On the boys deaths, the inmates claimed it was an accident that could happen anywhere.

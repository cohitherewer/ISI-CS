	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 10: A dispute during gambling on Dussehra led to a clash in Malkangiri last night leaving at least 12 people injured.        
	Malkangiri superintendent of police S.K. Gajbhiye said the situation was under control, as prohibitory orders under Section 144 were imposed today while one unit of the Special Operation Group and a platoon of the Orissa State Armed Police had been deployed in the area to prevent further clashes.        
	Gajbhiye said a fight took place between children of two communities at Podia, 55km from the district headquarters, over ghudghudi (a local version of gambling) on Wednesday night. Later, the seniors intervened following which the fight turned into a communal clash last night. The injured people were first admitted to a local primary health centre and some of them were shifted to Malkangiri.        
	A meeting of peace committee was held at Podia today to ensure restoration of normalcy, Gajbhiye said, adding that another meeting had been convened at Malkangiri in the evening.        
	Kandhamal situation        
	The situation in Kandhamal was normal and under control, reiterated Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar.        
	No incident of violence was reported in the district last week, he said, adding that adequate police force was deployed in sensitive pockets to maintain law and order.        
	Today, a 10-party Opposition delegation left for Kandhamal to appeal to people for restoration of peace and communal harmony.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik evaded a question as to whether he would like to lead an all-party delegation to Kandhamal to restore peace there. I have been visiting Kandhamal from time to time and have announced a special package for the district. A special administrator has also been appointed to monitor the implementation of Kandhamal package, he said.        
	Special administrator M.S. Padhee reviewed the implementation of the special package yesterday at Phulbani, the district headquarters.

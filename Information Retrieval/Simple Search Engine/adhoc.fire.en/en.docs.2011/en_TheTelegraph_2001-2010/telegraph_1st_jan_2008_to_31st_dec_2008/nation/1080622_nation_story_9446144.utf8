	New Delhi, June 21: In a few years, Calcuttas Metro stations could have more secret eyes than gun-toting guards.        
	The Centre is working on a security blueprint for Metro Rail networks that, from early indications, is shaping up to be a technology-driven, low-manpower strategy.        
	While the July 2005 attacks on the London Underground have blasted home the message how vulnerable the networks could be, the success of Delhi Metros security has proved that the model can be replicated in other cities.        
	Over the past few months, Intelligence Bureau sleuths and CISF and Delhi police officers have surveyed stations in the capital, particularly those under the ground.         
	Their findings were presented at a meeting chaired by home minister Shivraj Patil last month. The trade-off is between manpower and technology, but many experts favour more dependence on technology, said an officer.        
	The CISF, which has about 1,500 personnel at Delhi Metro stations, insists it requires more than 3,200, but Metro officials have been placing greater emphasis on technology. According to them, fewer, but better-trained, personnel armed with detectors, X-ray machines, smart cards and closed-circuit TVs can do the job.         
	Delhi Metro officials, who visited London a month after the blasts, were surprised to discover that there was little passenger frisking and no overwhelming presence of security personnel.         
	That is because their security philosophy is driven by what they call prudent pessimism, said a home ministry official.         
	This essentially means certain events can be forestalled, so the focus should be on quick response. The approach in India, on the other hand, is prevention. But with terrorists carrying out strikes at will, this approach could change.        
	Experts said with Metro networks spreading to other cities, among them Calcuttas east-west line  from Salt Lakes Sector V to New Das Nagar in Howrah  increasing security manpower was not feasible.        
	More so because similar projects are planned in Kochi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Ludhiana and Pune. Another in Ahmedabad is being considered.

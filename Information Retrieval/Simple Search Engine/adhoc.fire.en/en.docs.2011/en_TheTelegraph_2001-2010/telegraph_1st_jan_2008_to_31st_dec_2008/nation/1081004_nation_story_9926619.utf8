	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Ratan Tatas lonely decision came on a long, hard day, mostly spent in aeroplane seats rather than boardroom chairs.        
	The 70-year-old head of a $62.5-billion business empire flew back from a business trip to Germany, touched down in Delhi in the morning, and flew back to Calcutta in the afternoon. I just had a shower at Delhi and then came here, Tata told reporters.        
	If he had anticipated a long meeting at Writers Buildings, he was right. The talks carried on because chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was very persuasive in his desire that we should not move, Tata said.        
	But the industrialist had made up his mind. The usually voluble Mamata Banerjees silence to last nights appeal from Confederation of Indian Industry mentor Tarun Das would have been ringing in Tatas ears.        
	Das had asked Mamata and her colleagues to behave in a responsible manner before it was too late, virtually telling the Trinamul Congress chief she would be responsible if Tata pulled out.        
	But as Tata headed for the meeting, there was still no response from Mamata.        
	A decision like this becomes a lonely decision and taken with lot of pain, Tata said, perhaps hinting he had made up his mind not surrounded by advisers but during the long voyage from Germany to Calcutta.        
	But he looked relieved as well to have taken the hard decision, perhaps because many of his executives had apparently advised a pullout long ago. There is great pain, but there is also the feeling that this is the right thing, because there is no other option, Tata said.        
	At the news conference he was aggressive at times, by his own admission. May I respond to that rather aggressively, he said, asked whether he was doing justice to the age-old Tata motto of nation-building. Maybe you should ask Ms Banerjee that question.        
	The announcement left many people stunned, because few had expected Tata to convey the pullout decision to the chief minister in person and that too just before the pujas.        
	There had been a buzz right through that he would address the media but this was confirmed only during the fag end of the meeting with Bhattacharjee. In Writers corridors, officials took it as a positive development. Had Tata left Calcutta without saying anything, it would have indicated a pullout, some said.        
	But then, others argued, had the meeting been positive, surely it would have been followed by a joint statement?        
	Amid the speculation, journalists rushed to Taj Bengal, the venue for the briefing. The makeshift arrangements clearly betrayed that the decision to meet the media was a belated one.        
	With all the banquet halls booked, the journalists were made to sit under a canopy in the open-air Terrace Garden and a podium was brought in for Tata. But it was drizzling and water began seeping down the canopy.        
	The news conference was shifted to the Palm Lounge near the lobby. Soon after, Tata ended all the speculation by announcing he was moving the Nano out of Bengal.

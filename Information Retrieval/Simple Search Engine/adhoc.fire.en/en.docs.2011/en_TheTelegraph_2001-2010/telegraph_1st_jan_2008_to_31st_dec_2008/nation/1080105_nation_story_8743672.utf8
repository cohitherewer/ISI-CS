          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury today demanded the inclusion of the conspiracy angle, as a reference point, in the state judicial probe into the Khandhamal clashes.        
	The veteran leader who was in the capital today, described the clashes as a larger game plan of Hindu fundamentalist forces to turn Orissa into a laboratory of Hindutva experiments.         
	The clashes were a part of a larger plan and was not confined to any local issue, as was evident from the fact that the incidents took place a day after Narendra Modis Gujarat victory, said Yechury.         
	He added that there was a resemblance between Khandhamal and Dang carnage (Gujarat), which happened 10 years ago. We should take Khandhamal seriously. The Sangh Parivar plans to make Orissa the next laboratory of Hindutva, he stressed.         
	Yechury, despite Naveen Patnaiks assurance of peace, said that the situation was far from normal and the unrest was a price that the BJD had to pay for enjoying a coalition with the BJP. I was asked not to go to the clash sites by the CM. That means the situation is far from normal, he reasoned.        
	Asked to comment on the Union home minister, Shivraj Patils, partisan attitude he said: Patil should not have taken local politicians with him. The home minister had insisted on taking only Congress ministers to Khandhamal. Yechry also alleged that the relief activities being carried out by the government agencies were not up to the mark and insisted that neutral agencies and NGOs be allowed to carry out work there.        
	He believed that fundamentalists were trying to use an ethnic divide (he was referring to the conflict between Dalits and tribals over ST status) for a communal agenda.        
	He said that the grant of SC status to Dalit Christians could resolve the problem.         
	On the other hand, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, a RSS organ whose members held a dharna near the state Assembly and secretariat today, demanded ST status for the Kondh tribe. Other demands included relief and rehabilitation to the people affected by Brahmanigaon attacks, compensation of Rs 5 lakh to victims families, free treatment to injured Hindus, release of innocent tribals, strict enforcement of Orissa Freedom of Religion Act to prevent forcible and induced conversion and ban on missionary organisations.

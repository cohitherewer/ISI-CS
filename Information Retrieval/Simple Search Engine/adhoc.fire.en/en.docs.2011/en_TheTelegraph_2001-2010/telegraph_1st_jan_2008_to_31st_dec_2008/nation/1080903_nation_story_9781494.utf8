  Party nudged to take on parivar          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia Gandhi                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Sonia Gandhi has asked the Congresss Orissa leaders to campaign aggressively against the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, party sources said.        
	The state unit has begun planning protests and rallies in Kandhamal, the hub of the recent communal violence, and other Dalit and tribal-dominated areas.        
	Sonia gave the go-ahead at a party meeting yesterday. Sources said Ajay Maken, general secretary in charge of Orissa, argued that the Congress could not possibly meet the VHP-BJP challenge in Kandhamal. He cited how junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal had to cancel his trip to the district following a request from the state government.        
	Sonia, however, disagreed and said that if a senior minister or leader had the conviction and will to break into the area, it could be done. She added that if, for instance, home minister Shivraj Patil wished to visit Kandhamal and other affected areas, there was no way the administration could scuttle the trip. The comment, apparently made in passing, was enough to nudge Patil into action.        
	Several Orissa leaders, including state Congress president Jayadev Jena and former ministers K.P. Singh Deo and Srikant Jena, believe the party will gain nothing by holding back with the objective of keeping the Hindus on its side.        
	After the murder of the swami (Laxmananda Saraswati), our leaders feared a Hindu backlash. Some of them cited their close associations with the swami and spoke of the need to maintain a balance. When some of us said we should reach out to the Christians after they were attacked and killed, we were told not to, an Orissa leader said.        
	A Congress team, led by Maken, has met President Pratibha Patil and asked her for a CBI probe into the Orissa violence.

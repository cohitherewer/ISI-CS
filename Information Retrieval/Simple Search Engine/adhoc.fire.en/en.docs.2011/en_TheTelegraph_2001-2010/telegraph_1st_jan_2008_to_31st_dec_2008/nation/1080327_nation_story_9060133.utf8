The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribal poser on Tata plant
                                                                                                               Tribal poser on Tata plant
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 26: After floundering helplessly for a strategy before the foundation-laying ceremony of Poscos Jagatsinghpur plant, the state government has a fresh hurdle to overcome at Kalinganagar, where Tata Steel plans to start a 6MT plant in June.         
	Local organisation Visthapan Virodhi Jana Manch has threatened mass agitation with help from hundreds of tribals to protest against a government that has been indifferent towards the plight of masses.        
	Hundreds of tribals gathered at Ambagadia (Kalinganagar) on Tuesday to protest against the Tata plant.        
	The Manch threat comes days after the government postponed the foundation-laying ceremony of the Posco project scheduled for April 1 by at least three months.         
	The tribals in Kalinganagar have been raising the same issues and have been reiterating similar demands.         
	Our demands are clear. We seek an amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and scraping of Special Economic Zones in the state, said Rabindra Jarika, the general secretary of the Manch.         
	The state government is still in a quandary over implementation of the R amp;R policy, formulated months after the Kalinganagar violence in January 2006.         
	The Manch, a tribal outfit, was formed on January 2, 2006, when the police gunned down 14 tribals who protested against the displacement due to the Tata Steel Plant project.         
	The organisation spearheaded a blockade at Ambagadia for over a year only to be lifted after high court intervention.         
	Its unfortunate that the government shows no eagerness to resolve the issue through discussions across the board, said Chakradhar Haibru, the president of the Manch.         
	The organisations bid to revive its agitation assumes significance as the municipal elections in the state are slated in September and Lok Sabha polls are due in March 2009.         
	Sources said the state finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, who represents Sukinda constituency in Jajpur, is facing stiff opposition over the displacement issue in his area.         
	The Opposition, especially the state Congress, is trying to cash in on the agitation by allegedly extending covert support to the tribal movements in Kalinganagar.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, July 6: Two central ministers were arrested after a six-hour stand-off at the airport and shut out of Indore which is under curfew following clashes over the Amarnath controversy.        
	Denied permission to proceed to Indore, central ministers V. Narayanswamy and Kantilal Bhuria were arrested along with former chief minister Digvijay Singh and other Congress leaders such as Suresh Pachauri.        
	Till late tonight, the Congress leaders were stranded on the Indore-Bhopal highway in a police van as party workers blocked the road demanding their release.         
	For over six hours, top officials of Indore stayed put at the airport, trying to dissuade the Congress leaders from venturing inside the city.         
	A defiant Digvijay said: We are here under instruction from our leader Sonia Gandhi to meet riot victims and visit the affected areas. We will not move unless we are given permission to visit the area. The BJP is letting the VHP take out rath yatras but throttling our democratic rights.        
	In Bhopal, Opposition leader Jamuna Devi fainted when the police dragged the septuagenarian away from a sit-in outside chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans residence. She was later taken to the central jail in Bhopal.        
	BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh is scheduled to go to the polls in November. Clashes had broken out in many towns on Thursday during a bandh by the BJP, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal over Amarnath.

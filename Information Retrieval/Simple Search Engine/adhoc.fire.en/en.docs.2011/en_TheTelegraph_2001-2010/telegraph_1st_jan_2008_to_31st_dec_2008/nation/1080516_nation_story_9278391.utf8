                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Agents of terror: cafe to humble wheels     Jaipur email traced to cyber outlet in UP
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY AMP; NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                      
	May 15: State police have detained the two owners of the cyber cafe from which two emails were sent to the media yesterday claiming responsibility for Tuesdays Jaipur blasts.        
	The police are also verifying the authenticity of three video clips attached to one of the emails, purporting to show two explosives-fitted bicycles moments before they were used in the blasts.        
	The emails were sent from two accounts  guru_al_hindi_jaipuryahoo.co.uk and guru_al_hindiyahoo.fr  from Navin Computer in Sahibabad in Ghaziabad district, near Delhi.        
	The first mail, purportedly from a little-known outfit, the Guru al Hindi, had the video clips. The footage of one bicycle  apparently parked at Chhoti Chaupar, one of the blast sites  shows its frame number: 129489. The clips have been forwarded to Rajasthan police for verification.        
	The second mail claimed the blasts were carried out by the Indian Mujahideen. Police sources recognised this particular email address as one from which a mail had been sent to TV channels on November 23 last year, claiming credit for the days court blasts in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow. That email, however, had been sent from Shakarpur, Delhi.        
	Officers said the Ghaziabad cyber cafe was raided early this morning on the basis of an intelligence report.        
	Two brothers, Madhukar Mishra and Dibakar Mishra, who own the cyber cafe, have been taken into custody. They are being interrogated, state police chief Vikram Singh said. We are trying to find out how the persons who sent the terror mails looked like.        
	All cyber cafes in Uttar Pradesh are required to ask clients to sign their names and write their phone numbers in a register, preferably after showing proof of identity such as a driving licence.        
	Since last year, they have also been required to install video cameras and film every client. This is rarely followed, with many preferring to keep their cameras switched off.        
	Officers didnt say if Navin Computer followed all the regulations, revealing merely that a name had been signed on its register when the emails were sent out.        
	Officers are trying to ascertain whether the Guru al Hindi and the Indian Mujahideen are the same outfit, especially because both email addresses contain guru_al_hindi.        
	The name of Guru al Hindi had first cropped up in connection with the Malegaon blasts.         
	Intelligence sources said both names were red herrings being used by the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islamis sleeper cells in India.        
	Some intelligence officials said the emails may have been sent by Mohammad Shameem, a Harkat man working in Rajasthan whose name figured during the interrogation of suspects after the November court blasts.        
	An ATS officer said the video clips were probably filmed with a mobile phone camera. The first video, lasting three seconds, focuses on a brand new bicycle (whose frame number is visible). The other two are four seconds long. They show a second bicycle, also new, in a parking lot. Its carrier has a blue bag.        
	The second email said: We are waging an open war against the country for supporting the United States and the United Kingdom.        
	Officers investigating the Jaipur blasts have not ruled out the possibility of a multiple-cell operation in which each explosion was facilitated by different individuals.         
	Other sources claimed that butts of Bangladeshi cigarettes were found at one of the blast sites. But they refused to either disclose the brand name or hazard a guess on why anyone should leave behind such telltale nuggets.        
	The police have detained eight persons, said to be Bangladeshis, after they were found under suspicious circumstances near the Ajmer dargah, adds PTI.

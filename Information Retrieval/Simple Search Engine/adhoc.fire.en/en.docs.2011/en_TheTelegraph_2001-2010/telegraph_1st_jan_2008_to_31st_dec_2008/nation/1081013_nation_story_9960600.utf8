	New Delhi, Oct. 12 (PTI): The Indian National Lok Dal today rejoined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance and announced that it would contest the Lok Sabha elections in Haryana in alliance with the BJP.        
	The INLD, the main Opposition party in Haryana, had snapped ties with the NDA in February 2004.        
	The parties did not mention the number of seats each would contest in the state. The alliance is not based on preconditions.... In 1998, too, I had extended support to Atal Bihari Vajpayee without any conditions, INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala said.

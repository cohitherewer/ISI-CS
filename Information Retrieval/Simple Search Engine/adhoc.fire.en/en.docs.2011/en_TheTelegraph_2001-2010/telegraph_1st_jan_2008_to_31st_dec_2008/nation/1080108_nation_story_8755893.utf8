     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Jaipur, Jan. 7: An over-enthusiastic BJP worker today soured the swearing-in of Om Prakash Mathur, the new head of the partys Rajasthan unit, when he was arrested for firing two shots in the air.
    
	As thousands of BJP supporters gathered to see their leader take oath at the party office, Zorawar Singh from Dungarpur district decided to use a country-made pistol to express his happiness.
    
	In Rajasthan, gunshots are routine at weddings and other festivities, which also indicate the familys reputation and standing in society. 
    
	Singh was immediately taken away from the scene and later arrested. The programme then continued without any further disruptions and concluded with chief minister Vasundhara Rajes address.
    
	The person has been arrested on the charge of violating the Arms Act as he was carrying a weapon whose licence had been issued in the name of his father. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 have been clamped in the VIP area to prevent any untoward incident, superintendent of police Anil Paliwal said.
    
	Last November, two persons had died when BJP supporters fired an old cannon to welcome then food and civil supplies minister Kirori Lal Meena in Sawai Madhopur district. An embarrassed BJP government had defended itself, saying it was a one-off incident.

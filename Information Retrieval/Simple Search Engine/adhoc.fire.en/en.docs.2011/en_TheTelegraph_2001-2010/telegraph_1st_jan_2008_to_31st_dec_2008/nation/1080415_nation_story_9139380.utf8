The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun plays PM Rahul tune again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun plays PM Rahul tune again
  - Sonia unlikely to bite the   bait, say Cong sources        OUR BUREAU                            Arjun, Rahul                                             
	April 14: Arjun Singh today said Rahul Gandhi should be the Congresss shadow Prime Minister for the 2009 elections, a move seen as an attempt to unsettle Manmohan Singh.        
	A reporter had asked the HRD minister if the Congress should have a young leader in the polls. Why not? Arjun said, adding this was the right time to project Rahul.        
	He has all the qualities of his father. He is making sincere efforts to acquire the information and knowledge required, Arjun said, clarifying that these were his individual views.        
	In Chennai, DMK president and chief minister M. Karunanidhi picked up the cue, saying: I will be happy if he (Rahul) is made the prime ministerial candidate.        
	On March 29, Arjun had said India needed a young Prime Minister but did not name Rahul.        
	No one in the Congress would respond officially but sources cited Sonia Gandhis remarks after the April 6 ministry shuffle. She had said Rahul had declined a ministry berth because he wanted to focus on party work.        
	The Congress leadership had also killed an attempt by the Uttar Pradesh unit, at its Kanpur meeting last month, to pass a resolution proposing Rahuls name as candidate for Prime Minister.        
	Arjuns intention, therefore, had less to do with Rahul than Manmohan, whose elevation he resents, a source suggested.        
	He said Arjun, buoyed by the court nod to his brainchild  the Other Backward Classes quota  was trying to return to the centre-stage of national politics. He was looking to shake up the UPA while reinforcing his Nehru-Gandhi loyalist image.        
	Although the Prime Minister, Sonia and Rahul were not particularly enthusiastic about the quota, the court verdict has woken the party up to its political potential. After two days of low-key response, posters have appeared outside the Delhi Congress headquarters hailing Arjun and showing his face alongside those of Sonia, Rahul and Manmohan.        
	In the November Delhi polls, the Congress is likely to use the quota plank to check the inroads into the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrant votes by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	But that doesnt mean Sonia will bite Arjuns Rahul bait. She is clear about whats political and whats personal, a source said.        
	Sources said Sonia and Rahul wouldnt want to undermine Manmohan. Besides, the Congress wants to reverse its electoral losses before Rahul would lead it.        
	The Arjun camp thinks that even if his statement misfires, his long-time loyalty will prevent any adverse reaction. Besides, Arjun can plead he had spoken in response to media queries.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: A Bangalore IT professional who vanished from here in April and was thought to be dead in Goa has resurfaced in Pune while apparently begging on trains, but is unable to recollect her past.        
	Software engineer Meghna Subhedar, 28, who was said to be mentally disturbed since her divorce four years ago, telephoned her doctor-father Mohan Subhedar at his clinic in Chhattisgarhs Korba yesterday and told him she was stuck at Pune railway station without any money.         
	Her surprised father, who was hearing her voice after almost seven months, asked her to reach the house of a relative in Kothrud in Pune, who would take care of her.        
	Subhedar, a former chief medical officer at National Thermal Power Corporation who now runs a clinic at Korba, then informed the Government Railway Police that his daughter had resurfaced.         
	While a GRP team led by assistant commissioner Bapu Thombre left for Pune, Subhedar took a train to Nagpur, flew to Mumbai and reached Pune this afternoon.        
	Mumbai railway police commissioner A.K. Sharma said: When our people spoke to her, she did not seem to recollect anything about where she was. She reached Pune in a distraught state. Her hair was cut short. She was wearing torn clothes and had some injuries. Apparently, she had been begging on trains.        
	Sharma said looking at her mentally disturbed state, Subhedar requested the police not to question her immediately. Her father did not want her to be under pressure. So, we have allowed him to take her custody, he said.        
	After her divorce, Meghna was working with technology company Genesis in Bangalore. She quit the job on April 1 and arrived in Mumbai on April 10 to travel to her hometown of Korba.         
	She telephoned her father that she would board the Mumbai-Howrah Geetanjali Express from Dadar the same day. Her father advised her to board the train at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. Our probe revealed that she never boarded the train, but withdrew money from an ATM at Andheri on April 11, Sharma said.        
	The railway police traced Meghnas location to Margao in Goa where another ATM transaction was reported on April 14. The railway police and the Goa force continued parallel investigations, but could not make much headway.         
	On July 25, Goa police recovered a decomposed body of a woman from Candolim beach and said it was Meghnas.        
	However, the Subhedars, who went to identify the body, were not entirely convinced that it was their daughters. Her mother Anjali, a gynaecologist, identified some marks on the body, but not fully sure, demanded a DNA test be conducted.         
	The DNA test was negative, indicating that she could be alive. However, there were no ATM transactions thereafter, and no leads on her whereabouts, Sharma said.

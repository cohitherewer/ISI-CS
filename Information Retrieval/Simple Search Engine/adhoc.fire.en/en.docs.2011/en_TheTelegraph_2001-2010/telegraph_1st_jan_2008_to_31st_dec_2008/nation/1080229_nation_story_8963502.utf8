          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chandigarh, Feb. 28: The family of Sarabjit Singh, who is on death row in a Pakistan jail for allegedly spying for India, sees hope of his return in Islamabads election results.         
	The victory of democratic forces in Pakistan is a good signal to all prisoners facing cooked-up spying charges. I think the new Pakistan government will move in the right direction and release not only my brother but also others, including the prisoners of war, his sister Dalbir Kaur said.        
	President Musharraf will receive kudos from the world if he acts on his own and releases everyone.         
	Sarabjit was arrested by the Pakistan army on August 25, 1990, and labelled an Indian spy. He was found guilty of plotting the 1989 bomb blasts in Lahore and Multan and handed the death sentence.         
	But his family claims Sarabjit had strayed across the border when he was drunk and denies he was a spy.        
	Dalbir, who has been campaigning for her brothers release for the past three years, said human rights activists such as Asma Jehangir feel innocent people languishing in jails will now be set free. I am in touch with all.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had taken up the matter with Musharraf but Pakistan remains non-committal.        
	Dalbir, Sarabjits wife Sukhpreet and daughters Swapandeep and Poonam are planning to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and appeal to the new regime in Islamabad.        
	We will travel to Jati Umra, the ancestral village of Nawaz Sharif, whose residents had met the former Prime Minister in November, and make a joint appeal to him to release Sarabjit, Dalbir said.        
	Prisoner return hope        
	The relatives of another prisoner who has spent 35 years on death row could be reunited with him soon thanks to the efforts of a Pakistani minister, reports PTI.        
	Kashmir Singh, who too was arrested on spying charges, was found by Pakistans caretaker human rights minister Ansar Burney during a visit to a Lahore jail. In custody since 1973, he had turned into a mental wreck. Burney got him admitted to a hospital and approached Musharraf for his release.

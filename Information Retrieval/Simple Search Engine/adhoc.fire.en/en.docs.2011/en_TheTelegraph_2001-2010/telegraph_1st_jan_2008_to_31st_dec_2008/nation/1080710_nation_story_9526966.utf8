          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 9: A fight over Rs 50 ended with 12-year-old Shankar Singh getting slapped and pushed off a train on July 2. Now, lying on the hospital floor without an arm and leg, the boy awaits justice.        
	An Orissa-based organisation, Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP), on Tuesday demanded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for the child who was pushed off the Mumbai-Howrah Geetanjali Express by a train ticket examiner (TTE) in Rourkela.         
	CLAPs executive president Bikash Das in a memorandum to railway minister Lalu Prasad has urged for urgent action to save the victim of a barbaric attack by a railway personnel.        
	Shankar, the son of Rajesh Singh, a resident of Vedavyas slums in Rourkela, was allegedly slapped and pushed off the train by TTE Navneet Mishra.         
	The 12-year-old was admitted to the Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela where his right leg and right hand were amputated  and his condition has slowly deteriorated since then.         
	Expressing concern over railway ministrys apathy to the plight of the victim, the legal organisation said: What is appalling is that the ministry has neither come forth with a statement following the incident, nor made any arrangement for medical treatment.        
	The victim, Shankar Singh, and his father have been left in the lurch by the ministry. Till to this day the child is lying on the hospital floor, in absence of money. An assistance of Rs 5,000 from Child Line, a local organisation, has been the lone succour, said the executive vice-president.

	Vienna, Sept. 4 (Agencies): The US said today the Nuclear Suppliers Group was making progress towards an agreement on lifting a ban on trade with India, after Washington revised a proposal to meet a raft of objections.        
	Some diplomats at the start of the two-day NSG meeting said US insertions into the revised waiver text suggesting, but not spelling out, that trade with India would be cut off if it tested another nuclear weapon had swayed most hold-outs in the 45-nation group.         
	The changes indicated India was voluntarily committed to NSG guidelines against exporting dual-use enrichment equipment that could yield peaceful nuclear energy or bomb fuel.         
	The waiver will allow the NSG countries to do business with India, among the countries outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty.         
	We are making steady progress and will continue to make progress, undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns, heading the US delegation, said outside the meeting. And while a number of representatives here have raised important questions that need to be addressed, our discussions have been constructive and clearly aimed at reaching an early consensus.        
	Two diplomats at the meeting said a six-nation bloc that had spearheaded demands for explicit conditions on trade with India was splintering and other significant nations that had expressed reservations, such as Japan and Canada, had now dropped them. But another diplomat said the like-minded bloc of Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, New Zealand, Norway and the Netherlands was holding firm, with backing from China.        
	These countries were not satisfied with the revised text that has a provision for regular information by the NSG head about Indias adherence to its guidelines on global atomic trade.         
	The objections from these countries prompted former American ambassador to India, Robert Blackwill, to remark in Delhi that the US should think of ending the consensus rule at the NSG if the waiver for India did not come through this time. At present, all decisions at the NSG are taken by consensus.        
	Blackwill, addressing a seminar on US-India ties, said some of the countries raising objections had the faintest relations with India.         
	India has ruled out accepting major conditions with the waiver.        
	Clock ticking        
	With the outcome still unclear and likely to require consultations in capitals for a final decision, diplomats said another meeting might have to be held later this month. Without NSG action in early September, the US Congress may run out of time to ratify the deal before it adjourns at the end of the month for autumn elections, leaving the matter to an uncertain fate under a new President.

             Narendra Modi: Worshipped
                 
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 6: The campaign masks had made him seem omnipresent. Now Narendra Modi can officially call himself God.
    
	Gujarats impoverished snake charmers community has built two temples to Modi, where he is worshipped as the peer (saint) of Hindus.
    
	The Vadee clansmen, scattered across Saurashtra and north Gujarat, have placed the chief ministers portraits in the temples at Wakaner near Rajkot and Kakor in Banaskantha district. They plan to replace them with idols soon.
    
	The community attributes supernatural powers to their hero, saying there have been no droughts in its villages since Modi visited one about five years ago.
    
	That visit to Wakaner  the first by any chief minister to a Vadee village  began Modis rise to divinity in the communitys eyes.
    
	BJP leaders say the chief minister ensured that the marginalised community  which had been struggling since snake-charming was banned  received small plots, housing, electricity and water and education opportunities. He also helped them shift to alternative livelihoods, supplying them with vegetable handcarts and sewing machines.
    
	It changed their lives. So Modi is like God to them, said Bharat Gariwala, a loyalist of the chief minister. Modi should not to be blamed if some people worship him. The party has nothing to do with the temples.
    
	Its an absolutely spontaneous response. I dont think Modi or his fans or party are involved, said Sudhir Rawal, who edits a Gujarat government publication.
    
	Not everybody agrees. Tridip Suhrud, a social scientist and Gandhian, said: All of this is orchestrated.
    
	He cited the Modi Chalisa  a collection of 40-odd verses in praise of Modi  that is being distributed across the state in the form of booklets and CDs since the BJPs election victory.
    
	Clearly there is an attempt to carve a new image for Modi who wants to wash his stains off, Suhrud said. All these billboards praising Modi have come up in the urban areas  are they not another form of idol worship?
    
	Since his election victory, Modi has been repeating that no one is above the party and that the BJP does not believe in individual worship.
    
	Designer Manish Baradia, the man behind the Modi masks, however, sees nothing wrong in some people worshipping the chief minister.
    
	Such things are common in the south. We are a country given to hero worship, he said.

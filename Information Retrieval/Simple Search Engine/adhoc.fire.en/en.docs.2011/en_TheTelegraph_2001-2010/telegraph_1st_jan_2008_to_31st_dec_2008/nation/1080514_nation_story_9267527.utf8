          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, May 13: Lalu Prasad has initiated official formalities to accept Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackerays challenge to perform Chhath Puja in Mumbai.         
	Though the railway minister is in Singapore, the Maharashtra unit of RJD formally applied to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and Mumbai joint police commissioner K.L. Prasad seeking permission to perform the ceremony at Shivaji Park on November 3 and 4.         
	Mumbais municipal office confirmed the receipt of the application.         
	The local unit has already given the applications. Our boss (Lalu) has asked me to travel to Mumbai on May 15 to meet the officials concerned and book Shivaji Park for the puja purpose, said party general secretary Shyam Razak while talking to The Telegraph.        
	Razak said RJDs local unit has spoke to Maharashtra chief minister Bilasrao Deshmukh, who has assured that there should be no hindrance in Chhath Puja in Mumbai.        
	The RJD leaders are also contemplating to move Mumbai High Court on the issue.         
	Raj Thackeray organised a rally at Shivaji Park and challenged the RJD boss to dare to perform Chhath in Mumbai.

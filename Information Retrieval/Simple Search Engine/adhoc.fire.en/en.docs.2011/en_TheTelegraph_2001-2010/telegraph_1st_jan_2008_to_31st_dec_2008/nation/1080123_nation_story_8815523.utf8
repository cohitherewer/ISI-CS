     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Maharashtra government has done all it can to implement the Srikrishna Commission report on the 1992-93 Mumbai riots, the state told the Supreme Court today.
    
	In an affidavit filed by deputy home secretary Arun Nainavare, the government asked the court to dismiss a petition by the Action Committee for Implementation of the Srikrishna Report, saying it had taken the requisite and necessary steps justifiable in the eyes of law to implement the proposals.
    
	The government said it had launched a special drive and arrested 41 absconding persons in 24 cases. Five accused had died, it said, adding the drive would continue. In all, 379 of the 539 cases in which the accused were discharged or acquitted had been scrutinised so far. The rest will also be scanned and appeals filed wherever needed, it said.

          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The encounter between militants holed up in a Jammu house and the security forces has put the focus back on infiltration from across the border.        
	Sources in intelligence agencies said the militants were probably from among the infiltrators who had cut through a fence in Kanachak area yesterday. An intelligence official said it was the third infiltration instance in two months. With security forces guarding the Line of Control in Kashmir zealously, infiltrators are finding it easier to come through the international border.        
	Border Security Force DIG G.S. Virk said they had warned the Centre earlier about more than 800 militants waiting at the border to infiltrate. We had strengthened our security and patrolling, he told The Telegraph.        
	BSF personnel had detected yesterdays sneak-in. Two or three militants managed to come in after cutting through the fence Virk said. About 30 heavily armed men opened fire so others could cross over. There was a distance of 150 meters between them and the BSF men. Thats why our personnel could not target them.        
	During a flag meeting between the BSF and their counterparts, Pakistan Rangers, today, India lodged a strong protest over the increased infiltration. The firing, accompanying the infiltration, was the 31st ceasefire violation this year, leaving four BSF jawans injured.        
	Sources at the BSF headquarters in Delhi said during the meeting, held at Kanachak, the Indian side produced proof of infiltration, cutting the fencing and firing.        
	An official said three to four men had infiltrated through the Layliyal border outpost by cutting a three-tier fence.        
	The ease with which infiltration has occurred has cased deep concern. Sources said the infiltrators were often armed with sophisticated gadgets to counter the preventive systems put in place at the LoC and the border.         
	2 protesters die        
	Two more protesters died today and dozens were injured after security forces opened fire to control mobs who defied curfew as fresh violence flared in Kashmir after a brief lull.        
	The deaths  in Handwara, north Kashmir, and Soibug in Budgam, central Kashmir  raised the toll in the Amarnath land row to 40 in the Valley and adjoining Kishtwar in Jammu during the last two months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pressure on Singh, says Pakistan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pressure on Singh, says Pakistan 
          NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD AND OUR BUREAU                          Gilani. (Reuters)                                  
	Dec. 25: Pakistan today stayed silent on reports that an Indian had been arrested for yesterdays Lahore blast, but waxed eloquent on New Delhis rhetoric which it felt was domestic pressure getting the better of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Amid reports of troop build-up by India on the Line of Control and on the Rajasthan border, Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said his country knew how to defend itself, his third such assertion in as many days.         
	Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi kept up the rhetoric by pledging to retaliate with full force against any surgical strikes inside Pakistan territory.         
	Our nation and armed forces are fully capable of defending their country and thwarting any aggression, Gilani told reporters after visiting the tomb of Benazir Bhutto at Naudero, Sindh.        
	In the same breath, Gilani took a swipe at his Indian counterpart, saying Singh was under domestic pressure which had made him say what he had about Pakistan.         
	Singh had recently described Pakistan as the epicentre of terrorism and had called for dismantling of infrastructure facilities of militants.        
	Gilani said he had a good working relationship with the Indian Premier, but it appeared he was being forced to talk tough by domestic forces.         
	His statement on Singh is being seen by observers as a way of getting back at suggestions in India that the civilian government in Pakistan was functioning under pressure from the powerful military establishment.        
	Indian arrests        
	Neither Gilani nor anyone in the Pakistan establishment commented on reports that at least one Indian  some put the figure at three  had been arrested for the car bomb explosion in a residential complex for government officers in Lahore yesterday which killed one woman.         
	Security sources said the alleged Indian spy, Satish Anand Shukla, operated in Lahore under the alias Munir. Shukla, the sources said, was from Calcutta and had worked in Indian embassies abroad.         
	Local media reports said security forces also arrested at least two more Indian nationals from Bahawalpur town in Punjab province on the basis of information they gleaned from Shukla.        
	The sources said cameras and maps of offices of different Islamist organisations were seized from the three men who are said to be agents of the Research and Analysis Wing, Indias external intelligence agency.         
	However, interior ministry spokesperson Shahidullah Baig said he had no knowledge of the arrests and could say something only tomorrow.        
	Officials in the Indian foreign and intelligence establishments, as well as those in Calcutta police, said they had absolutely no idea of the arrests.        
	But Indian intelligence sources said they smelt a rat because of the swiftness with which reports of an arrest had been leaked to the media, without any official confirmation. This is probably the first time that Pakistani authorities have made an arrest over a bomb attack on the day of the incident.         
	Pakistan witnessed nearly 70 suicide bomb attacks in 2007 and over 50 this year, but no immediate arrests followed any of the incidents, the sources pointed out.

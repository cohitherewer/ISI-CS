	Cuttack, Jan. 24: Ravenshaw University here is coming up with Orissas first campus-based FM radio station to provide students an interactive platform to reach out to each other, discuss issues of common interest and develop talent.
    
	Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited has undertaken the turnkey execution of the project. While work on the studio facility is already underway, the entire process of setting up the community radio station is targeted to be completed within the next five months, said Satyakam Mishra, the university registrar.
    
	If all goes well, the FM transmission  96.0 Ravenshaw Radio  will hit airwaves by June before the start of the next academic session, he said today.
    
	To be run by students, the radio stations programming mix would include education and entertainment-based programmes. The service will initially cover a 7km area.
    
	The FM transmission initiative is aimed at enabling the university to provide radio coverage within the campus and to serve the cause of the students by involving students. 
    
	The radio station is expected to make them more involved in what happens within the campus in the areas of education, health, sports, entertainment, university debates, seminars, workshops and cultural events, said Mishra.
    
	Besides, students of the institution will gain hands-on experience of running a radio station, he added.
    
	Official sources said the university plans to have a radio station of middle module with a separate production studio with recording, editing and storage devices in addition to the on-air studio and programme production studio at a cost of Rs 20 lakh.
    
	The production studio can also serve the purpose of income generation by renting out on demand, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai stars in state show
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai stars in state show
  - New awards impetus for old festival          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, May 12: They are the countrys brightest stars and they would be in the state by next week to take part in the state film festival in the golden jubilee year of Orissa Cine Critics Association.        
	The annual event of one of the oldest film industries in the country is set to receive a glamorous makeover this year  with a little help from the government and Mumbai-based event management group, Vision Corporation Limited.         
	Apart from the stellar Mumbai line-up, new awards for fresh faces are expected to draw in crowds.         
	Our industry needs exposure and it needs fresh faces. There is a lot of talent here and to give them a platform we would be organising a model hunt and an Orissa Film Industry Award-2008 for new entrants, explained association president Pradosh Patnaik.        
	While the stars are expected to add glamour to the show, previous years national award winning film Kathantara (directed by Himansu S. Khatua), Subas Das directed Aw Aakare Aa and Pujapaine Phulatie directed by Gadadhar Puty would add substance.         
	Another new entrant to the programme list is the award for television shows.         
	This year, veteran actor Sarat Pujari and music director Shantanu Mohapatra would be conferred with lifetime achievement awards.        
	Plans are also in the pipeline to use a part of the sponsorship money to help out actors and workers who are financially worse off than their colleagues. Besides, a delegation of Mumbai-based Oriya filmmakers would be attending the show to speak on the role of filmmakers in promotion of Orissa tourism at a symposium to be held during the May 22 to 24 festival.        
	Apart from the symposium a seminar on present day Oriya cinema would be addressed by the industrys prominent personalities.        
	If organisers are to be believed, this year residents would be able to catch a glimpse of Rani Mukherjee, Kajol, Ajay Devgan, Zeenat Aman, Poonam Dhillon, Diya Mirza, Amrita Rao, Amisha Patel, Gracy Singh, Divya Dutta and Rituparna Sengupta at the event.         
	Actor, compare and now singer Shekhar Suman has also been sent an invitation along with item girls Payal Rohatgi, Celina Jaitley, Tanushree Dutta and Kashmira Shah  all expected to sizzle the show. Also, A-list director and producer Mahesh Bhatt and Yash Chopra respectively, along with Vinod Rathod, Amit Kumar and Sukhwinder Singh would be present at the event.        
	This years event is being touted as the power packed show ever and is expected to boost the flagging interest in the industry that has, of late, taken a beating from Hindi and English films.

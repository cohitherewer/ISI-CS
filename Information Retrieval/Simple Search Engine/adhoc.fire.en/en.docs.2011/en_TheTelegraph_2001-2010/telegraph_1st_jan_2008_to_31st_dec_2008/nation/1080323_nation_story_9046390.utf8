          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 22: Police today abstained from celebrating Holi as a mark of respect to their colleagues killed in the Nayagarh attack on February 15.        
	City deputy commissioner of police Amitav Thakur said police personnel in the capital and other places did not celebrate Holi to honour the 17 policemen who died in the February Maoist attack.         
	The act is also to honour those who died in the subsequent combing operations of the police, the deputy commissioner added.        
	On the night of February 15, about 300 Maoists had planned an audacious and meticulous operation. They launched simultaneous attacks on a series of police establishments in the sleepy town of Nayagarh, about 100km from the state capital. About 100 women were part of the Naxalite attack group.        
	The rebels had killed 14 policemen before taking away a huge cache of arms and ammunition. The police station at Nayagarh, the police station and district armoury, the police training school at Daspalla, the Nuagaon police station and the outpost at Mahipur were attacked in the same night.        
	The attack was the worst Orissa has seen and confirmed the governments fears  the Maoists were now within striking range of Bhubaneswar.        
	The government had retaliated. Police launched massive operation in forests known to be rebel strongholds and claimed to have killed several Maoists. But several police personnel were also killed in these operations.         
	Meanwhile, Holi was an uneventful day in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.        
	Police commissioner Binay Kumar Behera said some stray incidents were reported. Otherwise, he said, Holi was celebrated peacefully in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. No major incidents of violence were reported during the day, the police commissioner added.

  - Price rise profit eludes cattle farmers          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Truce sought: A milkman has a busy morning                                        
	Cuttack, Nov. 9: The price of milk has skyrocketed over the years, but milkmen in the state are still finding it hard to make both ends meet.        
	Even after five successive hikes in milk prices since 2003, the milkmen are getting a raw deal from the Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (Omfed). Though Omfed raised prices by Rs 10 in the past five years, it passed on meagre Rs 2.1 to the cattle farmers.         
	In 2003, when Omfed was selling milk for Rs 10 per litre, the milkmen were given Rs 8.3. But when minimum procurement price was pegged at Rs 10.4, the milk price was increased to Rs 20 per litre in January 2008, the general secretary of the Orissa Milk Farmers Mahasangha, Pradip Behera, told The Telegraph.         
	There are over 11 lakh cattle farmers in the state. Of them, nearly 3 lakh supply over 3 lakh quintals of milk to Omfed everyday.         
	More than 1,000 of the farmers held a convention in Cuttack today, highlighting their woes and resolved to press for a raise of Rs 6 per litre in Omfeds minimum procurement price.         
	The diary had increased milk prices to Rs 24 per litre from October 16. But the hike was revoked from November 1 following widespread public resentment.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had directed to keep the price hike in abeyance for 15 days till a committee inquired and submitted a report.        
	When Omfed decided to hike milk prices from Rs 20 to Rs 24, farmers were assured Rs 4 raise in the minimum support price. Though Omfed earned an extra Rs 2.4 crore from the consumers in the 15 days during which milk was sold at Rs 24 per litre, not a single penny was passed on to the farmers, said Subash Chandra Behera, the working president of the Utkal Jadav Mahasabha (UJM).        
	Now, farmers and milkmen have resolved to demand an equitable distribution of the Rs 2.4 crore profit among all the parties who have earned it.         
	Meanwhile, further price hike demanded by Omfed has led to trouble, as sweet makers have put their foot down.        
	In fact, more than 10,000 sweet-sellers under the banner of Utkal Mishtanna Byabasai Samiti had hit the streets of the capital on October 22 demanding immediate withdrawal of the exorbitant price. Shutters were down in sweet shops across the state on that day.        
	Hike in prices also had a cascading effect on prices of other milk products.         
	According to an understanding between farmers supplying milk to Omfed and those not, whenever the price of milk is hiked, the price of milk products are increased by five times the increase in milk price, said the president of the Utkal Jadav Mahasabha.         
	For example, 6 litre of milk is required for every 1kg of chhena (cottage cheese). So, when the price of milk was raised from Rs 20 to Rs 24, the price of chhena was increased to Rs 95 from Rs 75, he added.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has asked service providers to explain why post-paid mobile phone subscribers should pay for hard copies of their bills.
    
	Some telecom players, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Reliance Communications, have been sending emails and text messages to subscribers asking them to refrain from seeking hard copies of bills and switch to electronic versions. They had also been mulling a charge on hard copies, Trai said in a consultation paper. 
    
	The telecom regulator said the companies had to continue providing hard copies for free as all subscribers could not be expected to have access to the Internet. The electronic bills are sent through email.
    
	Moreover, a lot of important information in the bill cannot be fitted into an SMS, said a Trai official. 
    
	Bharti Airtel said it does not charge any money for monthly cellphone bills. But, a duplicate bill is provided at an extra cost, a spokesperson said. 
    
	However, we need to study the consultation paper before making a statement, he added.
    
	The bill represents the true extent of service actually provided and also details of the service and conditions available to the subscribers, the regulator said.
    
	Trai also noted that service providers in other sectors such as power, gas and water do not charge anything for providing hard copies of bills. 
    
	Therefore, after examining the issue in detail and keeping in view the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, it emerges that no post-paid subscriber is liable to pay for the bill, an official said.
    
	In the consultation paper, Trai has proposed amendments to the telecom tariff order to incorporate a provision making it mandatory for companies to provide hard copies of mobile phone bills free of cost to all post-paid subscribers. 
    
	The telecom regulator has asked mobile operators and stakeholders to send their replies by January 18.

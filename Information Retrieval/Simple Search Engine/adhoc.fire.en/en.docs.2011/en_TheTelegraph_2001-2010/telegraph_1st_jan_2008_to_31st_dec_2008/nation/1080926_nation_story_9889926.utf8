	Bhubaneswar/ New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Centre has cracked the whip on Orissa for the second time in a week for the continuing communal violence in the state.        
	In renewed violence since last night, one person was killed and another injured. More than 100 houses, two churches and prayer houses were burnt or ransacked, a senior police officer said. A retired soldier was kidnapped by a mob after he allegedly threatened to shoot the men trying to torch his house.         
	The Centre today invoked Article 355 of the Constitution, one step away from Article 356, to ask the state to take effective, focused and firm measures to restore normality. The state was earlier warned on September 19.        
	Reacting to the fresh violence, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said: We have sought 10 companies of paramilitary forces. The administration is doing its best.

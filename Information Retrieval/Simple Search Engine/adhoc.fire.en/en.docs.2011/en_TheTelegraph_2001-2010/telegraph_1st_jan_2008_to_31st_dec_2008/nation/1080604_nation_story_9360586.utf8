	Patna, June 3: Three men were killed in Bhojpur, while five children were drowned in the Burhi-Gandak river in Begusarai today.         
	The Bhojpur incident took place around 9am when Ashok Shah (55) and his son Tullu (28), with workers in tow, began to dig a pond on a bigha of disputed land at Shivalpur village under Koelwar police station, about 70 km from here. Ram Ayodhya Singh (45), who claimed the plot to be his, reached the spot with his armed men and tried to make the father-son duo stop work.         
	Both parties broke into a heated argument and subsequently Ram Ayodhya Singh and his supporters fired at Shah and his son who died on the spot. Shahs supporters later gathered villagers who chased Ram Ayodhya Singh and his men.         
	While nine people escaped the mob fury, Singh was caught and bludgeoned to death by the mob. A case of murder has been registered against nine men. One of them has surrendered before Koelwar police.         
	In Begusarai, four children and an adolescent, aged between 12 and 17 years drowned in the Burhi-Gandak at Nurullapur village around 8.30am when they swam into the deeper waters. Villagers, around noon, fished out the bodies.         
	The victims are Bark (15), Guddu (12), Nita (12), Kanhaiya (9) and Pushpa (17).        
	Life sentence        
	A fast-track court sentenced former Bihar minister Aditya Singh and his son to life in connection with an eight-year-old murder of one Ashok Singh. Judge V.S. Pathak held Singh and Suman guilty for the murder also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on each of them.

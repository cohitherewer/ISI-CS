          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Patna, June 22: Police today recovered the bullet-ridden body of Ariari block development officer (BDO) Arbind Kumar Mishra (42) from his Sheikhpura residence in south-east Bihar, 140km from here.         
	Arbind, the second BDO to be killed in Ariari in the past five years, was shot from a close range on his forehead. The police recovered the pistol used to allegedly kill Arbind from the spot. The motive behind the murder is still not clear.         
	The police said that the murder might have taken place around 3pm, as the BDO was spotted working in his Ariari block office till 2pm. Arbind had left his office at 2pm for his rented house in Sheikhpura, 10km from the office. He used to live alone in his single-storey home.         
	Though Arbind was provided with police protection, the men in uniform guarded him only when he was on duty.         
	Sheikhpura superintendent of police I.N. Mishra suspected that the assailant or assailants might have been hiding in the house before the BDO entered.         
	He or they may have gunned Arbind down soon after he entered and might have escaped through the backdoor leaving the pistol. The neighbours heard nothing, Mishra added.         
	Though a section of the victims office colleagues believes that the BDO might have taken his life, others have trashed the claim. The nature of injury, too, makes suicide improbable, as it is rare and difficult for a person to shoot in his forehead, police said.         
	Incidentally, the deceased was supposed to submit an affidavit in Patna High Court tomorrow on irregularities in the functioning of panchayat bodies in the appointment of rural teachers.         
	Local people suspect that goons and thugs heading panchayat bodies or hired by them may have had a hand in the death.         
	Before Mishra, a criminal gang had gunned down former Ariari BDO Ashok Raj Bats in 2003 after the latter had denied local contractors development related contracts.         
	Sheikhpura and adjoining Lakhisarai areas are notorious for criminal gangs operating as contractors and peoples representatives.         
	The slain BDO yesterday had admitted before a news channel that he was under tremendous pressure from some officials and people to do things that he was unwilling to do. But Mishra had not named anyone or the reason behind the pressure.         
	Police headquarters have sent a team of forensic experts to examine the body.

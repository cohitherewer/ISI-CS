          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Sept. 7: BJP leader Sushma Swaraj today said the influence of Sonia Gandhis foreign origins could be seen in the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	The deal only shows what happens when foreigners like Sonia Gandhi are at the helm of the countrys affairs and are remote-controlling the governments functioning. Indias foreign policy is likely to be dictated by the US now, she told a news conference here.        
	Swaraj, who had earlier accused the UPA government of perpetrating the Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts to divert attention from the cash-for-votes scandal, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had made the deal a prestige issue.         
	She admitted that the BJP had initiated the process of the deal, but added that her party had given the condition that only one nuclear facility would be put under the International Atomic Energy Agencys scrutiny. But, Swaraj said, the UPA government has agreed to scrutiny on 35 nuclear reactors, thus ensuring that India walks straight into Americas non-proliferation trap.

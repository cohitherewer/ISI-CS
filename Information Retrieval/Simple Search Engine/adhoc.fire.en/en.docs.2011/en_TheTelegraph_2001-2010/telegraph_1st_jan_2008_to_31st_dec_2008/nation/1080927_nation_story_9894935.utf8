                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Loan sharks rule the roost

	Bhagalpur, Sept. 26: Receding floodwater of the Kosi could not make Dilchand Rishidev happy as he had to borrow money at high interest rate to rebuild his washed away home and start business afresh.        
	Rishidev, a villager of Dibaha in Chattapur block of Madhepura district, said he had to hand over two pairs of cows, two pairs of goats and his wifes two armlets and one silver necklace to the moneylenders just because he had borrowed Rs 4,000.        
	I have taken the loan at an interest rate of 18 per cent a month. If I fail to deposit the interest every month, my amount would accumulate with compound interests and hope I will never be able to get back my cattle along with the ornaments of my wife, said Rishidev. He had already spent Rs 2,000 for the treatment of his younger son in Bhagalpur.         
	Some kind-hearted moneylenders reduced the interest rates ranging between 5 and 9 per cent but the borrower has to ensure first with valuable items to the moneylender for taking loans. Floods have blessed many while turned us to beggars, said Suraj, who lost land home in last months flood. Buddhan Ravidas of Ranipatti panchyat in the worst-affected block, Kumarkhand, in Madhepura was surprised to find many neo-zamindars in the locality who also started offering free foods to their clients after completing the loan formalities.        
	In absence of any financial help for flood victims from the government, moneylenders rule the roost here with goonda banks  a popular term used here to grab property of underprivileged people after they fail to return the loaned amount on time.         
	Earlier, police in several districts managed to check rampant goonda banks but the aftermath of Kosi flood has left even the men in khaki groping in the dark how to check the illegal business.

	New Delhi, Oct. 16: India has deployed a warship to patrol the Gulf of Aden in the wake of a spate of pirate attacks on merchant navy vessels.        
	The ship, armed with marine commandos and helicopters, will immediately start its work in the risky African waters, sources said.         
	MT Stolt Valor, a Japanese vessel carrying 18 Indian crew members, was hijacked a month ago by Somalian pirates. The lives of the crew are in danger and the pirates have reportedly demanded a ransom of $2.5 million. The Indian Navy will not storm the ship, official sources said.         
	Somalian pirates reportedly hijacked another ship, with a Panamanian flag, yesterday.         
	The frigate-sized patrol ship will remain in the gulf for 20 days to a month at a stretch, after which it will be replaced by another vessel. The Gulf of Aden provides access to the Suez Canal, through which a sizeable portion of Indias trade flows.

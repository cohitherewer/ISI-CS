	Bhubaneswar, April 15: The state government today decided to take several preventive measures to combat the prevailing heat wave situation in Orissa, which has already claimed five lives this year.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who chaired a meeting to discuss the steps to be taken, asked the disaster management secretary to monitor the situation on every alternative day through collectors and related department heads.         
	Disaster management minister Manmohan Samal said: There will be no dearth of funds to combat the heat, he said, adding that adequate funds would be released from the states calamity relief fund soon.         
	He also said that reports of the five alleged deaths due to sunstroke at Khurda, Puri and Nayagarh had reached his department.         
	Joint inquiries will be conducted by the disaster management and health departments into the deaths, he said.         
	The health department officials were directed to ensure provision of air-conditioners, saline bottles, medicines and ORS packets at hospitals and primary health centres across the state to treat sunstroke patients.         
	Similarly, school and mass education department has been asked to ensure that all institutions closed by 10am. The school authorities have also been directed to stop physical exercise classes. Stern action would be taken against the schools violating the order.         
	Labour department officials will enforce a rescheduled working hour, disallowing work between 1pm and 3pm. Provision of drinking water at workplaces would also be made. Transport department officials would ensure that buses were not overloaded during daytime.         
	Officials of the urban and rural development departments were instructed by the chief minister to repair all the defunct tube-wells within a month.         
	Water resources and rural development departments were asked to conduct a repair drive on a war footing. More water tankers would also be pressed into service besides the present 77.

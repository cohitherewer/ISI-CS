          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 14: Separatists are claiming victory in their fight with Delhi after the Election Commission today deferred a decision on polls in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	There is a revolution on the streets and nobody was going to vote. It is the peoples victory and Delhi should accept it as a referendum, said separatist leader Mohammad Yasin Malik.        
	The likely delay also fuelled speculation that the state may not vote this year at all, which could mean a longer spell of central rule.        
	The Centre and governor N.N. Vohra were both keen on elections before January 10, when governors rule expires in the state. But if elections cant be held in November, it is unlikely the state will go for polls between December and February because of the harsh winter. This means extension of central rule.        
	Key political players, looking forward to regain the ground lost during the Amarnath stand-off that led to governors rule in July, saw a reprieve in the commissions move to defer a decision. The BJP, however, called it a surrender to the separatists.        
	Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said the three-member panel was still assessing the situation and no decision had been taken at the moment.        
	Official sources here said the administrations success in thwarting a march by separatists earlier this month had almost convinced the commission that elections could be held. But violence during the Prime Ministers visit last week may have forced a rethink, said a source in the state poll panels office.        
	PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said it was a welcome step and the government should initiate a process of engagement and reconciliation to rebuild peoples confidence.        
	National Conference chief Omar Abdullah said his party had left it to the wisdom of the EC to decide the poll dates. The commission has deferred the decision, not the polls.        
	But the BJP said the Congress-led Centre had surrendered before the separatists. We will go to the people and expose the government for its double standards, said state unit chief Ashok Khajuria.

	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Centre has approved a Rs 4,000-crore project to make a passenger jet that defence public sector undertaking Hindustan Aeronautics Limited wants to build, reports our special correspondent.         
	This is a first in the countrys aviation history.         
	A HAL source said the project aims to build a twin-engined jet with a capacity to seat 72 to 110 passengers.                    
	HAL chairman Ashok Baweja today led a team that made a presentation on the project to defence minister A.K. Antony. We are working on it. I cannot tell you right now what kind of an aircraft it will be, Baweja said after the presentation.         
	But a HAL source said the project christened IRTA  Indian Regional Transport Aircraft  aims to build a twin-engined jet with a capacity to seat 72 to 110 passengers.         
	In the presentation, HAL officers estimated that the project would take between four and six years. They projected a demand for 1,230 regional jets by 2026.         
	Baweja did not take questions on whether the passenger aircraft project is a civilian version of a medium transport aircraft that India and Russia propose to build in a joint venture. The aircraft will have a range between 600km and 800km which puts it in the regional category.         
	The military version of the aircraft is likely to gradually replace the AN-32 transporters that are the workhorse of the Indian Air Force.         
	The aerospace research establishment, National Aerospace Laboratories, is understood to be collaborating with HAL for the project. National Aerospace also has a memorandum of understanding with aviation firm Pratt and Whitney to design and produce a jet engine for the aircraft.         
	The passenger aircraft differs from the military transport aircraft that HAL is said to be building in collaboration with Ilyushin of Russia in one fundamental aspect  the military aircraft called the MTRA is likely to have a turbofan engine, unlike the passenger aircraft which is proposed to be powered by jet engines.         
	But the aircraft are of the same tonnage  between 18 and 20 tonnes. The Indian Air Force has an immediate need of about 50 such aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of AN-32s.

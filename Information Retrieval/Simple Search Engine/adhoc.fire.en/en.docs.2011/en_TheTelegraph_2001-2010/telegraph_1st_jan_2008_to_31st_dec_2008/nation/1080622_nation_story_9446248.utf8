	Mumbai/Chandigarh, June 21: Hundreds of Sikhs went on the rampage in a Mumbai suburb today after a businessman from the community was shot dead last evening by the private security guards of the Dera Sacha Sauda sects chief.        
	The guards of Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh, who had offended Sikhs with an alleged blasphemy last year, fired on transporter Balkar Singh Bhatti after he drove his car in front of their convoy around 6.45pm yesterday. The 40-year-old died in hospital hours later. Two others were injured.        
	This morning, Sikh protesters brandishing naked kirpans (swords) blocked the roads to Thane and Navi Mumbai as well as the tracks in Mulund, where yesterdays incident happened, giving thousands of commuters a hard time.        
	For two hours, the mobs paralysed Central Railway, shut down shops and stoned public buses before police broke up the protests with lathis and tear gas.        
	Bhattis killing sparked street protests also in Punjab and Haryana and a threat by the Sikh clergy in Amritsar to block trains unless Gurmit was arrested by Monday.        
	Last night, the police arrested three of Gurmits armed guards from Khopoli, a town 70km from Mumbai. The Dera chief was staying at an ashram in Khopoli run by the sect, which has adherents from many religions.        
	Today, Gurmit ended his Maharashtra trip, driving to Pune and catching a flight to Bangalore. The police today arrested a fourth security guard at Pune and 10 others.        
	The shooting happened near a mall in Mulund, which Gurmit visited last evening. The police said a crowd of Sikh protesters got into an argument with the guards as the convoy was leaving, prompting the firing.        
	But the police complaint, lodged by a man who claimed to be sitting beside Bhatti in the car, mentions no protesters. According to him, the guards had stopped the duo from entering the mall, leading to an argument.        
	Later, as the convoy left, Bhattis car came in its path as he tried to avoid a bicycle, the complainant says. Another quarrel followed, ending with the businessman being shot.        
	Gurmits car had already passed the spot, the complainant said. A source suggested the protesters may have gathered after the shooting.        
	A team from local Sikh organisation Gurusingh Sabha met deputy chief minister R.R. Patil today and placed three demands: arrest Gurmit, close the Khopoli ashram and ban the Dera chief from entering Maharashtra.        
	Patil later said the government would probe if the Khopoli ashram posed a law-and-order problem and decide whether visitors like Gurmit should be allowed their own private security.        
	Gurmits convoy had policemen from home state Haryana, which accords him Z-plus security, and was being escorted by Mumbai police.        
	But the private security staff opened fire. The deceased was driving a car and the firing was unnecessary, our probe shows. The FIR does not name the Dera chief but if the evidence warrants, we will question him, Patil said.        
	The Dera chief, who was expected to reach his headquarters in Haryanas Sirsa today, has been requested by the administration to keep away till early July to allow tempers to cool. Additional police have been deployed around the Dera headquarters amid reports of stray attacks on the sects followers.        
	The Dera chief had in May 2007 angered Sikhs by appearing in newspaper advertisements dressed as the 10th guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Imitating Sikh gurus is considered blasphemous, and the incident had sparked two weeks of violence.        
	Gurmit faces CBI cases for murder conspiracy and rape in an Ambala court. He is accused of sexually exploiting women in Sirsa and getting an editor murdered for exposing it.

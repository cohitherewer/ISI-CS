          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      A grab of The Telegraph on the day the hijack ended                                
	Chandigarh, Feb. 5: Three persons accused of facilitating the December 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar were handed life terms today.        
	A Patiala special court found Abdul Latif, Dalip Kumar and Yusuf Nepali guilty of arranging the stay, passports, tickets and arms for the hijackers in Kathmandu, from where IC814 had taken off for Delhi on December 24.        
	The conviction followed the testimony of nearly 120 witnesses recorded by the CBI during the in-camera trial since 2001 in the Patiala Central Jail, where the accused have been kept after their arrest in Mumbai.         
	The masterminds, Masood Azhar, Ahmed Zargar and Sheikh Ahmed Omar Sayeed, are still out. The three were freed in exchange for the 189 passengers held hostage in Afghanistans Kandahar for a week. The passengers returned home on New Years Eve in 2000.        
	Judge Inderjit Singh Walia handed the life terms under Section 302 of the IPC (murder) and the anti-hijacking act, besides three to seven years under Section 307 (attempted murder). The three were also sentenced to five years and fined Rs 2,000 each under other sections.        
	Nepali and Kumar were sentenced separately to three years under the arms act and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) but these two charges were dropped against Latif. The sentences will run concurrently.        
	The hijackers had killed a passenger, Rupen Katyal, 25, and stabbed another, Satnam Singh, but he survived. Katyal was said to have been attacked after the aircraft left Amritsars Raja Sansi Airport, where it had landed for refuelling. Twenty-six passengers were released in Dubai, the hijackers next stop before they took the plane to Kandahar.        
	CBI deputy inspector-general M. Narayanan, the investigating officer in the case, had sought capital punishment for the three men, arguing Katyal had been killed and the lives of others endangered during the hijack. Defence lawyer Barjinder Singh Sodhi said he would appeal the verdict. The CBI had charged 10 persons.         
	Masood Azhar set up Jaish-e-Mohammad in early 2000, soon after his release. He had been arrested in 1994, accused of being a member of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, one of Kashmirs leading militant groups. He had been kept in a Valley jail before being taken to Afghanistan and freed in exchange for the hostages.         
	The hijackers forced the passengers to stay in their seats, day and night, for a week. Some were blindfolded, separated from their spouses and children, beaten and tied up.        
	At one point, the hostages went 26 hours without being given anything to eat in an unventilated plane filled with the stench of overflowing lavatories. The hijackers were armed with pistols, grenades and kitchen knives.

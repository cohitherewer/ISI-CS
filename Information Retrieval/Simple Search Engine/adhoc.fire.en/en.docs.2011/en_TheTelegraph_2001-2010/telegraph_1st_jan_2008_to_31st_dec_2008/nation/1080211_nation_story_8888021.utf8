The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Couple drown
                                                                                                            Couple drown
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 10 (PTI): A couple enjoying the cool weather at Bandstand in suburban Bandra drowned in the sea today, police said.        
	Kishor Chandanshive, 23, and Prachi, 20, and two other couples were sitting on rocks near Hotel Sea Rock in the afternoon. The water started rising with high tide, but they did not realise this and were swept away, a senior police officer said.         
	Bandra police spotted the couples and launched a rescue operation. The other two couples - Ganesh Mire and Rohini Nikam, both 23, and Neelesh Patane, 21, and Swati Pare, 22, - were rescued. Kishors body was found late in the evening.         
	Mumbaikars got a respite from the cold wave with the temperature rising by over 6C. Subdued winds from the north caused the jump, the Met department said. We expect the city to get warmer over the next few days, a Met official said.         
	However, the department has predicted a minor fall in temperatures tomorrow with the minimum likely to be 13C.        
	Colaba recorded a minimum of 14.4C and Santa Cruz recorded a minimum temperature of 12.4C as against 8.6 C yesterday.        
	The cold wave conditions prevailing for the last few days are likely to subside soon, he said, adding that the winds from the north are not so strong, the main reason for the increase in the temperature here. Wind velocity for the day was between 5 and 10 kmph compared to 40 kmph two days ago, he added.        
	But the temperature will change gradually and it will not rise suddenly, the official added

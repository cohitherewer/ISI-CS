	New Delhi, May 14: The 2008 monsoon is likely to hit Kerala on May 29, three days earlier than the normal date of June 1, meteorologists said today  four weeks after forecasting a normal monsoon rainfall.         
	But scientists cautioned that an early onset over Kerala could not be used to predict the advance of the monsoon elsewhere in the country, including its onset date over Calcutta  usually around June 7.         
	The south-west monsoon had advanced into the south-eastern Bay of Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the north Andaman Sea on May 12, almost eight days early.         
	More than a century of monsoon rainfall observations have helped the Indian Met department (IMD) chart normal onset dates for different parts of India  June 1 over Kerala, June 10 over Calcutta and Mumbai, and June 28 over Delhi.        
	The timing of the onset over Kerala may not be related to the onset over the eastern parts of India, said Madhavan Rajeevan, the scientist who leads the IMD monsoon forecasting effort.         
	The monsoon onset over Calcutta is determined by winds over the Bay of Bengal. Its also initially difficult to distinguish between pre-monsoon and monsoon rainfall in parts of the east, Rajeevan said.         
	The IMD tracked six specific atmospheric parameters over the past two months to predict the onset date over Kerala. Last month, it had predicted that the monsoon rainfall for the entire country was likely to be 99 per cent of its long-period average.         
	The long-range forecast does not predict the distribution of rainfall in specific regions of India nor say anything about how rainfall will be distributed in time over the four-month wet season.

	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Students appearing for their Central Board of Secondary Education exams in less than a months time can now browse through the answer scripts of last years toppers to fine-tune preparations.         
	The board has decided to post on its website the answer scripts of all those who scored 100 per cent in any subject in the X and XII exams last year. The move is aimed at helping students understand what comprises a model answer. At the end of the day, students want to score as high as they can. This may help them, CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly told reporters today. He added that answer scripts would be uploaded by February 21.        
	Over 7 lakh students will appear for the Class X board exams and more than five lakh for the Class XII tests this time, board officials said.         
	Students with handicaps and learning disabilities will be given 30 minutes more in the one-and-a-half hour exam. These students will be given 10 minutes more for every half hour, if the exam stretches beyond one hour 30 minutes. For instance, they will get an hour extra in a three-hour paper, Ganguly said.

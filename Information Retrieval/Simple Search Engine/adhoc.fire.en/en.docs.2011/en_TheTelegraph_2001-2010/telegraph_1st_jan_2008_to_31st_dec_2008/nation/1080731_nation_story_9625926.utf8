	New Delhi, July 30: Delhi University today sacked a math professor held guilty of molesting a girl student in 2007, the first instance of a faculty member being expelled for sexual harassment.         
	Atul Razdan, a teacher on the universitys South Campus, was handed the order and a copy of the report of the universitys inquiry committee today, DU officials said.         
	This is an extremely hard but unavoidable decision for us. I hope this has its necessary impact and does not need to be repeated, DU vice-chancellor Deepak Paintal said.         
	Razdan was not available for comment despite several calls to his residence and mobile phone.         
	Although the committee had recommended suspension for three months, the DU executive committee  the highest decision-making body of the university  asked the vice-chancellor to expel Razdan.         
	Two other teachers have been suspended over the past year for sexual abuse but have not faced expulsion yet.

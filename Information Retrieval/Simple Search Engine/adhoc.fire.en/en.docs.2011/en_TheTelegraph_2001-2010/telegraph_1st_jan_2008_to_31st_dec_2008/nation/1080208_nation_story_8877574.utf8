The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena shrugs off threat
                                                                                                            Sena shrugs off threat
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Shiv Sena isnt worried about Raj Thackerays attempt to hijack its sons-of-the-soil agenda, realising a violent campaign against non-Maharashtrians wont pay off.        
	We dont want non-Marathis to be driven out of Mumbai. We dont favour Hindi-speaking people being beaten up, said Sanjay Raut, the partys Rajya Sabha MP and editor of its mouthpiece Saamna.         
	The sons-of-the-soil agenda is a reality and we havent abandoned it. But that is for preservation of Marathi culture, for employment of Marathi youths, not for scaring away outsiders.        
	In the sixties, the Sena had started the Maharashtra-for- Maharashtrians campaign and thought nothing of attacking Udipi restaurants to drive south Indians away.         
	Raut today denied the possibility of the Sena being locked in competitive regional chauvinism with Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), saying the breakaway outfit had failed to take off.         
	Raj has no agenda, no political thought. He started talking about being secular and used a multi-colour flag to send signals to all communities. That didnt work. Now he is desperate for attention. But his latest gimmick has also failed.         
	A few minor incidents of taxi drivers being thrashed were blown out of proportion by the media, he added.         
	Raut, in touch with his party boss Bal Thackeray almost daily as he edits Saamna, said the Sena couldnt have won Mumbais civic elections without the support of Hindi-speaking voters. Our philosophy is Hindutva and we dont believe in beating outsiders.        
	But while the Sena might not appear to agree with Rajs tirade against north Indians, the stance doesnt signify a metamorphosis. The soft attitude towards migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is a Mumbai-specific plan dictated by the fact that these people make up a large section of the citys voters.         
	So, while Thackeray disapproved of Rajs attack on Amitabh Bachchan, he has remained silent on the violence against ordinary migrants.        
	Raut himself did little to conceal the regional chauvinism when he warned Uttar Pradesh and Bihar leaders to stay away from Maharashtra and asked outsiders to learn the local language and become a true Maharashtrian.        
	Sena leaders know Raj is an admirer of Amitabh  he has named his son Amit  and targeted him only for attention. In the past, he has often exhorted Maharashtrian youths to learn from the icon. At a convention in Pune, organised by Raj during his Sena days, Amitabh was the chief guest.

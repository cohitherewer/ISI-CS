The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP seeks Ayodhya magic in Amarnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BJP seeks Ayodhya magic in Amarnath

	New Delhi, Aug. 9: L.K. Advanis apparent ideological confusion after stepping into the moderate Atal Bihari Vajpayees shoes as the Opposition alliances shadow Prime Minister appears to have ended.        
	With such a volatile issue as Amarnath in hand, he is trying to rediscover the Ayodhya magic that he had himself sought to dilute in his new quest for a liberal image.        
	At a rally organised by the partys youth wing here today, Advani said the Amarnath agitation was a movement not only of the people of Jammu but of all patriotic Indians.        
	He saluted the self-esteem and patriotism of Jammus people and declared the BJP was ready for any sacrifices for the cause of Amarnath, signalling that the party was hurrying back to its Hindutva roots after the trust vote shock.        
	The brazen attempt to whip up religious frenzy was best manifested through the unique idea of creating an ice Shivlingam right on the dais.        
	Advani, Rajnath Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Ananth Kumar and other leaders worshipped the Shivlingam before making their speeches.         
	All this in the name of August Kranti and the youth. Styled Yuva Kranti Rally, the programme was organised to mark the anniversary of the Quit India Movement that the Mahatma had kicked off in 1942.        
	Mimicking Gandhis do-or-die call, Advani told BJP cadres the country needed a new struggle with a do-or-die spirit to protect itself against terrorism and the governments alleged anti-Hindu agenda.        
	Advani did use politically correct expressions such as democracy, equality and justice, employment and peace, but over-riding it all was the message that the BJP was back to Hindutva.        
	The events of July 22 have robbed the party of its pet weakest Prime Minister line, and its core urban middle class constituency is impressed with the Congresss decision to take on the Left and push ahead with the nuclear deal.        
	Politically, new allies are difficult to find, and Mayavati has shown she can muster support from other parties far more easily than the BJP. For the main Opposition party, therefore, the easiest way of creating its own space is to return to its basics.        
	The BJPs biggest hope was the price rise, which the government is trying to manage before the elections.         
	Another issue dear to the Sangh Parivar  the Ram Setu  could lose its electoral shine since the government has committed itself to exploring alternative alignments. Advani argued that like the setu controversy, the Amarnath row was a fallout of the Centres anti-Hindu sentiments.

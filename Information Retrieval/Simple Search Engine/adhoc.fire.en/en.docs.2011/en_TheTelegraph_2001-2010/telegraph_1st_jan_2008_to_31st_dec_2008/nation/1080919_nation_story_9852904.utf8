          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          No more: Girls talk over cellphone in a college                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 18: The blanket ban on using cellphones in colleges has not gone down well with teachers and students, who are protesting against the government decision.        
	The mobile phones are found to be a disturbing element on college campus. Therefore, we have banned it on campuses, said higher education minister Samir Dey, adding that the order would be implemented in both government and non-government colleges across the state.        
	The minister said neither the students nor the teachers would be allowed to carry cellphones to the college.        
	A circular would be issued to colleges and universities to ensure that students enter the campus with their cellphones switched off.         
	Students using cellphones would be fined and the principal would decide the kind of punishment and the amount of fine to be imposed for such indiscipline, he added.        
	However, neither the teachers nor the students were happy. I dont think cellphones should be banned on campus. We use them in case of emergencies. Just because a few of us misuse it, there is no point all of us should suffer. Some of us living far away from our college and always require to be in touch with parents, said Pratyasha Ray, a student of Ramadevi Womens College here.        
	The ban should be on playing music and games or other misuses like creating obscene SMS texts. Total ban will only create more problems, said Bijay Mishra, a lecturer with the same college.        
	Besides invasion of privacy, camera phones are unpopular for the many MMS scandals that rocked campuses many a time. The idea should have been to restrict their use during class. We, teachers, need them the most since many of us leave children at home alone when we come to college, said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

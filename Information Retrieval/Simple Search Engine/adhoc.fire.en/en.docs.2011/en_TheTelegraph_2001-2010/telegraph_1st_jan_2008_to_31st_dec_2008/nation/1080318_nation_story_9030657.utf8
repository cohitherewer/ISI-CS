          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 17: Orissa Police Association, a panel of inspectors and sub-inspectors, today demanded a probe into the death of Rabindranath Sahu, the officer in charge (OIC) of Chendipada police station in Angul.         
	Sahu was found hanging in his official residence yesterday morning. He used to stay alone in the officers apartment, while his family stayed in Angul, 24km from the official quarters.        
	It is being suspected that Sahu committed suicide by hanging himself. A case of unnatural death has been registered in this regard and circle inspector Prasanta Mohanty has been entrusted with the investigation.         
	The officers family, however, has alleged that Sahu was murdered. An impartial probe is imperative. The family has held senior district police officers responsible for the death, said the police panels general secretary, Sunil Mohanty.        
	Orissas CID-crime branch should handle the case. If anyone is found guilty, exemplary punishment must follow, the secretary added.        
	Preliminary investigations indicate that Sahu returned to his quarters late on Friday night from a field inquiry. Minaketan Nath, a personnel who had accompanied him, left the quarters around 11pm, when Sahu was alive.         
	Minaketan discovered the officers body the next morning when he went to the officers residence to deliver a message received from Nalco, the constable has stated. Some personnel, however, are not convinced that Sahu committed suicide as no suicide note was recovered from the spot.        
	Abhimanyu Sahu, the brother of the deceased, has alleged that excessive (work) pressure due to skeletal staff at police station and frequent hauling up by senior officers drove his brother to commit suicide.        
	He has squarely held senior officers responsible for his death.

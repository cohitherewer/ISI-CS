	Comedians villain in family drama     
	A Telugu film comedian has allegedly denied his aged parents food and shelter, prompting them to seek legal recourse, and painting the actor as the villain of the piece.    
	G. Rama Raju and Chandravathi, the parents of Shivaji Raja, have sought a monthly maintenance of Rs 15,000 before a Hyderabad court. They said they had spent all their money to educate Shivaji and also paid for his course at a film institute.     
	But the actor, who has appeared in over 100 films, drove them away after he made it good in movies, the parents alleged.     
	Rama Raju, 66, said he and his wife lived on his pension of Rs 2,400 and he had been diagnosed with a heart problem. When we approached him last week for help, Shivaji drove us away without giving us food and beat up his mother when she persisted pleading with him, he said.     
	Shivaji denied the charges. I never ill-treated them but gave them shelter and looked after them but they had gone away without telling me, he said, adding that he suspected someone else was behind this to grab his wealth.         
	Burial business comes alive   
	This is no dead business for sure. The burial service industry in the city is thriving big time, with various players trying to upstage each other by offering value-added services.    
	Earlier, the burial business would largely be family-owned, but now private firms have entered the fray.    
	While some have engaged marketing agents to boost target sales figures, others have slashed prices or are offering package deals. A popular value-added service is transporting the dead anywhere in the country.    
	The market is witnessing a keen competition says Joseph, who heads a family-owned undertaker firm that has been in the business for the past three generations.     
	 Nagarajan, who heads marketing operations for Kumar Company International, agrees. Yes, there is stiff competition, and we are offering value-added services, he says.

	Beach patrol barks orders  
	The patrol squad on Marina beach has a new colleague who barks orders, literally.     
	A stray dog is giving the cops company as they scour the beach to prevent people from drowning in the sea.    
	According to police officers, the dog took on the job on its own.    
	For the past 15 days, the dog has been following us on our beach patrol rounds and has been barking at people who ignore our warnings. One day, it jumped into the sea and chased those who were swimming out onto the shore, police said.    
	The dog, which has been christened Julie, has been administered vaccine.    
	Anna Square police now intend to identify other strays on the beach and train them to catch drug peddlers and other criminals. The police already have their eyes on five such dogs, sources said.

	Twelve health points will be set up near the Games village, Chauhan said. Better streetlights and a fire station near the village are on the cards, he added.

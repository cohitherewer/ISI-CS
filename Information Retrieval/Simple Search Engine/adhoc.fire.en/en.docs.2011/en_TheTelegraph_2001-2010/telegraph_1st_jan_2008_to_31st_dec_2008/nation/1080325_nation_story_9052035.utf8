	Cuttack, March 24: Deccan plans to extend its services to the river-locked Rajkanika in the coastal district of Kendrapada keeping in mind the immense tourism potential of Bhitarkanika sanctuary and areas surrounding it.         
	A senior official in the district administration admitted that Deccan was planning a stopover near Bhitarkanika, a virgin destination largely ignored due to its connectivity problem.         
	Raja S.N. Bhanjdeo, the scion of Bhanjdeo Dynasty that ruled Rajkanika region for over a century, is being roped in for the project.         
	The 75ft-high palace of the Raja of Kanika, sprawling over some 4 acres, could be used to develop a helipad as well as a hotel to accommodate high-profile tourists.         
	Plans are on to use an aircraft carrier to ferry tourists from Bhubaneswar to Rajkanika. But, in this and with regards to accommodation, the state government will play no part, added the official.         
	The managing director of Deccan, G.R. Gopinath, reportedly entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Raja S.N. Bhanjdeo on the venture during the formers two-day stay at the palace last week. He also spoke with The Telegraph during his visit.        
	Deccan will start a special air service to Rajkanika to enable mainly high-profile tourists to see Bhitarkanikas pristine beaches, birds and crocodiles with the largest rookery of Olive Ridley turtles at Gahirmatha. The medieval port at Chandbali, Sialia and the palace too, would be tourist destinations, said Gopinath. A helipad would be constructed at the palace soon, he said.         
	The little-known Sialia hamlet under Rajkanika block, is perhaps the only door less village in the sub-continent. All the 80-odd houses in the hamlet have no doors and are mostly left unguarded.         
	Bhitarkanika is also an ideal destination for sea, sand and adventure seekers with its group of islands that offer not only pristine beaches, but trekking trails through forests teeming with wildlife as well.

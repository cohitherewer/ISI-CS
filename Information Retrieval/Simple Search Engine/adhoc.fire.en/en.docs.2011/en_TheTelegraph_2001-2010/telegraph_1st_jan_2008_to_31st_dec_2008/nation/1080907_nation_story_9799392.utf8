										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Mulford in Delhi. (PTI)				                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver in the bag, Delhi is now looking ahead to the last step before the Indo-US nuclear deal can be operationalised: the vote in the US Congress.        
	Efforts are on to ensure that Congress, which sits on September 8, settles the issue this month, sources said.        
	If not, India is hoping a special session can be called to clear the agreement so that it is completed during the tenure of President George W. Bush.        
	Bush spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today.         
	The two leaders expressed their belief that mutually beneficial relations between India and the United States were in the interest of their peoples, and were on a path of steady consolidation and multifaceted expansion, a foreign ministry statement said.         
	Singh thanked Bush for his role in taking forward the civil nuclear initiative and the decision by the Nuclear Suppliers Group.        
	One technical issue could come in the way of a September vote  the Congress calendar requires a continuous 30-day session once the President introduces the bill. We hope that the US Congress considers the agreement in this session itself. Otherwise, our next option would be a special session.         
	Sources did not rule out the time-constrained option of a lame-duck session in December, after the US presidential poll in November.         
	Todays agreement on a waiver for India will strengthen global non-proliferation. It will also permit India to address its critical energy requirements and contribute importantly to protecting our global environment. We will now move forward to accomplish the final step with our Congress, US ambassador David Mulford said.               As Delhi got the waiver from the NSG,Mayavati called for the governments resignation saying it had bartered away Indias national interests.   The Uttar Pradesh chief minister wrote to President Pratibha Patil on Saturday asking her to immediately convene Parliament or dis- miss the government.   Now that the nuclear deals conditions were public knowledge, Mayavati said, the government was too scared to call a Parliament session.   The BSP chief alleged the government had kept the na- tion in the dark about the conditions in the Indo-US deal and misled Parliament.  Going by the conditions known so far, if India con- ducts nuclear tests not only will fuel supplies be stopped, it will end the nuclear deal, she said in New Delhi. The government must resign on moral grounds.   
	Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                  The waiver agreement approved by the Nuclear Suppliers Group does not legally bind India to restric- tions on testing nuclear weapons, atomic energy commission chairman Anil Kakodkar said on Saturday.   India has made no legal commitment, he said. The- re is no explicit mention of testing,Kakodkar (in PTI picture with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan in Delhi) added, minutes after foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee announced that India had got a clean waiver.   It (the waiver agree- ment) is fully acceptable to us, Kakodkar said, but declined to give details. Well explain later, he said, leaving unclear how Austria, Ireland and New Zealand countries seeking termination of the exemp- tion if India conducted another nuclear weapons test had been coaxed into the consensus.

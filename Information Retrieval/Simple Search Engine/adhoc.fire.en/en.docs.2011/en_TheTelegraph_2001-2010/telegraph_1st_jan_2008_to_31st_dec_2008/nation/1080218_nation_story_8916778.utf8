  - Musharraf muzzles and manipulates but shamelessly sells elections as fearless        SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           An election worker in Lahore. (Reuters)                                        
	Lahore, Feb. 17: Just in case you are warming to the outbreak of democracy on the western borders, be aware that it is a controlled epidemic in Pakistan doctored rather efficiently by President Pervez Musharraf.         
	Even his critics concede that the regime probably had no hand in knocking Benazir Bhutto out of the way, but Musharraf remains bluntly unembarrassed about muzzling and manipulating as he goes about showcasing this election to the world as free, fair and fearless.         
	The Election Commission is not an independent body, as Musharraf promised it would be; it is headed by a handpicked man called Kunwar Dilshad who reports directly to the President. The government employs more than a thousand retired army officers in key positions; they owe much to the President and they will oversee this election in partnership with the ISI and the army. Close to 90,000 troops have been deployed; parts of Pakistan look more like a garrison expecting siege than a country going to the polls.         
	Aitzaz Ahsan, the Pakistan Peoples Partys best-known face during Benazirs long exile, would have brought to you many more reasons why this remains a dictated democracy. The pity is he cant.         
	On the day President Musharraf declared emergency last November, Ahsan was sealed in his home in Lahores upmarket Zaman Park; emergency was revoked under western pressure earlier this year, Ahsan is yet to be let out.         
	Hes been allowed no access to visitors or to phones or the Internet; hes been allowed no unguarded access to the sun. Nothing, nobody apart from immediate family, says wife Bushra Ahsan. Her husband is probably in the room next to where we sit  a teak-panelled lawyers chamber abutting the Ahsan residence  but we cant see him.         
	Outside the house, an armoured police carrier stands 24-hour guard and armed sentries loll about in the portico, keeping a casual eye on who comes, who leaves. Dont bother, they know everything, its their job, Bushra Ahsan says with a dismissive wave of the palm as she settles into her banished husbands chair. I hate this but I am used to it now. Her house crawls with eavesdroppers in uniform, the landlines remain jammed, the one mobile phone she has is tapped.         
	A former interior minister, Ahsan probably makes a prime ministerial prospect post-Benazir, but the President decreed him out of the process. It was viscerally personal, they say. Ahsan was the one who led the successful judicial battle for the reinstatement of Chaudhary Iftikhar as Supreme Court chief justice last year.         
	The movement for Chaudhary Iftikhars return flamed into massive countrywide street protests last year and rattled President Musharraf enough to strike back. He had the Chaudharys reinstatement abrogated by a kangaroo court, cracked down on protests and put most agitating judges and lawyers behind bars or under house arrest.         
	To this day, 48 senior judges who refuse to attend court until Chaudhary Iftikhar is brought back are under lock and key. These include the Chaudhary himself and Justice Khalil Ramdey, the man who heard Ahsans petition and brought the Chaudhary back before the President bundled him out again. So are hundreds of lawyers across the country.         
	I would not even hazard a guess about how many judges, lawyers and political activists are incarcerated as this election goes ahead, Bushra Ahsan says. This is a funny free and fair election. They actually offered to set Aitzaz free, but on the condition that he would not speak and engage in no political activity, such is the freedom we have, such is the dictators democracy.        
	So why is her husbands party in it? What would you have us do? she retorts. Sit by and let the general have a field day? These are not credible elections, but its necessary to be part of them, we have a following and a cadre, where will they go if we decide to sit at home? Irony is, her husband must remain there, anyhow.

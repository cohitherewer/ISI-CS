The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Silver scientist? Heres a $10m challenge
                                                                                                               Silver scientist? Heres a $10m challenge
          G.S. MUDUR                          sparkling idea                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: An international gold mining company has invited scientists in India to pitch out-of-the-box ideas to pull out silver trapped in the rocks of a gold mine in Argentina.         
	Barrick Gold Corporation, headquartered in Toronto, is offering $10 million (Rs 40 crore) to scientists who can find a way to economically recover silver from the Valedero gold mine in northern Argentina.         
	The gold in the Valedero mine is found in the pores of mountain rocks and is extracted through conventional mining and chemical processes. But an estimated 180 million ounces of silver is locked within the particularly tough silicate matrix of the rock. The silicate has defied virtually all viable mining technologies.         
	This is a challenge weve thrown to the global research community, and were hoping Indian scientists respond, said Barun Gorain, the principal engineer with Barrick research and development division.         
	Gorain met scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and the Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, in the capital today and outlined the problem in Valedero.         
	The company has tried to get the silver by grinding up rocks into powder, using chemicals to separate the metal. It has also tried to use intense heat to destroy the silicate matric and set the silver free. But both these are prohibitively expensive processes and mining becomes impractical, Gorain said.         
	Its a tough problem, said Suddhasatwa Basu, associate professor of chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi. Silicate doesnt react easily with chemicals used in conventional mining. Well need to do some basic research before we can send any proposal, Basu said after a briefing by Gorain.         
	Gorain said gold recovery from the rocks in Valedero is typically about 80 per cent with conventional processing, but these methods yield only about 7 per cent of the silver.         
	The viability of silver from Valedero will depend on the cost of recovery, the cost of implementing a new technology, and silver prices in the global market. Even at a price of $10 (Rs 400) an ounce, the reserves of silver trapped in Valedero would be worth $1.8 billion (Rs 7,200 crore). But scientists point out that not all of it would be recoverable even with new technology.         
	Barrick launched its worldwide hunt for ideas in September 2007, and has received about 100 proposals from scientists from various countries.         
	There is significant chemical engineering and mining talent in India, said Gorain, who had studied at the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, before pursuing a career in mining plant operations in Canada.         
	Besides the ISM, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, are candidate sites that could pitch ideas to the company, he said.         
	The last date for proposals, which scientists may send online to www.unlockthevalue.com, is April 30, 2008.

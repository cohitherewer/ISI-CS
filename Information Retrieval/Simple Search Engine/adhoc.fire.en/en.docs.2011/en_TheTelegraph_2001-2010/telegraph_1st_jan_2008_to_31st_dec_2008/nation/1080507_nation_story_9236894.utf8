          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Prayer time                                  
	Lucknow, May 6: Having travelled the world from China to Chennai, the concept of women-only mosques, or Nusis, is now knocking on the doors of Lucknow, the centre of traditional Islamic learning.        
	The All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board today demanded separate mosques for women in north India, a suggestion that triggered sharp reactions from conservatives.         
	Separate mosques for women are the need of the hour for greater empowerment of women. This would amount to recognition of the rights of women to exercise their own faith and that they can offer namaz in mosques. Let me assert, women praying is not against the tenets of Islam, board president Shaista Amber said.        
	The board says women who go to pray in general masjids should be given a chance to pray at women-only mosques with lady imams. Women graduating from Islamic seminaries as imams should be allowed to act as one in mosques, it adds.         
	Last year, 13 women who had obtained degrees from Meeruts Marqool Quara Marusul seminary did not get a job anywhere in India.         
	Women-only mosques exist in the Netherlands and China, but in India the idea is frowned upon. Women usually pray in buildings adjoining mosques or in separate enclosures within them.         
	Shaista said she built a mosque for women in Lucknows old city on Rae Bareli Road. I pray there myself and I encourage other women to join, she said. But the mosque may soon be razed as it is built on land that will be taken over for a government project.        
	Shaista has drawn inspiration from Daud Sharifa Khanum, a postgraduate in history who is spearheading a movement in Tamil Nadu for a separate mosque for women.         
	Like Sharifa, the 42-year-old Shaista said she faced the ire of clerics.         
	Muslim religious leaders accused Shaista of indulging in politics. Naim-ur-Rahman Siddiqui, a scholar at Lucknows Nadwa Islamic seminary, said issues such as woman-led prayers and new women-only mosques are borrowed from western attempts to distract attention from pressing issues. Our Muslim sisters should rather be preoccupied with educating the young generations about their religion and protecting them from moral aberration, he said.

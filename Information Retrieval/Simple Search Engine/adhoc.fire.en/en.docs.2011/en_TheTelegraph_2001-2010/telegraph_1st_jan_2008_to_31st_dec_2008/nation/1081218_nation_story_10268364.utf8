  - Centre to issue rules of response in an attack         SUJAN DUTTA                           National security adviser MK Narayanan                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Centre will soon issue a war book for homeland security that will detail measures to be taken by central ministries, state departments and security agencies in the event of a major terrorist attack.         
	The cabinet secretariat is now collating the feedback from ministries on standard operating procedures to be adopted after a terrorist strike. Omnibus standard operating procedures that lay down the responses to a terror strike do not exist currently.         
	The exercise was initiated after the attack on Mumbai and the SOPs were to be out this month. But the work has got delayed because officers involved in drafting the SOPs have been preoccupied with drafting the bill for the National Investigation Agency and the amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 that are now being discussed in Parliament, a senior officer said.         
	A war book for armed conflict situations, such as war, exists. It lays down the steps each ministry will adopt if the Centre decides that hostilities are on the verge of breaking out. For example, it lays down how the railways will cooperate with the army to move military equipment.         
	The war book was consulted for Operation Parakram, the mobilisation of the armed forces in the wake of the December 2001 attack on Parliament.         
	Suggestions for the homeland security SOPs in response to the cabinet secretarys notice have already been sent by the defence ministry. The SOP will establish a command and control centre  vested either with the cabinet secretary or with the national security adviser.         
	There are SOPs for specific eventualities  such as if an aircraft is hijacked, the Air Traffic Control is to inform the cabinet secretary directly who will then convene a Crisis Management Group and who will be its members.         
	But, tackling the attackers in Mumbai involved multiple agencies (army, navy, state police, intelligence, central and state governments) with no single authority designated to coordinate. The code of the National Security Guard was adopted by convention. It says that if the NSG is called in for an operation, it will decide its mechanisms.         
	However, officials say the NSG is incapable of dealing with all the exigencies of such a situation that may involve, for example, media management.         
	The SOPs for homeland security are likely to authorise the cabinet secretary or the national security adviser as the command and control centre. He/she will then identify a nodal central ministry or state department for that particular operation.         
	The nodal agency will take charge of media briefings and decide the administrative actions that are to follow and issue guidelines for public security.

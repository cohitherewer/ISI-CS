The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dalai, a bit of a Marxist
                                                                                                               Dalai, a bit of a Marxist
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          The Dalai Lama. Telegraph picture                                  
	McLeodganj, March 18: Jyoti Basu may not be aware that he has been refusing to extend solidarity to a fellow Marxist.        
	Miles away from the former Bengal chief minister who has accepted Tibet as a part of China for long, the Dalai Lama today said he had a shade of Marxism in him.        
	I am a Marxist as far as social and economic theory is concerned, he told reporters, his conversation briefly veering from the Tibetan youths march for independence from China and his own call for meaningful autonomy.        
	Terming himself a Buddhist communist, the Dalai Lama said he was part Marxist because he believed in equal distribution and shunned the intent to profit.        
	But he qualified that Marxist theory was acceptable to him only in its purest form. This was because the ideology became all about power and control after Lenin came on the scene, he said.        
	It became even worse after Stalin, he added.        
	Although he cracked jokes and toggled between spirituality and politics, his conversation inevitably returned to the Tibetan marchers demand for independence.        
	Tibet can develop under Chinese leadership, he said, before relating a little story about how he had met Chairman Mao and how he had been impressed by the interpretation of Marxist thought.        
	The Han Chinese and the Tibetans can live happily ever after, he said.        
	In Calcutta, Basu refused to get into the Tibetan independence-versus-autonomy debate, saying it was an internal affair of China.        
	We have accepted Tibet as a part of China for long. Some people claim 10 persons died in the violence in Tibet, while others say 100. The incidents are saddening. But these are internal affairs of China.        
	The Dalai Lama said the events of the last few days, especially the Chinese crackdown in Lhasa, had made him feel like a deer in a tigers grip.        
	Can a deer fight a tiger? Our only strength is justice and truth, he said.        
	Then, in a possible message to the marchers that they should not resort to violence, he said: Expressing emotions is easy, but we are not writing a novel.        
	On Chinese premier Wen Jiabaos accusation that he was inciting the violence, he said: Let Chinese officials come and check records. They can check my pulse, stool and urine, let someone come from the embassy in New Delhi.        
	The Dalai Lama said since the March 10 uprising began, he had been as anxious as he was during the first uprising in Lhasa in 1959. The laughing is only an act.        
	He said in 1959, he had been caught between protesting Tibetans and a Chinese regime determined to crush the rebellion.         
	Neither side was willing to listen and so there was anxiety and helplessness. This time also I feel the same.        
	Then came the final word: When I meditate I think of exchanging taking the hatred and fear of Chinese and giving peace and goodness. In my emotional world, it works.

          JODI KANTOR                          Malia, (below) Sasha: Youngest occupants                                  
	Washington, Nov. 6: When Verna Williams called to congratulate Michelle Obama on Wednesday morning, she half-jokingly offered to stop calling her old law school buddy Meesh and start calling her something more dignified.        
	Michelle dissolved into giggles, and the two traded title ideas, one sillier than the next, all of them too ridiculous to repeat to a newspaper reporter, Verna said.        
	A day after the presidential election, the Obama family of Chicagos Hyde Park is only beginning to figure out how to become the first family of the US.        
	As the first African Americans in the role, they will be a living tableau of racial progress, and friends say they are acutely aware that everything they say and do  the way they dress, where Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, go to school, even what kind of puppy they adopt  will brim with symbolic value.        
	Heres an intact black family, a happy family, with beautiful kids and a loving extended family, Verna said, and they happen to live in the executive mansion.        
	For President-elect Barack Obama and his family, leaving Chicago means dismantling the protective cocoon they have built around them.        
	Throughout the campaign, Malia and Sasha, who will become the youngest White House occupants in decades, spent many hours in their grandmothers tiny South Side apartment, in the same building where their mother was raised. Their private school at the University of Chicago is laced with neighbours and allies who watch over the girls with loving vigilance.        
	When the girls and their mother have needed an escape, they could retreat to the backyards of long-time friends, where they jumped rope or turned up the volume on their iPods and danced with abandon to songs by Soulja Boy and Beyonc Knowles.        
	Michelle, a creature of habit, has spent nearly every Saturday for the past 10 years with the same two friends and their collective brood of children, lately at a local California Pizza Kitchen.        
	Now all of that must change.        
	On Wednesday afternoon, Michelle spoke with the first lady, Laura Bush, who invited her and her daughters to visit the White House soon.        
	The hunt for a new school begins now, Michelle told friends. In Hyde Park, she has a reputation as a fiercely attentive mother, one who watches Malias footwork closely at soccer games while other parents drift and gossip over lattes. Friends say Michelle will apply the same scrutiny to her daughters transition.         
	Because she is Michelle, said Sandra Matthews, a friend from Chicago, she will manage that, she will direct it, instead of relying on others to research schools.        
	As parents, the Obamas believe in giving their daughters some sway over decisions that affect them, she said. And so, note to headmasters: The preferences of Malia (pronounced mah-LEE-ah), a solemn-eyed Harry Potter fan, and Sasha, the family ham, could weigh heavily. (Many Washingtonians expect them to look closely at Georgetown Day School or Sidwell Friends, which Chelsea Clinton attended.)        
	While the Obama White House will surely entertain the usual Washington dignitaries and foreign heads of state, the most prized guests might be the girls friends. We may see sleepovers at the White House, groups of young girls in their sleeping bags hanging out with Sasha and Malia, Verna said.        
	Instead of trying to create an entirely new social world in Washington, friends predict that the Obamas will transport some of their Hyde Park world to the capital. On the campaign trail, they were accompanied by bands of relatives and friends: Craig Robinson, Michelles brother; Martin Nesbitt, the campaign treasurer; Eric Whitaker, a hospital executive; and others. In part so the Obama girls could have familiar playmates, everyone brought their families along, too.        
	The attitude of the Obamas is Come join us on this adventure, said John W. Rogers Jr, a finance company founder, who has done so a few times.        
	Im not letting go of this family, said Yvonne Davila, whose daughters are two of the Obama girls best friends.        
	The Obamas will come to Washington with a fifth family member, one who has so far remained mostly out of the spotlight. Marian Robinson, Michelles mother, is a widow and retired bank secretary who has served as the girls chief caretaker during their mothers frequent absences.         
	Aides say they do not know whether Marian will formally move into the White House, but it is certain that Malia and Sashas grandmother will be near at hand and available when their parents have to travel.        
	The election of Obama, who has spent long periods away from home, will help realise a cherished family dream: for the next four years, the Obamas will finally eat dinner together.

	Patna, Dec. 18: Vishwanathan Anand today predicted that Bengal boy Surya Shekhar Ganguli had all the potential to emerge as a world champion.        
	The three-time champion was in Patna promoting a career fair organised by the Bihar government.         
	Talking to reporters, the veteran described Surya Shekhar as young and full of new ideas. Asked how he rated the player, Anand said: He has all the ingredients to make it big.        
	The rising star from Bengal has been winning the Indian chess championship for five years in a row since 2003. He had completed the Grandmaster norm in the year 2002, while playing for the 35th Chess Olympiad. Anand also expressed his happiness at meeting M.S. Dhoni at Chennai recently.         
	Asked about Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modis remark that politicians should learn from chess players, Anand, in a lighter vein, said: Yes! The politicians make good moves. They should play chess.

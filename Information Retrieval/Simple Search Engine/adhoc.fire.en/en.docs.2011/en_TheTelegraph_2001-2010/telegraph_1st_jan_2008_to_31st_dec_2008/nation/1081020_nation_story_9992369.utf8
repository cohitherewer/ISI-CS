  - Panel admits taking risk, police say separatists bigger threat than militants        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Election Commission today announced a seven-phase Jammu and Kashmir election between November 17 and December 24 despite internal differences and the state administrations doubts.        
	The 38-day polls will be the longest any state has ever had. Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said the polls would be held on November 17, 23 and 30, and December 7, 13, 17 and 24. Counting will take place on December 28.        
	Some phases will witness polling in barely five or six of the states 87 constituencies. The elections have been staggered because of limited availability of security forces, with five more states going to the polls between November 14 and December 4.        
	Gopalaswami said the commission had taken a risk amid uncertainty about participation by all political parties. Some parties and other outfits in the Valley are opposed to polls at this time.        
	He explained: First you need to ask if political parties are ready. We are not conducting (the) election in a vacuum. To start with, there were one no, one yes and one yes-no. After that one no became yes. So we have two yes and we have taken a risk.        
	He indirectly admitted to differences within the commission, saying: So each one presents his views, which he considers the best. There are three election commissioners and at least there may be three opinions.        
	Commissioners S.Y. Quraishi and Naveen Chawla favoured immediate polls while Gopalaswami had reservations. Sources said the rift was linked to the Centres desperation to hold the polls at the earliest.        
	Conflicting signals came from within the state. Governor N.N. Vohra was keen on an early election but the administration was jittery on two counts: the weather and security. Officials felt that December would be too cold for elections, especially since some of the states higher reaches had already had snowfall.        
	Although Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have offered to send Urdu-speaking officials on poll duty and the Centre has promised adequate paramilitary forces, state officials argued that these people were not trained to work in extreme weather. Election schedules in the state usually do not stretch beyond October.        
	The officials also felt the situation had not become normal after the Amarnath rift between Jammu and the Valley.        
	The commission, however, was under immense pressure to announce an election because both the BJP and the Congress wanted one. The Congress feared it would have to pay for any worsening of the situation in the coming months; the BJP wanted to cash in on the strong feelings in Jammu generated by the Amarnath row.        
	Sources said national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and governor Vohra were the prime forces behind the early election schedule.

	New Delhi, Oct. 15 (PTI): The Centre today said clubs should enforce the smoking ban as they were classified as public places.          
	Clubs also fall in the category of public places and therefore have to enforce the rules relating to the ban on smoking in public places, the health ministry said in a statement, adding that restaurants or refreshment rooms in clubs, too, were public places according to rules.          
	However, if a restaurant attached to a club has a seating capacity of 30 or more, it may create a separate smoking area.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up the Centre for citing a religious text to justify its prohibition on homosexuality and asked it to come up with scientific reports instead. The rap came after additional solicitor general P.P. Malhotra referred to an article quoting the Bible. These are not scientific reports. These are articles quoting the Bible, which is a propaganda.... Show us scientific reports, a bench said.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave vent to its disapproval of obscenity and violence on TV, saying it had become impossible for families to sit together and watch programmes. A three-judge bench granted three weeks to the Centre to submit its views on the fate of the proposed broadcasting bill aimed at regulating content in the electronic media.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: The West Bengal State Agriculture Commission has opposed the entry of multinationals in retail, saying the move will hit farmers and small traders.
    
	In its interim report submitted to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today, the commission has instead suggested that the state set up joint ventures and co-operatives.
    
	We have recommended that the government devise a market mechanism that will protect small traders and farmers. If multinationals come into the retail market, they will do big business. The state cannot allow monopoly of such big players, said commission chairman and former Calcutta University vice-chancellor R.N. Basu. 
    
	Madan Ghosh, CPM state secretariat member and one of those on the panel, echoed him. The governments control over the retail business is necessary.
    
	As an example of state control in retail, the commission cited the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), which markets milk in all metros and key cities. The Bengal government should work for the formation of such co-operatives, the panel has suggested.
    
	According to Ghosh, the chief minister was responsive to the suggestions in the 124-page interim report. The final set of proposals will be submitted in a few months. The chief minister has told us to submit the final report as early as possible, he said at Writers Buildings.
    
	The chief minister promised to form an executive committee once the final report was submitted, Ghosh said, adding this panel would put the proposals into practice.
    
	The 16-member commission, consisting of 11 experts in the field of agriculture and five farmers representatives, was formed in November 2006 to suggest ways to improve the lot of farmers and ensure food security.

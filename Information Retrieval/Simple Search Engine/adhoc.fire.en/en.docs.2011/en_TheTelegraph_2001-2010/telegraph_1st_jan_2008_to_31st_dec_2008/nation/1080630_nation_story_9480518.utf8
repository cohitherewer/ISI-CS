          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma                                  
	Lucknow, June 29: A Bahujan Samaj Party MLA was arrested today for exploiting a woman research scholar who disappeared from Agra last month but resurfaced yesterday to recount the hell she had been through.        
	Bulandshahr MLA Bhagwan Sharma was picked up from Mayavatis Delhi home where the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had called him and got him arrested after her aides drew her attention to the 28-year-old researchers TV interview today.        
	Shital Birla had said she would like to meet the chief minister and tell her how the Brahmin leader, said to be crucial to Mayavatis caste coalition, had forced her to go into hiding after forcibly marrying her though he was already married.        
	Sources said Sharma, also called Guddu Pandit, will be handed over to Agra police tomorrow.        
	Uttar Pradesh additional police chief Brij Lal said Sharma was arrested on charges of sexually exploiting the research scholar, threatening her family and hiding his marriage.        
	Shital told Agra police chief Raghuvar Lal: The MLA first befriended me, misled me about his life.        
	He kept me in the dark about his first marriage and forcibly married me in a temple with his men on guard, exploited me physically and mentally. When I came to know about his first marriage, I struggled to get out of his clutches and that is when I began to face hell.        
	Mayavati has asked the police to treat Shitals statements to the media as an FIR and start a case against the MLA.        
	Sharma claimed he didnt know Shital. A conspiracy is being hatched by my rivals to malign me, he said.

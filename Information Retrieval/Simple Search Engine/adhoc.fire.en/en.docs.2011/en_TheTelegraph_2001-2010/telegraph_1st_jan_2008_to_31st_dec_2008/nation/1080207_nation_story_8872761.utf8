	Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 6 (PTI): A Malaysian court has asked an Indian IT professional to return data on clients accounts worth about Rs 160 crore after his former employer here accused him of passing on confidential information to a Bangalore firm he joined after quitting.        
	Judge Maimun Tuan Mat also restrained Ashish Sahay, 35, from distributing the data and said anyone who had helped him in passing on the information would be jailed or fined.

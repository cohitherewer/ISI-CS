          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 7: The Bihar Assembly saw two adjournments during pre-lunch session today with the Opposition disrupting proceedings.        
	The Opposition was protesting against the alleged assault of a Bhagalpur central jail constable on former CPM MLA Mehboob Alam.         
	Alam is the two-time MLA from Barsoi  a north Bihar Assembly seat.        
	As soon as the House assembled for the day, CPM legislators demanded that their notice of adjournment motion on the assault be passed.         
	The CPM members stormed the well shouting slogans against the government, when Speaker Uday Narayann Choudhary announced the rejection of the as it was not in order.         
	That angered the CPM MLAs even further and they chanted: Down with the Nazi-Nitish regime, down with bureaucracy.         
	Cacophony ruled, as members of the RJD, BSP, LJP and CPI, too, joined the CPM members in the well.         
	Road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav tried to calm the agitated Opposition members down, and promised to make an official statement, once an official report on the incident was received.         
	Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav requested the chair to restore order before the government could make a statement.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Ramashray Prasad Singh conceded that the government would make a statement, but criticised the Opposition for open defiance of the Speaker, Sadanand Singh.

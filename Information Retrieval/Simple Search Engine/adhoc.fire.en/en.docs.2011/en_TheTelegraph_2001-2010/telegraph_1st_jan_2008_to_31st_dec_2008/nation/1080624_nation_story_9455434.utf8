          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 23: The government will table the report on the controversial West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, when the Assemblys budget session resumes on July 1.        
	Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said the disagreements between the Left partners and the CPM over the bill, which was referred to a select committee in November 2006, had not been resolved over the last 19 months.        
	The bill had sparked a furore after it proposed relaxation of the rural land ceiling for industry, commerce and infrastructure. Although it did not explicitly say that the clause was aimed at facilitating SEZs or industrial parks, the allies claimed it would reverse the effect of land reforms and lead to corporate zamindari.        
	Since the committee was told to give its report by the end of the 2008 budget session, I thought of calling a committee meeting to prepare a report, Mollah, also the chairman of the select committee, said. But our allies are still opposed to it, so is the Opposition. So I felt the meeting would be futile.        
	Mollah said he would move the bill again if his party wanted it. The bill will lapse if the report is not placed in the budget session this year.        
	But Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said further time could be given to consider the bill if the committee chairman asked for it.        
	CPM sources said the party was unlikely to stoke the acrimony over the bill, especially after the panchayat poll drubbing it took in East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas.        
	The party leadership is likely to give the bill a quiet burial, a CPM leader said.

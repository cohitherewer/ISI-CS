     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Cuttack, Jan. 10: Inspector-general of the states crime branch B.K. Sharma today admitted in the high court that he had dealt with a case after receiving a letter and a direction from an MLA and the then director-general of police, respectively. 
    
	He further added that though he had considered the representation from BJD MLA Parmeswar Sethi, on orders from DGP Amarananda Pattanayak, he had directed his subordinate officers to act in accordance to law. The IG made the statement, while making a personal appearance before the two judge bench of Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice B. Mohapatra in pursuance of a Court order. 
    
	The court, on Monday, had taken note of a change in the mode of inquiry into a murder at the behest of a ruling BJD MLA and directed Sharma to appear today to submit his clarification. The court had taken offense to the fact that the crime branch had taken over a probe of a Jajpur murder, while the matter was sub-judice.

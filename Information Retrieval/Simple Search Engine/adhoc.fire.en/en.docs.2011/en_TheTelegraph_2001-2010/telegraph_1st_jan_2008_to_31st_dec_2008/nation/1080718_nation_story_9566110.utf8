          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 17: Citing a report in The Telegraph, the BJP today asked the Prime Minister to tell the country whether the nuclear deal would be done irrespective of the outcome of the vote of confidence on July 22.        
	However, while expressing full confidence that the government would lose the trust vote, the BJP appeared keen to dilute the centrality of the nuclear deal during the debate on the motion and the electoral discourse later.        
	The Opposition party said the government should make clear the stand on the fate of the deal before the special session assembled on July 21 to debate the trust motion.        
	In Wednesdays edition, The Telegraph had quoted a highly placed source as saying that the nuclear deal would be done irrespective of the outcome of the trust vote.        
	We would like to alert MPs belonging to all parties about the governments conspiracy to make the outcome of the trust vote irrelevant to an international deal which has serious implications for Indias national security in perpetuity, the BJP said in a statement today.        
	The BJP noted with deep concern the report in The Telegraph, which has not been contradicted by the government so far.        
	It also asked the government why it had rushed a team of officials to meet the IAEA secretariat in Vienna tomorrow, four days before the trust vote. We demand that all further action in respect of the nuclear deal be suspended until the government proves its majority, the statement said.        
	The BJP said the effort to delink the deal and the trust vote is tantamount to showing disrespect and contempt for Parliament. On 20 July 2005  that is, two days after the Prime Minister and the US President issued a joint statement  Dr Manmohan Singh had said Parliament in our country is sovereign. It goes without saying that we can move forward only on the basis of a broad national consensus, it said.         
	However, the nuclear deal came last on the list of issues BJP leader Arun Jaitley showcased after a meeting with NDA allies and chief ministers. He said the NDA would like to have a national debate on issues like leadership failure, inner contradictions in the UPA, mismanagement of economy, agrarian distress, internal security and the nuclear deal.        
	Senior leader Venkaiah Naidu also betrayed the BJPs discomfiture in targeting the government on the nuclear deal when he said the main issue before the nation was the performance of the government. Other issues are secondary. The nuclear deal will be just one issue, he said.        
	Naidu also presented an independent Lok Sabha MP, Harish Nagpal from Amroha, as a prize catch.        
	Although Nagpal claimed he would vote against the UPA government, Naidu said he was not joining the BJP. But sources said Nagpal had reached some understanding with the party.

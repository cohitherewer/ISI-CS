	July 21: The CPM is likely to take action against Speaker Somnath Chatterjee after the trust vote for defying the directive to step down before the trial of strength, party sources said.        
	The central committee of the party had conveyed to the Speaker last evening that he should step down before the trust vote, but he stayed on.        
	Party sources said appropriate action would be taken after the trust vote. CPM leader Prakash Karat had said yesterday that the politburo would initiate appropriate action.        
	The CPMs Bengal chief, Biman Bose, parried questions whether he was assigned the task of persuading Chatterjee to step down. No, no, what is left for me to convince him? The partys decision has been communicated to him. I have nothing more to say, he said in Calcutta after returning from Delhi.         
	Other central committee members from Bengal, Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty, were tight-lipped.         
	A state party leader said the politburo would take action only if Chatterjee remained the Speaker even after the trust vote.         
	The question of disciplinary action will come only if he refuses to budge again, the leader said.

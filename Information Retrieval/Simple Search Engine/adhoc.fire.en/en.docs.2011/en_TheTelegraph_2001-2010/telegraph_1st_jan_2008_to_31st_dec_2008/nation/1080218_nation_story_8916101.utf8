The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eyes missing, Sonia terrain smells a rat
                                                                                                               Eyes missing, Sonia terrain smells a rat
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	Lucknow, Feb. 17: Sonia Gandhi may receive an unusual complaint when she travels to her constituency on Wednesday: the eyes of the dead are disappearing at the district hospital.        
	Patients relatives suggest a transplant racket is at work, their suspicions strengthened by the Gurgaon kidney scandal. Rae Bareli district hospital authorities blame rats in the mortuary.        
	Faced with a furious crowd yesterday after two bodies were handed over to families with their right eye missing, the hospital carried out a super-fast inquiry.        
	The districts chief medical officer, R.B. Singh, set up a probe committee which announced within hours that the eyes had been eaten by rats. The medical board, too, has confirmed this, Singh said.        
	Rae Bareli is not convinced. This isnt the first time. Last March, the relatives of four dead patients whose eyes went missing had sat on a dharna, a man said. Why couldnt the mortuary be freed of rats in so long a time?        
	It appears the handiwork of a human organ racket like the kidney transplant ring unearthed in Gurgaon (Haryana) and Moradabad (Uttar Pradesh), a joint police complaint by the families of the dead says.        
	Doctors not connected to the hospital said such a racket was possible provided the eyes were removed very quickly after death, preferably within two-three hours.        
	Raj Kumar Chaudhary, a relative of one of the dead, Nankau Nishad, said the two families would hand a petition to Sonia, their MP, when she arrives this week.        
	During every visit, Sonia Gandhi reminds officials to improve healthcare in the district but see whats happened, said Ashit Kumar, a relative of Akhilesh Kumar, the other dead patient.        
	Nishad, 60, died at home and Akhilesh, 24, was killed in a road accident around the same time on Friday evening. They were declared dead on arrival and the bodies were sent to the mortuary for the night.        
	Soon after their families received the bodies yesterday, a crowd of over 100 people gathered at the hospital and demanded an explanation on the missing eyes.        
	Some town residents said it was strange the rats never touched any other body part.        
	However, the hospitals chief medical superintendent, V.S. Tripathi, said: The rats often eat away large chunks of the bodies. They are a real menace and their population is growing. We have taken this case very seriously.        
	Doctors said it should be easy to tell between rat damage  which would leave the eye tissues and surrounding areas looking mauled and serrated  and the clean, surgical excision required for transplant.        
	I will look into the allegations, Tripathi said.

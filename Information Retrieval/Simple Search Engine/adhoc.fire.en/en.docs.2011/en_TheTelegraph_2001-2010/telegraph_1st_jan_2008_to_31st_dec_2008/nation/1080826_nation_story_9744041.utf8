	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 25: VHP international secretary-general Praveen Togadia today lambasted the BJD-BJP government in Orissa.         
	He held chief minister Naveen Patnaik and the state police responsible for death of VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati and demanded a public apology from him as his government had failed to protect the seer.         
	Describing the Naveen Patnaik government as a government of eunuchs, Togadia said: Six months ago, the swamiji was attacked. Even then, the chief minister and police behaved like eunuchs.         
	Naveen should publicly apologise, as he is responsible for the death. It was his individual responsibility to protect the seer, said the VHP leader, while talking to the reporters at the Biju Patnaik airport here.         
	Togadia, who left for Chakapada to attend the seers funeral, added: Naveen may agree or disagree, he is duty bound to protect the saints.         
	Asked whether he wanted the resignation of the chief minister, he quickly answered: We are not demanding Naveens resignation but a public apology.         
	Dubbing the murder as the first open attack on Hindu institutions and saints, the VHP leader demanded imposition of a ban on church activities.         
	Criticising the director-general of police, Gopal Nanda, for hinting at a red hand in the murder, Togadia asked how Nanda knew of the alleged Naxalite involvement just 30 minutes after the incident. He is lying and trying to mislead the people.         
	The seers murder has brought to the fore the tenuous relationship between the ruling BJP and its brethren organisations in the saffron family. Hindu Jagaran Samukhya and Bajrang Dal have asked the BJP ministers to resign from the government  immediately.         
	Even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik ordered a judicial probe into the incident and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of last nights attack victims, it has not assuaged the angry feelings of the Sangh Parivar.         
	BJPs meteoric rise in Orissa is said to be the outcome of the groundwork laid by the Sangh Parivar in the tribal belt.         
	Bajrang Dal national co-convenor Subash Chouhan also echoed Praveen Togadias complaints. Hindu Jagaran Samukhya state convenor Ashok Sahu also demanded the chief ministers resignation.         
	Both Chouhan and Sahu have dismissed the official theory of the Naxalite hand in the attack. The government has squarely failed in its constitutional duty, said Sahu rejecting the judicial inquiry ordered by the chief minister and demanding a CBI probe.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 23: The state government will promulgate an ordinance soon to enact a law on the lines of Andhra Pradesh to take action against mob attacks on doctors on duty and prevent damage to property in government-run health institutions.         
	The draft ordinance would be placed before the cabinet at its next meeting for its approval, said health services director Sukadev Sethi today.        
	After the draft ordinance receives the cabinet nod, it would be sent to the governor for the promulgation, sources here said.        
	Earlier last month, an assurance to this effect was given by chief minister Naveen Patnaik to a delegation of the Orissa Medical Service Association, the body representing government doctors working across the state.        
	Frequent mob attack on government doctors on duty at several places across the state on the allegation of negligence in duty has been a matter of concern. Recently, government doctors had gone on one-day strike in protest against mob attack on Dr Niranjan Nayak of Shergarh primary health centre in Ganjam district. Earlier in April, a senior professor of VSS Medical College amp; Hospital at Burla was seriously injured in a mob attack.        
	Enactment of legislation to prevent mob attacks on government doctors on duty was one of demands of the association, which had threatened that 3,000-odd government doctors would resign en masse from November 3 if the demands were not met.        
	The other major demands included formulation of a comprehensive transfer policy and cadre restructuring, conferment of junior Grade I status at the entry level, a specialist allowance of Rs 3,000 per month and a post-mortem allowance of Rs 500 per case.        
	Sethi said that the transfer policy and cadre restructuring had been tentatively finalised by the high power official committee and was likely to be announced soon after the approval of the chief minister.        
	The decisions on revision of specialist allowance from Rs 150 per month to Rs 3,000 and grant of post-mortem allowance of Rs 500 per case had been taken, he said.        
	Sethi appealed to the doctors to refrain from resigning en masse as the government had accepted their demands.

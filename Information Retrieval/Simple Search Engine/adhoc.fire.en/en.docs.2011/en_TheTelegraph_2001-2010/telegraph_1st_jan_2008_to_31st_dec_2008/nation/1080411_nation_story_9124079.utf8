	Thimpu, April 10: Bhutans ruling party will also play the role of the Opposition in the countrys first elected Parliament in what could be a unique experiment in a virtually Opposition-free parliamentary democracy.         
	We have no other choice to make democracy a success in Bhutan as the Opposition has only two seats in Parliament, Bhutans Prime Minister, Jigmi Y. Thinley, said in an interview to The Telegraph, his first to the foreign media since officially taking over yesterday.         
	The president of the ruling Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) also pledged to provide a transparent and corruption-free government in the Himalayan kingdom.        
	The 56-year-old leader, who studied at Dr Grahams Homes School in Kalimpong before majoring in English from St. Stephens College in New Delhi, said his party achieved far beyond what it had set out to, winning 45 of the 47 seats in the March 24 election to the National Assembly.         
	Yet, he said, he was aware of the small presence of the Opposition in Parliament and its effect on good governance. There is no denying that you need a strong Opposition to hold the government accountable, said Thinley.        
	Concerns, indeed, persist in Bhutan about the fate of the fledgling democracy, with the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) losing all but two seats despite bagging 33 per cent votes in the countrys first general election. So shocked were they by the result that the two PDP members withdrew themselves soon afterwards, plunging Bhutan into its first political crisis.         
	Luckily for Bhutan, it did not last long, with the two retracting their withdrawals late last week. We have considered our decision under pressure from our workers who wanted us to be in Parliament, said MP and former attorney-general Damcho Dorji.        
	The Prime Minister said his government was not oblivious to the fact that the PDP represents 33 per cent of the voters in Bhutan. We will listen to the two Opposition MPs. Their voices will not be muted.         
	But more importantly, Thinley said, the ruling party MPs would be asked to act like the Opposition. Our party members will be encouraged to speak their mind and raise different issues rather than toe the party line.         
	A year from now, the Prime Minister said, his countrymen may not feel the absence of an effective Opposition in Parliament. Our MPs will be no less vocal, if necessary, against our own government, he added.         
	The DPT will also make it mandatory for its MPs to visit their constituencies at least twice a year to get to know the peoples problems and raise them in Parliament, the leader said. This is perhaps the only way you could make the parliamentary democracy work in our country, said Thinley, who has appointed a 10-member cabinet but no defence minister.         
	Under Bhutans draft Constitution, expected to be adopted formally in Parliament soon, the Royal Bhutanese Army and the Royal Body Guards, which protect members of the royal family, will remain directly under the king, who is the supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The Royal Bhutan Police, however, will now come under the home ministry for maintaining law and order, the Prime Minister said.         
	Thinley said the monarchy will remain supreme in democratic Bhutan with the king as head of state. We will continue to draw inspiration from it.         
	Being Prime Minister is not new to Thinley, though.         
	He served one-year terms twice, first in 1998 and then in 2003, as rotational Prime Minister, as was the norm in pre-democracy Bhutan. But this time, it is different. I am now fully conscious of the historic significance of the present moment, he said.         
	Transparency and zero-corruption would be the other mantra of his government. To start with, the Prime Minister said, the first session of Parliament will be held in the open and broadcast live. His government will also make available all documents  except those on security  to public libraries and on official websites.         
	We are committed to ensuring transparency through public access to government, Thinley said, perched on a sofa in his party office on Chang Lam in Thimpu. The present king and his father stare down at him from a framed photograph on the wall.         
	To weed out corruption, the Bhutanese Prime Minister said, the anti-corruption commission, set up two years ago, would be strengthened and penalties hiked. He said his government would also propose state support to political parties so that they wont have to depend on private contributions and suffer from the consequent obligations.        
	As for foreign policy, Thinley, one of the six children of a late civil servant, said deepening relations with India  while maintaining Bhutans usually good relations with China, its other neighbour  would get the highest priority. And he has a closet desire.         
	Having virtually grown up in India, Thinley aides said, the first country he wants to be invited to is India. For him, it would be nothing short of a homecoming.

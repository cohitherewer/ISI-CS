                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A friendly neighbour charms with a letter
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Work in progress at Sachins plot in Bandra. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 17: The little master has again won the day with a masterstroke.         
	Sachin Tendulkar has sent a letter to would-be neighbours saying he was aware of the noise generated by work on his house and would ensure least inconvenience to all.         
	The cricketer is building a six-storey house on a plot in upscale Bandra where Dorab Villa, a 9,000sqft two-storey mansion, once stood. He bought the property for Rs 39 crore in May.         
	Piling work for the foundation began around two months ago, and the noise and hectic activity have caused residents of the neighbourhood some anguish.        
	In his letter, the master batsman writes that he was at the site when the work started. I am aware of the noise generated by the machine. I want to reassure you that I will make sure that the work is done in a manner causing least inconvenience to all. Your cooperation is appreciated and I look forward to moving into the neighbourhood soon, it says.         
	Copies of the letter, dated December 5 and signed Sachin R. Tendulkar, were delivered by his personal staff to over 120 families of Perry Cross Road, which is now eagerly waiting to welcome him by the end of 2009 when the house is expected to be ready.                    
	Sahil Kamat, an old resident of the neighbourhood, said all visitors to his home are asking to see Sachins letter. My grandchildren were thrilled to see the letter. We are going to preserve it, Kamat said.        
	The master batsman had brought cheer with his match-winning century against England a couple of days ago, which he dedicated to victims of the attack on Mumbai.         
	The letter has wiped away all the irritation among neighbours who say the continuous noise of dismantling the old structure was driving them up the wall.        
	The dismantling of Dorab Villa began a couple of months ago. Under municipality rules, they have surrounded the plot with high corrugated tin sheets to check the flying cement and dust. But it still did not help, especially as the hammering went on from morning to evening, said Rashmi Haritwal, a resident of a highrise opposite Sachins property.         
	Also, this being a narrow lane, the trucks that came and went with construction material created a traffic problem. But the sweet letter has changed the mood here completely. We are ready to bear with the trouble because of the humility with which he has approached his neighbours, Rashmi added.        
	Perry Cross Road is a quiet locality in otherwise bustling Bandra, which is also home to Shah Rukh Khan.        
	A stones throw from Sachins new home is Soona Villa, where actor Naseeruddin Shah and tennis star Leander Paes live. The cricketer now lives in Bandra Reclamation.        
	Local councillor Asif Zakaria applauded Sachins gesture. It is good to know that such a big person understands problems of the common man, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 7: The Nandan Kanan Zoological Park will soon house a captive breeding centre for Indian pangolins under a rear-and-release project introduced by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).         
	The special programme is also aimed at documenting the behavioural pattern and reproductive characteristic of the endangered nocturnal insectivore.         
	Sources said CZA particularly chose Nandan Kanan Zoological Park for the project as it had successfully carried out a breeding programme of Indian pangolins.         
	Though the insectivore hardly breeds in captivity, Nandan Kanan achieved the rare feat of breeding the mammal in a specially designed enclosure.        
	Conservation breeding of endangered species in captivity and then releasing them into the natural habitat to improve their status has always been a priority of the zoo. After successful breeding of white tigers and gharials, captive breeding of Indian pangolin is another step in that direction, said Ajit Patnaik, the director of Nandan Kanan Zoological Park.        
	The number of Indian pangolins in captivity is fast declining beacuse of its typical food habit. Being an insectivore, the animal feeds on ants and termites. Hence, while many zoos have failed to keep them alive, Nandan Kanan has been successful.         
	It was possible to sustain the insectivore because we had standardised locally available red weaver ants as an alternative feed, the zoo officials said.         
	The first baby Indian pangolin was born in captivity in November 2007.         
	Sources in the government said the special project would require an initial outlay of over Rs 17 lakh.

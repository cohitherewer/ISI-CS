                                                                                                               Immolation threat spurs govt action
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 16: Self-immolation threat by workers of Orissa Textile Mills (OTM) has apparently compelled the state government to make a last-ditch effort to prevent the auction of its assets.         
	Ten workers of the OTM have threatened self-immolation if the mill is not revived and its property is used for other purposes after a sell-off to a private party.         
	More than 100 workers have been staging a dharna in front of the mill at Choudwar, around 11km from here, for nearly 32 months demanding its revival.         
	The state-owned mill winded up in 2002. A liquidation process has been underway since then.        
	The government is keen to keep OTM now, as a proposed Rs 300-crore Integrated Textile Park project at Choudwar hinges on it.        
	There are clear indications that the government wants to make a fresh offer. However, no clear offer details has reached me as yet, D.K. Singh, the official liquidator for OTM, told The Telegraph today.        
	A clear picture would emerge on Monday when the government makes its fresh offer, added Singh.        
	The workers threatened self-immolation on Thursday. Official sources said, a day later (on Friday) a state counsel mentioned about the OTM auction before a company affairs bench and expressed the governments desire to stake a claim on its assets through a fresh offer.         
	The company affairs bench of Justice I.M. Quddusi, however, refused to take up the matter at that point and directed the counsel to bring up the matter when the liquidation case is taken up in court next  as is stated in court protocol.        
	Industrial Development Corporation of Orissa (IDCO) had earlier offered Rs 30 crore for the Orissa mill. But Bhubaneswar-based Koustuv Group had emerged as the frontrunner in the auction in the final round of bidding before the company affairs bench of high court on February 29 with an offer of Rs 43 crore.        
	The company affairs bench of Justice Quddusi had since then closed the bidding and ordered the submission of a written affidavit by Koustuv Group on its offer with the amount along with a detailed plan on how it intends to use the assets of the mill.        
	Prabhat Ranjan Mallik, the chairman of Bhubaneswar-based Koustuv Group, had indicated during the bidding that the firm would like to use the mill premises to set up a tin modulation unit.

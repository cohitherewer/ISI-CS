          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jayanta                                  
	Agartala, Oct. 21: A 26-year-old man hanged himself here last night after he found that he had bungled while trying to recoup his losses in the market downswing.         
	Jayanta Saha, a resident of Shanitola and son of an LIC development officer, had invested over Rs 18 lakh in equity shares, which had halved in the meltdown.         
	Jayanta did not hold a regular job but made a living by investing in the stock market.         
	He had planned to recoup the losses by making fresh investments in 700 more shares.        
	But while operating his demat account through the Internet yesterday, he keyed in an extra zero, thereby placing an order for 7,000 shares.         
	Jayanta, who had passed MCom from Tripura University, was alone at home as his parents had gone to Bangalore to visit his married sister.         
	After he realised his mistake, Jayanta spoke to his father in Bangalore over the phone and was told not to worry.         
	Apparently, it is a case of suicide though we have found no suicide note. Only papers containing accounts of share values were recovered from his bedroom, said Sanjay Biswas, officer-in-charge of East Agartala police station.         
	Jayanta was cremated today after a post-mortem.         
	Police sources said Jayantas father Santosh and his mother Manjushree arrived home this morning.        
	Jayanta was upset at having lost so heavily in the stock market, especially because part of the money was his fathers, Jayantas cousin Chhaya Saha, an LIC agent, said.        
	Chhaya said Jayantas parents had tried to calm him from Bangalore but he was inconsolable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Green cess on Delhi diesel cars
                                                                                                            Green cess on Delhi diesel cars
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Price for pollution                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Delhiites with diesel cars will have to cough up a green fee every time they top up their tanks.        
	The Delhi government has finally woken up to rising pollution levels and imposed an environment fee of 25 paise a litre on diesel vehicles.        
	The money will be used to create an air ambience fund to promote clean-air policies in Delhi.        
	The proposal to impose the cess on diesel was first mooted in 2002. At that time, the plan was to charge Rs 2 a litre, sources said. Diesel cars were to pay a higher registration fee, too.        
	Although a watered-down version of the original plan has been imposed six years on, Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the 25-paisa cess was at least a start.         
	We understand it must be tough as the diesel lobby is very strong. But the government has at least acknowledged diesel as a problem. We will push for more.        
	Narain has been pushing for a reduction in the number of diesel cars in Delhi for years. She said every third car in the city, which has over 5 million registered vehicles, ran on diesel. This number is likely to go up to 50 per cent in the next two years, she said.         
	The rise in the number of diesel cars and the lack of a good public transport system have been taking a toll on air quality, a study by the CSE has shown.        
	An analysis of air quality data last year showed that pollution levels were almost back to what they were in the pre-CNG days.        
	The annual average level of respirable suspended particulate matter  dust and soot particles  in residential areas was also higher than what was considered safe.        
	Levels of nitrogen oxides, too, have seen an upward trend, a clear indication of vehicular pollution.        
	The environment cess has been imposed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The money will be used to promote clean-air technologies, for waste management and to generate pollution awareness.

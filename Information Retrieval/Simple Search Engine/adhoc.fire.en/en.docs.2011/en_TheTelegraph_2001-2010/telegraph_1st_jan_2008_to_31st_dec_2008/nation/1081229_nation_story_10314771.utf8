	Peshawar, Dec. 28 (AP): A suicide bomber pretending to need help with his car killed 30 people at a poll booth in north-west Pakistan today.        
	The bombing underscored concerns that militant violence near the Afghan border could escalate now that Pakistan is shifting troops away from the region towards India.        
	The explosion also wounded 15 persons in Buner district bordering Swat, a valley where Pakistans army has waged a stop-start offensive against insurgents for over a year, police officer Beharmand Khan said.         
	The building targeted was a school, where voters were casting ballots in a by-election for a National Assembly seat.        
	The suicide attacker pulled his car outside the polling station and asked people to push the vehicle, saying it had broken down. His purpose was to gather maximum number of people around the car. The moment people started pushing the car, he blew it up, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister of the North West Frontier Province.        
	He said the attack was a message to the world that it is not possible to hold a peaceful election in this country.        
	The bombing followed reports that Pakistans army has restricted leave and was re-deploying troops away from the north-west  where many al Qaida and Taliban militants are based  towards the eastern border with India amid tensions over last months attacks in Mumbai.        
	Pakistani newspapers warned today Pakistan would be taking a huge gamble if it allowed the deteriorating relations with India to distract it from battling militants in the north-west, where it also is engaged in an offensive in the lawless tribal belt.        
	Pakistan just cannot afford to re-deploy any large number of its troops on the eastern border, leaving the wild west in a free fall, wrote the Dawn.        
	Proof handed over        
	The US and Britain have provided Pakistan evidence that elements in the country were involved in the Mumbai terror attack, according to western diplomatic sources who said Islamabad had not done enough to act on the intelligence.        
	The US and the UK are said to have handed over to Islamabad intercepts of satellite and mobile phone conversations between the attackers and their Pakistan-based handlers, PTI reported.

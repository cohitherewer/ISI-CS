          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: An Orissa police officer killed fighting Naxalites who had raided state armouries is one of two posthumous recipients of this years Ashoka Chakra.         
	The granting of the highest peacetime gallantry award to a policeman killed battling Naxalites is an indicator of just how seriously the government is taking the operations against ultra-Left militants.         
	The defence attache, the counsellor and the two Indo-Tibetan Border Police constables killed in last months suicide attack on the Kabul embassy have been named among the posthumous recipients of the Kirti Chakra.        
	Assistant commandant Pramod Kumar Satapathy of Orissa and R.P. Diengdoh of Meghalaya police top the Independence Day honours list of gallantry award winners. Neither are alive to accept their Ashoka Chakras.        
	Satapathy, the training-in-charge of a special operations group, led about 20 policemen on bikes to Nayagarh on February 15 after learning of raids on an armoury and police stations close to Bhubaneswar.         
	The raiders had retreated to the jungles of Ganjam and Phulbani districts. Satapathy drew up a battle plan to take on the Naxalites  believed to have been between 200 and 300  camping at an elevated location. The rebels opened fire on the police, killing Satapathy. The Naxalites fled but the police recovered some of the looted arms.        
	Meghalayas Diengdoh was killed on November 7 last year after he led a police team in a raid on a camp of the banned militant outfit Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland in a jungle near the border with Assam.         
	He asked the militants, armed with AK47 and AK56 rifles and explosives, to surrender but they opened fire. Diengdoh killed one of the militants before a bullet hit him under the left shoulder. He bled to death on the way to hospital.         
	The victims of the Kabul attack, among the recipients of the 124 gallantry awards announced today for armed and paramilitary forces, are Brigadier Ravi Datt Mehta (posthumous Kirti Chakra), V. Venkateswara Rao, counsellor (posthumous Kirti Chakra) and ITBP constables Ajay Singh Pathania and Roop Singh.         
	The list includes nine Kirti Chakras, 18 Shaurya Chakras, one Bar to Sena Medal, 87 Sena Medals, six Nao Sena Medals, one Vayu Sena Medal and five Presidents Tatrakshak (coast guard) Medals.

	Bid to blow away new airport blues    
	Complaints against Bangalores new airport seem to be rising at a faster pace than the number of flights it handles.    
	In an effort to stem the growing criticism of the hub at Devanahalli, the Karnataka government recently decided to set up a committee of MLAs to look into the alleged violation of conditions by the Siemens-led promoters.    
	The decision came after a number of MLAs, cutting across party lines, presented a litany of complaints against the airport, operational for over 10 weeks now, in the Assembly.     
	Some members alleged that the construction work was substandard while others said the terminal building resembled an air-conditioned godown, which did not reflect the states cultural ethos at all. There seems to be a lot of unhappiness with the number of chairs and toilets. Even the snacks on sale havent been spared.    
	Infrastructure and tourism minister G. Janardhan Reddy agreed to set up the committee. The panel, which will comprise members from the ruling and Opposition parties, will examine all the problems and suggest remedies.        
	Independent, with music    
	Surviving as independent musicians in India isnt easy. But the creative tribe simply cant give up. That was singer Palash Sens message at a special meeting of independent musicians organised by online portal TempoStand.     
	Sen, a trained doctor, is the lead vocalist of popular Hindi band Euphoria.     
	Titled Maa Tujhe Salaam, the meeting was aimed at encouraging independent musicians and composers to come up with songs on patriotism on the occasion of the 61st Independence Day.    
	The songs were then made available online on the portal. TempoStand is also producing an album of the best songs from the ones created at the meeting. The winner is likely to receive a cash prize of Rs 10,000. Sen is to announce the winner via podcast on the portal.    
	Divorce after 46 yrs apart    
	Love left them long back. Their marriage took place almost half a century ago.    
	Pohumal Gangwani and wife Sita, separated for 46 years since they tied the knot in an India under Nehru, officially ended a practically non-existent, but legally binding, marriage.    
	The divorce recently came through in Bombay High Court, which turned Sitas petition for alimony into an application for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent.    
	All these years, the Gangwanis, both in their late sixties, hadnt applied for divorce. The two got married in 1960 but had not been staying with each other since August 1962. In 1966, the Bandra metropolitan magistrate granted Sita maintenance of Rs 55 a month. This amount was revised from time to time.    
	In 2003, she filed a fresh plea demanding Rs 5,000 a month. The family court revised the amount to Rs 3,000 in May 2006. Pohumal was also restrained from selling off joint assets. He agreed to pay Rs 8 lakh as final alimony.        
	Pray, on toes    
	The recent serial blasts have turned Tamil Nadus temples into surveillance zones.    
	Cellphones were recently banned inside Madurais Meenakshi temple, where visitors are now looking over their shoulders for possible security personnel shadowing them.    
	Roaming and loitering are being discouraged, if not banned. Sitting around for long is viewed with suspicion.    
	All temple staff and shop owners will be given ID cards soon. Policemen will be on guard round the clock. Security at the airport and railway stations has been tightened.

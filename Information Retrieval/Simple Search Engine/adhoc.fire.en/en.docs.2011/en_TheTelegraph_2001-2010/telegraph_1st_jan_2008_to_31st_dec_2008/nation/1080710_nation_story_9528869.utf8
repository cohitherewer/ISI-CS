	New Delhi, July 9: The Centre today told the Supreme Court that enacting a law to regulate mushrooming fertility clinics could take some time.         
	The apex court had asked the government on September 28, 2006, to explain what it was doing to monitor the functioning of such clinics.        
	The poser followed a petition by one Anita Jayadevan, who had first moved Kerala High Court against such a clinic in the state but was turned away on the ground that courts couldnt do anything in the absence of a law.        
	Jayadevan then approached the apex court seeking a directive to the Centre to frame a law to register and monitor such clinics.

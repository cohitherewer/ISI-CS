                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Midnight once more for Rushdie
          AMIT ROY                          Salman Rushdie                                  
	London, May 11: Salman Rushdies Midnights Children, which won The Best of the Booker after the award had been going for 25 years, has been shortlisted once again for the prize which is to be given to mark its 40th anniversary, it will be announced tomorrow.        
	This is one occasion where having a lot of Indians across the world will help, for they will all be eligible to vote as the selection process is going online from tomorrow until midday (London time, presumably) on July 8, 2008.        
	William Hill has offered Rushdie 6/4 odds as the favourite to win again. The only danger for Rushdie is that people may vote not so much for the novel, which many believe to be the most important to have come out of postindependent India, but for Padma Lakshmis former husband who arouses strong passions, not always in his favour.        
	However, if Indians in India and across the diaspora choose to swing behind Rushdie, they could collectively outvote the other contenders.        
	Rushdies Midnights Children (Cape; paperback Vintage) won in 1981 and the Booker of Bookers in 1993. The New York Review of Books called it one of the most important books to come out of the Englishspeaking world in this generation.        
	The five other shortlisted books, chosen from the list of 41 Booker Prize and Man Booker Prize winners, are: Pat Barkers The Ghost Road (1995, Viking; paperback Penguin), Peter Careys Oscar and Lucinda (1988, Faber amp; Faber; paperback Faber), J.M. Coetzees Disgrace (1999, Secker amp; Warburg; paperback Vintage), Nadine Gordimers The Conservationist (1974, Cape; paperback Bloomsbury) and J.G. Farrells The Siege of Krishnapur (1973, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, paperback Phoenix).        
	Polling opens to the public to find the overall winner. Through online partnerships with national and international media, with libraries, reading groups and book retailers, millions of people across the globe have the opportunity of registering their votes for their favourite book from the shortlist.        
	Second favourite, according to William Hill, is Pat Barker at 3/1, followed by Peter Carey (4/1) and J.M. Coetzee at 5/1, Nadine Gordimer (8/1) and J.G. Farrell (10/1).        
	The six books span three decades  the earliest winner being J.G. Farrell in 1973, and the most recent J.M. Coetzee in 1999. Winning The Best of the Booker could mean a hattrick for either Coetzee or Peter Carey who are the only two writers to have won the Booker Prize twice.         
	The shortlist was selected by a panel of judges  the biographer, novelist and critic Victoria Glendinning (chair); writer and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup and John Mullan, professor of English at University College, London.         
	The overall winner of The Best of the Booker will be announced as part of the London Literature Festival at the Southbank Centre on 10 July where the winner will be awarded a custommade trophy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Doctors rising clouds health system
                                                                                                            Doctors rising clouds health system
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Orissa/Patna, Feb. 6: Cloud looms over the health system in eastern India, especially in Bihar and Orissa.         
	Reason: around 3,000 Bihar doctors are ready to go on a 48-hour strike from tomorrow and their Orissa counterparts (of same strength) have decided to resign en masse with effect from March 19.        
	We feel that we are no longer required in the state health system. Our grievances are neither heard nor are our problems addressed, said the president of Orissa Medical Services Association, M.S. Mishra. General secretary S.P. Singh concurred. The decision to quit was taken today in Orissa at a general body meeting of the medical association.         
	In Orissa doctors serve a population of 4 crore in 1,700 peripheral institutions.        
	Cut to Bihar where 3,000 doctors would go on a 48-hour strike from tomorrow to demand central pay-scale and time-bound promotion yet again. If the government does not concede to their demands by February 20, the doctors would proceed on an indefinite strike from February 21 midnight.         
	The doctors of Patna Medical College and Hospital and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital will not join the strike even as they would extend their support. However, all doctors working at 25 district hospitals, 70 referral hospitals, 23 sub-divisional hospitals, 533 primary health centres and 1,259 additional primary health centres under the Bihar State Health Services Association would stay away from work from midnight.         
	The state medic association spokesperson Ranjit Kumar told The Telegraph: Despite Patna High Court directive to meet our demands on December 27, 2007, the state has only filed an affidavit in the court saying it would be considered.         
	Complaints are similar in Orissa. There, doctors allege that they have never been consulted for any healthcare issues, while two successive health ministers have paid little heed to their demands. Naveen Patnaik had given an appointment for discussion with the medicos panel on August 19, 2006, but it was later postponed indefinitely.        
	In this context, we feel there is no other alternative for us than to resign en masse, said the chief of the doctors body in Orissa.

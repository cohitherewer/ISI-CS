  - Learning hub to take shape in five years          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Bhubaneswar, July 14: First investors, now Orissa is drawing attention of spiritual gurus from everywhere.        
	New Delhi-based Jagadguru Kripalu Yoga Trust today signed an MoU to set up a yoga and spiritual science university in Banki tehsil of Cuttack.         
	In December 2006, Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir Trust had signed an MoU with the government for a world class multi-disciplinary university at Naraj near Cuttack. The MoU was signed in presence of guru Ravishankar and chief minister Naveen Patnaik.        
	States higher education minister Samir Dey, who was present at todays event, said the government was searching for a suitable promoter for the establishment of a yoga and spiritual science university, as a part of its human resource development policy when this offer came along.        
	The trust is involved in promoting yoga and spiritual sciences across the country. They will set up a university in a phase-wise manner over five years in the state.         
	For the first phase, the trust has sought 110 acres of land near a water body and another 140 acres close to the first location.         
	The government has identified the required land at Banki in Cuttack, said the minister, adding that the land would be allotted on payment of premium according to norms.         
	Ajit Kumar Kar, who signed the MoU on behalf of the trust, said the proposed university would cater to the needs of 10,000 students in spiritual, yoga and secular disciplines. It would offer bachelor degree courses in naturopathy, yoga sciences, rural economics and development dealing with health, hygiene, management, oriental learning, yoga therapy and social work. The proposed campus would have a sports complex, recreation facilities, utility centres, meditation halls and laboratories.        
	The proposed university would be the fourth private university after the ones promoted by Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir Trust, Vedanta Foundation and Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India that had signed MoUs with the government in the past.        
	In April 2008, the cabinet gave its nod to a proposal for the enactment of a unitary law facilitating the establishment of a private university to be set up by yoga guru Ravishankar.         
	The state law allows only the establishment of government-run universities.         
	The BJD government therefore drafted a law to facilitate the establishment of self-financed and self-governed private universities.

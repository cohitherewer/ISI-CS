	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 7 (PTI): Citing lack of credible evidence, Orissa Human Rights Commission today gave a clean chit to former Assembly Speaker Maheshwar Mohanty in a case relating to sexual harassment charges levelled against him by a lady marshal of the House.        
	In view of lack of credible evidence and variation in statements of the victim, we are closing the case, commissions chairman Justice R.K. Patra said adding the allegations made by lady marshal Gayatri Panda could not be established.        
	The charges of sexual harassment levelled by Panda against Mohanty had rocked the state during the last budget session of the Assembly, leading to Mohantys resignation as Speaker in March.        
	Justice Patra, however, made it clear that that the case against Mohanty would continue in the womens police station. Mohanty and Panda were not present when the commission pronounced its verdict. Stating that a woman would not approach the commission without something derogatory to her dignity, he said in this case none of the evidence is credible and, therefore, not acceptable. Therefore, we have decided to close the case.        
	Reacting to the ruling, Pandas counsel U.K. Mishra said: This is not a defeat. We will take further steps.

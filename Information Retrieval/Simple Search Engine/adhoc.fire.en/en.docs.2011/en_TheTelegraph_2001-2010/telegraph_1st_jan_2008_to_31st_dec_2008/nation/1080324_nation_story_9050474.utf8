The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Airport faces fresh strike
                                                                                                               Airport faces fresh strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, March 23: Littered lounges and stinking toilets will again greet passengers at Calcutta airport on April 10, thanks to a strike by some 1,500 contract staff and casual labourers.        
	There could be a shortage of drinking water and passengers may not find trolleys outside the terminals, but an official said flight movement would not be affected.        
	Passenger services will be partially affected but flights will operate normally to and from Calcutta, the official said.        
	The contract staff and casual labourers mainly load luggage into aircraft, clean the terminals and aircraft, and operate the aerobridges and the pump. Some work as drivers or runway bird-watchers, some maintain the conveyor belts and other equipment, and others retrieve the trolleys.        
	The strike by the Citu-backed ground workmens union, which has handed in a 14-point charter of demands including pay rise, was finalised by vote tonight. A total of 1,476 workers voted for the strike and only six voted against, a union spokesperson said.        
	We were compelled to call the token strike since our demands were not being met by the authorities, said Pronab Chakraborty, union joint secretary.        
	A strike by the Airports Authority of India Employees Union on March 12 and 13 had paralysed passenger facilities at the city airport.        
	For two days, litter piled up in the terminals, the toilets became unusable, trolleys were scarce, and there was an acute shortage of drinking water.        
	Hyderabad launch        
	Two SpiceJet flights became the first to land at the new Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad today, though the airport near Hyderabad was expecting Lufthansa to touch down first.        
	The Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt was to arrive at 12.30am and the SpiceJet flights at 12.50am and 12.55am. But SG 397 from Ahmedabad landed at 12.15am and SG 393 from Mumbai at 12.20am.        
	We didnt know that the two flights had been rescheduled, an official said. Still, it was the Lufthansa passengers who got the special welcome lined up for the first flight.

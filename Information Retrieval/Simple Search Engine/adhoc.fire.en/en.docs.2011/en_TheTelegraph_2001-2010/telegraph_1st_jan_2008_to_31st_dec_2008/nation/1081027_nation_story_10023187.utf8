                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Food scare for strife-torn Kandhamal

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 26: Strife-torn Kandhamal has been identified as one of the most food insecure districts.        
	In terms of food security, Kandhamal  along with three other southern hilly and tribal populated districts Rayagada, Nabarangpur and Gajapati  was found to be extremely insecure in the food security atlas for rural Orissa.        
	Kandhamal also emerged as the worst-performing district in terms of food availability index. Among the 30 districts in Orissa, Kandhamal finds its place on the bottom of the ladder in terms of per capita agricultural output (Rs 899 per annum), irrigation extent (13.5 per cent of the cultivated area) and rural connectivity (20.53 per cent).        
	The atlas, prepared by Delhi-based Institute of Human Development on behalf of the United Nations World Food Programme, revealed that the overall agricultural productivity in Orissa is very low with most districts having less than one-third cultivated area under irrigation.        
	People in Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada and Malknagiri districts have the lowest access to food. They spend less than Rs 250 per person on food, which is below the national expenditure level. Kandhamal, Gajapati, Rayagada and Malkangiri have under-five mortality higher than 160 with more than half of their children being underweight.        
	Less than half the population in the state has access to primary health facilities. The situation is still worse in most of the northern and southern districts of Rayagada, Malkangiri, Kandhamal and Gajapati. Rural connectivity is very poor in Kandhamal, Malkangiri, Koraput, Gajapati, Rayagada and Boudh districts, where more than two-third villages do not have access to paved roads.        
	Releasing the atlas yesterday, Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen said: It provides adequate information for providing specific inputs in designing district-level interventions. The atlas marks the beginning of a comprehensive food security information system for the state and will enable more rational allocation of resources to the most vulnerable areas for improving food and nutritional security s, said Mihoko Tamamura, United Nations World Food Programme representative and country director for India.

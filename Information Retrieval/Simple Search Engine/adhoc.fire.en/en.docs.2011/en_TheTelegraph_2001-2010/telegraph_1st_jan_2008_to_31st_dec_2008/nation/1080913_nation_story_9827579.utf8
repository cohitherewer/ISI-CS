          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bush: Fuel flutter                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Senior government officials today expressed concern at the US Presidents statement that fuel supply assurances to India were not legally binding, and said Delhi would ask Washington to clarify the matter.        
	President George W. Bush had yesterday told the US Congress that the fuel assurances were only political commitments that would not become legally binding commitments if Congress ratified the nuclear deal.        
	According to Indian officials, Bushs observations indicate he was interpreting the 123 Agreement differently while presenting it to the US Congress. They said the agreement clearly spelt out Americas responsibility to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply.        
	Officials here said the agreement obliged the US to supply fuel and to work with friends and allies to enable India to obtain full access to the international fuel market, including reliable, uninterrupted and continual access to fuel supplies from firms in several nations.        
	Bushs statement, however, was in keeping with a secret US state department letter leaked a few days ago, which said Washington would stop nuclear co-operation if Delhi conducted a test, triggering a furore in India.        
	By terming the assurances political commitments, Bush appears to have left it to the next President and his successors to decide if they want to stick to those commitments.        
	CPM jab        
	The CPM today said Bushs statement had proved once more that the UPA government had consistently misled the country on the nuclear deal. It said his words contradict Delhis claim that it had received guarantees for uninterrupted fuel supplies and perpetual safeguards.        
	(Bushs) note states there are no legally binding assurances on the US for fuel supplies. It also makes clear that the IAEA safeguards are in perpetuity and not as Indian officials claimed. Thus, while the US does not guarantee assured nuclear fuel supplies, India has accepted its safeguards in perpetuity, a politburo statement said.        
	The CPM argued that Bushs observation was of a piece with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees statement on September 5 that India would join international efforts to stop the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies.        
	(This is) an obvious reference to Iran. Clearly India has succumbed to US pressure to deny Iran the rights as it was a signatory of the NPT. On all these issues, it is the Hyde Act which has prevailed. This is precisely what the Left parties have been saying, the politburo statement said.

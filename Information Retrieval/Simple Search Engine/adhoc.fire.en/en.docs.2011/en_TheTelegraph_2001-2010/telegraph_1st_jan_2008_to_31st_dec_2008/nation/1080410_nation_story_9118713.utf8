  - Party fires letters to firms demanding reservation for sons of soil        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Raj Thackeray                                
	Mumbai, April 9: Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has demanded 80 per cent job reservation in the private sector for sons of the soil.        
	The move is likely to set the tone for the partys first major rally since its anti-north Indian campaign. It is scheduled to be held early next month.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Kamgar Sena (MNKS), the labour wing of the two-year-old party, has sent letters to several private sector companies asking them to give priority to locals when considering job applications.        
	Two days ago, we sent letters to about 45,000 private sector companies, Manoj Chavan, the MNKS chief, said.         
	The letter claims the government had earlier stipulated the 80 per cent job quota for those living in the state for 15 years. We have received complaints that this policy is being openly flouted by companies, who are employing workers from outside Maharashtra because they are willing to work for lower wages. This is unjust to the sons of the soil.         
	But government officials said they could not recall any such quota.        
	Chavan said more letters were on the way. Globalisation is fine, but where will locals go if they cant be employed in this state? We want companies to provide first preference to the locals and if they do not find suitable candidates, then they can take candidates from other states. We havestarted with private limited companies, but we will gradually write to the railways, the income-tax department, and even BPOs.         
	He added that security companies like Tops Security had begun recruiting locals as supervisors and security guards.         
	The MNS campaign has evoked sharp protests from industry associations.         
	Niraj Bajaj, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, said in a statement that such reservation would prove detrimental to industry and the concept of economic competitiveness.         
	Bajaj, a cousin of industrialist-MP Rahul Bajaj, said the Constitution guaranteed all Indian citizens the right to earn their livelihood in any part of the country.         
	It is one India. The right to work anywhere in the country must be protected unconditionally by the state government concerned. It is tarnishing the unique image of Mumbai as a cosmopolitan and large-hearted city that welcomes and accommodates all those who seek opportunities for work and contribute to Maharashtras growth process, he said.         
	The MNS drive against migrants mirrors Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackerays campaign in the 1960s targeting south Indians. The Sena had attacked Udipi restaurants to drive south Indians away.        
	A few years ago, when Raj was still with the Sena, his supporters had allegedly attacked students from Bihar travelling to Mumbai for the railway recruitment exam. Examination centres were also vandalised.        
	Raj raked up the sons-of-the-soil campaign again earlier this year and was arrested on February 13 for making provocative speeches against north Indian migrants.        
	The MNS chief is slated to address his first big public rally since the controversy on May 3 at Shivaji Park, where he has promised to unveil a fresh agenda for his partys campaign leading to the 2009 elections.

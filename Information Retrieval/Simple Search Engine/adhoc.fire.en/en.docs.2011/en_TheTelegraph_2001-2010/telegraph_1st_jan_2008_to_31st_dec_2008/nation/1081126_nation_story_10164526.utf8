                              Joseph Pallipurath                            
	New York, Nov. 25 (AP): A Keralite of Indian origin accused of fatally shooting his estranged wife and another man inside a church has been captured in Georgia.        
	Joseph Sanish Pallipurath, who drove from California to New Jersey to confront his wife, was arrested around midnight on Monday in Monroe, east of Atlanta, said New Jersey district US marshal James Plousis.         
	Joseph, from Sacramento in California, is suspected of shooting and killing 24-year-old Reshma James inside the St Thomas Syrian Orthodox Knanaya Church in Clifton, New Jersey. Also killed was church director Dennis John Malloosseril.        
	A third person, Reshmas cousin Silvy Perincheril, was shot in the head. Reshma, also from Kerala, had taken out a restraining order against Joseph, prosecutors said.        
	In California, the suspects father had called on him to surrender, as did relatives of one of the victims.        
	All three victims were shot once in the head and didnt regain consciousness, depriving investigators of the opportunity to question them.         
	The search for Joseph had centred on Georgia, where he has relatives, the prosecutors said.        
	After fleeing three months ago from what relatives said was an abusive arranged marriage in California, Reshma moved to New Jersey and stayed with Silvy. The couple were married just over a year ago in India and moved to Sacramento in January.

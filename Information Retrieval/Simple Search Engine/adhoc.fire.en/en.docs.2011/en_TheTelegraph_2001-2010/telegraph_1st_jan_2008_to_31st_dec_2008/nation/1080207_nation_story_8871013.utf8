The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chopper to rally ground, Behenjis a hit
                                                                                                            Chopper to rally ground, Behenjis a hit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 6: Uttar Pradesh chief minister created a history today by landing straight from her chopper on to the Gandhi Maidan to address a rally  no leader has managed such a dramatic entry so far.         
	In her maiden address after assuming office as the UP chief minister, Behenji (as she is called by her cadre) made it clear that she was working hard to repeat the UP experiment in Bihar in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls due early next year.         
	She also revealed her ambition to become the Prime Minister of India with the support of the sarvajan (people from all sections) which was the central theme of her hour-long speech today.         
	The BJP and its supporting parties have based their politics on dividing the society on religious lines. The Congress and its partners, too, had been ruling the country by pitting one section of the society against another. Divide and rule, much like the British government, is the common trait of the so-called mainstream parties. The BSP is the only party that has based its political philosophy on the sarvajan, she said, looking towards senior party leader, Satishchandra Mishra, a Brahmin.         
	Propping up her logic, her cadre shouted: Desh ka pradhan mantri kaise ho; Mayavati jaise ho.         
	Her address here was a part of preparations for what will culminate into the Sarvjan Bhaichara Banao Mahasammelan (Grand convention for restoring brotherhood) at New Delhi.         
	The New Delhi mega- convention, for which we will announce the date later, will make our position and strength clearer to other parties, she shouted.         
	Mayavati addressed a moderate gathering here.         
	Instead of being intimidated, the most popular Dalit leader, Ram Vilas Paswan, preferred to ignore the meeting. Bihar is no UP, Paswan simply said, while the other two of Bihars triumvirate (Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad) refrained from commenting.

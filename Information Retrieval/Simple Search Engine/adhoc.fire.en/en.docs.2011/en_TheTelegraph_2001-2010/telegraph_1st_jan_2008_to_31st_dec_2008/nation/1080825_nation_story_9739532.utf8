The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar and Mehbooba seek talks 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Omar and Mehbooba seek talks 
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The two young leaders of Kashmir politics today accused the Centre of double standards in dealing with the protests in Jammu and those in the Valley.         
	If talks can be initiated in Jammu, the same yardstick should be applied to Kashmir. Why did the all-party team that visited the Valley not meet the fruit growers, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah asked.        
	PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti seemed more aggressive at a separate news conference, saying security forces were quick to shoot in the Valley while looking the other away at trishul-wielding protesters in Jammu.        
	Both seemed to agree, though, that the Amarnath land logjam could be broken only through dialogue.         
	They also appeared to share the view that the Centre had allowed the problem to fester, with Mehbooba critical of former governor S.K. Sinhas role in sparking the trouble.        
	Omar suggested the Centre initiate talks with the separatist leaders in the Valley on a priority basis and said curfew wasnt a solution.        
	The Centre should start looking for ways and means to bring the separatist leaders to the discussion table, he added.        
	Mehbooba, too, came out against the use of force, saying suppression, oppression, coercion and violence could not resolve the issue.        
	All have to sit together. The members of Amarnath Shrine Board, the action committee, the separatists and the administration.

	Gaya, Feb. 19: The five-day cultural extravaganza, Tarang, ended on a festive note on Tuesday with vice-chancellors, principals and even a Raj Bhavan official joining the dancing college students on Gaya roads.        
	Leading from the front was principal of GBM College Shanti Singh. In order to infuse enthusiasm among her students, she started dancing with the students at a road show organised as part of the closing ceremony.         
	The youthful spirit of the GBM College principal infected Maghad University vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey, officer on special duty (Raj Bhavan) Krishna Kumar, other vice-chancellors, principals and teachers also. All of them joined in the celebrations with the participants, much to the delight of Gaya residents.        
	The five-day cultural extravaganza was organised to search for cultural talent and give talented people much-needed platform and exposure. The road show was aimed at making people aware of the events that took place at Magadh University, about 13km from town, said Kumar. Spreading the message of Tarang  sanskriti (culture), srijan (creativity) and samvad (interaction)  was another motive for the show.        
	Teachers and students covered a 3km stretch with a mix of traditional and modern dances as part of the road show. The public show of happiness by academics, who temporarily discarded their sobriety, is being regarded as a trend-setting incident. Gulal on the faces and grey hairs of the academics presented a spectacular show that would be remembered for a long time, said MG College vice-principal Arun Kumar Prasad.         
	Before flagging off the show, vice-chancellors Prema Jha (Bhagalpur University) and Qamar Ahsan (Maulana Mazharul Haque Arabic and Persian University) conveyed their best wishes to the participants. About 500 students had taken part in cultural events such as dance, drama, music events, debate, elocution, quiz, cartooning, painting and rangoli.         
	The closing ceremony was held at the university stadium, where Governor-cum-chancellor R.S. Gavai distributed prizes to the winners.         
	He asked the participants to retain the spirit of healthy competition. Dances and ghazals were also organised at the ceremony.

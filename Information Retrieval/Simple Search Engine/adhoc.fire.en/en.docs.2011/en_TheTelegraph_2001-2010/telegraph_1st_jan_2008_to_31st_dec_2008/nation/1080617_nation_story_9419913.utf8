	Cuttack, June 16: Mountaineer Kalpana Dash has opted out of the assignment of scaling Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. For, she is still suffering from high altitude hypoxic injury.         
	I will not be a part of the mission as I have been advised to take rest after a health check-up at the SCB Medical College and Hospital today, she told reporters here.         
	She has been advised rest for three months because she has not recovered fully, SCB Medical College and Hospital superintendent D.N. Maharana told The Telegraph today.         
	Pradip Dash, the ace mountaineers brother, said: We came in for the check up, as she complained of breathing problem and joint pain last night.         
	Her health check-up included clinical examination at the orthopaedic, TB and chest diseases and cardiology departments.         
	Her chest X-ray and ultrasound reports indicated that her clinical condition was normal now. There were no signs of pulmonary oedema and fluid accumulation in her lungs any more, the hospital superintendent said on the basis of observations made by D.P. Das, the head of the TB and chest diseases department.         
	There were signs of high-altitude hypoxic injury and the effect of muscular strain during her Everest climb. She might need more rest before she gets better, he explained.         
	Kalpana (41), a Dhenkanal-based lawyer, is the first woman from the state to climb Everest on May 21.         
	She achieved the feat 24 years after ace mountaineer Bachendri Pal.         
	Dash had been suffering from high-altitude pulmonary oedema since she reached the Everest summit. It had caused fluid accumulation in her lungs.         
	She was under intensive care at Norvic International Hospital in Kathmandu before returning to Dhenkanal on June 7.

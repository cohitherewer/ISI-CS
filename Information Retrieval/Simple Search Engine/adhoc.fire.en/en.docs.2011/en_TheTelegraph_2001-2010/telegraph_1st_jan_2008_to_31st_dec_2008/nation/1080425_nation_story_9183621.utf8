          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 24: After land, Orissa is now witnessing protests over allocation of water to industrial houses.         
	Though industrialisation boosts growth, it creates water wars among rural and urban population, admitted state industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, who also holds the rural development portfolio.        
	Harichandan was speaking at a national conference on water resource development in mining and mineral-based industries here today.         
	Each mineral-based industry should have a comprehensive plan for their own reservoir, an affluent treatment plant and recycle system, said the minister while inaugurating the event.        
	Presently, 10 per cent of fresh water in India is used by industrial sector.         
	As industries consume a substantial volume, its up to them to address the problem. Ironically, mineral-rich Orissa has attracted more mining and mineral-based industries.         
	Such industries should now plan to develop their own water resources in order to solve the crisis and continue industrialisation, he said. The minister also advised the industries to go for rainwater harvesting and recharge of aquifers.         
	Water wars have caused headaches for both industries and the Orissa government that has signed more than 50 MoUs with private companies promising them to supply water for the proposed projects.        
	Farmers in western Orissa have been agitating against the diversion of Hirakud water to the industries.         
	Opposition parties have staged demonstrations to protest the move to provide water to Posco and other industrial houses from the Mahanadi river.

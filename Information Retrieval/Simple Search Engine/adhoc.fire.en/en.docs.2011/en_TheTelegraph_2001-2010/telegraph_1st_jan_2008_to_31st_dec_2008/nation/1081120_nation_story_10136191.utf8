	New Delhi, Nov. 19: India and Pakistan are hoping to resolve the Sir Creek dispute in December because any delay could internationalise the issue under a UN convention to which both are signatories, reports our special correspondent.        
	Sources said both sides were working for a breakthrough in the next round of the composite dialogue which is scheduled in New Delhi on December 2-3.        
	Under the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, all maritime boundary conflicts have to be resolved by 2009, failing which the UN may declare disputed areas as international waters.                          
	Sir Creek is one issue where we expect a breakthrough. Let us wait for the December meeting, a foreign ministry source said.        
	Sir Creek is a 96km strip of water in the Rann of Kutch between Gujarat and Sindh province in Pakistan  that opens into the Arabian sea. Eight rounds of talks and a joint survey have not solved differences.                    
	The issue dates back to 1914 when a pact, signed between the then Government of Sindh and Rao Maharaj of Kutch, agreed to a boundary line running through the middle of the creek as a border between the two states.        
	The final demarcation was completed in 1925 in which the boundary was shown by a green line on the eastern side of the creek.        
	India contends that the green line was simply an indicative line and the boundary should be defined by the mid-channel of the creek as shown on the map of 1925. But Pakistan believes the notion of mid-channel is applicable only to navigable channels and this one was not.        
	Kashmir, Siachen, peace and security and bilateral trade and economic relations will also figure in the December talks.

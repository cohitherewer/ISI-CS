          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The BJP, in a spot over terror allegations against Hindu outfits, is digging up cases to prove that the Congress, too, has been tarred with the same brush.         
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar reeled off charges against Congress leaders in a statement today.         
	Mohammad Surti, who was a minister in the Congress government in Gujarat, has been sentenced to 20 years in an arms smuggling case. The Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind has submitted to Sonia Gandhi names of 40 Congress leaders who were involved in the Godhra riots, he said.        
	The statement cited several incidents in Assam where Congress leaders were allegedly involved.         
	Congress member Vimal Mushari, who is an associate of Assam revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman, has been arrested in the recent blasts case. Another Assam minister, Hemant Biswasharma, has Tada (anti-terror) and arms act cases pending against him. Terrorists arrested for the Dhemaji blasts in Assam in 2005 have confessed that they received instructions from former Congress minister Bharat Narah, Javadekar said.        
	The statement alleged that it was no secret that Congress ministers in Jammu and Kashmir were shielding terrorists in the Valley.         
	The BJP cited cases from Maharashtra, too. NCP corporators Sabir Sheikh has been arrested for the recent communal riots in Dhulia. Another Congress leader, M.M. Sheikh, has been charged in the (2002) Sholapur riots, the statement said.        
	This is just the beginning, we will thoroughly expose the Congress, the BJP spokesperson warned.

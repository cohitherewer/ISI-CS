          SUBRAT DAS                          The breach on Puri-Bhubaneswar NH-203 near Teaishpur on Monday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: Floods in the Puri district have cast a shadow over the tourism industry with road communication between Bhubaneswar and Puri being cut off because of breaches in the Bhargavi river.        
	Even the railway service, the only available alternative, had to be suspended this afternoon as tracks between Delang and Birapratappur on the Bhubaneswar-Puri section went under water.        
	East Coast Railway officials said the train services would be suspended for indefinite period till the floodwater receded and damaged tracks repaired. Three trains plying on the route had been cancelled, while a few others, including Jodhpur-Puri Express and Puri-Tirupati Express, had been detained en route, the officials said.        
	The unforeseen development worried tour operators in Puri and Bhubaneswar. The disruption of road communication between Bhubaneswar and Puri has already affected the tourist inflow. It will further affect if the flood continues till Durga Puja, said Sailendra Patnaik, the general manager of Swosti Travels.        
	Patnaik said thousands of tourists from Bengal visit the beach town during the Puja. Some tour operators from Calcutta had enquired about the alternative routes after the road communication between Bhubaneswar and Puri was snapped. We had suggested them to divert the bookings through railways. But now with the disruption of train traffic, the bookings may have to be cancelled, he added.        
	Arrival of tourists from Bengal generally starts during Durga Puja. With less than a fortnight left, tour operators are left in the lurch.         
	Our bookings and preparations for Puja have been over. But the sudden development is a matter of concern, said Surajit Banerjee, the manager of Hotel Victoria Club in Puri.         
	Sunil Patnaik, the district tourist officer in Puri, said not many tourists had been stranded in the temple town after the disruption of road communication. This is a lean tourist season up to September-end. Those who had come by tourist buses went back by train, he said.

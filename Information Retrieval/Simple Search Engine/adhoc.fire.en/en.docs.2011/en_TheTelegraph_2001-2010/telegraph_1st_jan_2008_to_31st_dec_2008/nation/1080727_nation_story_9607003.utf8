                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New bomb? No sweat

	Bangalore, July 26: Police defused a bomb nearly 24 hours after eight low-intensity explosions killed a woman and injured seven in the countrys IT capital, but the weekend crowd shrugged off the attack to throng the citys hotspots.        
	Malls and multiplexes recorded the same number of footfalls as last weekend, even if it meant visitors were frisked and their bags searched.        
	Security staff at Forum Mall struggled to keep pace with the tide of people around noon today though 100 metres down the road a live bomb was the centre of attention.        
	Nitya Sridhar, accompanied by her husband and child, was shopping for shoes. We are aware that crowded places have to be avoided, but bombs cannot explode every day, she said. Life has to go on.        
	Children were back to school this morning as the new BJP government had refused to declare a holiday for educational institutions.        
	The morning traffic was like every other day and buses were full, said Pushpalatha, a schoolteacher.        
	For Rajan and Umesh and their friends, today was movie time at Garuda Malls multiplex on Magarath Road. We arent worried about more explosions. If we allow ourselves to be frisked and our bags to be searched, we will all be safe, the college students said.        
	The police beefed up security at all vital installations and will meet multinational and IT company representatives next week to discuss security. State government sources said they hoped the Centre would amend laws to enable private companies to get central paramilitary security as promised by the Union home minister yesterday.        
	Chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa asked IT firms not to panic. Investigations are on and the government will take all necessary steps to scale up security in the state, he said.        
	State police chief R. Srikumar said the explosives appeared to have been professionally assembled and police were looking into all possible angles, including the involvement of foreign terror groups.        
	More clues have been gathered from the unexploded device recovered today. We have several leads and are following up on them, he said.        
	No terror group has so far claimed responsibility.        
	Police sources said around 10am, the control room got a call from a shop owner that a bucket with wires jutting out was lying near a wall on the busy Hosur Road. The spot is between Forum Mall and Madiwala, where the first bomb went off yesterday.        
	Balaji N., who owns a shop on the stretch, wondered how the bomb could have gone unnoticed for almost 24 hours and said someone might have planted it this morning.        
	City police commissioner Shankar Bidari allayed such fears and said it may have gone unnoticed yesterday as the action was elsewhere down the road.        
	Police and National Security Guard teams defused the bomb around 11.45. Police said the defused bomb, identical to those that exploded yesterday, contained low-grade ammonium nitrate and was attached to a small timer circuit.        
	Deconstructing this improvised explosive device will give us an idea of what the other eight contained, a bomb squad member said as a crowd of onlookers clapped.        
	The public doesnt know the danger caused by exploding bombs, complained a constable. They are coming so close.

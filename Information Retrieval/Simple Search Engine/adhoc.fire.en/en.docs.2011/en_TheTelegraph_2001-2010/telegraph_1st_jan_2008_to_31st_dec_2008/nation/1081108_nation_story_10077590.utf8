          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 7: Orissa Private Engineering College Association (Opeca) has filed a petition in the high court seeking filling up of vacant seats in BTech and MCA courses through college-level counselling.        
	Several seats are vacant in member colleges of Opeca due to non-reporting and drop out by students for the current academic session 2008-09, the petition said. If the seats remain vacant in the institutions, meritorious students in the Orissa Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and All India Engineering Entrance Examination merit lists will be deprived from pursuing higher technical education, the Opeca petition claimed.         
	Besides, the technical institutions will have to bear the cost for the vacant seats till the end of the batches concerned. This will lead to serious financial crisis in the institutions, the petition claimed.         
	The Opeca further has claimed that member colleges that have set up institutions by utilising funds from their resources without having any grants from the government would incur expenses towards the payment of teaching and non-teaching staff.         
	Opeca secretary Binod Kumar Dash, who filed the petition, has urged the chairman of Joint Entrance Examination, 2008, commissioner-cum-secretary and chairman, policy planning body in the department of industries and directorate of technical education amp; training, to allow filling up the vacant seats in BTech and MCA courses through college- level counselling from the JEE merit list.         
	But the authorities have not considered it, the Opeca secretary rued.

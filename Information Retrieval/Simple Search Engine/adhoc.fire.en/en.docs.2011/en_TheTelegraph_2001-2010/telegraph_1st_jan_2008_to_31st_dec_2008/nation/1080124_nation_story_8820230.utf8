	Raipur, Jan. 23: A publisher said to be from Calcutta has been arrested in Chhattisgarh on the basis of leads given by a Maoist woman commander captured during an arms drop.
    
	A.K. Sengupta, who runs a publishing house called Apurva Prakashan, was arrested after a raid on his Raipur home last night, police said.
    
	Police sources claimed to have found in the house a Raipur map showing politicians houses, including that of chief minister Raman Singh, marked in red. 
    
	The police added that Maoist literature in Bengali and Tamil was also seized. Sengupta is also a writer and he takes English coaching classes in the area. 
    
	A Raipur-based freelance journalist, Prafulla Jha, was also arrested in a related crackdown.
    
	Both arrests were carried out after the police caught Shantipriya, the Maoist commander, on Monday.
    
	As many 91 country-made pistols and 26 foreign wireless sets were found in the eight travelling bags the commander and her driver dropped after the police pursued them.

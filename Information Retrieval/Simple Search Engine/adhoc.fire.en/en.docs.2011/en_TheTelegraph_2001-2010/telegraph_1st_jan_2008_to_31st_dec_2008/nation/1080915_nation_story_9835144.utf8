                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tech torment for Chembur family
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          Relatives mourn near Gaffar Market. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 14: The email on last evenings Delhi serial blasts has been traced to the Wi-Fi (wireless) connection of retired Chembur engineer M.K. Kamaths wife, Sarika.        
	The couple and their son Akhil, who live in an apartment in Eric Housing Society on Chemburs 16th Road, were questioned last night by sleuths of the anti-terror squad (ATS).        
	After preliminary rounds of questioning, it has been found that the Kamaths Wi-Fi router was hacked by the shadowy Indian Mujahideen to send yesterdays email.         
	Hacking has become a terror for common citizens like us. We are innocent and hard-working people, Sarika said.        
	The Internet protocol address, essentially the code that shows the source of an email, led the sleuths to the Internet connection of the Kamaths, who have another connection, a non-Wi-Fi one from MTNL, which is safe.        
	The police said the family had two flats in the Eric complex, one of which had been leased to a company, Kamran Power Controls Pvt Ltd, but vacated some time back.        
	The house has two Internet connections. Prima facie it seems the wireless (Wi-Fi) Internet was active and unsecured at the time the email was sent, additional commissioner, ATS, Param Bir Singh, said. He added that no computers had been seized from the Kamaths home.        
	Since this case of hacking was similar to the one in which the Wi-Fi router of American national Ken Haywood was hacked to send the email on the July 26 Ahmedabad blasts, the sleuths have decided to transfer the case involving the Kamaths to Mumbai polices cyber crime cell.        
	Sarika denied any link with the Delhi blasts and claimed her family had become a victim of technology.         
	We are innocent. Someone seems to have hacked into our computer. We did not feel the need to secure or password-protect our Internet connection. But now it has become a necessity for all citizens to secure their connections, she said.        
	Efforts are on to trace the sender of the mail but the focus is on Taufiq Bilal, suspected to have plotted the Ahmedabad blasts before hacking Haywoods connection.        
	A modus operandi similar to the one used in Navi Mumbai (where Haywood lives) appears to have been used (yesterday). A non-secure Wi-Fi connection has been hacked into to send the email. We do not know the origin of the email. Our team is investigating, anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare said.         
	An ATS team left for Delhi today to co-ordinate with the police there in the probe.        
	Haywood, back in Mumbai last week after having slipped out to the US when a narco test was about to be conducted on him, continues to face the ATS investigation.         
	But a month of scanning his laptop and forensic assistance hasnt brought the sleuths close to tracing the origin of the mail on the Ahmedabad explosions.

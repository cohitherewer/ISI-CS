                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Party to CM: be firm
  - Dont be apologetic, people angry with Opposition        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 29: The people of Bengal are getting angrier and angrier with the Oppositions one-point mission to derail the Tata small-car project and cripple the industrialisation drive, the CPM said today.        
	Without naming Mamata Banerjee or her party, the CPM state committee questioned why the government was not being firm in tackling the protesters and was appearing apologetic while dealing with them.        
	People are increasingly becoming angry with certain Opposition parties for the way they have created an unruly situation to stop the Tata small-car factory from becoming a reality, the state committee said in a statement.        
	It seems that for certain Opposition parties it has become a one-point mission to destabilise the programme for industrialisation and several development projects.        
	At a meeting at Alimuddin Street in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, several members asked why all the spotlight was on the 2,000 unwilling farmers when over 11,000 had willingly given up land for the Nano factory.        
	Then why is the government appearing apologetic while dealing with the agitation? Why cant the government show firmness while dealing with the protesters? a member asked, setting off a chorus.        
	Acknowledging that the Oppositions disruptive politics was one of the reasons for the swelling public support for industrialisation, the state committee said: All we have to do is carry the bulk of the people with us and strive towards total implementation of our industrialisation programmes.        
	We shall not lose sight of our goal and we shall not at all be impatient if we are to walk towards implementation of our programmes for the benefit of our people. Towards this end, we will have to launch a state-wide campaign.        
	The committee ticked off the government for its clumsy handling of Singur. Some members said local leaders should have explained the merits of the project to the people instead of getting estranged from them. If they were careful, the situation would not have come to such a pass, a member said.        
	The committee wondered what tomorrows all-party meeting on Singur would achieve when Mamata herself was skipping it. The Trinamul leader left for Delhi this evening to look up Sonia Gandhi.        
	I am interested only in land-based rehabilitation of farmers who parted with land inside the Tata project. I have nothing to do with the package the government has announced, violating the September 7 agreement. They are all trying to muddy the waters, Mamata said.

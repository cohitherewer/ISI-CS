                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rapist bail puts unsafe tag on India 
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Aug. 5: A British woman who fought to get her Indian rapist convicted has spoken out after the man got speedy bail, putting a question mark in western minds over law enforcement in India.        
	The 40-year-old British journalist today expressed outrage that Parvat Singh, 32, owner of the Pardesi Rest House in Udaipur, had been released three months into his life sentence.        
	She said she was astonished that Singh could have his appeal heard and dealt with speedily though Indian law decrees she should have been given the chance to be present in court to oppose bail.        
	This gives a whole new meaning to Incredible India, she said. He is a convicted rapist and he is running a guesthouse. No woman is safe there.        
	Coming so soon after the rape and murder of Scarlett Keeling, a 15-year-old British girl, in Goa in February, Hindustan is now being referred to as Rapistan by critics in London of the Indian governments apparent inability or unwillingness to tackle the growing number of assaults on foreign women.        
	According to The Times, London, The National Crime Records Bureau says that rape is the fastest-growing crime in India, with 19,348 cases reported in 2006, a 22 per cent increase on 2005.        
	R.R. Singh, Parvats lawyer in the fast-track trial court, said his client, sentenced on April 23, was released on July 31. He said the high court in Jodhpur granted bail since it could not be established that the woman was in the guesthouse at the time of the alleged rape.        
	Besides, he claimed, her recorded statements suffered from discrepancies and a language problem. The court also took note of the delay in lodging the FIR.        
	Justice P. Jain, a former high court judge, said sessions courts and high courts can grant bail if they feel prima facie that there is no case laid out and further investigation is needed. The victim can appeal for bail cancellation.        
	Lawyer Singh said the bail would apply till the hearing of the appeal began. Advocate Sandeep Mehta, who represented Parvat in the high court, refused comment.        
	The woman, who had checked into the guesthouse on December 19 last year, said Parvat entered her room on the pretext of giving her a blanket on December 23 and raped her. She was admitted to hospital and lodged a police complaint on January 9.        
	She gave evidence at the in-camera trial and, in an interview with the Times, described it as a bear-pit and a hideous experience during which she was threatened by Parvats friends. One of those friends sent her a taunting text message last week: Ha, ha, he is coming out tomorrow.         
	The woman has been in touch with the public prosecutor in Jodhpur and is now launching a campaign to get the bail revoked because I believe he will rape again and kill.         
	She said: If I have to get on a plane and go back I will, even though he threatened to kill me.        
	With inputs from Rakhee Roy Talukdar in Jaipur

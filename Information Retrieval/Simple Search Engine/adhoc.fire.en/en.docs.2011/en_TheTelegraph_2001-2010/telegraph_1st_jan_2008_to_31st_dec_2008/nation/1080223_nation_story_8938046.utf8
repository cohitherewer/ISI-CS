	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Centre should seek to modernise the management of tiger reserves and recruit staff from local populations, the Prime Minister said today.        
	At a review meeting, Manmohan Singh said the Centre would enhance financial and organisational support for the project and called on chief ministers to take personal charge of tiger conservation and forest management.         
	The review comes within two weeks of Project Tiger officials revising their estimates of the number of tigers to 1,411, less than half the previous estimate of 3,642.         
	Singh will convene a conference of chief ministers for a co-ordinated response to tiger conservation.

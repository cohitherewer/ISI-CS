          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 5: Three months ago, 45-year-old Dibakar Behera received the prestigious Biju Patnaik Award amid thundering applause. He was a poacher-turned-protector of fowls in the Chilika lake.         
	Behera had set an example for many others like him and a cash award of Rs 1 lakh along with a citation was a small prize for his efforts. That was on October 3 last year. Last Friday Behera was caught with two birds  a Gadwall and a Shoveller  both falling under protected species. Behera, who is president of the Sri Sri Mahavir Pakshi Surakshya Samiti, an anti-poaching organisation, was on his way back from the lake when a joint team of forest officers and committee members nabbed him red-handed.         
	There had been complaints about him for quite some time and our people were keeping a tab on his activities, said divisional forest officer Abhimanyu Behera.        
	Ironically, the DFO himself had recommended Dibakars name for the Biju Patnaik award.

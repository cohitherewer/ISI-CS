	Mumbai, June 9 (PTI): There were several deficiencies in seafaring safety on the MV Rezzak, the cargo ship that disappeared off the Turkish coast with 25 Indian sailors on board four months ago, a preliminary probe has found.        
	The report of global shipping registry Panama Maritime Authority said that the ships GM (metacentric height used to calculate stability) was very high and did not rule out rolling and pitching of the vessel because of wind direction.        
	The ship carrying steel billets left for Russia from Turkey on February 17 and disappeared in the Black Sea.         
	The report said authorities at Novorossiysk port in Russia had inspected the ship and reported a number of deficiencies in seafaring safety.

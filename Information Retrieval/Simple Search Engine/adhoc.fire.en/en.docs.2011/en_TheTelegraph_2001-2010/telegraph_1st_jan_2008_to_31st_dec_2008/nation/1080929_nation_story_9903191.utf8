	Tech shield for temple money            Bet on technology to come to the aid of divine coffers.    
	Karnataka is set to ring in electronic hundis (donation boxes) in state-run temples to prevent pilferage of temple funds.    
	The new BJP government hit upon the novel idea after it was swamped with complaints from devotees that priests often stole a lot of the cash by doctoring accounts.     
	The government has decided to go in for smart hundis that will count the coins and notes. Such technology has always been available in this IT-savvy state, known for its self-service kiosks where one can pay water, power and phone bills 24/7. They also get receipts. So, counting the hundi money means just tweaking the existing technology.    
	To start with, the government is set to introduce the smart hundis in Bangalores Banashankari temple, a favourite posting for priests because of its rich pickings.     
	Tenders have been called to install such machines in all the 36,000 government-run temples. With every penny dropped and accounted for, devotees can expect the end of middlemen.        
	Travel public, keep roads free              
	Travel together and leave behind your cars at home  that is the message the Delhi government has been sending across.    
	With 700 new vehicle registrations daily, the authorities believe the roads just cant take the new cars.    
	The warning came from transport minister Haroon Yusuf, who stressed that using public transport was the need of the hour.     
	The government is committed to providing safe and pollution-free public transport, he said after the recent inauguration of a zonal transport office in Vasant Vihar. The number of such offices, which issue licences and other permits, now stands at 13.    
	Yusuf listed the metro, low-floor green and AC buses as examples of the improved public transport options now available in the capital. We are committed to creating a world-class transport infrastructure. (PTI)    
	Buses elusive, target depot               
	Buses elusive? The depots have no business being there.    
	Commuters in Thane, a bustling Mumbai suburb, tired of waiting hours for buses run by the civic body recently vented their anger at the nearby depot, ransacking the place and blocking the roads for hours late into the night.    
	Such was the violent protest at the Thane Municipal Transport depot, near the railway station, that no official from the municipal corporation dared come to the spot initially.    
	But patience seemed to have been wearing thin for sometime. For weeks, commuters who return after a tiresome day at work in Mumbai and elsewhere face problems because of the erratic bus services, a protester said. The complaints had been going unheard for weeks together.    
	The commuters, who were said to be in hundreds according to witnesses, ripped off parts of the cabin used by transport officials to oversee and control the bus service.    
	The police arrived after the tempers cooled a little but could only remove the road blocks. The slogans went on into the night.        
	Drink brakes              
	Getting behind the wheel after a peg or more at Delhi pubs, hotels and cinema halls isnt hassle-free anymore.    
	Scores have been booked for drink driving in recent weeks at such places as part of a drive to contain the menace. These locations are chosen for raids as chances of drink driving are much higher at these spots, a police officer said.     
	The alcohol-sniffing squad armed with alcometers (breath analysers) is out in force in these areas to catch revellers on a high. We want people to return home safe, the officer said.              
	CHENNAI: The dolls exhibition at Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan on Anna Salai puts to rest all fears that the culture of story-telling is dying. Take a look at the most expensive doll, Kanaka Durga, which costs Rs 29,000. The exhibition is on till Tuesday, from 10am to 8pm.

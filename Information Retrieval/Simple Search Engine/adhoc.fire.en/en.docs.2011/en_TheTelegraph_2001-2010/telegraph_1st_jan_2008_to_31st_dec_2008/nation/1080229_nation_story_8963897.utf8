The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuke team extends stay
                                                                                                               Nuke team extends stay
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Menon                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: Indian nuclear negotiators have extended their stay in Vienna, reflecting the hope in Delhi of clinching a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said in Delhi that India was hopeful of concluding the safeguards talks as soon as possible. The IAEA agreement is needed to operationalise the civilian nuclear deal with the US.        
	Menons expression of hope came close on the heels of US defence secretary Robert Gatess remark that the clock is ticking on the nuclear pact.        
	We are not looking at deadlines. It takes two hands to clap. We are hoping to wrap it (the IAEA agreement) up, Menon told reporters on the sidelines of his meeting with US undersecretary of commerce Mario Mancuso.         
	Like last time, we are hoping to conclude it this time round. When we are there, we will let you know, Menon said, asked if he was hopeful of India concluding the safeguards pact during the fifth round of negotiations in Vienna.         
	The IAEA talks, initially scheduled from February 25 to 27, have been extended. The team is staying back to cover some more ground, a source said. The source added that an agreement on the safeguards text could be clinched either in this round or in the next round of talks.         
	Echoing Menon, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar said: I am optimistic about it (the outcome of the talks).        
	The negotiations have been aiming at ensuring uninterrupted fuel supply for the civilian reactors, which India will place under safeguards, and the right to take corrective action in case the flow is interrupted.         
	Gatess statement yesterday in Delhi that time was running out is being seen as a reminder that the deal should be operationalised before the US Congress gets entangled in election-year politics.         
	Three influential senators led by Joseph Biden, who visited India, had also said Delhi must wrap up the IAEA pact by May so that the deal could be ratified before July-end by the US Congress.

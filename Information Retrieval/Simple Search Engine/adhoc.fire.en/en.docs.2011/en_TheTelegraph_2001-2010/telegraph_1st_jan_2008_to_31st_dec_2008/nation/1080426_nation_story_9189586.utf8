          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 25: Sharp divisions have surfaced among the IIM top brass over the steep fee hike announced by the Ahmedabad institute.        
	IIM-A chairman Vijaypat Singhania took a hard stand after a meeting of the review committee set up to look into various aspects of the schools functioning. There is no reason why the fee hike should be rolled back when I have already explained everything to the HRD minister, he said.        
	The IIM review committee has recommended to the Centre that all the schools defer any increase in fee.        
	The panel, headed by former Maruti Udyog managing director R.C. Bhargava, will review the functioning of the IIMs, calculate the cost per student at each of them, and offer guidelines for deciding the fees.        
	IIM-A has faced flak from politicians and educators for announcing a 175 per cent fee hike for the 2008-10 batch.        
	Bhargava claimed the fee hike was not discussed today. The meeting, he stressed, was with the institutes stakeholders to seek their opinion on various issues, including governance at the B-schools and their financial status.        
	But review panel member Ajit Balakrishnan, chairman of the board of governors of IIM Calcutta, indicated that the committee was not in favour of steep fee hikes.        
	I do not subscribe to the view that one who can afford to pay should pay more, he said, rebutting the argument put forward by the IIM-A.        
	The Calcutta B-school has put on hold a decision on a fee hike, saying it would wait for the review committees final report.         
	The review committee, in its interim report submitted to the government this month, has recommended that the B-schools keep the fee at the level of December 2007 until the committee submits its final report, expected in June.        
	The committees recommendations, if accepted by the government, will be binding on the IIMs.        
	Singhania said admission offer letters would be issued in a few days. After a cumbersome process, he said, the non-creamy OBC candidates have been short-listed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     PM back to nuclear test, in six weeks
  - Left in no-trust cry, BJP calls for Manmohan resignation           OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Barely six weeks after the political high of his crafty trust-vote triumph, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finds himself besieged yet again on account of his pet project.         
	Alleging that Singh had misled the nation on key terms of the Indo-US nuclear deal, both the BJP and the Left today demanded that the Prime Minister resign or immediately face privilege/ no-trust moves in Parliament.        
	The pincer aggression on the government rode on the charge that the government had concealed the fact that it had virtually signed off Indias right to conduct a nuclear test as part of the deal.        
	The Prime Minister has lied to the nation and to Parliament, this government has no right to remain in government, the Prime Minister should just quit, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said this afternoon.         
	The BJP fielded its chief spokespersons on the deal  Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie  to allege that the government was guilty of hiding critical information and should, therefore, quit.         
	The governments worries, though, could go beyond just its known adversaries. The Samajwadi Party, which bailed the UPA out on the trust vote, indicated as if the new revelations could force it to rethink its support.         
	Speaking to reporters while surveying the flood damage in Bihar, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said: I dont know the details, but if this is true, we have to look at it seriously.        
	Parliament is not scheduled to meet until October 17  a postponed date that the Opposition has already objected to  but with fresh, and strident, demands that it be summoned, the governments plate looks piled with fresh trouble.         
	It may have an ally in Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who may use technicality to stave off an early session. But the battle at hand is increasingly political. From the tempers of the BJP and the Left, it is clear both will intensify their attack on the government.        
	With its attention focused nervously on the deliberations of the NSG in Vienna, neither the government nor the Congress managed to kick-start a political offensive.         
	The Opposition is in a high-profile, two-pronged assault but the Congress and government spokespersons are still groping for direction. Two days into the controversial revelations in The Washington Post, nobody of authority has laid out the governments side  not the Prime Ministers Office, not the external affairs ministry.        
	The Congress, too, has fielded second-rung spokespersons until it formulates a more substantive response.        
	The Post had made public the Bush administrations correspondence with Congress that suggested the US would immediately terminate nuclear trade with India if Delhi conducted a nuclear test.        
	Karat said the four Left parties, the BSP, Telugu Desam, Janata Dal (S) and others would meet President Pratibha Patil together in the next couple of days to demand the monsoon session be convened immediately. These parties, which had voted against the July 22 trust motion, are planning a no-trust motion.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 4: The Supreme Court has upheld the life term awarded to a man who had strangled his girlfriend to death after she turned down his marriage proposal.        
	Kuchibotla Saran Kumar, in his early thirties, had been sentenced to life by a Visakhapatnam trial court and Andhra Pradesh High Court.         
	The trial court and the high court have discussed the evidence threadbare. We find no fault in their judgments. The appeal is dismissed, a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and Harjit Singh Bedi said.        
	The apex court took into account several factors while convicting Kumar. One of them was that he had told several witnesses that he would kill his girlfriend, P. Sesha Sudha, if she married someone else.         
	The court also noted that Kumar had been on the run after Sudhas killing in 2000.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rashmi                            
	New Delhi, May 31: A 17-year-old Noida schoolgirl shot herself in the family car today because her parents were trying to persuade her boyfriend, a motor mechanic, not to marry her.        
	A sobbing Rashmi Morya rushed out of a park, where her parents had set up a meeting with Hitesh Laharia to make him see reason, and got into her fathers Skoda which was parked outside.        
	She drew out a (licensed) revolver kept in the dashboard and shot herself in the head, a police officer said. She was driven to the hospital in the same car.        
	Rashmi is fighting for her life at Metro Superspeciality Hospital in Noida. Doctors said she was critical.        
	Hitesh is a Class X dropout from a well-known Noida private school where Rashmi, a resident of Sector 56 in the satellite town, studies. They had come to know each other in school and fallen in love. Sources said Hitesh was Rashmis senior and would be about 19 or 20.        
	Rashmis father, property dealer Virendra Morya, was said to be upset at his daughters choice of life partner. The two families met in the park to discuss the matter.        
	Hiteshs mother said: The two have known each other for two years. We met the Moryas in the morning. Virendra Morya asked my son to reject any marriage proposal from his daughter. We were trying to convince them (the boy and the girl) that this (marriage between them) wasnt feasible, but she was headstrong and refused to understand.        
	When Rashmi realised her parents were trying to pressure Hitesh to reject her, and were close to succeeding, she dashed out.        
	The police detained Hitesh and his mother for questioning and have also interrogated Rashmis parents.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (east Delhi), Ajay Chaudhry, said no case had been registered and officers were recording the statements of the two families.        
	A case will be registered only after initial investigations, Chaudhry said, adding that no action had yet been taken against Virendra for keeping a loaded firearm in the car.        
	The incident comes two weeks after another Noida schoolgirl, 15-year-old Aarushi Talwar, was found murdered at her home. Her father Rajesh Talwar has been arrested for the murder.

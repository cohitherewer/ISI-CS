          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: State governments, political parties and religious bodies shouldnt be allowed to set up channels, the countrys broadcasting regulator has told the Centre.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has suggested in its report that recognised parties neednt set up TV networks as other channels can provide them reasonable access in the run-up to Lok Sabha and state polls.        
	The proposals follow a request from the information and broadcasting ministry to examine whether such entities should own channels. However, the regulator suggested that the ministry seek the Election Commissions guidance to frame the final guidelines on the matter.        
	The suggestions, if implemented, could affect many parties, including the Congress, the CPM, the DMK, ADMK and the PMK, which own channels directly or indirectly.        
	A Trai spokesperson said, however, the recommendations werent binding on the ministry. Its up to them whether to accept the recommendation or not.         
	The Congress entered the satellite TV business with Jai Hind TV in Malayalam. Inaugurated by Sonia Gandhi last year, the channel was launched to counter the CPM-affiliated Kairali TV. Plans are now afoot to set up Jai Hinds Kannada, Hindi, Telugu and Bengali channels.        
	In Tamil Nadu, political parties have long owned major channels, like the DMKs SunTV, followed by Jayalalithaas Jaya TV. After the break-up with the Marans, who own the SunTV, the DMK launched Kalaignar TV. The smaller PMK also has a channel, Makkal TV.        
	On religious bodies, Trai suggested they shouldnt be allowed to own broadcasting stations and teleports in conformity with the secular fabric of the Constitution.        
	The proposal, Trai has clarified, doesnt mean a bar on religious programmes that are in conformity with the content or programme code that the government prescribes from time to time. At present, there are around 20 religious channels in Hindi and regional languages.         
	If a religious body has been granted permission for a channel earlier, Trai has suggested creating an an appropriate exit route within a time limit of three to four years.        
	The broadcasting bar proposed on state governments will also apply to local bodies. Trai has suggested their interests can be met if public-service obligations are imposed on private broadcasters. It has also been suggested that state governments and their organs stay out of activities related to distribution of channels.        
	The ministry should set up a body to approve and certify programmes that private networks beam as a public service, Trai has said. To begin with, such approved programmes can be run for 30 minutes a week.         
	A Public Service Broadcasting Obligation Fund has been suggested to pay for the cost of the programmes.

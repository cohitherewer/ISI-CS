          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the inauguration. Telegraph picture                                  
	Barasat, June 16: Villagers locked up a North 24-Parganas water-treatment plant a day after its inauguration, alleging that an incomplete unit had been opened with an eye on this months municipal elections.        
	A 1,000-strong crowd gathered at the site in Kartickpur, near Deganga, this afternoon, locking up the plants main gate amid little resistance from district officials. The inauguration, by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had taken place only yesterday.        
	We put the plant under lock and key as we feel the inauguration was an eyewash. It will take two to three months to be functional, alleged Humayun Chowdhury, from Gosainpur, near Kartickpur, 45km from Calcutta.        
	The CPM is desperate to improve its prospects for the June 29 elections to the nearby Habra municipality, Chowdhury said. The party lost all 10 seats in the Deganga panchayat samiti to the Trinamul Congress last month.        
	Jainul Abedin, from nearby Champapukur, pointed out that the public health engineering department, which built the Rs 144-crore plant, had not completed laying the pipeline to supply clean drinking water.         
	The protest cut across party lines. Even banners of the Trinamul Congress, which holds sway in Deganga, were not seen during the time the mob laid siege to the plant.        
	Many of us owe allegiance either to Trinamul or the CPM. But cutting across party lines, we have assembled here to close the plant. All of us will be affected if we dont get clean water, said an elderly Asim Ghosh.         
	North 24-Parganas district magistrate P.K. Mishra said he would find out the status of the project from the public health engineering department. A department official said on the condition of anonymity that the plant would need at least a month to be functional.

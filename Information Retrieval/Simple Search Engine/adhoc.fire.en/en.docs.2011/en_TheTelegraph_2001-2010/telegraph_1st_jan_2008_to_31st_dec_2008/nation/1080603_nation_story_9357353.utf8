                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CBI takes dentist home, quizzes wife
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                              
	New Delhi, June 2: The CBI today took Rajesh Talwar to his Noida home so that sleuths could reconstruct the sequence of events on the night of May 15, when his daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj were murdered.        
	The dentist, who is the key accused in the murder of his 15-year-old daughter and Hemraj, was also taken to some undisclosed spots before being taken back to the agencys headquarters.        
	The CBI had wanted Rajeshs custody for seven days, but was granted only one. Sources said the agency would ask for extending the custody tomorrow when Rajesh is produced in the CBI court in Ghaziabad.        
	The sleuths also questioned his wife Nupur Talwar and family friend Anita Durrani, with whom the police said Rajesh was having an affair. Both women are dentists.        
	We are trying to reconstruct the sequence (of events) which Noida police have not been able to do. There are discrepancies in the polices version. There are discrepancies in how Nupur has described the events. We are corroborating statements made by various persons. It is the discrepancies which raise doubts about the Talwars role, said a senior CBI official.        
	Rajeshs brother Dinesh, whom the accused is said to be close to, was also quizzed, as were the domestic helps, including the maid who was the first to arrive on the morning of May 16. The driver, who last saw the family together, was also questioned.        
	The CBI team, led by joint director Arun Kumar, took away samples of blood and chipped away small pieces from the staircase leading to the terrace where Hemrajs body was found.         
	The team is in touch with forensic experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory.         
	The CBI has started the process of recovering data from Rajeshs laptop and Aarushis desktop computer.         
	We are trying to retrieve the deleted files from the computers. The hard discs will be sent to the Hyderabad forensic laboratory, which helped us immensely in cracking the Rizwanur Rahman case, the official explained.        
	Sources were sceptical about getting fresh evidence from the murder spot as 17 days have lapsed.         
	Moreover, Nupur had been living at the same address. The house should have been sealed by Noida police and treated as the scene of crime. They did not even seal the room where Aarushi was said to have been killed. We can basically only re-evaluate the evidence collected by Noida police. Finding fresh evidence seems unlikely but we are still working at it, said another official.        
	About starting afresh and not treating Rajesh as an accused, sources said the CBI had merely re-registered the FIR of Noida police. The FIR had named Hemraj the main accused as it was registered before his body was found. Then unknown persons were added to it. So we are going ahead with it and considering all evidence and documents provided by Noida police, a source said.

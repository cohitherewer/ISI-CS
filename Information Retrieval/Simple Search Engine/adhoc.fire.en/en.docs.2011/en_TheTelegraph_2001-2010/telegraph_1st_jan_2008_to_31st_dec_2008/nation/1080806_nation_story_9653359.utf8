	New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): The Supreme Court today allowed the Andhra Pradesh government to go ahead with admissions to educational institutions under a controversial law that provides 4 per cent reservation to backward Muslims.        
	However, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan made it clear that the admissions would be subject to the outcome of a bunch of petitions in Andhra Pradesh High Court challenging the Andhra Pradesh Reservation in Favour of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes of Muslims Act, 2007.        
	A seven-judge Constitution bench of the high court is examining the act.        
	Senior advocate K. Parasaran and additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium submitted that the state be allowed to go ahead with the admission process as counselling, which the apex court had permitted on May 16, was over.         
	Subramanium contended that the 4 per cent quota had been extended to the backward Muslims after considering a report of the Andhra Pradesh Commission of Backward Classes.        
	He urged the bench to allow the operation of the act subject to the outcome of the case pending in the high court.        
	However, senior advocate Ramakrishna Reddy, appearing for anti-reservation petitioners, said that as the high court had already stayed its operation, the state government could not implement its reservation provision.         
	The apex court said the admission process could go on as nobody had challenged the act for the academic year 2008-09. The students for 2007-08 are not concerned with the academic year 2008-09. There is no aggrieved party, it said.        
	The only question that has to be examined, the bench said, is whether the Muslim groups brought under the ambit of reservation can be considered backward classes.         
	The state government moved the apex court after the high court imposed the stay on April 29.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 8: The Supreme Court today expressed its inability to quash the Sachar committee report on Muslims on the ground that it lacked the jurisdiction to do so.         
	The committee had recommended reservations for the community to improve its socio-economic and educational status.         
	Former Rajya Sabha MP B.P. Singhal had challenged the constitution of the panel and its recommendations, and requested the court to restrain the Centre from taking any further action on it.         
	You want us to set aside the report? That is not possible. No, no, we wont restrain the government from taking any action, a three-judge bench said. Its just a recommendation. We wont interfere.        
	Instead, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan added, why dont you apprise the government of your grievances?         
	Counsel H.P. Sharma insisted that implementation of the suggestions had caused losses to the public exchequer. But the court said: If you want, you challenge the government action which aggrieves you. Sharma then agreed to withdraw the petition.

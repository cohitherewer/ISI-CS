                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saarc treaty for terrorist handover
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	Colombo, Aug. 3: The 15th Saarc summit ended today with member countries pledging the strongest possible co-operation against terrorism and signing an accord that provides for handover of terrorists and criminals.        
	The summit adopted the Saarc Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, which had been hanging fire, despite Pakistani concerns over its extradition clause. India and Pakistan dont have an extradition treaty.        
	The convention will provide a legal framework for greater co-operation among the member nations security forces to track, arrest and hand over criminals and terrorists on request from one another.        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani met Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai on the summits sidelines. Gilani had yesterday said he would ask Karzai for evidence that the Pakistan militarys intelligence agency, the ISI, had helped the militants who bombed Indias Kabul embassy on July 7.        
	Afghanistan, India and the US have linked the ISI to the bombing, prompting Gilani to offer to hold an inquiry into the attack.        
	US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, an observer at the summit, told reporters it was important that Islamabad maintained control over its agencies.        
	Its a new political leadership in Pakistan thats come out of this election. They have a lot of really big challenges, he said.        
	But one of the things (they must do) is work with the other institutions including the army and the intelligence service. They need to get everybody lined up in the same direction if theyre really going to tackle the terrorist problem.        
	America has been pressuring Islamabad to bring the ISI under civilian control.        
	In a joint declaration at the end of the summit, the leaders of the eight member countries reaffirmed their commitment to implementing all international conventions relating to terrorism.        
	They spoke of the need to treat as criminals anyone who provided, collected or acquired funds for terrorist acts in line with the UN Security Council Resolution 1373.        
	The declaration stressed the growing link between terrorism, narcotics smuggling and illegal traffic of firearms and people.        
	It said every member country needed to complete all legislative and practical measures to implement the Regional Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.        
	As part of the effort, the countries decided to hold the meeting of Saarc home (or interior) ministers later this year in Islamabad.        
	The summit discussed energy security, agreeing on the need to develop hydropower potential, grid connectivity and gas pipelines, and promised to co-operate on efforts to tackle climate change.        
	The eight nations affirmed their commitment to implementing the South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta) in letter and spirit.

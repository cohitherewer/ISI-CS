	Bhubaneswar, April 25: Normal life in Berhampur was hit after lawyers of Ganjam Bar Association observed a bandh on Friday in protest against Wednesdays police lathicharge.         
	The association demanded action against Ganjam superintendent of police Devidutta Singh for the alleged police atrocities on lawyers and squatted on rail tracks at Berhampur railway station for about two hours in the morning. This was followed by road blockades at NH-5 and NH-217. The district unit of Congress extended its support to the bandh call.         
	Tyres were burnt at places to mark the protest.         
	Heavy police deployments had been made to avoid any untoward incident during the bandh.         
	Other Bar associations, including Gajapati Bar Association, Paralakhemundi Bar Association and Angul Bar Association extended their support to the call. Besides, trade unions and citizens forums also supported the bandh.         
	Barring a few shops, markets remained closed. Many preferred to stay off the roads.         
	However, protestors allowed ambulances, schoolbuses and vehicles carrying patients. The bandh was a success, said secretary of Ganjam Bar Association Mohan Chingari.        
	On Wednesday, agitating lawyers and police clashed while the latter tried to open courts that have remained closed for months over the demand of permanent bench of high court in southern Orissa.         
	More than 30 lawyers were injured allegedly in the police lathicharge, while police personnel were hurt in the brick batting by lawyers.

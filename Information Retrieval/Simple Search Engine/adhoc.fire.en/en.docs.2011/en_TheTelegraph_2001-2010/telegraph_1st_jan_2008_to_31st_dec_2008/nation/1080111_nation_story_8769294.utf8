     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Even before the Nano hits the roads in India, Tata Motors has received invitations from two countries to locate similar projects there.
    
	We have been approached by a couple of countries who want to host this product; I cant give you the names. All I will say is that Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia are options, Ratan Tata told reporters.
    
	Tata, however, said the focus would be on the Indian market for the next two years before the company decides to venture abroad.
    
	The company will consider setting up production facilities abroad or exporting from here. 
    
	Much will depend on the sort of benefits the host countries are ready to provide.

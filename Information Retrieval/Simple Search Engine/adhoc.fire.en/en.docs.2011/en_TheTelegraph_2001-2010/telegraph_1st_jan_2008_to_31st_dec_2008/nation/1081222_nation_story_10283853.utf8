	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 21: The Orissa government has tightened vigil on roads, outside churches and increased night patrolling  ensuring that no expense is spared for a peaceful Christmas.        
	Kandhamal administration  a region that has been a hotbed of continuous communal clashes since past Christmas  has called for a meeting tomorrow, to be attended by all religious communities at Phulbani District Rural Development Agency office, to discuss peace.        
	Peace rallies and shanti sabhas (peace meetings) have been planned to drill in a message of harmony in the district and thwart any scope of possible disturbances on December 25. We are prepared to handle the situation. We are hopeful that the celebrations will be peaceful, said Kandhamal superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.         
	Meanwhile, Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who was to visit Orissa today, cancelled his trip after the proposed bandh call given by the Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Sradhanjali Samiti was called off. Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Sradhanjali Samiti revoked its December 25 bandh following a talk with chief minister and after receiving his assurance that the murder of Hindu seer would be investigated thoroughly.         
	However, the samiti is planning a prayer meeting on December 25. Meanwhile, a delegation of leaders, led by Archbishop Raphel Cheenath, met Naveen Patnaik to urge the leader to provide adequate security to churches in vulnerable areas.

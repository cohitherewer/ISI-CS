          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, May 30: The protests in the Darjeeling hills impelled Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today to call on the home minister and urge him to hold back the bill to bring the Darjeeling Gorkha Hills Council under the Sixth Schedule.         
	Bhattacharjee apprised Shivraj Patil about the situation in Darjeeling after the new hill council came to power.         
	Sources in the PMO said the government was concerned over the uncertainty there following the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas agitation for a separate Gorkhaland, led by Bimal Gurung.         
	The situation has changed in Darjeeling since January, when an all-party delegation of Bengal legislators requested Patil to ensure that the bill be passed in Parliament. Patil had told them that the bill, which will allow the council greater powers, had been introduced and was being considered by a standing committee of the home ministry.         
	During the standing committees hearings earlier, the unanimous opinion was to hold back the bill as the Gorkhaland protests gained momentum. Passing the bill would add fuel to the protests. The committee had recommended its passage with several riders, virtually advising the government against going ahead.

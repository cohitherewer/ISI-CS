          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Experts from India have found a way to plug the Kosis breached embankment in Nepal, but the deluged millions downstream in Bihar are unlikely to see dry land before at least a fortnight.        
	A team led by former Bihar water resources department engineer-in-chief Nilendu Sanyal suggested a two-step process  diverting the rivers flow before plugging the 1.6km-long hole that unleashed massive floods on village after village.        
	The experts, who visited the site yesterday, found that the current at the breach was so powerful that it was impossible to work on the broken stretch now. So the priority was to divert the flow a bit to the western side and then work on plugging the gap.         
	Top Indian officials will do an aerial survey of the breach tomorrow.        
	Umesh Narayan Panjiar, secretary in the water resources ministry here, said huge concrete structures would be dumped upstream into the Kosi to divert the rivers flow.         
	Authorities, however, said silting on the rivers western side had increased flow towards the breach and dredging along the western bund would be a massive exercise.        
	Sources said an 8km-long and 8-metre-wide area would be dug up on the opposite side of the breach to ease the water pressure on the eastern side. The ends of the breach are already being protected so that there is no further damage, said Panjiar.        
	The sources said the work would start as early as possible and would take at least a week, maybe even a fortnight.        
	By the time the first steps are taken, both Indian and Nepalese authorities would have made arrangements for boulders to be used to plug the gap.        
	Under the Indo-Nepal agreement of 1954, India is entirely responsible for repair and maintenance work on the barrage and embankment.        
	While huge chunks of earth are needed to plug the breach, the experts also suggested that geotextiles  knitted polypropylene sheets  be extensively used to reinforce the new embankment that will come up. Sandbags will also be used but care will be taken so that the sand does not flow downstream.         
	The flow of water through the breach came down from 1.9 lakh cubic feet per second in the past few days to a maximum of 1.3 lakh cusecs today.

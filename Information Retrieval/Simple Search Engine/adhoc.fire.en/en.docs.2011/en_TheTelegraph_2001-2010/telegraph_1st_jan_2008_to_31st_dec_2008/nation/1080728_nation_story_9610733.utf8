The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani finger at Centre
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advani finger at Centre
                            
	Ahmedabad, July 27: L.K. Advani waded into a fight with the Congress today, suggesting the Centre was not only soft on terror but stood in the way of BJP-ruled Gujarats efforts to crack down on militancy.        
	The BJP leader cited how a stringent Gujarat crime law had been pending with the President for four years, and sought immediate clearance. He also cited the delay in hanging Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, whose mercy petition lies with the President.        
	The Congress, spotting an attempt to deflect the blame for the Ahmedabad blasts, hit back by saying chief minister Narendra Modi should own moral responsibility for the security lapse.        
	Advani said: Some states have good laws to fight organised crime, like Maharashtra (the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act). Based on them, Gujarat has passed a law in the Assembly (the Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act). But it is awaiting presidential clearance for the last four years. I demand that there should not be further delay of even a day to give clearance to this law of Gujarat.        
	Advani also demanded revival of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota)  introduced by the NDA but repealed under the UPA.        
	There should be zero tolerance against terrorism. But we are not seeing zero tolerance (from) the UPA. There is an attempt to delay conviction of a person involved in the Parliament attack, Advani said without naming Afzal.        
	Last night, I talked to the Prime Minister and conveyed all these things.        
	Advani recalled how, as home minister of the NDA government, he had suggested that a federal agency be set up to fight terrorism, only to be opposed by the states.        
	Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said: Terror strikes took place on Akshardham, Red Fort and Raghunath Mandir while Pota was in force. So, by enacting a law we cannot prevent terrorism. It is the effective implementation that can prevent acts of terror. The laws that exist are strong enough.

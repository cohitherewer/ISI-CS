	Gaya, Aug. 22: Members of Magadh University syndicate, senate and leaders of the employees association have demanded a White Paper from the vice-chancellor (VC), B.N. Pandey, and have asked him to come clean of charges of moral turpitude.        
	The charges were levelled against the VC by an acitivist group, Jan Jagran Manch.        
	Arvind Singh, a senior member of the Magadh University syndicate, met B.N. Pandey yesterday. Though Singh refused to divulge the details of the discussion, he is believed to have advised Pandey to come clean. Pandey remained mum regarding the issue at a reporters meet held yesterday. Earlier, the Manch members had alleged that Pandey was using a guesthouse near AN College, Patna, for his pleasures at the cost of the university.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: Gujarat was not cooperating with the Centre in its efforts to boost minority education, human resource development minister Arjun Singh today said.
    
	Gujarat is not cooperating at all with us, he told reporters after a meeting of the National Monitoring Committee on Minority Education.
    
	The committee had asked all states to submit reports of the initiatives they had undertaken to improve education among minorities.
    
	But Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have not even submitted their reports, Singh said. 
    
	The Sachar Committee, which presented its report before Parliament in November 2006, had revealed the appalling status of education among Muslims. Only 4 per cent Muslims are graduates while the national average is 7 per cent. The report also showed that only one out of every 20 post-graduates is a Muslim. 
    
	Singh announced that the HRD ministry was setting up a committee under junior school education minister M.A.A. Fatmi to review how deep the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan had penetrated into minority-dominated areas. It would submit a report in two months, the minister said.

	Singh played down Delhi High Courts observations about illegal construction at his official residence. Come over to my residence any day and I will show the few big constructions  a cowshed and a room for my office. But we have to remove them. I have no quarrel, he said. The court had today slammed the Centre for ignoring illegal constructions in the houses of ministers, including Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tin plant plans on district radar
                                                                                                               Tin plant plans on district radar
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, March 27: Orissa-based Koustuv Mining and Smelting Private Limited has zeroed in on Choudwar, 11km from Cuttack, to set up its tin smelting plant  the first of its kind in eastern India.         
	The 100 per cent export-oriented plant would have tin manufacturing capacity of 15,000MT a year and is expected to be commissioned 18 months from now.         
	P.R. Mallick, the chairman of the PSU, affirmed that a refinery would be set up with a cost of Rs 250 crore at Malkangiri.         
	The company has got seven licences to prospect tin ore reserves over 1200 acres at Kaliguda, Vijapada, Michikera and Badaregawada in Malkangiri and the project received the approval of Orissas single window clearance authority in November 2007, Mallick said.         
	While tin ore deposits are confined to mostly Chhattisgarh and Orissa, tin (cassiterites), with a value of up to 0.5 per cent, is concentrated at the confluence of the Ong and Mahanadi in Malkangiri in pegmatites and in the vein quartz of granitoid foliation.         
	Earlier, in the 1990s, Hyderabad Aircraft Maintenance Company (Hamco) was granted mining lease for the tin ore reserves. After attempting to set up a joint-venture processing plant with Reme Private Limited, Hamco had backed out, while the project was grounded.         
	We plan to make the refinery operational within this year and start off with 100 tonnes per day and subsequently increase it to 200 tonnes per day. If every thing goes according to plan the smelting plant would follow within six months of the refinery, said Mallick, talking to The Telegraph. The company would take the Sirosmelt route developed by Ausmelt Propietory Limited of Australia and borrow Malaysian expertise to construct the tin plant.

          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Private FM radio stations may soon be allowed to broadcast news and current affairs, sources in the information and broadcasting ministry said today.        
	This has been a season of good news for FM channels  first they were given the green signal to air political advertisements, and now another long-pending demand is likely to be met.        
	But there is a rider  the channels will not be allowed to generate news content and will have to borrow it from All India Radio, Doordarshan and authorised television channels and news agencies.        
	The government decision is in tune with the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).         
	The medium of radio can reach the remotest corners of the country and has greater chances of being misused for sowing political and communal disaffection. Hence, we are insisting that radio channels take their news content from government-approved sources, an I amp;B official said.         
	The proposal will come up for cabinet approval this month.         
	As many as 200 FM channels had submitted an application to the I amp;B ministry for permission to include news and current affairs in their list of programmes more than four years ago. They had argued that if private TV channels were free to air news, there was no reason why FM stations should be barred. At present, news is allowed only on AIR.         
	The fear that unregulated news on radio could pose a threat to national security had held the government back so long.        
	The I amp;B ministry is now expected to ask FM stations to retain full recordings of all programmes for six months and make transcripts available for official scrutiny whenever required.         
	The private radio industry is happy about being able to air news, but the content leash has left it sulking. If private TV channels can have their own news content, why not FM channels? asked the owner of an FM channel.

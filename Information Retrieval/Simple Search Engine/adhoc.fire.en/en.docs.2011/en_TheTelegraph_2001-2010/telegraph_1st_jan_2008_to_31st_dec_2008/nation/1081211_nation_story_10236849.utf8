          JAYANTH JACOB                           Ahamed addresses the Security Council meet. (Jay Mandal/On Assignment)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: India feels that international pressure on Pakistan to display evidence of action is mounting. Thus far, though, Delhi believes, Islamabad has not been serious about moving against terrorists who targeted India.         
	While foreign ministry sources took note of the right gestures coming out of the UN Security Council, they said Pakistans intent needs to be backed up by action.         
	The crux of Indias message to the world body perhaps lay in the last paragraph of junior foreign minister E. Ahameds 961-word speech at the UN Security Council meet on Threats to International Peace and Security Caused by Terrorist Acts.         
	Ahamed pointed out that India had so far acted with restraint but all options were open, and called for decisive action on the part of the world community to determinedly pursue and eliminate terrorist organisations.        
	Ahamed said: We must do our duty by our people and take all actions as we deem fit to defend and protect them. The Charter of the United Nations and provisions of international law, including the right of self-defence, gives us the framework to fulfil these responsibilities.        
	At the end of the UN meet, the Council called on countries to strengthen their co-operation to find, deny safe haven and bring to justice or extradite or prosecute all those who support, facilitate or participate in financing, planning, preparing or committing terrorist acts or provide safe haven.         
	Thats what we want Pakistan to do. The Mumbai attackers are from Pakistan, they used its territory to plot and launch the attack, and we want these perpetrators to be brought to justice, a source in the Indian foreign ministry said.

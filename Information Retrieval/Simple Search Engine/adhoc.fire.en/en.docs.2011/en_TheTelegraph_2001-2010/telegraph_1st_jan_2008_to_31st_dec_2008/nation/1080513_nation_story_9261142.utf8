          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 12: The state government today mooted the idea of raising an exclusive force  much on the lines of Central Industrial Security Force  to guard the state-owned dams and hydro and thermal power stations.         
	The suggestion was tabled in a meeting chaired by home secretary T.K. Mishra.         
	Mishra said the suggestion was being seriously examined and a decision on it would be taken soon.         
	It was also decided that the existing security arrangements in hydel power stations such as Hirakud, Rengali, Machhkund, Balimela, Upper Kolab and Indravati would be further strengthened. States thermal power plants run by Orissa Power Generation Corporation at Ib would also get more security.         
	More personnel will be posted in these installations, said the home secretary, who reviewed the arrangements.         
	The decision to beef up security in these areas was apparently taken in view of general threat. We have not received any specific security alerts, he said.         
	Mishra added that he had advised secretaries of energy, water resources and industry departments to build their own security system, especially for the sensitive projects.         
	Presently, the states police department and each project management have joint security system.         
	Central Industrial Security Force looks after thermal power stations run by National Thermal Power Corporation at Talcher and the captive power plants of National Alumina Company.         
	The power plant management and the administration, it seems, have arrived at a consensus regarding the need for better equipment such as close circuit television cameras, high frequency wireless sets and night vision binoculars to strengthen surveillance.         
	Milestones for security were also set today, the home secretary told the reporters after the meeting.

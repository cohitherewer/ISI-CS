The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Officers name on rural job roster
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Officers name on rural job roster

	Ranchi, Nov. 7: Muster rolls meant to include beneficiaries of the UPA governments showpiece job scheme for Jharkhands rural poor have revealed names of a serving army officer and a college teacher.        
	The disclosures comes amid widespread criticism of the states dismal record in implementing the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	The Jharkhand State National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) Watch, which is conducting a three-day convention here to evaluate the schemes implementation in the state, has also detected fake bank accounts used to defraud the states poorest of the poor.        
	The NREGA Watch has been formed by NGOs and social organisations to keep tabs on the implementation of the national job scheme in Jharkhand.        
	While the muster roll in Dhanbad district includes the name of a serving army officer, a college teacher is included in Palamau district, said Balram, an activist involved in the review.         
	Muster rolls of various districts have names of villagers who no longer live there, but show them as having worked and received wages, he told a meeting attended by economist Jean Dreze and others.        
	We have come across several malpractices in the implementation of the NREGA in the state. Contractors and the government employees have turned the job scheme into a farce, Dreze said.        
	The government, Dreze said, may have allowed the opening of savings accounts in banks or post offices to minimise corruption, but these too have been milked dry by employees.        
	In these savings accounts, wages are deposited and withdrawn without the knowledge of the account holder. Such instances have been found in several districts, Balram said.        
	He claimed that employees of post offices often made villagers sign on papers to open savings accounts in their names without informing them of the purpose. One post master in Ranchi used to open savings accounts in villagers names. He is absconding now, Balram added.
